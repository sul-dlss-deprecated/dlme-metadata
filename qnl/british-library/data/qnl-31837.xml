Dear Wilkins, You may remember that in 1904 you and Abrahams arranged the procedure to be adopted in adjusting the payments by this Office to the Foreign Office in respect of Diplomatic and Consular ejpenditure in connection with Persia and various minor consulates. The procedure is set forth in Treasury letter to the Foreign Office of 16th January 1904 No.190&amp;9/03 (Annex to Enclosure 2 of Political Despatch No.73, dated 29th July 1904, of which a copy is attached). and in subsequent letters, and is as follows:- In any given year (say A) India is to pay to the Foreign Office £4087.10.0 in respect of that year £6000 less a permanent reduction of £1912.10.0, for which see India Office letter of 2/th July 1904 Enclosure 8 no the above mentioned Despatch) vlus or minus an adjustment in respect of the financial year but one before the given year (say B) - the plus portion consisting of half of any net increase in the Foreign Office expenditureTV' expenditure in year B as compared with September, 1900, and the minus portion consiscing of half any net increases in Indian expenditure in year B as compared with that at September 1900 m The transactions therefore fall into two parts:- viz. (1) a payment in respect of the given year (A) and (2) an adjustment in respect of the earlier year (B). At the time when this arrangement was made the adjustment in respect of year B, though consisting of a refund to this Office, was smaller than the payment to the Foreign Office in respect of year A* For some years however the situation has been completely changed - the amount of the refund being far in excess of the payment in respect of year A. For example in 1907 m 0S we paid the Foreign Office &lt;£4087.10.0 in respect of that year, (receiving at the same time a refundjfram them in respect of the year 1905-6); ihilst in 1909-10 we received a refund of &lt;£16,818.8.8 in respect of the year 1907-08 (paying at the s'ame time &lt;&amp;iOc r /.lO.O in respect of 1909*10)m ItIt seuns to us that che procedure of m/iking a fixed payment of *‘1087.10.0 to the Foreign Office in respect of a given year, though originally quite appropriate, is no longer so, now that a very much larger payment is really due from the Foreign Office to us. These views were set forth in letters to the Foreign Office dated 19th March and 8th September last, of which I attach copies, but have met with an unfavourable reception from them and you (see your letter to the Foreign Office dated 2nd November 1920, Ih.17037/10 (39976) ). I think there must be some nisconcaption as to uhat it is uc arc asking ana uhy, and, as you were concerned in the drafting of the original arrangement, I am writing to you unofficially in the hope that you may take the view that our request is a reasonable one, and that, if we renew it, it may he agreed to. It is apparently thought that we are asking for a modification of the agreement of 1900, but this is not so. We do not wish to escape the liability of the &lt;£40tV.10.0 a 04 ^ 4087 m lO.O $ but use think that it uoula be convenient and appropriate that the payment from the India Off ice to the Foreign Office in respect of any given year (Part (l) of your arrangement) should be made at the same time as the payment by the Foreign Office to the India Office in respect of that year (Part (2) of your arrangement) t i*e. in the next year but one after the completion of the given year* Don*t you think our proposal reasonable? As matters stand our expenses in Persia are at present between &lt;£30,000 and £40,000 a year greater than those of the Foreign Office and, though this discrepancy is about to be largely reduced oimg to reductions and transfers , yet our expenditure in future is certain still to exceed that of the Foreign Office, but the refund by the Foreign Office to us m respect of that excess expenditure will continue to be made if matters go on as they are between one and two years afterwards; and it seems unreasonable that we should *be required to make our payment of £4087.10*0 at an earlier date than the Foreign Office refund to us is made.L The immediate effect of compliance with our request muld he that our payments of&lt;£4Qd7*10*0 in respect of the years 1V10-U and 1911-12, ifoich would under present arrangements be made in those years, would he postponed in each case for two years, with the result that the Foreign Office reftmds to us tn-resp&amp;ct Hdfu y&amp;lM - ami -1909-10 would he correspondingly increased, but the net final result of the transactioni would of course he unaffected. I hope I have made my point clear? Yours sincerely.b FOREIGN OFFICE, November , 1910 ^|59976/lO) Sir:- I am directed by Secretary Sir E.

Jo / Sir:- 4r I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury Mr. Mallet’s letter of the 15th September (32790/10) with its enclosure further respecting the proposal of the Secretary of State for India that the annual payment of £4,087.10. 0. by India to the Imperial Exchequer in advance oi the adjustment based on the actual expenditure of the two Covernments should be abandoned. In reply I am to state that My Lords regret that They are unable to assent to this proposal. They agree with the views expressed in the letter from your Department to the India Office of the 3rd May last (10693/10) and think that the reasons therein given sufficiently justify a refusal to acquiesce in a partial revision of existing arrangements. I am &amp;c., (Signed) GLH. Murray. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.J.4 P.3337. INDIA OFFICE. Whitehall, S.W. 8th September 1910. Sir, 1 With reference to the concluding paragraph of Sir Richmond Ritchie's letter of 19th March last, and paragraphs 2-5 of your reply of 3rd May, ifo.10393, I am directed to state that the payment made each year to this Office by your Department in respect of diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia has always been regarded by this Department (as will be seen on reference to the annual claims) as being the net result of tjo transactions, viz. (1) An adjustment in respect of the expenditure by the two Governments in the previous year but one,' and (2) A standing advance of £408?.10.0 by this Office to the Foreign Office m respect of the current year. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.It has of course been recognized by this Department that the sum of £4087.10.0 just mentioned is made up of various ite/ris, of jlhich only £487.10.0 is in respect of Persia. But in vieu) of the fact that the annual expenditure by India in Persia is nou) very greatly in excess of the Imperial expenditure the amount of the excess in 1907-8 (the last year in respect of jjhich an adjustment has been made) having been £35.414 - and that no payment in respect of this additional outlay is made to this Office until between 1 and 2 years after date, it seemed to the Secretary of State for India in Council inappropriate that in addition this Department shoula continue to make a payment in advance; ana although only a part of the advance 0/684087.10.0 is in respect of Persia it seemed not unreasonable, as the various items have hitherto been lumped together, that the ahole of the advance should be discontinued. It Jioula m fact m Lord Morley's opinion have been reasonable toto go further and to suggest that a standing advance shoula be made by the Foreign Office to the India Office, but His Lordship did not j)ish to press this suggestion. It is argued in your letter under reply that the present excess of expenditure by India may not continue, but, jjhile this is not denied, it seems likely that the Government of India's expendi ture in Persia u)ill continue to be m excess of that incurred by the Foreign Office for at least some years to come; and in the meantime it seems to be unreasonable to continue a system of aavances jhich have noj for some years ceased to be appropriate. Lord Morley ventures to hope therefore taut on reconsideration Sir E.Grey uiill agree with nun. tnat the proposal made by this Office was reasonable and moderate and that it shoula be carried into effect. I have the honour to be, j ,;c., (Sd.) C. G. CA1-JPBELL.^ copy' extract from letter OFFICE TO THE INDIA No.10693/10 FROM THE FOREIGN OFFICE DATED 3rd MAY 1910. fCeLLJ. I*j /^tv £4087.10.0. £487.10.0. ¥i th ref erence to the concluding paragraph of * your letter, I am to observe that it jjould seem most convenient to regard the payment made in any year as the contribution in respect of that year, although the amount is based on the actual expenditure of the last year but one. If, hojever, it is regarded merely as a settlement of accounts of previous years, I am to point out that the sum of Four thousand and eighty-seven pounds, ten shillings is not a contribution by India solely on account of Persia, only Four hundred and eighty-seven pounds, ten shillings being in fact the amount paid for that service, as jjill be seen from the letter from this cQv•|br this Office to the Treasury of August 11th 1900 d)hich j)as communicated to you by the Treasury on September 11th, 1900. Moreover it is not certain that the present excess of expenditure by India jill continue; Turbat-i-Haidari has been reduced, the exchange of Kermanshah and Mohanunerah involves less expenditure •K. than before from Indian revenues, and the total Indian expenditure in 1907-8 Mas largely swollen by arrear charges. There is, again, the prospect of economies in the establishments administered by India as stated in your letter under reply, Jhile the proposal in the letter from this Office, No.1153 of February 20th 1909, that certain posts Mhich are at present held by Indian officials should in future be filled from the Levant Consular Service, jould further relieve India of providing in the first instance for those establishments. As Lord Morley is auiare, the accounts from India have not hitherto been received till long after* -o after the expiration of the year to jjhich they relate, and if these are in future rendered at an earlier date a more speedy settlement jjill become possible. Unaer these circumstances it jould appear best that any modifi cation of the existing methods of adjusting accounts should be deferred till a general revision of the 1900 arrangement, when it will be necessary to take into account also the aaditional expenditure incurred by this Department m China since that date* i •/*OPY LAST PARAGRAPH OF LETTER TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE DATED 19th MARCH 1910. In vieu&gt; of the large and increasing adjustments in favour of this Office jjhich are noj necessary in connection u&gt;ith the annual statements of diplomatic and consular expenditure m Persia, the continuance of an annual payment of &lt;£4087.10.0 from Indian to Imperial Revenues in advance of the adjustment (2 years later) based on the actual expenditure of the tuio Governments does not appear to be any longer appropriate, and I am to suggest for Sir E.Grey s consideration that it should be abandoned.Thisjocument is the prope rty of the Secretar y of State for India in Council. India Office, 14th July 1911. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to invite the attention of Sir E. Grey to paragraph 2 of your letter of 10th December .1906, No. 36,866, and to paragraph 1 of Sir A. Godlev’s reply of 19th March 1907. ‘ It was proposed in your letter, in accordance with a letter from the Treasury of 31st October 1906, and in pursuance of the recommen dations of the Welby Commission, to include non-effective charges in the scope of the annual adjustments made in respect of Persia. While agieeing that this proposal would be in accordance with the spirit of the existing arrangements between the two Governments, the letter from this Office stated that “ as the Indian officers detailed for duty in ^ lersia spend only a portion of their time in that country, it is “ lm P ossib l e t0 state accurately the amount of the non-effective charges “ borne by India in respect of service in Persia, and it would require very great labour to provide even an approximate estimate.” More over, it seemed probable that “ the charges borne by India on this i( account are increasing by at least as great an amount as those borne by the Foreign Office; and the exclusion of such charges, both from ‘ the Imperial and the Indian claims, would apparently not involve any ‘‘loss to Imperial revenues.” Accordingly the Secretary of State in Council expressed the hope that the proposal might be withdrawn, and this was done. A communication has now been received from the Government of India ( c °Py enclosed) suggesting a method by which an approximate estimate of leave and pensionary charges could be arrived at without difficulty. The method is that in use when additions are made to a Government establishment in India to provide for work for an outside authority which has to be done under the supervision of the controlling officers of the establishment-the cost of the addition being charged to the authority in whose interest the work is done. Examples are Political Agents appointed at the cost of various Native States, and Government of India Opium Agents in Native States and their establish ments. The practice is to charge the authority concerned, in addition to the pay of the officer, with a contribution payable during the period of loan and calculated to cover the liability for leave allowances and pension estimated to be incurred during that period. The contribution is assessed at a fixed proportion of the pay drawn, ranging from one-fourth in the case of the higher officers to one-fifth and one-sixth in the case of subordinate officers. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.It was not brought to the notice of the Secretary of State in Council in 1907 that so simple a method as the above was employed by the Government of India. The method followed when officers of the Government of India are lent to Colonial Governments of charging a leave and pension contribution based on “assumed pay (arrived at by a difficult process of calculation) would have involved very great labour, if applied to officers employed in Persia, and it was for this reason that that method was not then suggested. The method now proposed, being based on pay actually drawn, would present no difficulty. Lord Crewe proposes, therefore, subject to the concurrence of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to authorise the Government of India to include in their annual statements a charge for leave and pension calculated in the manner indicated. With reference to the suggestion made in the enclosed letter from India to include stationery and printing charges, Lord Crewe understands that it would be difficult for the Foreign Office to state the amount of their expenditure under these heads, and he does not therefore desire to press the suggestion. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, (Signed) R. Ritchie.It has re cantly been brought to the notice of the Government of India that the charges defrayed by them on account of (i) stationery ana printing ana (ii) pensionary ana leave allowances in connection with the consular and aiploniatic services in Persia have hitherto been omitted from the annual statement of divisi ble expenditure on such services * The omission seems to have been due to an oversight, but it would appear to be in accordance with the recommendations of the Wei by Commissi on that the i charges should be included. The Government of India propose therefore to include them in the statement with effect from the beginning of the current financial year. 2. There would be considerable aijficulty, however, in calculating the actual charges on account of pensions and leave allowances earned in Persia, and the Gove mme nt of India wo ul d, t he ref o re, propose to add a fixed percentage to the actual chargescharges under salaries and establishment, so as to cover the estimated cost of pensions and leave allowances. If this were approved, the percentage might be dejinitely jixea on the analogy Oj the rules in Articles 795 ana 768 oj the Civil Service Regulations * 3, Will you kindly let me know whether there is any objection to these proposals.E vuJutriJUAjL.

Chie-third of the divisible charges they stated would amount vo about oSPO.OOO a year, but. they recommended that the decision of the Foreign Office Conference should be maintainedinaintained for a period of 5 or 6 years f the contribution then to be revised. The payment of • oOO a yeai in respect op (Tima was however one of o tnose which the Imperial Government agreed to p orego in lieu of the contribution of £50.000 a year from them towards the expenses of the India Office which was recommended by the Velby Commission. At present therefore India may be regarded as contributing £12.500 towards expenditure in China, y The outlay of the Foreign, Office in China in So-o 1910-11 is estimated at £&amp;6.500 approximately.

Grey to state that . 0.6 the sum of Thirteen thousand, nine hundred and twentv- tv/o pounds and six pence, representing the Imperial contribution in respect of expenditure in Persia &amp;c has been transferred to Indian revenues, the Treasury having sanctioned the payment in a letter dated March- 26 th lulO copy of which is enclosed* ' - v T —r~ ^ 2 With reference to the concluding paragraph of your letter I am to observe that it would seem most convenient to regard the payment made in any year as tne contribution in respect of that year, although the amount is based on the actual expenditure of the last year but one. If, however, it is regarded merely as j| a settlement of accounts of previous years, I arn to ,0cm .10.0. point out that the sum of Four thousand and eighty- seven pounds, ten shillings is not a contribution by India The Under Secretary of Statei India Office. I 4 M;y(10693/10) Inula solely on account of Persia, only Four -hundred and eighty-seven pounds, ten shillings being in fact trie amount paid for that service, as will be seen from the letter from this Office to the Treasury of August ( 11th 1900 which was communicated to you by the Trea sury on September 11 th, 1900. 3 - Moreover it is not certain that the present ex cess of expenditure by India will continue; Turbat- i-Haidari has been reduced, the exchange of Kermanshah and Mohammerah involves less expenditure than before from Indian revenues, and the total Indian expenditure in ISO ?-8 was largely swollen by arrear charges. There is, again, the prospect of economies in the es- tablishments administered by India as stated in your letter under reply, while the proposal in the letter from this Office, No.1153 of February 20 th 1909, that certain posts which are at present held by Indian of ficials should in future be filled from the Levant Consular Service, would further relieve Incia of pro viding in the first instance for those establishments.09 m T (10693/10) / • As Lore.

Grey that % Lords are willing that the excess over the provision made for this service in the Vote for Diplomatic and Consular Services for the current year should be met out of savings on the Vote generally. As regards the details of the amount (which My Lords note is calculated at £13,922. 0. 6.) payable to India, My Lords must leave it to the Secretary of State as in previous years to satisfy himself that they include The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.include no items uncovered by previous sanctions of CiUb Board ana uhat they form in all other respects a \ proper charge to the year 1907-8 in respect of which the present contribution is to be made; and They sanc tion the proposed transfer on this understanding. herds have read with satisfaction the statement j.n Six R.

With reference to this Office Letter of 19th Mcrch 1910, and your reply of 3rd May 1910, No.10693/10, I am directed to forward herewith for the information of Secretary Sir E.Grey statements comparing the expenditure of the Governmentof Inaia on Diplomatic Consular Servicesin Persia in 1908-9 with that in 1907-8.

Detailed statements of the variations of exp enditureexpenditure which have resulted in this net increase will he found in Enclosure 2% Calculations are attached showing that, after taking account of the increase of &lt;£2,906-13-7 in the expenditure by the Foreign Cffice in 1908-9 mentioned in your letter of 3rd May last, the amount payable to this Office in the present financial year in respect of diplomatic ana consular expenditure in Persia in 1908-9 is £11,792-19-3 exclusive of any amount to be regarded as due from your Department^ with effect from 1904-5. in respect of the Military Attacheship at Meshed (viae paragraph 5 of this i Office letter of 2nd September 1910 ana connected correspondence * With reference to this Office letter ^ K(S&gt; » * letter oj 26th February 1907, regarding expenditure at Koweit and the footnote to the letter of 19i'i March last, I am to jorward for Sir E* Grey's information a detailed statement of expenditure on that Agency from its establishment in 1904-5 to 1908-9 inclusive (enclosure 4). It will be seen that the rent of the foreshore in 1908-9 and the cost oj the launch in that year amounted together to 6^7787-18-10 and that, apart from these i terns ana the rent of the foreshore in 1907-8 (the cost of which has been already shared by the Foreign Office), the expenditure on the Agent ana his establishment has amounted to &lt;£13,001.5.0.o6\ s.d. 1908-9 (Letter from Foreign Office of 3rd May 1910). -798-0-10.

'' R^red M day of 19/o . x Tiff fl/3 The statement of expenditure on the Political Agency at Koweit which the Government of India now give for 1904-05 to 1908-09 inclusive may he regarded as fairly satisfactory. In respect of 1908-09 (if the rent of the foreshore and the cost of the launch are deducted) the expenditure amounts to c£3.078, which y though it is dll, 109 in excess of the allotment made by the Croveminent of India for the Agency in 1905 as stated in their letter of 19th January 1905 and reported to'-fkll Foreign Office, is only c£221 in excess of the C outlay which the Crovemment of India stated in their Letter of November 1906 No.171 was finally sanctioned by them for the Agency and which was also reported to the Foreign Office. The increases, both over the allotment made in 1905 and the outlay actually sanctioned in 1906, appear to be defensible:- the increase of £1,109 over the allotment beina due to (l) increase of * XJ the Agent's pay as part of a general scheme for the Political Department and also pay of navigators and of camel sowars (amounting together to Rs*7.793 - £520) and (2) an increase under With regard to these camel charges we said in Letter to Foreign Office 26th February 1907 -'The Secretary of State is not aware of the precise reasons which have actuated the Crovernment of India in sanctioning a camel establishment, but considering the situation at Koweit, and the Desirability on general grounds of the Agent making himself acquainted with the locality, the expenditure does not appear 5609.

It is satisfactory to observe that expenditure has not risen appreciably during the last 3 years, when the special item of foreshore rent (Rs.60.000) and also (for 1908-09) the cost of the launch (Rs.56.819) have been deducted; with regard to the latter the price agreed upon was Rs.50.000 - it is possible Rs.6.819 represents the cost of upkeep etc. for 1903-9 The total sum ifitwhich we shall have to ask the foreign Office in respect of the Koweit Agency (after deducting items already agreed upon, viz: foreshore rent and cost of Launch) for 1904- 05 to 1903-09 inclusive .will be the half of Rs. 195-018 -12-2 i.e. &lt;£6,500-12-6. //. f , '4 J ktL u /L. urUi 'LL pJin^JC £ fc ft* '■ P. 5~ *0■ PERSIAN LEGATION — contd.

That amount should apparently, as stated by Mr. Kirk, be a moiety of the total royalty without deduction of any sums withheld from the Persian Government to cover the cost of wilful damage. 2. I request that a report on the subject may be included in your reply to my Despatch of the 30th July last. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.i u rn** ENCLOSURE. Note by Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, 5th August 1909. From some correspondence which has recently taken place between myself and the Examiner of telegraph Accounts at Calcutta, it appears that the Jask Royalty payable to the Persian Government is shared in moieties between the Indian and the Home Governments, but it is not clear whether the amount refunded by the Home Government represents one half of the total Royalty of 3,000 tomans, or only one half of the sum actually paid to Persia after deduction of claims on account of wilful damage. For instance, a sum of Rs. 414 only is shown in Statement No. 41 of the Finance and Revenue Accounts for the year 1906-07, but this amount appears to have been made up of a payment of Rs. 7,954. 10. 4 on account of Royalty less Rs. 7,541. 0. 2 deducted on account of wilful damage, and it is not clear whether half of Rs. 7,954. 10. 4 or of Rs. 414 was refunded by the Home Government for that year. This is still further complicated by the fact that in the following year (1907-08) a sum of Rs 17,647 is shown, which repre sented the total Royalty for two years. I am informed by the Director of the Persian Section that the Royalty for 1906-07 was withheld by His Britannic Majesty’s Legation till February 1908. It appears to me that half of the total Royalty should be recovered from the Home Government, because that is the actual amount due to Persia, and any deductions on account of wilful damage are only made owing to the difficulty of obtaining payment from Persia in any other manner. The case seems to me to be one that the Financial Department might inquire into, so that it may be settled whether or not the amount recovered from the Home Government is half of the total amount of the Royalty, as it appears to me should be the case. H. A. Kirk. 6593.Political, No. 73. India Office, London, 30th July 1909. To His Excellency the Right Honourable the Governor General of India in Council. Consular 1907-08. My Lord, With reference to your letter of the 4th March 1909, No. 33, . submitting a comparative statement ? Ttr.' Dipwio - Consular Services m Persia in 1906-07 and 1907-08, I forward herewith a copy of a Memorandum prepared in this Office, and request that I may be supplied at an early date with the information desired therein. The most convenient course would be that a revised statement of expenditure should be furnished embodying the additional information required. 2. The increase in expenditure in 1907-08 is very considerable, amounting, even after deduction of the special payment of Rs. 60,000 in respect of Koweit under the Agreement with the Sheikh of the 15th October 1907, to 8,135L, and I request that, in addition to the information asked for in the Memorandum, I may be furnished with a brief statement in general terms of the chief causes of this increase. I observe that certain of the payments in 1907-08 are stated to include considerable sums in respect of 1906-07, but I presume that there were also considerable arrear payments in 1906-07. Some explanation is required of the continuous growth of the charges shown under the head of “ contingencies.” 3. A statement'^' of the outlay at Imperial posts in Persia during 1906-07 and 1907-08 is inclosed * Inclosure in Foreign Office letter of p p • T 1st April 1909 (3194/09) ±or purposes ol comparison. It will be observed that the total outlay in 1907-08 was somewhat less than in the previous year. 4. With reference to the special item of expenditure at Koweit, I have to remark that such expenditure cannot property be included in a statement of charges incurred in Persia. But it will be convenient to effect in connection with the annual settlement of the Persian charges an adjustment of the expenditure incurred at places in the Gulf and its 6314. I. 1416. a-S vicinity outside Persia which the British Treasury have agreed to share ; and I request that a statement of any charges of this kind up to the 31st March 1908 which have not yet been adjusted may be appended as ^supplement to the statement of expenditure in Persia. I also request that this procedure may be followed in future. 5. It is extremely desirable, as I have said, that the information should be given to me at an early date. I have the honour to be, My Lord, Your Lordship’s most obedient humble Servant, (Signed) Morley of Blackburn.ENCLOSURES. Enclosure No. 1. MEMORANDUM. JrERSIAN ijEGATION Contingencies.—-The explanation given of the expenditure under the tiearl Contingencies” should apparently read as followsOf this « iSiT aVv'* 5 on account o£ Jas k Royalty for 1905-06 and „ 1 906-07, being Rs. 17,647. 1. less Rs. 4,292. 1. (Krs. 14,593) repre- sentmg deductions, &amp;c.” F p Bs ^ r c«, The explanation given of the increase of Ks. 0-,u42. 1. 2. in the Escort Charges is not quite clear. The Government of India should be asked to state :— (а) The amount refunded to the Imperial Government in 1907-08. It is not clear from the statement whether this was 11s. 26,280. 1. 4. or Rs. 13,140. 0. 8. (б) How much, approximately, of _ the remaining expenditure in 190/-08 was for the first time charged in full to Indian re\ enues (m other words, what amount would under the system previously followed have been shared by the Imperial autho rities in the first instance or through the Account Current, and so excluded from the statement) ? Special payment —The special payment of Rs. 60,000 by the Accoun tant-General, Bombay, being on account of Koweit, should be excluded from the statement of expenditure in Persia, and arrangements for recovery of the portion chargeable to Imperial revenues should be made separately in accordance with the instructions in the last paragraph of the covering Despatch. Seistan. Salaries .—The extent to which arrear payments enter into the figures of expenditure in 1907-08 makes it difficult to understand the exact position of affairs in the two years. If the expenditure in 1906-07 similarly includes arrear payments, the amount of these should be stated. In the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Government of India regarding appointments in Seistan, the term “ ^ ice-consul ” has apparently been used only of the minor appointment at Koh-i-Malik Siah, held originally by Mahomed Ashraf Khan. The references to Lieutenant Daukes and Captain Kelly in connection with this appointment are not understood and should be explained. Contingencies .—No explanation is given of the increase under this head. Civil Buildings .—No information has apparently been furnished to the Secretary of State regarding the buildings in question. General .—The rate of expenditure at this Consulate appears to be very high. Excluding medical expenditure in connection with the plague (which shows a decrease in consequence of the cessation of the plague), there is an increase in the charges in 1907-08 of Rs. 29,343 (1,965Z.) 6314.

Permanent Establishment.—The increase under this head seems to have been very heavy. Contingencies .—No explanation is given of the increase under this head. Turbat-i-Haidari.

Contingencies .— r i he increase under this head js not explained. Generoil .—The rate of expenditure at this Consulate seems high, and the increase in 1907-08 considerable. Kerman. General. —The increase of expenditure at this Consulate is very large, the explanation given being that it is due to the inclusion of expenditure for several months of 1906-07 in the accounts of 1907-08. Before the accounts are forwarded to the Foreign Office information should be obtained as to the amount of increase under each head which is due to this cause. The Government of India should also state whether the expenditure in 1905-06 does not also include arrear payments, and, if so, to what extent. Bam. With reference to Enclosure No. 5 in the letter to the Foreign Office, of 17th March last, a copy of which was forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department on the 4th June 1909, the Government of India should be asked to state whether the expenditure at Bam in 1906-07, which was shown in the statement accompanying their letter of 20th September 1908, No. 165, included the whole of the outlay in connection with that post. If not, particulars of the outlay omitted should be furnished. The date on which the expenditure in connection with Bam ceased, and the approximate amount included on account of Bam in the accounts of expenditure at Kerman in 1907-08, should also be stated. Kermanshah. Supplies and Service and Contigencies .—Some explanation of the increase under this head is desirable. Arabistan. An explanation should be furnished of the increased expenditure on Allowances, and of the increase of Rs. 4,610, under Supplies and Services and Contingencies, independent of the amounts attributable to the Mohammerah launch and the Oil Syndicate Camp charges.,&gt; DRAFT LETTER, Under' Secretary of State, India Office, icti March 1910 icji Foreign Office* In continuation of correspondence ending with your letter of 1st April last No*11703 I am directed to forward herewith for the information of Secretary Sir E* Grey statements comparing the expenditure of the Government of India on diplomatic and consular services in Persia in 1907-8 with that in 1906-7* It will be seen that the amount shewn as spent in 1907-8 exceeded the corresponding outlay in 1906-7 by 617,825.13*11* From the details given in enclosure 2 it will be seen that the exceptional expenditure of a temporary nature in 1906-7 referred to in Sir A* Godley's letter of 17th March 1909 was Foreign Office* considerablyconsiderably reduced in 1907-8:- 1906-7 1907-8 Launch for use of His ) ' ) Majesty's Consul at ) 2407 Moh amine rah J o£. 7&lt;?r For the construction of ) new consular buildings)3199 2471 at Funder Abbas. ) Hxpenditure due to the ) ) outbreak of plague in) 2209 956.

The balance is mainly due to the payment of the Consular Establishment having been sanctioned in krans.

(a) The decrease is accounted for as follows : — (1) Major Cox reverted to Officiating Residentship, 2nd class, from 23rd November 1906 at JKs. 2,483-5-4. He was formerly druwing Rs. 3,000. (2) : The pay of Assistant Surgeon R. G. Ives for nine months at Rs. 290 per mensem, amounting to Rs. 2,610 was taken under salaries in 1906-1907, but from January 1907 it has been taken under establishment; hence the expenditure would be less by Rs. 2,610 under salaries and more under establishment. (3) Lieutenant Williams and Captain Condon were both in Bushire as Residency Surgeons during July and August 1906,. Captain Condon’s pay for two months, ws., Rs. 1,200, is therefore an excess over the expenditure of 1907-1908. (6) Rupees 2,610, pay of Assistant Surgeon, now tnken, under establishment in 1907-1908. In 1906-1907 it was taken under salaries. Rupees 2,250, pay of Mr. Gandhy, Superintendent, Resident’s office, not drawn in 1906-1907, as he officiated as Extra Assistant Resident for one year from 16th April 1906.. ^ Rupees 730, pay of engine driver and boatmen for Mohammerah Agency launch, charged under Bushires at Rs. 275 per mensem. This is a new charge in 1907-1908. i Rupees 314, Roorkee allowance, drawn for a member of the escort from March 1907. Rupees 366, aotine allowance in the chain of Mr. Gandhy, who was granted privilege leave for three months from 8th July 1907 (Rs. 122 per mensem for three months). Rupees 140, actin? allowance in the chain of leave (privilege and furlough) granted to Muhammad Khan from 1 Oth December T906 to 9th June 1907. The ra-e of acting allowance for trie furlough period from 9th March 1906 to 9th June 1907 being in excess of half savings together with the pay of the temporary clerk appointed in his chain. (c) The expenditure under the head “ Supplies and Services ” for 1906-1907 has been shewn as Rs. 86,855. This amount included a sum of Rs 36,113 on account of cost of a steam launch for the Mohammerah Agency. The net charge is therefore Rs. 50,742. The expenditure of 1907-1908 is Rs. 69,530, and hence the excess is Ks. 18,788. The charge un ier the head telegrams for 1906-1907 is Rs. 27,571 and that for 1907-1908 is Rs. 46,411, excess « Rs. 18,840. ^ ^ P'Q. 2&gt;t Otis ^ ' ^£?

A, Robert son t Esq., Comptroller t India Treasuries, dated the 27th November 1909, A misunderstanding has arisen from mistakes in the marginal explanatory * Endoaed in despatch to His Majesty’s Secretary note Oil the Original‘statement of the of state for India, No. 33 (General), dated the 4th expenditure of the Persian Legation m March 1909 . 1907-08. The rupee equivalent of 6,000 tomans, the full subsidy for two years paid in 1907-08, is Rs. 17,617-1-0 and not Us. 17,467-1-0 as stated through a clerical error. Next, the reference to the deductions from the subsidy of 14,593 krans (Rs. 4,292-1-0) was so worded as to give the erroneous impression that the recorded divisible expenditure was the net payment and not the gross amount of the royalty. Pinally, the sum actually charged to the head “ Jask Royalty ” in the accounts of 1907-08 was Rs. 20,422-4-5 and the excess of Rs. 2,775-3-5 (9,852 krans), which was due to an erroneous adjustment made by transfer-entry in the March Supplementary account, has been written back to the debit of the Telegraph Department in 1908-09. * * * * There was also an error in the accounts of 1906-07, which caused the charge of Rs. 414 on account of the Jask Royalty in that year, referred to in the note, dated 5th August 1909, of the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Tele graph Department. The sum of 2,341 krans (Rs. 577-5-1) drawn in advance by the Telegraph Department as compensation was erroneously retained on my books as a charge under “ 25—Politicalinstead of being transferred to the Telegraph Department, and a credit of Rs. 163-10-11 on account of gain by exchange on the balance of the Royalty drawn and refunded was wrongly adjusted under the same major head instead of under the head “ 32— Miscellaneous The difference between these two sums is the net debit of Rs. 413-10-2. The result has been that the divisible expenditure of the year 1906-07 was exaggerated by Rs. 677-5-1. * t t Foreign Office Press—Ho. 225—284*10—49.Enclosure 3.

Indian Medical Service, was in charge of the duties of Vice- Consul from 13th April to 13th September 1907- Captain C. T. Daukes on return from privilege leave took over charge from 13th November 1907. (31 British Vice-Consnl or Consular Agent, Koh-i-Malik Siah, under the orders of the iConsul, Seistan, The appointment was held by Muhammad AshrafE Khan throughout the year 1907-1908. (6) The excess of Rs. 4,040-3-8 is made up of the following amounts 1. Vice-Consul, Birjand. Rupees 1,040 represents the special allowance of Rs. 100 per month sanctioned for Mr. Howson, Telegraph Signaller, Birjand, for doing dual duties for the period from June 1906 to April 1907 and drawn in June 1907. 2 Translator, Rupees 861-1-10. The figures in 1907-1908 are less than those of 1906-1907, as in 1906- 1907 a charge of Rs. 902-1-10 was incurred in connection with the arrangements consequent on the grant of leave to Muhammad Hussan, the permanent Head Clerk of the Consulate. The full pay of the appointment of the Head Clerk was granted to the officiating incumbent, Mirza Ijaj Hussain, who was an outsider. 3. Mochi. Rupees 225. The Mochi was entertained from the 1st October 1906 at Rs. 26 per mensem, Rs. 126, therefore, only appeared in the accounts for 1906-1907. In 1907-1908 Rs. 36 per mensem was charged in accordance with the sanction of the Government of India. 4 Hospital Assistant. Rupees-l,446-13-8. In 1906-1907 Rs. 720 was charged to the Consulate on account of furlough allowance of Hospital Assistant Ghulam Jilam from the 16th November 1905 to 14th November 1906 at Rs. 60 per mensem in addition to the pay of the two regular Hospital Assistants and the balance is made uplof the pay of the fonr sowars attached to the Hospital Assistant at Birjand and Bandan, which used to be charged to this head in 1906-1907 but in 1907-1908 were adjusted under Levy Sowars. 6. Carpenters. Rupees 58-3-4 represents transit pay of carpenters newly appointed while proceeding to Seistan from 28th November 1907 to 6th January 1908 at Rs. 45 per mensem charged to this head in addition to pay of the'.carpenter who already held the post. 6. Escort. Rupees 6,861-7-9 made up of (i) Rs. 4,151-7-8, representing pay of two Naiks and eight sowars from 4th February 1907 to 29th February 1908 (drawn in 1907-1908), which were sanctioned as an addition to the 8eistan Escort, (ii) Rs. 1,680 transit pay from Ist September 1907 to 10th November 1907 of relieving escort party charged to Seistan estimates in addition to pay of escort already attached to Consulate, (iii) Rs. 376-12-10 due to promotion of the Jemadar of the Escort to the rank of Risaldar from 16th July 1907 and to the substitution of a Risaldar in the place o? Jemadar when the escort was relieved, and (iv) Rs.. 224 pay of transport muleteers from November 1907 at Rs. 66 per mensem erroneously adjusted under this head. 7. D&amp;k sowars. Rupees—1,787-8-4, This decrease is due to the withdrawal with effect from 21st September 1907 of the extra service costing Rs. 340 per mensem between Robat and Nasratabad. %. Levy sowars. Rupees 830. This balances a portion of the decrease against Hospital Assistant above and represents pay of four sowars attached to Hospital Assistant at Birjand and Bandan for March 1907 and two sowars attached to Hospital Assistant, Birjand, only from April 1907 to February 1908. 9. Telegraph Establishment. Rupees—1,620-7-11. The decrease is mainly due to the fact that in April 1906 Mr. Forkgen, one of the Telegraph signallers, drew pay and allowances for the period from 14th October 1905 and thus abnormally increased the charges for 1906-1907. 10. Compounder and Dresser. Rupees 167-15-8 represents extra expense incurred owing to the grant of privilege leave to permanent compounder from 4th April 1907 to 28rd August 1907 at Rs. 20 per mensem and increments of the compounder and dresser. 11. Shop-keeper, Bhisti, and Sweeper. Rupees 144-11-6, During the first four months of 1906-1907 only Ks. 66 per mensem was drawn and thereafter Rs. 96 per mensem. The difference of Rs. 30 is the pay of the three appointments of shop-keeper, bhisti, and sweeper at Koh-i-Malik Siah, and thia mainly accounts for the increase under this head. 12. Headquarter Levies. Rupees 187-14-6 due to Jemadar's pay for Febrnary 1907 not being drawn till May 1907 and extra expense in the privilege leave vacancy of that officer. 13. Transport Muleteer. Rupees 448 represents pay at Rs. 56 per mensem of muleteers of the Consulate for March 1907 to October 1907, which in 1906-1907 was adjusted under “ Supplies and services, feed and keep of transport animals.’* Their pay from November 1907 has been erroneously taken under “ Escort.'

(,a) The decrease is accounted for as follows (1) Major Cox reverted to Officiating Residentship, 2nd class, from 23rd November 1906 at Rs. 2,483*5-4. He was formerly drawing Rs. 3,000. (2) The pay of Assistant Surgeon R. Q. Ives for nine months at Rs. 290 per mensem, amounting to Rs. 2,610 was taken under salaries in 1906*1907, hut from January 1907 it has been taken under establishment; hence the expenditure would be less by Rs. 2,610 under salariei and more under establishment. (3) Lieutenant Williams and Captain Condon were both in Bushire as Residency Surgeons during July and August 1906, Captain Condon’s pay for two months, viz., Rs. 1,200, is therefore an excess over the expenditure of 1907-1908. (6) Rupees 2,610, pay of Assistant Surgeon, now taken under establishment in 1907-1908. In 1906-1907 it was taken under salaries.

Rupees 730, pay of engine driver and boatmen for Mohammerah Agency launch, charged under Bushire at Rs. 275 per mensem. This is a new charge in 1907-1908. Rupees 314, Roorkee allowance, drawn for a member of the escort from March 1907. Rupees 366, acting allowance in the chain of Mr. Gandhy, who was granted privilege leave for three months from 8th July 1907 (Rs. 122 per mensem for three months). Rupees 140, acting allowance in the chain of leave (privilege and furlough) granted to Muhammad Khan from 1 Oth December 1906 to 9th June 1907. The rare of acting allowance for the furlough period from 9th March 1906 to 9th June 1907 being in excess of half savings together with the pay of the temporary clerk appointed in his chain. (c) The expenditure under the head “ Supplies and Services ' for 1906*1907 has been shewn as Rs.'86,855. This amount included a sum of Rs 36,113 on account of cost of a steam launch for the Mohammerah Agency. The net charge is therefore Rs. 50,742: The expenditure of 1907-1908 is Rs. 69,530, and hence the excess is Kb. 18,788. The charge under the head telegrams for 1906-1907 is Rs. 27,571 and that for 1907-1908 is Ks- 46,411, Le., the excess is Rs. 18,840.Enclosure No. 2. Extract from a note by J. A.

The rupee equivalent of 6,000 tomans, the full subsidy for two years paid in 1907-08, is Rs. 17,617-1-0 and not Rs. 17,467-1-0 as stated through a clerical error. Next, the reference to the deductions from the subsidy of 14,593 krans (Rs. 4,292-1-0) was so worded as to give the erroneous impression that the recorded divisible expenditure was the net payment and not the gross amount of the royaltv Finally, the sum actually charged to the head “ Jask Royalty ” in the accounts of 1907-08 was Rs. 20,422-4-5 and the excess of Rs. 2,775-3-5 (9,852 krans), which was due to an erroneous adjustment made by transfer-entry in the March Supplementary account, has been written back to the debit of the Telegranh Department in 1908-09. * * * * * There was also an error in the accounts of 1906-07, which caused the charge of Rs. 414 on account of the Jask Royalty in that year, referred to in the note, dated 5th August 1909, of the Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Tele graph Department. The sum of 2,341 krans (Rs. 577-5-1) drawn in advance by the telegraph Department as compensation was erroneously retained on my books as a charge under “ 25—Political ”, instead of being transferred to the Telegraph Department, and a credit of Rs. 163-10-11 on account of gain by exchange on the balance of the Royalty drawn and refunded was wrongly adjusted under the same major head instead of under the head “32 Miscellaneous ”. The difference between these two sums is the net debit of Rs. 413-10-2. The result has been that the divisible expenditure of the year 1906-07 was exaggerated by Rs. 577-5-1. * * t Foreign Office Press—No. 225—28-MO—4d.1910. FORT WILLIAM. FOIxETGrN' DEPARTMENT.

From some correspondence which has recently taken place between myself and the Examiner of lelegraph Accounts at Calcutta, it appears that the Task Royalty payable to the Persian Government is shared in moieties between the Indian and the Home Governments, but it is not clear whether the amount refunded by the Home Government represents one half of the total Royalty of 3,000 tomans, or only one half of the sum actually paid to Persia after deduction of claims on account of wilful damage. For instance, a sum of Rs. 414 only is shown in Statement Xo. 41 of the Finance and Revenue Accounts for the year 1906-07, but this amount appears to have been made up of a payment of Rs. 7,954. 10. 4 on account of Royalty less Rs. 7,541. 0. 2 deducted on account of wilful damage, and it is not clear whether half of Rs. 7,954. 10. 4 or of Rs. 414 was refunded by the Home Government for that year. This is still further complicated by the fact that in the following year (1907-08) a sum of Rs 17,647 is shown, which repre sented the total Royalty for two years. I am informed by the Director of the Persian Section that the Royalty for 1906-07 was withheld by His Britannic Majesty’s Legation till February 1908. It appears to me that half of the total Royalty should be recovered from the Home Government, because that is the actual amount due to Persia, and any deductions on account of wilful damage are only made owing to the difficulty of obtaining payment from Persia in any other manner. The case seems to me to be one that the Financial Department might inquire into, so that it may be settled whether or not the amount recovered from the Home Government is half of the total amount of the Royalty, as it appears to me should be the case.

Consular Services in Persia in 1906-0/ and 1907-08, I forward herewith a copy of a Memorandum prepared in this Office, and request that I may be supplied at an early date with the information desired therein. The most convenient course would be that a revised statement of expenditure should be furnished embodying the additional information required. 2. The increase in expenditure in 1907-08 is very considerable, amounting, even after deduction of the special payment of Rs. 60,000 in respect of Koweit under the Agreement with the Sheikh of the 15th October 1907, to 8,135L, and I request that, in addition to the information asked for in the Memorandum, I may be furnished with a brief statement in general terms of the chief causes of this increase. I observe that certain of the payments in 1907-08 are stated to include considerable sums in respect of 1906-07, but I presume that there were also considerable arrear payments in 1906-07. Some explanation is required of the continuous growth of the charges shown under the head of “ contingencies.” 3. A statement* of the outlay at Imperial posts in Persia during 1906-07 and 1907-08 is inclosed Inclosure in Foreign Office letter of r r- T ; April 1909 (3194/09) ±or Purposes of comparison. It will be observed that the total outlay in 1907-08 was somewhat less than in the previous year. 4. With reference to the special item of expenditure at Koweit, I have to remark that such expenditure cannot properly be included in a statement of charges incurred in Persia. But it will be convenient to effect in connection with the annual settlement of the Persian charges an adjustment of the expenditure incurred at places in the Gulf and itsvicinity outside Persia which the British Treasury have agreed to share ; and I request that a statement of any charges of this kind up to the 31st March 1908 which have not yet been adjusted may be appended as a supplement to the statement of expenditure in Persia. I also request that this procedure may be followed in future. 5. It is extremely desirable, as I have said, that the information should he given to me at an early date.

Special payment —The special payment of Rs. 60,000 by the Accoun tant-General, Bombay, being on account of Koweit, should be excluded from the statement of expenditure in Persia, and arrangements for recovery of the portion chargeable to Imperial revenues should be made separately in accordance with the instructions in the last paragraph of the covering Despatch. Seistan. Salaries .—The extent to which arrear payments enter into the figures of expenditure in 1907-08 makes it difficult to understand the exact position of affairs in the two years. If the expenditure in 1906-07 similarly includes arrear payments, the amount of these should be stated. In the correspondence between the Secretary of State and the Government of India regarding appointments in Seistan, the term ^ ice-consul ” has apparently been used only of the minor appointment at Koh-i-Malik Siah, held originally by Mahomed Ashraf Khan.

TO •; &gt;. 0 The Right Honourable St.JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Sir, Simla, the nth May 1905 . We have the honour to address you on the subject of the deputation to Seistan of two European signallers of the Indian Telegraph Department. 2 . In February 1903 , His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran suggested to us the employment, during the period of Colonel McMahon’s Mission, of an English telegraph clerk in Seistan for the purpose of transmitting cypher and English messages to Meshed and Tehran. It was considered, however, for the sake of relief and other objects, that the employment of two signallers would be preferable, and accordingly Telegraph Master A. G. Moore and signaller C. H. Cooper were selected for the work, and left India for Seistan in May 1903 . 3 After an absence of nearly two years, Messrs. Moore and Cooper asked to be allowed to return to India, and we have deputed to relieve them two men of the same standing, Messrs. McManus and Howson, who arrived in Seistan on the 17 th March. The terms of their employment, which are the same as those of the two men first named, are shown in the letter from the Foreign Department to the Consul in Seistan, No. 1150 -F., dated the 31 st March 1905 , of which a copy is enclosed. As the deputation of Messrs. Moore and. Cooper exceeded one year, and as in view of the recent appearance of Russian, signallers in the offices of the Persian telegraph line between Meshed and Seistan it will be necessary to retain British signallers in Seistan for employment on the line indefinitely, we ask your sanction to our proceedings, with effect from the original deputation of Messrs.

Simla, the 10th September 1908. My Lord, r- In reply to Your Lordship’s despatch No. 39 (Political), dated the 3rd April 1908, we have the honour to forward a revised statement com paring the Indian expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular Services in Persia for the year 1906-07 with the final expenditure for 1905-06. 2. The foot-notes to the revised statement explain most of the items mentioned in the memorandum which accompanied Your Lordship’s despatch, and with regard to the remainder we offer the following explanations:— (a) As regards the item under A (1) of the memorandum it will be seen from paragraph 3 of our despatch No/58 (Political), dated the 29th March 1908, that, with the exceptions mentioned in foot note ( 4 ) at page 1 of the comparative statement, the figures given are complete. The statement which accompanied that despatch also gives the correct entries for the items under A (2) and (3) with the exception that an expenditure of Rs. 569 should be shown under Bushire “ Civil Works ” for 1905-06. This figure was not shown in the statement of the 27th December 1906, as we were only advised of the expenditure by the Bombay Gov ernment on the 2nd August 1907. (5) The reason why gain or loss by exchange is shown in connection with the transactions at certain Consulates, but not in connection with those at others, is as follows:—The accounts of the British Legation, the Khorasan Agency, and the Seistan and Turbat-i- Haidari Consulates are kept in the Persian currency, and treasury balances are held in krans. The rates at which the transactions in the monthly accounts are converted from krans into rupees is advised quarterly by the Treasury Officer at Tehran, and consequently the conversion of the balances results sometimes in a gain and sometimes in a loss by exchange. In the other Consulates the accounts are kept, and the balances held in rupees. Certain items of expenditure are however shown in the vouchers both in krans and rupees. The procedure has differed in respect of these items, in some cases the full charge in rupees has been taken under the one head, and in all others the difference between the actual rupee cost at the market rate of the day and the cost calculated at the official rate for the quarter has been treated as gain or loss by exchange. The latter method has now been discontinued except in converting charges for2 ii We have the honour to be, My Loed, Tour Xiordship’a most obedient, humble servants, A &amp; \ a. jwiXlvL-1908. SIMLA.

The Treasury have been informed in reply that Sir E. Grey is satisfied that the expenditure generally has received Their Lordships’sanction and His Majes ty's Paymaster-General has accordingly been authoriz ed to transfer the sum of Seven thousand and forty Pounds six shillings and sevenpence to the credit of the Secretary of State for India. I am, however, to fr-e Under Secretary of State, India Office. pointpoint out that in the absence of minute details of expenditure this Department is not in a position to assert positively that no single item is included not covered by previous sanction of the Treasury, and must rely on the care exercised by the Government of India in the preparation of their account, while still asking, as in the past, for further information in respect of any expenditure which appears to be excep tional. With a view to settling as early as possible the amount of the contribution due for the current year I am to forward herewith statements of the expenditure incurred by this Department in 1906-7, the accounts of which have now been completed. It will be seen that the total expenditure to be shared between the two Governments in respect of Lakhon and Chiengrai is Two thousand and sixty-seven Pounds fifteen shillings and ninepence, and that the additional expenditure in Persia over 1905-6 is Six thousand five hundred and ninenine Pounds ten shillings and eightpence.

In reply I am to request you to inform Secretary Sir E.

Sik, Fort William, the 19 th March 1908. We have the honour to reply to your despach No. 117 (Political), dated the 20th September 1907, regarding the expenditure incurred by the Government of India on Diplomatic and Consular Establishments in Persia in 1905-06. 2. With reference to the questions raised by the Foreign Office and with reference to paragraph 2 of your despatch we offer the following explanations:— {a) We regret that the item “ Gain by exchange on local transactions at Meshed,” which is recorded in the accounts under a revenue head was omitted, through a misunderstanding, from the statement of expenditure for 1905-06. It has now been entered in the revised comparative statement of the expend iture of the Government of India in Persia in 1905-06 as a minus figure against the heading “Loss by exchange on local transactions”. (5) The gain or loss on remittance transactions at His Majesty’s Legation at Tehran does not affect the divisible expenditure, as such gain or loss is the result of a conventional method of exhibiting the transactions in our accounts where they appear under a Debt head. No figures were therefore shown under this head. (c) The greater part of the increase of Rs 40,700, for supplies and services at Arabistan, relates to the charges on account of the deputation of Major Morton on the Karun River Irrigation Scheme, which amounted to Rs 29,300. In consequence of the orders contained in your despatch No. 36 (Political), dated the 12th April 1907, that the expenditure on Major Morton’s deputation up to the 5th July 1905 only was to he divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues, the sum of Rs 18,362-11-2 has now been deducted from the divisible expenditure of 1905-06. The increase of Rs 40,700 is thus reduced to Rs. 22,382, of which approximately half is on account of Major Morton s deputation while the other half mainly represents newly sanctioned charges for the new Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz which was started in September 1904. The princi pal items are—(1) Rations and purchase, feed and keep of horses and camels for the escort sent in October 1904 (Rs 7,000); (2) tour charges (Rs 2,900); (3) House-rent at Rs. 100 for the entire year against three months in the previous year (Rs 900); and (4) purchase and repair of tents (Rs 700). (d) The charges shown against the Shiraz Consulate are Rs 306-8-4 for the pay of the two gardeners and three Sarbazes sanctioned in January 1902, Rs 238 for travelling allowance of the escort from Eushire, and Rs. 500 for upkeep of the Residency buildings and grounds. The expenditure is con trolled by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and in previous statements was shown against Bushire.2 3. We submit herewith a revised comparative statement for 1905-06 including the gain by exchange previously omitted, and excluding all charges in respect of the Robat escort, which will he included in the statement of outlay in connection with that escort which will he forwarded to you in due course. The outlay by the Government of India on the Consular Guards at Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz, and Ispahan is that brought to account in the year 1905-06, and necessarily includes arrear payments for the year 1904-05 which did not enter the accounts of that year. The Controller, Military Accounts, Northern Circle, has been advised to refund through the Account Current the claim on the Foreign Office for the pay of the Salutri and Farrier of the Ispahan guards referred to in paragraph 3 of your despatch No. 56 (Political), dated the 17th May 1907. No other claim was made on the Foreign Office through the Account Current for expenditure on Consular Guards in 1905-06. We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants,Please see the Secretary of State's telegram dated 13th February 1909, regarding the expenditure on Diplomatic and Consular establishments m ^ersia.

It has now been entered in the revised comparative statement of the expenditure of the Government of India in Persia in 190£-1906 as a minus figure against the heading “ Loss by Exchange on local transactions.' 1 (2) The gain or loss on remittance transactions does not affect the divisible expenditure as they are the result of a conventional method of exhibiting the transactions in our accounts where they appear under a Debt head. (8) The increase of Rs. 40,700 for supplies and services at Arabistan is mainly due to the charges on account of the deputation of Major Morton on the Karun River Irrigation Scheme which amounted to Re. 29,300. In consequence of the orders of the Government of India communicated in Foreign Department letter No. y 20S0-E.A., dated 5th June 1907, that the expenditure up to the 5th July 1905, only was to be divisible in moieties, the sum of Rs. 18,862-11-2 has now been deducted from the divisible expenditure of 1905-1906. The increase of Rs. 40,700 is then reduced to Rs. 22,882 of which approximately half is on account of Major Morton's deputation and the other half represents newly sanc tioned charges mainly for the new Vice-Consulate at Ahwaz which was started iu September 1904. The principal items are (1) Rations and purchase, feed and keep of horses and camels for the Escort sent in October 1904 (Rs. 7,000), (2) Tour charges (Rs. 2,900), (3) House-rent at Rs. 100 for entire year against three months in previous year (Rs. 9C0), and (4) Purchase and repair of tents (Rs. 700). (4) The charges shown against the Shira? Consulate are Rs. 806-8-4 for the pay of two gardeners and three sarbazes sanctioned in the lore’gn Department letter No. 68-E.A., dated 8th January 1902 ; Rs. 238 for travelling allowance of the Escort from Bushire, and Rs. 5C0 for up keep of the Residency buildings and grounds. The expenditure is controlled by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and in previous statements was shown against Bushire. I sul mit a revised comparative statement for 1905-1906 including the gain by exchange previously omitted, and excluding all charges in respect of the Robat Escort. The outlay by the Government of India on the Consular Guatds at Tehran, Tabriz, Shiraz and Ispahan is that brought to account in the year 1905-1906 and necessarily includes arrear payments for the year 1904-1905 which did net enter the accounts of that year. The Controller, Military Accounts, Northern Circle, has been advised to refund through the Account Current the claim on the Foreign Office for the pay of the Salutri and larrier of the Ispahan Guards referred to in paiagraph 3 of the Secretary of State's despatch No. 56- Politieal, dated 17th May 1907. I take this opportunity to submit the revised statement for 1906-1907. Those heads Only are shown under vhich charges occur in the figures for that year or the year 1905-1906, The deduct entry of Rs. 18,362-11-2 in the original statement for 1906-1907 on account of over charges in 1905-1906 for Major Morton's deputation'should be omitted now that the expenditure in 1905-1906 has been revised.
