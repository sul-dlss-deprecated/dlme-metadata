No. 520-S Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain. 4th March, 1948. / Copy forwarded with compliments to; « Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Downing Street, London.li. C Pf xt 37^46 6th February, 1948* 629. Cur Ref: R.46Q8g/47/B.0.A, 1 . Till you please refer to your letter of the ^Int January to Donaldson at the C.R.O. , a copy of which you sent to Rate-.iff e Cousins, about the introduction of an air mail service to Kov.eit. 2* Firntlv , will you please accept ay a^x^logies for n&lt; t writing to you before cn this raatter, but there have been so raany considerations to be taker: into account in connection with the u.'e of Koaeit as a stop on the B.O.A.C. *s trunk routes that I felt it would be preferable to defer writing until we v ere in a positio . to let you have soaie definite infonaation. As, however, it appears you oust now make your arrangements for the diposal of air mail oorresp:Jideice froa Ko.»eit after 1st April, I mn writing to let you know the present position. &gt;• 5.O.A.C. , at our instigation, have for some time been considering the desirability of catering for Koweit traffic, possibly by one of their flying boat services nav operating to Bahrein. Had it not been for the cholera ban imposed by the Iraqi and Iranian Authorities on pex*8ons entering their territory from yt, the Corporaticn would by now have completed a ground survey not only of Koweit, but also of Abadan. 4. As recently as 16th January, B.O.A.C. infomed us that they are doing everything possi le to prepare a plan for calls at the above places and, in connection witV*ith ther.e developments, they are considering having in mind the increasing activities in the Persian Gulf itself arising particularly from oil developments there, whether there is sufficient traffic in prospect to justify a special service in that area, 5. It is evident that some further time is likely to —^ elapse before these plans can materialise, and you will probably consider it advisable in the meantime to proceed with the arrangements outlined in paragraph 5 of your letter under reference. 6. I need hardly add that we shall keep you advised of further progress. 7* I am sending codes of this letter to Donaldson and fyman. Tours sincerely, (Signed) H.
