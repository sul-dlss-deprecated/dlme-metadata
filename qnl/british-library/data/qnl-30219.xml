IfaMater, Tehran, in his despatch below reports the campaign waged in the Persian press, including that con trolled by the Russians, against ' Imperialists” (i.e. the British) who are alleged to be endeavouring to form a tribal bloc and to be arming the tribes for their own ends. Sir R. BO.Hard points out that E.M.G-. f s policy towards the tribes was laid down in 1941 and has been followed faithfully ever since; this policy is to assist and strengthen the Persian admin istration, and to avoid making flp«i!|'W* *p promises to the tribes which it might prove impossible to implement, though payment might be made to tribedfelements for specific services. • 1 ■ ■ H.M. Minister gives various reasons why the British are suspected of intrigue among the tribes: the fact that owing to the need for security on the Bushire-Shiraz Road and in the oilfields and to the weakness of the Persian area (26620) Wt.83011/P.H1 6,000 10/43 A.&amp; B.W.Ltd. Gp.685 /ArnyArmy, Na*ir Khan Qashgai was indedmified for any thing he had done against the British and not interned; the intrigues of Qawam-ul- Mulk, a hereditary friend of the British, against the Tudeh party; the number of ' arms acquired by the tribes in recent years, the natural inclination of the Persians to believe a false and colourful story rather ‘ ’than a plain statement of fact’; and the anxiety of the Russians to distract public attention from their own afctlvities in the North, In order to counteract the ^ allegations, Sir R, Dillard persuaded * Bayat, the late Prime Minister, to make a statement in the Majlis on the difficulty of disarming the tribes, the meetings between various tribal leaders, and the patriotism of the Persian tribesmen. H.M. Miuiuter Hfrfcz also recommended that an article should appear in the British press on tribal problems in Persia; material for such an article is given in annexe- 2 to his despatch. The article appeared in the Observer of ■13 th July, and the text was broadcast in B.B.C^News Service the same day.

I have the honour to report that a campaign has been waged for some time in various Persian nev/spapers in Tehran and provincial towns, particularly Shiraz, against 'imperialists’' _ who, it is alleged, are trying to form a tribal bloc for their own purposes,and are arming the,tribes to that end. The target of the attack is of course the British, but the use of the erm imperialist' enables the accusations to be put forward even m newspapers which are known to be mouthpieces of the Soviet Embassy. 2 e The policy to be followed in regard to the tribes in ,o^ ia . was iaid down in ypur telegram No. 854 dated O ctober 5th 1941, an reply to my Mespatch^o. Sba or October 1st 1941. Macle wary by a six years 1 experience of~krab and Kurdish tribes in Iraq, and by some knowledge of events in Persia over a much longer period, I raised the question when General (now Field ^ ahal L° p £) Wave.IQ. visited Tehran soon after the occupation in &gt; ^nd the ensuing discussion, in which three of his general? as well as the specialist members of the staff of His Majesty’s Legation took part, it was unanimously agreed that it was undesirable to encourage the tribes because:- (1) It had been laid down by His Majesty’s Government that.our object must be to get the civil administration running again .and we could not cursue that policy at the centre and a different policy in’ the trioal areas ( 2 ) . Otherwise we. should, find ourselves involved in endless family and sectional intrigues to little purpose since serious tribal resistance to a' German advance was not to be expected (3) . We must not hold out promises to the tribes v/hich, aa _ in , case of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, might not be able to save them from the central government. 3, To these propositions a rider was attached that 1 'there was nothing against our paying tribal leaders or (other) elements for .s pecif services such as handing over Germans or helping tb protect the oil drea§, • „• - -j.. j r° 5 ' 1Q . 0 i‘. conclusion of the Tripartite Treaty in January , 19*2 provided an additional argument for the policy which X had . recommended and you had approved, since we were now bound in loyalty to the Persian Government not to follow a policy which might weaken Persia, -po •your instructions were given they nave been taithfully obeyed. 'While; urging, the Persian Government to pcide certain land -claims which have been causing'unrest' among some of the tribes and to improve the lot of. tribal ns well is o other areas., we have given loyal support to the Central ' ‘ Government, How is_ i t possible-, then,' that we oould be accused, / ris k of. being held guilty., of folio wing, the contrary policy? leaderf%Tdir h #hl the ^ n ^. n f eason is that although the Qashgai p *‘ a ’ r khan and hlG brother Khosrow were conspiring with for a thC 1 f 63 ^ harboured German paVachuUsts lor ^ long time, they and two brothers who were actuall' e Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C. M.P. mis Majesty’s principal Secretary of^tate ^ for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office, LONDON, S e _W : 1,(j) nnd seme are still interned. This may appear unfair, but v/e had ' think of security. For a considerable time lorries for Russia wv**re assembled at Bushire and driven up through Isfahan and Sb'': to Tehran and the Pars tribes could have made that road dan annus; while the security .of the oil fields - a major Allied interest until Japan is defeated - can be threatened by the B^ir Ahmed, Bakhtiari and other tribes. V/e should have been very glad if the Persian Government could have arrested Nasir and Khosrow Qashgai and Abdullah Zarrhampur of the Boir Ahmedi, for harbouring Germans, but the Persian Army was sc weak that one military detachment was disarmed by the tribes while another was defeated at Semirum. After that the Persian Government adopted an attitude of subserv iency towards the Qashgai, and to protect our own interests v/e gave Nasir a letter of indemnity for anything he might have done against British interests in the past and returned to their homes two brothers of his who had been intriguing with the Germans in Turkey and had fallen into cur hands: in return for this he handed over the Germans and promised go^d behaviour towards us for the future. 7» A subsidiary reason for the- accusation is the recent behaviour of Qawarn al hulk, The Qawam, who is a hereditary friend of ours, seems to be anxious to re-establish himself in Pars, whence he was removed by the late 8hah, who took away his Pars estates and gave him land elsewhere in exchange. He went to Pars some mnths ago, and there he on the one hand had a con ference with Nasir and other tribal leaders and on the other engaged in a foolish struggle with the Tudeh party, whose efforts he tried to counter by bribing the printers of Shiraz not to print the Tudeh newspaper.. This furnished Tudeh circles with ar excuse to attack the •'imperialists” and one local paper even accused the Qawam of being paid by the British, The charge is that the imperialists wish to create a tribal bloc f:;r some sinistc r purpose and are arming the members of the bloc, /'hat really angers the Tudeh and other critics, in s- far as they believe theii charges, is the supposition that the bloc is intended to be .aij - Russian and as a counter-weight to a Goviet-controlledii.zerbu.jano 8, There is little d'ubt that the Pars tribes are well armed. At the time when he was harb uring the Germans, Nasir’s German armourer was busy putting together parts of rifles which had been smuggled out of the arsenal at Tehran, there are the arms taken from the Persian army by the Pars tribes in the two incidents mentioned in paragraph 6 above; and above all th re are the arms lost to the Persian Government when the Persian Army disintegrated at the time if the occupation. There may w- 11 be a movement ~f arms into Pars at the present moment, for I sir is suspicious of the Government and may wish to increase his fighting power, and on the other hand he has plenty of money to buy arms, having grown rich during the last tw years, owing to the high price of grain and the various farms of commission open to all t ribo.l chiefs. It may be i o .that sene rifles have been acquired from the Ariab tribes of Khuzistan during the recant dis armament operations by the Persian forces, f^r anvng the rifles handed ever there are very few rw lern ones. But it is not nee '-snip that there should be a basis of reaswnable ground for the belief that the Pars tribes are being aimed at this moment. The Persian always prefers a. crooked to c. straightf- award explanation, a tale of intrigue to a plain fact. It is knu/n that there is always some gun-running in the Pension Gulf, end the easy conclusion is reached that the rifles in Pars have arrived from the Gulf and. of, , - . , .of course, by the hand of the British, whose interbsts in tho-. PmI are well known. It has been an article of our pol .cy in th. hi IuJl E ast for many years to try to prevent arms from fa jlin jwrivi r. \hands, since they drift about and a rifle £iven to ..ay might be used against us by an enemy tomorrow. It is true that at the moment of our greatest anxiety about Nasir Khan and his friends we supported the Qawam in his suggestion that arms should be given to*the Mamassani, hereditary enemies of the Qashgai, to enable them to defend themselves -against possible attack, but these arms were in fact not delivered; and once the German danger was past -we discouraged the distribution of arms to the tribes, as when the General Officer Commanding in Khuzistan wished to arm Khosrow Zarghampur, brother and rival of Abdullah, and His Majesty’s Embassy persuaded the Shah and the Chief of the General Staff to adopt milder methods instead. 9. One could not expect the pro-Russian newspapers not to seize upon the tale of imperialist intrigue in Pars to distract the attention of the public from the clumsy Soviet attempt to secure an oil concession and the arbitrary methods which the Soviet authorities in the north were known to be using. But it is possible that the Persians who run these papers half believed the tale. Similar suspicions were voiced in questions asked of His Majesty's Consul and other persons at Shiraz by Monsieur Marchenko, the notorious Soviet Vice-Consul at Isfahan whose machinations at Tabriz caused the Persian Government to ask for h? removal, whereupon the Soviet authorities sent him to Isfahan to continue his policy there. I therefore went to See the Soviet Ambassador and after referring to the newspaper attacks I told hir. of the tribal policy laid down by His Majesty's Government soon after the occupation, and of the reasons for its adoption, and assured him that this Embassy had followed that policy faithfully ever since and that events would prove to him that we had done so Monsieur Maximov showed much interest in what I said but I have no doubt he thought my visit was just a part of our cunning game. Even if he was not sure about our plot, it must be meat and drink to him, after his failure over the oil concession, to have a vast anti-Tudeh raid perhaps anti-Soviet plot to reveal to his Governme: t 10. There is some evidence that the Soviet authorities have begun to make approaches to the tribes. I am myself convinced that they have offered rifles and money to some of the khans of the Qashgai. Moreover, four men recently arrested at Isfahan for gun running • were foun d to include two members of the Tudeh party. It would be characteristic of the Russians to arm the tribes while using the Tudeh press to allege that the British were doing so, though it is possible that they are merely trying to win over tril they* believe us to have tried to debauch already v/ith presents of arms. 11. It is very difficult to dispose of a false accusation ii Persia. The Persians rarely tell the truth themselves and are disinclined to credit anyone else with that habit. Moreover, as you are aware, they regard the British as masters of intrigue and as spending much of their lives intriguing about Persia, so that ; direct denial is usually accepted as confirmation of any accusatic against the British. Nevertheless it seemed desirable that the anti-British propaganda about the tribes should be countered, and discussed the question with the late Prime Minister, Monsieur Bayat. I said that all his predecessors would admit that they had enjoyed our support and that we had hever encouraged the tribe &gt; against the cental government; that in the matter of the disamar . of the Arab tribes of Khuzistan we had given concrete evidence of goodwill.o..goodwill; and that it would protect the Persian Government as well as ourselves i’rom criticism if he would make a statement in the Majlis about the alleged tribal bloc* Eventually he made the statement which is enclosed as Annexe 1% It was better than -nothing but it did not go as far as I had suggested, and I have .&gt;een seeking for other means to convince the Persians ana the Russians, if it is possible to convince people so prone to suspicion, that good senee if not good faith must prevent our suoportinP! the tribes* Recently Mr* Macdonald, the Diplomatic Correspondent of the Times* who was passing through Tehran on his way home from Moscow, showed great interest in this question and when I asked whether the Times could perhaps publish an article on the tribal question if the Foreign Ofiiec provided the material, he said yes* In the hope that you will approve this scheme I transmit as Annexe 2 material which might serve as the basis of an article in the Times* I may say that I have told many Persians that Mr* Macdonald displayed an interest in the tribal question in the south and that 1 urged him to publish something on hie return to Etiglsnd* 13* If an article appears its effect would be greatly reinforced if it coujd be the subject of a Question in parliament* I transmit as Annexe 3 a draft which might form the basis of a Question and Answer in the House of Commons. 13# Copies of this despatch and of Annexes 1 and 3 are being sent to His Majesty*s Ambassadors at Moscow and Bagdad, \ the Minister Resident, Cairo, the Government of India, New-Delhi Persia and Iraq Command and to Tiis Majesty’s Consular officers in Persia. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (W/3 —a.ANNEXE I Reply given by the Prime Minister to questions by Deputy Abbas Mas'udi, 4th March 1945, on the tribution of arms and the Tribal Union* 553426 3 y his question the honourable member has given me the ^portunity to bring to the notice of the Majlis one of the .fficulties which the government has recently had to meet and which has made it hard for us to accomplish our duty. This difficulty has arisen from the spreading of false news calculated to disturb public opinion and to create anxiety and embarrasmont among our countrymen. It is such news which the honourable member has heard and which has caused him to put the question. In reply I have to say that, as far as the Government is aware, there is nothing to justify anxiety, and the rumours circulated in this connection are unfounded. The truth is that the events of Shahri- var 1320 (August 1941) and the temporary dispersion and weakness of the army were responsible for a certain quantity of arms falling into the hands of civilians, including certain tribes, and it cannot of course be denied that these arms have not yet been collected in full. Meanwhile it appears that these have been and still are illicit transactions in fire arms. This is not however a new thing; such unauthorised transactions have more or less always been made. This is nothing new and no special hands (dasth&amp;) are at work. There are always smugglers in every part' ~f the world; officials have been and are always on their track, and they are punished if they are arrested. The important point is that in certain tribal districts of Khuzistan and Khorasan where arms have thus fallen into the hands of individuals the Government is collecting than; this process of disarmament is to be carried out everywhere, inasmuch as the Government believes that no person, party or class of men, other than the members of the Army, is entitled to carry arms, since otherwise it will not be possible to maintain public security With regard to the meeting between certain tribal chiefs and their agreement, which forms the subject of the second part i the honourable member’s question, I have to state that according to reports received such rumours originate from the fact_ that an tne South certain local men of influence met one or two tribal chiefs secretly , but this has no effect on the circumstances. Meanwhile normal meetings which are always called for by neighbourly reasons, have taken place between certain tribal chiefs. Such meetings are- useful for the consolidation of friendly relations, and represent the desire of the tribes to live with each other in peace and friendship; this not only gives no ground for anxiety but is a source of great satisfaction. The rumours have their origin in the meetings which have taken place only with the intention of settling local disputes, ancl/it is to be hoped that all misunderstandings will be removed and that! unity and concord will be established among all men and classes in this delicate hour. The House is aware that our tribes have always beer, patriotic and have made sacrifices for their country. In this con nection they have proved themselves repeatedly in the past and they will also prove themselves in future if needs be. In conclusion I have to draw the attention of the honour able deputy and of the House to the fact that the disturbance and anxiwty felt three months ago in different parts of the country i.e. when this Government came to power, has been removed to-day, and peace and tranquility reigns everywhere, and it is hoped that this will continue. I hope that with the permission and collaboration of the House the Government will meet with success in carrying out reform and in improving the position of the peasants and workers, and tha*t it v/ill be able to enforce at an earlier date the programme for the development af the country, a programme which naturally includes the tribes. Naturally the tribes, who are seeking peace and improvement and who have no other intention will serve their country more than before.ANNEXE 2. . .0 Materia 1 for an artic le in The Ti me^ Tribal problems in Persia. (From a correspondent lately in Per3 In spite of the railway, the fine the factories in various cities and other sirns of modernis -^\the traveller in Persia soon finds that the | ) ersi4i84&amp;ernmp nt of to-day still has to face an ancient prob 1 1 'pP £ S’gFfc e in various parts of Persia of tribal elements which until the reign of Reza Shah had perhaps never been reduced to order for centuries# Added to the tendency to improve their lot by raidin 0 and the obstacle which long and difficult communications place in the way of the maintenance of order, there is the complic^.tio of difference of race. While some naturally turbulent tribes such as the Lurs and the Bakhtiari rank as Persians, there are Kurds in the west of Persia, Arabs in the south, and a Turki element, the Qashgai, in the province of Pars 0 How insecure Persia was in the days before the last war is well known. More than one British traveller got into trouble in Luristan and felt himself lucky to escape with his life. On one occasion Sir Arnold Wilson then a junior consular officer, was attacked quite close to Shir;, while another British consular officer received compensation fr: the Persian Government for wounds inflicted on him by Qashquli tribesmen on the Bushire - Shiraz road. 2. One of the first tasks to which Reza Shah set himsell was the reduction of the tribes to order. Regarding the migraoin of the Qashgai, Bakhtiari and other tribes not only as a phenomenon of a backward civilisation and therefore as reprehensible in itself but also as offering too tempting an occasion for raiding and looting, he forbade the migration and decreed that the tribes should be settled. Unfortunately this policy was carried out on unenlightened lines by corrupt officials, without reference to the capacity of the land chosen to support the population 'settled on it. The result was the impoverishment of the tribes and con sequently of the country. It may not have mattered to the Persian Treasury that the tribal women were forced to sell their bangles to get money to live, but it was a loss to the state that a 1 irv, proportion of the tribal flocks of sheep and goats died for lack, of pasture and that the famous herds of horses disappeared, the Persian town dweller, however, who is incurably town-minded and blind to the importance of agriculture and stock-raising, this seemed (if he even knew ab^ut it) of little importance in comparison with the fact that tranquillity reigned, that the tribes were disarmed end that travdl was safe. Security is indeed of the greatest importance, and it was natural enough, in a cc i mti t y which had rarely known it, that its establishment should loom large. But in Persia it cannot endure without a just tribal settlement; and the aim of Persian Governments of the future should be to preserve order while avoiding the economic mistakes committed under Reza Shah in the tribal areas under the na.mes of settlement and pacification. The fundamentally unstable ord o established by him was inevitably upset by the entry of British and Russian troops into Persia, in August 1941, The Persian Ariry was disorganised by the strain thrown upon it, and the subsea” k abdication of Reza Shah deprived it of the mainspring which had kept it g^ing f r twenty years; while at the same time many thousands of modern rifles were lost to the Persian Army an( ^ T filtered away to the more turbulent of the tribes. Thus at the time when the authority of the central government was greatly shaken, the fighting power of the tribes was increased. Moreovtv a number of tribal chiefs who had been kept in Tehran under sur^ veillance during the reign of Reza Shah were released by the gQy&lt;k*itr- inent of Monsieur Firughi, while some whom not even he would ha\ released,....- 2 - where....- rele^sed&gt; -evaded control and returned to their tribes to remain as potential trouble-makers* This combination of causes began to produce its effect almost at once. Disturbance manifested itself in Fars (tho Shiraz province)* in the Dashti and Tangistan areas bordering on the Gulf ports, and' above all in Southern Kurdistan, whe*e th$ Persian offiohal^ fled or ■ were-eyected and the Kurds in possessions 3i The question of public order was of immediate concern to His Majesty’s Government because of the decision to send Aid to Russia through Persia* British railway experts became responsible for the running of the railway from the Persian Gulf to Tehran, and although this duty was handed over to Americans of the Persian Gulf Command a year or so later, British troops remained responsible for the security of communications as far as Tehran - not only of the railway, but also of the roads along which the convoys to Russia ran. Thus the security essential to the regular provision of Aid to Russia and to the war effort in general v/as exposed to danger fro-, all three of the areas which have been indicated above. The Kurds might threaten the road communications in the west; the Arab tribe^ in Khuzistan were all round what eventually became important Britis. and American bases; and the tribes of Pars touched on one side the Bushire road, and on the other the oilfields which are essential to the pro section of the war, especially in the Par East. Gov ernm en J ' 4. The first area to claim the attention of the iersian / Southern Kurdistan, where a Kurdish leader named Hama Rashid was giving serious trouble. The movement demanded the attention of the British military authorities in Persia also, because of the risk its spreading to tribes on the Allied communications and its threat to stability in general - a stability which was essential to the prosecution of the Aid to Russia programme. It affected His Majesty Government in a much wider way also because of their interest in oh . maintenance of a string, stable and independent Persia. Moreover unrest among the Persian Kurds might disturb the Kurdish minorities in the neighbouring territories of Turkey and Iraq.. To remain silent was impossible because Hama Rashid was trying, with some success, secure support by claiming that he had the backing of the British. Accordingly a statement was printed in Persian and eventually droppe _ over the disturbed ansa by Persian aeroplanes, stating that the policy of His Majesty’s Government was to encourage the Persian Government to restore their authority in Kurdistan while at the same time redressing the legitimate grievances of the population, and specifically denying that any support was being given to the rebel leader, Hama Rashid. The British military authorities helped by releasing the Persian troops who had been taken prisoner during the operations of August 1941 and by handing over to the Persian Army a large stock of rifles which they had taken from the local population, who had acquired them from the Persian troops by various means at the time of the entry of the British forces. 5. It is not unreasonable to see a connection between the statement in the declaration dropped among tM tribes, about the policy of His Majesty's Government towards the tribes, and a state ment made in the Persian Majlis in March 1942, in which the irirne Minister stated that the Persian Government were firmly resolved to compensate tribal individuals for genuine injustices and announce the formation of a commission to examine grievances without delay - a statement v/hich was also distributed among the tribes of Southern Kurdistan. The trouble there simmered down into a compromise by which Hama Rashid was made ruler of Bon eh and other Kurdish Chiefs^ held similar positions elsewhere, each receiving a subsidy from tho Persian Government in return for the maintenance of order. Even this, however, did not satisfy Hama RaBhid, who took arms again against the Persian Government in September 1944. Being forced to abandon Baneh he burned every building there except the mosque. Under pressure from the Persian troops he retreated into Iraq,3 where the Iraqi Government, with admirable loyalty, have interned him sc that he may do no further harm; 6* 'The tale of the tribes cf Xhuzistan, the lcw-lyin£ part of Persia along the- left bank cf the Shatt al iirab, is shorte-. Here such turbulence as there has been has found a vent mainly in •Mutual raiding and in robbery of the Allied duja^s wtt-e*rlal c-he Allied bases* The Persian military authorities began a proces- cf gradual disarmament of the tribes in that region in 1942 a: have continued it recently, and in the course of this they are saic 1 to have collected several thousands of rifles; The British authorities have made no-objection to the collection of arms in to - area where they have essential military interests, though they arc hoping that hard on the heels cf the Persian Army there will follow good doctors and school-masters and civil officials, so that the Arabs may see that the Government of Tehran does not represent repression alone. 7. It was the Pars area which presented the greatest problem On one side there was sufficient disorder, early in 1942, to necessitate the despatch cf a battalion of British troops to Gach Saran, where one of the most important of the oil wells is situated On the ether there were rdm^urs of an understanding between seme Bakhtiari chiefs, the Qashgai and the Boir Ahmedi tribes - rumours which point was given by the presence of two Germans with the tribes and of a third, Mayr, moving about in disguise between Tehrc and Isfahan. This was the year, it will be remembered, when the Germans reached Ordzhonikidze in the Caucasus and penetrated with!' 60 miles of Alexandria; but apart from the danger of a movement against the Allies inside the country in concert with the German advance from outside, there was the risk of attack on the convoys of lorries which were assembled by the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation at Bus hi re and driven up to Tehran for delivery to the Soviet authorities. The Persian nrmy was not yet in a position tc assert its authority, and an attempt with inadequate forces to disarm the Qashgai during their migration to their winter quarters ended with the disarmament cf a Persian detachment. In the even: delivery of lorries to the Russians in Tehran proceeded with relat.n few incidents, though it cannot be said to what extent this should be attributed tc the fact that the convoys were well protected or the defeat of the ^xis at Stalingrad and Alamein and the efforts cf the British authorities to make the tribes, particularly the Qashga: understand that the Germans would lose the war. The tribes continued to look askance at their own Government and in the summer of 1943 they defeated a considerable Persian garrison at Semirum and captured all its arms and equipment* The Persian Government after a vague attempt to use Qawam ul MuIk, whose family had for generations wielded considerable influence in Pars, as a counterwei‘ through his influence with tribes and tribal sections^ who had no wish tc c me under the influence of Nasir Qashgai, embarked on policy cf conciliation. While this perhaps satisfied the immediac aims of the Persian Government, it was insufficient from the point of view cf Allied war aims which were threatened by German influenc among the tribes as represented net only by the Germans who had bee: for sane time in tribal country but by two aircraft loads of German; who were later dropped by parachute. In the end the British authorities were obliged to enter into direct negotiation with Nasir Qashgai, who handed ever the Germans in his territory in exchange for a letter of indemnity. This letter wiped out anything he might have d^ne against British interests in the past. It Ud not cover his relations with his own Government which are of course a matter for direct settlement with the Government, In this he was fortunate, for had the Persian Government possessed the necessary authority in tribal country, he would have been arrested like many other Persians accused cf conspiring with or on behalf of the Germans, and interned. 84 8. In Bakhtiarl e-untry -Iso the Persian Government had to ada t their policy to the difficulties of.the moment in violation of their avowed policy of preventing the rec very ox power by any tribal leader in his own territory* They conferred the governorship of Balchtiari cn the most inxluential of the Bakhtiari khans, the aged Murteza Quli* son of the late Samesam al Saltoneh. There have naturally been grumbles from the rival Bakhtiari family, who used in the days before Reza Shah to take ^turn and turn about in positions of authority with the oranch a which Murteza Quli belongs, out in the main the arrangement seems to be serving its purpose viz* to keep order in an area where the Persian Government is not in a position, until its armed forces are reorganised* to assert its ~wn authority. 9. Rumours of a tribal bloc had aroused s-me interest when y-ur c-rreso-ndent was in Persia recently* It was stated th it Nasir Qashgai had had a meeting with the Governor of Bakhtiari, Murtiza Quli Khan, and that Qawam al Mulk had been present. Vhc. 0awarn, who used to be a considerable figure in Pars, was compelled by Roza Shah to exchange his Pars estates for properties^ elsewhere : but under the present regime he seems to be gravitating back to h^. old haunts. section of the Persian press however professed to see in this meeting a plot of the rrrst sinister description, and to discern in the background 'imperialists” who were alleged to be furnishing the alleged bloc with arms f-r s-me unspecified object, It is n~t necessary t~ be a diviner to translate ”imperialist” into 'British”. The iersian man in the street attributes everything that happens in his c*untry, including (very nearly) good and bad weather, to British or Russian machinations, according to whether it happens in the south or the north, and delights in a chance to stir up trouble between what no calls his northern and his southern neighbours. The then rime Minister of lersia, Monsieur Bayat, seems to have taken a sensiole view of the matter, for he made a statement in the Majlis to the^ effect that agreements between notables and tribal leaders were t be welcomed as tending towards peace, and that it wasn t necessary to lock farther than the events of August 1941 and the inevitab■e smuggling (he might have added the continued thefts of rifles and ammunition from Allied camps and dumps in lersia), to account for the arms now in the hands ~f the tribes, a reasoned statement like this, however, reads dully to people starved of free comment for fifteen years and suddenly provided by their press with a .iet of.the wildest hints, innuendos and allegations against everyone i tufni It may be s-me years before the Persian reading public begins to settle down and to distinguish between myths suitable fet the' days when his historical epic, the Shahnameh, was written, ana the probabilities of the modern world* 10. To serious students of British foreign policy it is naturally inconceivable that Great Britain could support in regard to Persia any policy other than respect for her territorial integrity, sovereignty, and political independence. These principles, which are essential to British interests, have oeen solemnly set f-rth by Great Britain and Russia in the Tripartite Treaty of January, 1948. To suppose that Great Britain could be at the same time sup-porting the foundation of an internati nal organisation to ensure world peace and contemplating a policy whict would disrupt lersia or at least weaken the central government, is absurd except f-r people who live in as narrow a circle of idea^ as most Persians do. If there is one less credible accusation thar that the British are trying to form (out of perhaps the most volatile material in the world: icrsian tribes) a vague bloc tor s inscrutable end, it is that they ore so silly as to issue arms to the tribes. It might be thought that r 'ur century-eld efforts to prevent the sale — f arms in the Middle iiast except to ^r. pcrly c ens t i tu t e d .o.&lt;-oooc5 g'ovejmnicnts would have afforded a sufficiently cle.'.r indication of our unchanging policy. Everyone with eastern ience kn^ws how arms drift about according t local ec n and political needs. A rifle picked up on an Iraqi battlefield in 1915 might be used by an ^fghan raider into: India a year later c jx rifle thrown away or sold by a Persian soldier at Kermorishoh in Au.gust 1941 might be sold by a Kurd to a Lur and by a Lur to pn i^rab in Khuzistan; and during the disarmament in Kjouzintan ijts owner might sell it cheap to a neighbouring t than hand it in to the Persian Government for nothing. It would be a xco] ^ ^ person indeed who would hand over a rifle to .any Persian tribesman and expect to find it in the same hands a few months later. to a Persian tribesman risking his life in some vague quarrel for the beautiful eyes of some foreigner: why should he? C. distingu: r ed Turkish diplomat who served in London a few years ago used to tell a story based on his experience in rersia in the 1914 war 9 when he held a position in the Turkish forces in Kermanshah. Acting in liaison with these forces was an assistant Military nttach6 of the German Legation in Tehran, who was gullible enough to suppose that he could hire Persian tribes to help stem a possible Russian advance from the north. Disregarding the warni?ig£ of Turkish officers who knew the orient, he handed out geld to Lurs and Bakhtiaris and Kurds in return for promises of help® Th_ moment a small Russian force appeared above the horizon the tribes vanished, gold and all, and the German Military Attach^ committed suicide. Even if British officials in Persia were not bound, as they are bound, by the declared policy of His Majesty 5 s Government to support the 'territorial integrity, sovereignty and political indepen Pence of Iran', their inherited knowledge ^f the East would prevent their falling into the pit into v/hich the German Military Attach^ fell?'

This recommendation, which was incomplete accord with the traditional policy of His Majesty’s Government to maintain the independence and integrity of Persia, was approved, and the signature of the Tripartite Treaty ir January 1942, whereby Persia became the ally of Great Britain and Russia, afforded yet another reason why His Majesty's Government should support the Persian Government and assist it to re-establish the influence which had been shaken by the entry of foreign troops into the country. That policy has been faithfully followed and will continue to be followed by His Majesty's Government and by all the British authorities concerned.mjc - 2 - NOTE ON TRIBAT POLICY.

Now that tribal landfaf beinfre- ' turned /3 turned to their former owners, I think that influential chief? should not, on the pretext of managing their estates, he permiuter to return and regain their former semi—autonomous positions. They should reside in places remote from their tribe and leave -ne r^nagement of their estates to agents. - (b) \s the tribes are now armed and as, especially in Kurd istan proper, they nourish feelings of hatred against the Government and its officials, it does not seem possible always to replace the chiefs by officials. The general tribal structure, though to some extent modified during the last few years remains, broadly speaking, /whole/ same; i.e., the chief and his family lording it over/the^tribe, ' ' while Kedkhudsffi or headmen, usually hereditary, control the tribal sub-divisions’or villages. In Fusht-i-Kuh, where the Governor, Colonel Mokry, has succeeded in maintaining order over a large col lection of armed and unruly tribes, the former ruling family and their retainers and ex-officials have been rigorously excluded. The responsibility for maintaining law and order has been placed on the leading Kedkhudas, so far with good results. It may be argued that there is little difference between keeping tribal chiefs in \ power and promoting Kedkhudas to look after the tribes. In prac tice, however, the ties of kinship which exist between the Kedkhudors and the tribesmen are a curb on oppressive or grasping proclivities. The chiefs and their families, however, belonging as they do to a higher social stratum, are not usually closely connected by kinship with the ordinary tribesman. They enforce their will by means of armed body-'uards and are less sentitive to the reactions of the tribe than Kedkhudars. Colonel Mokry’s policy is in fact democrat and has the advantage, from the point of view of the Government, ol distributing tribal power among a number of Kedkhudars instead of leaving it in the hands of one family. . (c) To sum up, my personal opinion is that the influence ul tribal chiefs should be gradually eliminated and that until the pre sent hostility of the average tribesman towards the Government changes, the tribes should be managed through their own Kedkhudars. The extent to which such a policy can be carried out varies in different locali ties. It has been done in Pusht-i-Kuh, but its application among the Kurdish tribes of the Sunni faith is more difficult and it seems that, short of general disarmament involving large-scale military operations (see paragraph 3 below), for some time control will have to be exercised through the local chiefs, unsatisfactory as they may be. For the same reason it seems to me that when Government of ficials are re-introduced into those parts of Kurdistan where they are at present not functioning* they will probably at first have to be Kurds (see paragraph 4(viii) below). 3. DISARMAMENT. The chief difficulty in the way of disarmament is that, in order to avoid large-scale military operations involving heavy ex pense and the possibility of repercussions ail over the country, did' \ armament must be piece-meal. This means that a tribe which has been totally disarmed is at the mercy of its armed neighbours ana is almost certain to be attacked and looted. It is, therefore, impossible to disarm one tribe totally while leaving the rest armedo Universal total disarmament also seems out of the question as large forces will be necessary and heavy expense will be involved. In order not to frighten the tribes and cause them to combine against the Government, the most that can be done at present seems to me the disarmament of tribes who by looting and raiding, have incurred the hostility of their neighbours, when dealing with such tribes, neigh bouring tribes, who have suffered from the depredations of the guilty tribe, can often be relied on to assist the Government. Admittedly disarmament would solve the tribal problem for, without arms, the chiefs would be powerless against the Government but, at present, it only /only seems to be possible to effect the disarmament of a few un popular tribes. 4. TRIBA L HOSTILITY TO'VARDS TH5 CtO VBRNM SNT AND ITS OFFICIALS. V \) The first question to be considered is whether it is, in fact, possible to change the present hostile attitude of the average tribesman towards the Crovernment, with the example of Pusht-i-Kuh in mind, where Colonel Mokry has earned the respect and affections of the population, I can, I think, assert that it is. Colonel Mokry has succeeded because he has treated the tribes with justice, sympathy and firmness and has attempted to ameliorate economic conditions. There is no reason why the appli cation of these principles should not succeed elsewhere, though admittedly the task of changing the tribal heart will be long and difficult, especially in Kurdistan proper where the religious dif ference is an additional barrier on the road to mutual understanding* ^s I have stated-in paragraph 1, the gradual elimination of the in fluence of the chiefs is an important factor. Other measures which will, in mv opinion, assist are as follows t- (0 a policy of deliberately inciting one tribe against another and of keeping open tribal quarrels and jealousies can in my Apinion never lead to peace. On the contrary, it causes perpetual unrest, increases tribal suspicions and diminishes the prestige of the (Government. If adopted, the day may arrive when the tribes may come to the conclusion that, as the G-ov- men+- can apparently only maintain the upper hand by using one tribe against another, they might do better to unite against the Government. The tribes are so di vided already that, if left alone, they seem unlikely ever effectively to unite. Hatred and fear of oppres- sivn and bad officials might cause them to do so. Policy should therefore aim at healing tribal quarrels and not inflaming them. Comment by H . M.Legation: :, It is quite true that a policy of inciting one tribe against another will never lead to a permanent peace. But the preservation of a balance of power in certain areas may be the only way open to the Persian Government at the present moment of keeping a temporary peace. And compare paragraph 3 on page 3 where it is suggested that one tribe should be used to help in the disarmament of another* In our opinion the Government can for the present only play for time, keep inter-tribal jealousies alive, and, when the Army is in better heart and better equipped, set about a properly coordinated series of disarmament operations. If one big tribe is successfully disarmed it is unlikely that there will be much opposition from the others. In the meantime the Government should spare no endeavour to convince the tribes that they intend to deal fairly with them. 5 ' (ii) (ii) As the tribes consider that military officers were responsible under Reza Shah for the worst wrongs and cruelties inflicted on them, their hatred of the army 's intense. It therefore seems to me that ther^ ..Oj. e chance of diminishing tribal hostility towards the Government if dealings with them are taken ouf* of I the hands of the military and put into those of the civil authorities. There will of course be exceptions to this. Colonel Mokry in Ham is one. On the whole, however, I think civil officials might stand a better chance of improving matters. The troops should only interfere in tribal affairs at the request of the civil authorities, when the situation is getting out of con trol. '7hen they do so, action should be swift and sharp, and time should not be wasted by lengthy negotiations and /5 jia If-hearted measures. It seems tant that the military should not and por dispates, as they sometimes do at particularly im- interfere in land present. (iii) present the bribes are getting practically no cloth or sugar. Such supplies as there are I go to the towns and'some of the larger villages. It seems important that the tribes should receive a share of available supplies. Cloth is particularly needed. In some of the remote parts of '7estern Persia, part icularly Pusht-i-Kuh, many of the women and children are almost naked. (iv) Assistance in agriculture is also badly needed and is almost non-existent. In aany areas seed is wanted, especially in remote parts of the district and among the more savage tribes, which are precisely the ones which should be encouraged to take to agri culture and give up raiding. The lease of crown lands to tribes has been carried out in the Kermanshah area and, it is hoped, may induce the tribe concerned to abandon its traditional habits of looting. The ad option of a few irrigation pro jects, for which I be- Imeve plans exist, would result In'a considerable in crease in cultivated land, and aicorresponding improve ment in economic conditions,, l/vjr Jc k 01AJ &gt;, * Ota.. (v) The treatment of the tribes by the officials of the Ceded’lands Department at Shahabad is not always judicious politically. Insistaneo on grazing dues on lands seized by the ex-Shah from the tribes, at a time v/hen the G-overnment is remitting such dues on public domains, causes resentment. Less is done for the people on these lands, now under Gov ernment management, than anywhere else. It seems to me to be in the interests of the local people and of economy that these lands should be fully restored to their tribal owners as soon as possible. The salaries of the officials will be saved and more wheat will be delivered to the Government, as there will otuLy be a few tribal landlords’'to deal with instead of about forty officials, who are afraid of the tribes and so are unable to bring pressure on them to deliver their wheat. (vi) Communications, especially in Kurdistan proper, are. very poor. Very little is being done to keep up existing roads from Senandaj to Marivan, Ker manshah to Rawansir and Paveh, Ilam to Mehran and Deh- luran, and Ilam to Chardavul and Shirvan. There are two fine uncompleted bridges on the Shahabad-Ilam- Mehran road. One near Ilam does not need much work to finish it. it is, it is, in its incomplete state, suffering from the effects of the weather. Postal and telegraphic communications are poor and are gradually deteriorating, especially in Ilam. steps to improve communications or at least to maintain existing roads would assist the tribes, especially those round Paveh who live by exporting the produce of their fruit gardens. (vii) There are at present hardly any educational facilities, especially in Kucdistan proper, i.e., in the area North of the Khanaqin-Kermanshah road and Test of the Kermanshah-Senandaj-Saqqiz road. Medical facilities, too, especially in the above-mentioned area /m a area are almost non-existent. A few schools and doc - are badly needed, especially the latter. Many of the tribesmen are afraid to come into centres ^ e shah for medical treatment even if they could afi ora . do so A few good doctors would go a long way to per suading the tribes that the Government really means to treat them well. (viii) In order to carry out measures of assistance on the lines indicated above it will be necessary to re-introduce officials into the area of Kurdistan des cribed in the preceding sub-paragraph. Owing to ^ ex pression and cruelty of the officials during the last r^o-ime, hatred of Persian officials is intense and then sudden re-introduction would very likely iead to armed resistence. General Shahbakhti managed to get the Kurds to cease rebelling by promising them certain concession.,, one of which was the right to have their own officialo. Is is important that nothing should be done which migh , construed as a breach of faith and it, therefore seems to me that at first local Kurds will ha/e.to be anointed to official posts, and those already in offic ial posts will have to remain. If, through failure to be just and impartial, they are unsatisfactory and arouse the dissatisfaction of the people, their replacement] .y Persian officials is not likely to arouse so much re- sistance as the sudden introduction of Persian officials, without first allowing local Kurds to see what they can do. I feel sure that, except perhaps for doctors, the Sunni tribes of Kurdistan proper are likely bitterly to resent the arrival of Persian officials, and to I 0 °K upon such a measure as a breach of faith, vnico they may well oppose by force. Comment by H.M.Legationi ’’Shahbakhti, we think, did agree tha t : certs-in triba 1 chiefs might run their own areas, e,g., Hama Rashid at Baneh, buu as we know it is a purely tribal organisation without any recognised Government officials in the ordinary sense, Kurd or otherwise -no representatives of the Kharbar or Finance etc,, - though we bel.ev. Hama Rashid has the title of Bakhshdar, ^ V/e are no believer^a in the appointment of local Kurds ,0 official nosts. This may be necessary to keep things quiet at any (price for^a period but we feel sure that it would not lead to good administration, where are the Kurds with the.necessary qualitieo t. be found? They must know something about their job -agriculture, revenue, education, hygiene. 4nd they must be impartial and loya to the Persian Government and ready to.subordinate the interests of their family to wider interests. Are there any such Kurds; Prom local Kurds one would have to select for official posts men of^in fluence - that i-s^ chief tains. Is there any hepe that Ghey would not Wtheir official position to- increase their own influence as chiefs ra-ther than as Government 'officials? And according go Col, Fletcher f 's .plan, they -ill do this., •• as the civil authorities have the. right to demand the intervention of tr-o-n^ - i supper^of their policies. 'Ve think every.;Kurd so far appointed to an official pos-_ ition has aroused jealousy and op;; osi uion.m- e.g*, Mahmud Kani3dan°n Qazi Muhammad. And if Kurdisb officials are to be appointed^ why not ^rab, F^shgai, Turkoman; One of the difficulties the Government has to contend with is /r * as Kurds/7 21 ; is the lack of good administrators for tribal areas. The administ rative centres are lonely and many of the ordinary amenities of life are lacking. It might be worth while to offer special allow ances to officials serving in such places,’’ (ix) There remains one other measure which, if it can be carried out with reasonable efficiency, should eo much to remove causes of quarrels and inter-tribal fighting. Many of the present inter-tribal squabbles . are due to disppfees over land. Many of the tribal chiefs are afraid to come to Kermanshah and, even if they are willing to come in, have not the money necessary to fin ance lengthy legal proceedings in the courts. There are in this district a few local notables, whose services are from time to time called in to arbitrate in land disputes. If a small board or panel of local arbitrat ors, who should be men commanding the confidence of the tribes, could be set-up, ^and if disputes could be re ferred to them for arbitration, a great deal of unneces sary inter-tribal fighting would be avoided. I do net mean that a formal arbitration committee should be set up, but that there should be a small body of arbitrators who should take in turns to arbitrate, i.e., in any given dispute there would be one arbitrator and not a committee, k long-standing quarrel between the jawanrud tribe and some local landlords, in the course of which the tribe forcibly ocoupied six villages, was settled by reference to an arbitrator of good reputation locally. Although his decision was against the tribe it has been respected. Had the ‘natter gone to the courts it would have dragged on for years and the villages would probably still be oc cupied by the tribe. The success of arbitration on the lines above depends on the honesty of the arbitrator and the degree of confidence he inspires. For this reason I think that local men, chosen by the tribes, would be better than, any committee composed of officials. In conclusion I would again like to state my conviction 5 that justice, sympathy and firmness will do much to remedy the pre- sentstate of affairs and that repression, unaccompanied by any measures to improve the welfare of the tribes, will not succeed. If the tribes feel that they are regarded as animals, they will behave like animals. Conversely, if treated as human beings they are likely to be more amenable to Government control. (3d.)

SUBJECT. ll 4^- PERSIA Report on the Bakhtiari Tribe by H«M« Consul Isfahan* Secretary of State 1 * FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. This extremely interesting,though somewhat unwieldy, report is an exhaustive survey of the Bakhtiari Tribe as it is now and should prove a useful work of reference for questions concerning this area* Mr, Gault has confined himself solely to facts and does not attempt to suggest solutions to the various tribal problems, - The first two chapters (pages 2 to 18) are concerned with the geography and communications in the area; useful map references are given at the end of the chapters and a detailed survey (pages 8 to 18) of thp road from Shalamzar to Masj id- i-Suleiman by Captain Kay of the Intelligence Corps, Advance G,S,I., is included. Two points emerge most clearly - firstly that this area is extremely well watered , and secondly that except at Izeh supplies everywhere are very scarce. Chapter III (pages 19 to 25) which should be read with Chapter VTII (pages 34 to 58) on tribal organisation and Chapter LX (pages 59 to 61) on the Khans, deals with the history of the Bakhtiari Tribe and explains many passages in Isfahan Consular Diaries which have hitherto been rather obscure, giving in a concise form the history of the long standing en^mity between the Chahar Lang and the Haft Lang, the story of the oil shares given to the Khans and of the enforced sale of their lands^as well as the previous record of Morteza Quli Khan at present Governor of Chahar Mahal and the Bhaktiari, (the area of his Govemorate is defined in Chapter IV, page 26), Chapter V/ (11844) Wt.29201/P.295 2,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd. Gp.685Chapter V, page 27, on the characteristics of the tribe is particularly interesting. Like Major Fletcher in his report on tribal policy in Kurdistan, Mr. Gault notes the increasing divergence between the Khans and the tribesmen , the former becoming more and more of a town goer &lt;L\k and the latter tending to look to their Kalantars for leadership. He emphasises both in this Chapter and in his sunning up in Chapter X (pages 62 and 63) that the tribesmen are not by nature trouble makers and that most of the disturbances in the past have been due to^£hgi jgjlitical aspirations of the Khans; these Irioesrafln have, however, bred a deep seated mistrust between the Bakhtiaris and the rest of Persia. Chapter VI (pages 30 and 31) endeavours to assess the military value of the tribesmen and gives details of the arms and anmunition believed to be in their possession. In Chapter VII (pages 32 and 33) their economic value is rated very low. Their chief asset, now that the development of motor transport has led to a decrease in the breeding of horses and mules, being their large flocks of sheep and goats from which, they supply the districts of Isfahan and Khuzistan with meat and wool. Mr. Gault's final conclusion is reassuring. He considers that there is unlikely to be any serious trouble with the Bhaktiaris as long as Morteza Quli Khan is in power and points out that the Khans are now very vulnerable to the Persian Government because they own rich land outside the tribal area. He is also of the opinion that both the Khans and the tribesmen are well disposed towards the British. For information. . #■CONTENTS, Preface.

U vi u ( o ^ 4 The Bakhtieri country is a mountainous area in south-west Persia bounded on the east by the districts of Semirum, Chahar Mahal and Pereidan; on the north by the Shuturan Kuh; on the west by the Trahs-Iranian Railway and the Ab-i-Diz; on the south by the plains of Khuzistan, the district of Behbehan and the Ab-i-Khirsan* On the west,too, it merges almost imperceptibly into tne tribal area of Luristar and on the south-east and south into the ^isnqai and KuhgiIn tribal areas. Generally speaking the area may be said to lie across the mountain system which divides the high plateau of central Persia from the plains of the Euphrates-Tigris basin. The general run of the various ranges of this mountain system is from the north-west co south-east and the ranges themselves vary from the foothills of Khuzistun to the high peaks of central B&amp;khtisri which r?.se to 14,000 ft. and more* The backbone of this mountain system is the Eardeh Kuh range, of which the Zardeh Kuh itself (14,950 ft. ) is the highest point and which terminates in the Shuturan Kuh peak (14&gt;200 ft.) to the north-west and in peaks of 11-12,dOO ft. in height to the souih-east. To the east of this range lies another of which the K&amp;ih-i-Rang (14,090 ft.) is the highest point, followed by several other lower ranges which run over into Chaha.r Mahal. ro the west of the main range are also several lesser ranges, becoming progressively lower until the foothills are reached in which the oil wells of the ^nglo-Iranian Oil Company lie. The whole area is wild and inaccessible and there are relatively few routes, which are passable only by nnimals. The mountains themselves are very steep and jagged. Because of the severity of the winter, during which snow lies for three to four months, and because of the natural inhospitability of these higher areas where rock and stony * ground predominate, the permanent inhabitants are very few. Indeed until the last ten years or so there were none,for the wandering tribes men only came up for the summer grazing for their flocks, returning across the mountains in the autumn to the warmer climate of Khuzistan. In the areas known to the Bakhtiari as Pusht Kuh (Ardal and Naghun) and Mian Kuh (Deh Diz and Dopulan)there are a number of villages permanently inhabited by Bakhtiari and the Sehdehistan or «^aneki Sardsir is also r settled area. The water supply is plentiful as would be expected in an area where there is always snow at the higher altitudes. Two of the chief rivers of Persia rise a few miles from one another in Bakhtiari- the Karun in the JSardeh Kuh with feed ers from the Kuh-i-Rang and the Zayandeh Rud also in the Kuh-i-Rang. The Karun, Persia^ most important waterway, runs westwards and after draining a large area of Bpkhtiari runs into the Shatt-el-Arab at Khorramshahr. The Zayandeh Rud drains a very mush smaller area of eastern Bakhtiari and Fereidan and then flows eastwards down to Isfahan, eventually losing itself in the Gavkhaneh salt lake east of Isfahan, The Karun itself has its source in a mighty spring in the east side of the main Zardeh Kuh ridge a few miles north of the Zardeh Kuh peak. This spring, which appears to be the outlet of some sort of underground lake produces / /a large(Z% r^ C.r CuvXQns g X. iVYiqc-^ofj Se\nerr.«. 3. &lt; 1 fu g8 ^ V0lume of water W ^ich gushes out of the mountain side i he A for !? of a doul3le waterfall of a total drop of about 70 feet. In September,1943 the flow was estimated at 2,100 litres a second. .About two miles from this s*u’th£&gt; ±ke Ka^it^ + ^ ^■u U ^ nn ^ PS e ^ so G fclieh here, receives an important tributary,the Khushab, which is fed from several springs in the south western slopes of the Kuh-i-Rang several^miles to tne north east and also from one or two other springs further along the Zardeh Kuh ridge, in the neighbourhood of the Haft ianan peak. .At the point of junction which lies in a gorge m the bed of the main valley there are to be seen the remains of a dam which was built (possibly never finished) in the reign of Shah .Abbas for the purpose of raising the leve^ of the river water to enable a portion of it to be turned through a cut, which was to be made in the Knrkunan range to the east, into the Zayandeh Rud to increase the supply of water for Isfahan. For the first part of its course the Karun flows south-east between the Zsrdeh Kuh and Kuh-i- Zarri ranges* It then turns south and cuts through the Z*rdeh Kuh range, at the same time receiving a tributary from the north-east which brings in the drainage from the greater part of the district of Chahar Mahal. It then zig zags through the mountains of south-eastern Bskhtiari receiving among other tributaries, the waters of the Ab-i- bnzuft (q.v. ) and the Ab-i-Khirsan which rises in the Kuhgilu country away to the south-east.* At its junction with the Ab- i-Khirsan the Aarun turns north-west end flows for some way in this direction.

Then instead of continuing to the bridge the ascent of GARDANEH-I-GATCHI is begun. This although not very long (the summit is 3&gt;500 ft. ) is steep and difficult. The path is paved with large slabs of rock and cobblestones, making it very slippery. A ravine is crossed halfway up and the path then follows its bed. The country is heavily wooded. There are also patches of gressy slopes. At the summit, which is reached at mile 6, there is a narrow pass with a fairly high solitary hill on the right and a line of cliffs on the left. The descent is steep at first, but becomes easier, the path winding itself along the. sides of the hill slopes. A nearly dry stream (pools of water) is crossed at the bottom of the descent and another, very easy ascent is begun. The path follows the stream bed through a gorge known as TANG-I-KAP rising gradually. At 9 miles reach the tuins of ^ALEH MADRAS3EH OZ8197; this is an ancient caravanserai mentioned in his travels by the famous Arab Historian IBN BATUTA. There are also 2 newer buildings in fair state of preservation, but abandoned. They served as a gendarmerie post. The road swings sharply right and follows another gorge, narrower and steeper than the preceding one; it is known as Tang-i-&gt;=ileh Madrasseh. In places on left side it is flanked by absolutely perpendicular cliffs. A fairly good spring (Chashmeh-i-Khatun) is passed at mile 12. The path is along the dry bed of a mountain torrent crossing and recrossing it several times. Soon after the ascent of GARDANEH-1- SULTAN I commences. The roadway is paved with cobblestones and occasionally large slabs of rock, making it very slippery and difficult even though the gradients are not very severe. This road way which has been paved and kept up for hundreds of years is known as RAH-I- S7LTANI. The summit (4,200 ft.) is reached at mile 14 and there is a very short and gentle descent to a wide, undulating plateau about 3 miles^JLong and 4 miles wide. Trees disappear here and the country is rather barren with occasional grassy patches. Road crosses the plateau ascending very slightly, reaching the summit of Gardaneh-i-SARRAK (4,050 ft. ) at approx. 17 miles. The descent is long (2j miles), fairly steep in places, twisting and very slippery being paved with large slabs of rock and cobblestones. There is a beautiful view of IZ3H plain, but IZEH itself is not seen, being hidden by KUH-I-ISHGU* one of the spurs of KUH-I-MUNGASHT. The plain is reached at 19o miles* It is very wide, irregular in shape with several spurs of KUH-I-MUNGASHT jutting out. The road which is now wide, quite good and easily motorable in dry weather rounds the KUH-1-ISHGIL at mile 22 and proceeding in S. T F. direction reaches IZEH at mile 26. IZEH (MALAMIR) oU5903.

Road wide but very muddy (after 2 days rain) and going heavy. Lake SHAT-I- MANGAR is reached at 2 miles; it is about 1 mile on the right. There is a fair amount of cultivation^ the plain is very fertile in years with a good rainfall. Several villages are situated on the outskirts of the plain in the foothills. Start ascending very slightly at 4 miles the road becoming stonier and harder. RASWAND OU5406 is reached at mile 5^. It is a small, clean village; most of the houses are new, the village having been rebuilt recently. Turn west and descent into a steep nullah, cross this and begin an easy ascent over a col(Gerdaneh-i- Raswand). Curious shaped Imamzadeh bear the summit at 6 miles. This has also been renovated recently. Road descends slightly over a small plateau, turns south-west and at 7-g- miles crosses another col (Gardaneh-i-LAPAN). Descent is very rocky,long slippery in parts but not steep and on the whole easy. The path follows a small stream along a very narrow gorge cut through low hills. Reach a fairly wide plain at about 9 miles with several villages dotted around. Considerable cultivation,many gardens. At 10 miles cross Ab-i-NOWTARKI by a good ford; considerable river liable to sudden,heavy floods. There is apparently a yearly loss of life due to this. 5 children were drowned on the day previous to party*s passage. Village of NOWTARKI OZ4699 is reached at 12 miles. Rather attractive and clean with a fine half-ruined fort on a mound and ruins of a very large caravanserai. Population of the area - about 1,000. Water is excellent and plentiful from the river, qanats and aprings nearby. Considerable cultivation of wheat, barley and rice. Some fruits. No large flocks. As everywhere in the B^khtiari country the villagers make rugs and carpets. Leaving NOWTARKI the road is over a level plain for the first 3^- miles: it then descends into a bowl like depression covered with hj11- -'ocks, some of extremely regular conical shape. Road or rpthei path is descending all the time but there are occasional short ascents and descents, some very steep and rocky. The path is extremely narrow and ill defined, in places disappearing complete Several water course are crossed; one of them contained water. A considerable river is crossed at mile 23.

Very steep, tortuous and difficult ascent of about ^ mile to a plateau over 500 ft. above the stream bed follows. Peered with small hillocks, has a very deep stream gorge on the left, with escarpment beyond and a very massive me of cliffs at least 750 ft. high on the right. The path, very rough and stony goes oyer the plateau for the next 3 miles. It narrows gradually, the hills on both sides coming in. There are several ascents and descents, some very steep, 2 water courses are crossed end a very rocky bed of mountain torrent.

The ford # over the middle stream is not too good with soft bottom. Tater n0X ^ ^ miles are probably the most trying of the whole route. The path crosses at least 5 ranges of high hills; ascents and descents are very steep, rocky and difficult. In places there is no path at all as it has been washed away by heavy rains. The path after crossing one range, doubles back n the o^her side until it begins to ascend the next range and so on. Several streams and one fair sized river are ddresed.

One of the descendants of this chief had two families, of seven and of four sons respectively, who on the father’s death fell into dispute for supremacy within the tribe. This split has lasted until ihe present for the trihe is divided into two septs, the Haft Lang (seven feet) and the Chahar Lang (four feet) which are not on good terms with one another. Another version is that the division into seven and four represents the traditional assessment of military contribution by the tribe in former times, the Haft Lang, the poorer section, only having to give one seventh of their property, while the Chaher Lang being richer, having more villages and agricultural wealth, paid one fourth of their wealth. About 1840 Mohamed Taqi Khan, of the Kianersi tribe of the Chahar Lang sept, and a direct descendant of Rashid Khan and Ali Mardan.h Khan already mentioned, had risen to a commanding position of influence in the Bakhtiari tribe. He became head not only of his own tribe, but also of the Janeki Oarmsir section, which was a more important tribal unit, and carried with it the titular headship of the whole of the Chahar Lang. Indeed he became recognised as chief even by some of the Haft Lang tribes and by some of the Peili and Kuhgilu lars. His headquarters wore at ^aloh TuJ. Layard considered him an enlightened and just ruler. His importance, however, was displeasing to the Shah, Mohamed Ali, who sent an army against him. His family were seized by a trick and he himself finally surrendered against a guarantee of safety sworn upon the Quran. The Shah and his government did not adhere to the guarantee and Mohamed Taqi Khan was imprisoned in Tehran where he died in 1851. His next male relatives either suffered a similar fate or were killed out of hand. The Chahar Lang have never recovered from this blow and since that time have always remained of secondary importance to the Haft Lang. On the fall of Mohamed Taqi Knan of the Chahar Lang, Jafar Quli Khan of the Haft Lang, son of the As’ad Khan who has been mentioned, was appointed chief of the tribe or Ilkhani. In order to reach this position he had killed his brother and thirteen other of his relatives. As the result of hostilities with the government, which was, however, unable to subdue him, he fled and was replaced by Kalb Ali of the Duraki tribe of the Haft Lang. About 1850, Jafar’s son, Hussein Quli Khan,killed Kf&gt;lb Ali and became Ilkhani. a He ruled the tribe for thirty years and showed himself/wise and enlightened ruler. Like Mohamed Taqi Khan, however, his greatness did not please Tehran and in June,1882, while he was being enter tained in Isfahan by the Prince-Governor, the Zill-es- Sultan, eldest son of Nasir-ed-Din Shah, in return for hospitality shown the Zill in Bakhtiari, he was either strangled or poisoned by order of his host, who claimed to be acting on his father’s instructions. At the same time his eldest son, 3sfandiar Khan, was imprisoned. Hussein Quli Khan was replaced as Ilkhani, by his next /brother,Trr-othrr, Im^ra lali Khan? while .^he office of Ilbegi, or recoup min la tea tribe., wry given to another brother, Rezo. Rnli ICha.i. T-iesa vwc post a* IlRhem and Ilbegi, always existing* had for r.;any % ears now 'been filled by government ippoir:tiaont, os was another, that of Hakim (governor) of Chahai Cahsl. which though net o tribal area at that time formed part of the Bakhtiari country because the leading Bakntiari xamilies owned much land there. In 1883, the Zili- -es-Su3tan fell from favour with his father. This resulted in the release from prison of ‘Zsfnndiar Khan, son of the late Ilknnni, while his uncle, Imam ~jnli Khan was deposed and Reza Rpli Khan was made Ilkhani with Hsfandiar Khan as Ilbegi. Imam Ruli Klian refused to accept the government’s edict and had to be evicted by Reza Quli Khan and Usfandiar Khr?n assisted by Persian troops who attacked him at Ohaqakhor, the summer camp of the Ilkhani and of a part of the Haft Lang. As a result of this action Esfandiar Khan was given the title of 5amsam-es-Saltaneh, (Sword of the State) by the Shah, In 1890 another change took place when Imam Quli Khan was reinstated as Ilkhani, Esfandiar Khan remaining as Ilbegi and Reza '2uli Khan became Hakim of Chahar Mahal. Out of the killing of Hussein ^uli Khan, who is still spoken of as ’the late'Ilkhani’ by the older khans, and of the consequent jealousy between his descendants and the family of Imam quli Khan, who succeeded him and who was known as 'the Haji Ilkhani’ from having made the pilgrim -age to Mecca soon after his appointment as Ilkhani, has arisen the,other great rift in the Bakhtiari tribe and one which, although it only concerns the Haft Lang sept, is of much greater importance even today than the rivalry between Chahar Lang and Haft Lang. This is the rift between what are now known as the Haji Ilkhani families and the Ilkhani families of the khans. In view of this rivalry, often, in fact, usually, amounting to hatred, it became the custom after a time that the offices of Ilkhani and Ilbegi should never be held by members of the same side of the family. Thus if one of the Ilkhani khans were Ilkhani one of the Haji Ilkhani Khans would be Ilbegi (the governorship of Chahar Mahal does not seem to have been involved in this). This arrangement was strictly adhered to up to 1933 or so when the two posts were abolished by Reza Shah and Brkhtiari was finally divided up among the civil administrative districts of Khuzistan and Isfahan. Prom 1890 onwards no grept change has come over Bakhtieri tribal politics. The Chahar Lang gradually declined into complete though somewhat unwilling subservience to the Haft Lang, a process which was helped by inter marriage between the khans. The Ukhani-Haji Ilkhani feud has however continued undiminshed to the present day, in spite of much inter-mprriage. After the constitutional movement in Persia in 1906 certain of the Bakhtiari Khans, notably the’great* Sardar As’ad (the father of the Sardar As’ad who was poisoned by Feza Shah in 1934) and his sons and Samsam-rs- Saltaneh, took the side of the reformers against the reactionary forces grouped round Mohamed Ali Shah. In 1909 a Bakhtiari force under Sardar As’ad lay before Tehran and helped tp enforce the abdication of the unpopular /Mohane1pr’ soner 'by cur forces near the Karkheh river in western Luristan s id interned for a year. The great point of importance to us was of course the Mglo-Persisn Oil Company s enterprise in the neighbourhood of liasjid-i- 8 uleiman which ' Vhad to carry on its work at all costs. This end was event ually secured 'by Dr, Young of the Company who in 1915 secured a ;from certain of the khans that they protect the oilnelds. The following year, because of British reverses in Mesopotamia, the pro-German Bakhtiari faction began to threaten the oil-field and the British and Russian communities were forced to evacuate Isfahan, because of German pressure. In Isfahan the situation could only be i:estored by the arrival of a Russian Cossack force from the north and later by the arrival of Brigadier-General Sykes’ column from Kerman. The chief Khans who definitely identi fied themselves with the Germans during the Great War were Salar A’zam, Sardar Muazzam, Bahadur-as-Seltoneh, (these three are still living) Salar Mas’ood, Zergham-as-Sa^taneh and Bibi Mariam (daughter of Hussein Quli Khan -’The Ilkhani' 1 ). I Those whom we regarded as secretly favouring the German cause were Morteza 'Juli Khan and Amir Mofakham, who are both still alive. In 1918 Samsam-as-Saltaneh again became Prime Minister with a cabinet generally unfriendly to us. Prom this time on Bakhtiari influence in Tehran and in the govern ment began to wane. In 1921 the khans lost the governorships of Kerman and Yezd and in 1922 with the loss of the governor ship of Isfahan, they ceased to hold any such posts at all. The khans fell further into disfavour as a result of an attack at Shalil by tribesmen on a column of Persian troops moving down*the Bakhtiari road from Isfahan to Khuzistan. The fault really lay with the Kuhgilu tribes who normally raid the Bakhtiari road in that area, but the Bakhtiari Khans were blamed as having instigated the affair. Later they led a punitive force against the Kuhgilu on behalf of the government. In 1923 Reza Khan, Sardar Sepah, who was later to make himself Shah and was then Minister of War, split the khans by setting Sardar As*ad, Amir Jang and Sardar Mohtashem against the other khans. He also withdrew their traditional right to be accompanied wherever they went by armed retainers. Internal quarrels and disputes v/ith the government over revenue matters, sowed further dissension among them which weakened their general position greatly. At the same time Reza Khan separated the Pereidan Chahar Lang area from the Haft Lang, subdued the tribes by force and made it an independent administrative district. The separation of the Janeki Garmsir area followed. In 1929 trouble broke out in Bakhtiari. Originally caused by the dissatisfaction of some of the younger khans with their elders it eventually necessitated the intervention of govern ment troops and thus took on the form of a rebellion against the government. The chief participants were the Zarrasvand sub-tribe of the Haft Lang under Sardar Iqbal, Sardar Fateh and others and a section of the Chahar Lang under All Mardan Khan. The disturbances eventually ended v/ith the submission of the leaders. Sardar Iqbal, Sardar Pateh and Ali Mardan Khan were executed. This was the final flare-up of Bakhtiari power under Reza Shah who had now broken the influence of the Khans. The posts of Ilkhani and Ilbegi /still24 . rtill remained, being now filled by Amir Mofakham and Ncrteza ^uli Khan but in 1933 even these were abolished rnd Morteza 7J-li was made simple governor of Bakhtiari vntil he too was recalled in 1936 and the Bakhtiari area vas divided between the provinces of Khuzisten £oth Ustaii under a Governor-General at Ahwaz) and Isfahan (10th Ustan under a Governor at Isfahan). Previously to this the districts of Chahar Mahal and Sehdehistan (Janeki Sardsir) had also been lopped from the Bekhtieri governorate. In 1933, presumably from fear of renewd intrigue by the Khans, Raza Gheh suddenly imprisoned Sardar As^d, at the time Minister of Tar, and sixteen other Khans. Sardar As’ad was executed (by injection of poison) in the spring of 1934 and the others condemned to terms of imprisonment varying f a life sentence to a few months. Amir Mujahid and Khan Bab* Khan a brother of Sardar As*ad, died in prison. In 1938 and 1939 the Persian Government forced those Khans who were i in prison to sell their properties in Chahar Mahal and Khuzistan, either to the Government or to individuals(non- Bakhtiari^. Certain other khans, not in prison, were also pressed to sell their lands but most of them,notably Morteza 3uli Khan, managed to avoid actually doing so. At the same time the khans as a whole were forced to sell to the Government their holding of shares in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. At the present time the Khans ere trying hard to recover their lands but so far without success. Early in 1942 there was also much agitation among them for the return of their oil shares, but that has now(1944) ceased. The land question however is outstanding end as long as it so remains will be a genuine cause of dissatisfaction and even unrest among the khans. In 1941, Reza Shah again took fright at reported Bakhtiari intrigues in Isfahan and had a number of khans arrested there. They were imprisoned ffcr some months and then set free. On the abdication of Rezn Shah and the Allies* entry into Persia in 1941 those khans who were still in prison were released. j.-* In the winter of 1941-42 the khans in Tehran decided to try to recover their former position and sent out Nadir ^ili Khan, one of the younger khans, to make trouble in Bakhtiari. In the spring of 1942 Abul qpsim Khan, a son of Amir Mofakham, left Tehran with several khans of the Boir Ahmedi section of the Kuhgilu Lurs and, having reached the Janeki Sardsir (Sehdehistan) also set up as a rebel against the authority of the government. In the early summer both surrendered to General Zahidi, Persian commander at Isfahan, who promptly sent Abul G^sim Khan back to Bakhtiari with the vague post of'representative of the Persian army in Bakhtiari', As Abul 'lasim Khan was of the Haji Ilkheni section of the family, the Ilkhani section, their rivals, were allowed to send Manuchehr As*ad as joint representative. By the end of the autumn it became clear that General Zahidi was in contact with the Germans in the Caucasus and else where and he was arrested by us. On this Manuchehr As * ad returned to Isfahan where he has since remained, but Abul Qasira Khan withdrew to the heart of Bakht iari-Ardal- and refused to leave it. There he declared himself as /responsibleA' 25. rjTponsi'ble for the control of Bakhtieri pnd sought to heve hxTUbelf recognised hy the government pnd hy us ns p tribnl le^uer. His foT^owers caused much loss to the fertile and rich district of Chahar Mnhel hj/ continual robbery. His iiouteant, Ali Asghar Khan, attacked the Persian garrison ac Izeh in the spring of 1943 and disarmed it, thus securing about 150 Brno rifles and several mehine guns. He finally surrendered to Creneral Jahahboni, Persian G. 0. C. Southern Forces in August 1945. There is considerable evidence to show that Abul &gt;sim Khan was in relations with the Fifth Column in Persia and that he had harboured German agents. He js now (February 1944) living in Tehran. Meanwhile in an effort to eliminate Abul S*sim Khan from Bakhtiari and to bring peace to the area, the Persian Government had, in the early summer of 1943, appointed Morteza Quli Khan of the Ilkhrni family (aged 67), the youngest and the most active of the three oldest Khans-Amir Mofakham and Sardar Mohtashem are the other two- to be governor of Chaher Mahal and Bakhtiari with fairly wide powers. Morteza Buli Khan succeeded in bringing about tne surrender of Abul 'ijasim Khan and now (February 1944) the latter f s inlluence may be said virtually to heve disappeared. Bakhtiari as a whole is quiet, except for intrigues by the Hrji Ilkhani khans against I Morteza 'Bull Khan and his family. Note. In August, 1942,R.C.S.Harris,British Vice-Consul at Isfahan,accompanied by Dr. Griffiths of the Church Missionary Society Hospital,Isfahan,who had with him his small son aged II,were ambushed and shot while travelling along the south side of the Ushturan Kuh. The murders were committed by members of the Hivedi sub-tribe of the Chahar Lang Mamivand,it is believed at the instigation of German agents. The murders went unpunished. Note. For some months in 1941 &amp; 1942 Abul Khan was Governor of Kashan.CHAPTER IV 26. THE EAirifTT A RI GOVERN OR ATE The B^Khur'.Bri governornoe originpi ly comprised whole area inh-i'hitea *by the Hoft Lpng and Chahar Lang sections ex' the trite hoth in summer and in winter with the district, of Chahar Mahal, west of Isfahan. It prohahly also j.ncluded lands owned by the khans in Khuzistan (near D'’zfui and Lenhehan) huT: lying outside actual tribal areas. The district of the Sehdehistan (Lurdekan, Pelart and Khan- i-Mir?:fj or Janeki sardsir and the area inhabited by the Babmei trxbe of the Ruhgilu Lurs also fell within Bakhtiari jurisdiction. This continued until about 192b when first the Forex dan jhahar Lang area, then the Janeki Garmsir (Giiahar Lang) areas were, taken away and given to non-Bakhtieri governors. Lator the Sehdehistan Bahmei and Chahar Mahal areas were also taken away and finally, in 1936, the Bakhtiari governorate disappeared altogether, the western parts being incorporated in the 6 th Ustan (Governor-General f s province) under the Governor-General at Ahwez and the eastern parts becoming part of the 10th Ustan with its head quarters at Isfahan. Early in 1942 there were civil Vice- Governors, under Isfahan, at Shahr Kurd (Chahar Mahal), Ardal (Pusht Kuh) and Lurdekan (Sehdehistan). There were also civil Vice-Governors at Masjid-i-Suleiman, Haft Kel and Izeh in the 6 th Ustan under Ahwaz. On the appointment of Morteza ^uli Khan as Governor of Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari in the summer of 1943 a new Bakhtiari governorate was created. Geographically speaking it includes Chahar Mahal district west of Isfahan and, for Bakhtiari proper, an area bounded in the north by a line * in about latitude 32o 45* joining the bend of the Zayandeh Rud river where it divides Fereidan from Chahar Mahal and the Ab--i~Diz at laleh Ab—i-Diz; on the west by a line including Mpsjid-i-Suleiman, and Haft Kel (not Ram Hormuz); in the south by a line along the Ab-i-Ala, includ ing Talavar and along the Ab-i-Khirsan to Felart; in the east by Semirum district and Chahar Mahal, but in fact as some of the tribes have their summer quarters outside the area, Morteza Quli Khan‘s influence extends beyond his specified boundaries. Morteza Qhli Khan has put his own nominees in as Vice-Governors in the greater part of his governorate. For tribal matters he is independant of Ahwaz or Isfahan and refers direct to the central Government, while for questions of departmental routine he deals with ithe Oovernor-General or military commanders in Ahwaz or Isfahan, according to whether he is in the 'garmsir* or the 1 sardsir *.27. pp tTV* 0 ' CHAPTER V CHAR ACTERI ST IQ ^__ The Bnkhtiari trilDe today consists of two well- s^r;.:r?o^.nr;;K“r;“S3 a „ a more a comfortable e than 8 that 0/0 tribesmen, the kh^ns have younger S lchans have much real influence in the tribe Proper. This spUt was accentuated too by the policy of Reza Shah kee^in^ tribal leaders who might have been potential dangers to him in Tehran and elsewhere free n ■Drison. In fact it can now be said that the. average Bakhtiari Khan is more of a town-dweller than a tribesman. Of course some of the more hot-headed younger khans, such as Abul 'lasim Khan, dream of a return to the old days of Bakhtisri glory of thirty years ago when the B^-chtiari khan with his tribesmen at his back was a power in land, but the present Governor-of Bakhtian, Morteza Khan appears to have set his face against such ideas. This '•division which has grown up between Khan and tribesman has moreover been extremely beneficial in thrt it hns allowed the tribesmen who is not by nnture p trouble-seeser, to to his own way without being obliged by tribal nnstora wsste his time serving as a tribal irregular at ^he bidding n-r hi r khnn. There is no doubt that those triDai disturbances which have taken place during the twenty years have been fomented not by the tribesmen, but ty the Khans to further their own limitea political ends. Unfortun ately the Bnkhtiari Khan tends to live mthe past and to look back to the days of his greatness and fa ™ ° f J*®® renlise thnt these days have gone for ever. The Khan is, as p rule, not very popular with the tribesmen, because he is so apt to run them into trouble with the Government over political questions which are of no interest to }; he men but only to the Khan. On the other hand the tribesman has no reason to love the officials, or roi.-itsry. Rant bv the central government to rule him. sent ny ac tivities of the khans, too, have led them and all Bakhtiaris to be regarded by tne ordinary Persian, be he villager or townsman, with deep suspicion and mistrust. There is no doubt that the Bakhtiaris ^ V0 9 bad past, but it is none the less unfortunate that there should be this gulf between the Bakhtiari (or any °^ er Persian tribesman) and the rest of the inhabitants , Persia, for it has led the Bakhtiari to regard everyone s hand as against him and to make him disgruntled and more than otherwise likely to refuse to co-operate with other /Persians28 Persians and with the Persian Government, He will not even co-operate with his fellow Bakhtiaris. It has also had the result of making him of everybody and especially of Persian officials, suspicious and therefore unnecessar ily difficult to deal with. If a wise Prime Minister or Minister of '’Tar were to realise this fact and do something to overcome this inbred distrust, there would be far less tribal trouble in Persia. This suspicion of others makes dealing with tne average Bakhtinri very uncertain and leads him into evasion and what we should call crooked dealing. A typical Bakhtiari Khan trick is for the senior khans, say in Tehran, to send one or more of the young khans into Bakhtiari with secret instructions to stir up trouble what’’ time the seniors, when requested by the Government to control their juniors, often their own sons, pretend that they strongly disapprove of the disorders, but that they have no control over the trouble makers. Or they may offer to check the trouble in return for concessions or appointments given them by the Government. On the other hand the Bakhtiari is extremely hospitable and can be a pleasant companion provided there is no suspicion in his mind of one’s motives. His character is in many ways more attractive than that of the average Persian. . On the whole the khans are well-off financially as most of them own land in Ohahar Mahal and in Khuzistan. A few have squandered inherited fortunes and are now poor but they ere the minority. The tribesman is probably on the whole reasonably well-off, too, by virtue of the proceeds of his sales of wool, sheep-fat, cheese,milk,etc. But his life is a hard one and was, under Reza Shah, made much harder than it need have been by the oppression of the military governors set over most of Bakhtiari during that time and by the greed of any army officers who were sent on missions to the Bakhtiari. He has been completely neglected by the Government. As a man the Bakhtiari tribesman, is provided he is physically sound, which with his increasing contact with the Persian brand of civilisation is unfortunately not always the case, of great endurance, energetic and, by Persian standards, courageous. He is not always trust worthy and is greedy for money. Traditionally a shepherd he does grow a small amount of wheat and barley in certain areas, for his own consumption. But his main wealth is in his sheep and goats. Horses and mules are bred but to a decreasing extent and large numbers are not to be found now. He speaks his own dialect of Persian which is similar in many respects to the Lurish and Kurdish dialects spoken by the tribes in those parts of Persia. He is a Shia Moslem end not notably religious. He still wears the traditional Bakhtiari bulbous felt cap, brown or black in colour, and the very wide cotton trousers ’showier 1 i Bug instead of the old long coat’qaba* -- and voluminous waist band he now usually wears a Hluropean style jacket and leather belt. The khans used to wear white felt caps but only a few of the young men do so still. Most /of themMost of them wear ordinary European style clothes even in Bakhtiari and this is encouraged hy the present Governor, Morteza lili Khan, The tribeswomen still hold -to their traditional crese-o They unveiled. -black goats 5 hair tent - '“bohoon' - is still the no tic.! us dwelling• Under the governorship of Morteza ^li Khan up to 1936 considerable progress was made in settling the tribe in permanent villages, but with the disturbances of 1941 and 1949 much of this work was undone. Some of the stone built villages were deliberately destroyed by Abul 'lasim in 1942.CHAPTER VI 30 MILITA RY VALUE. The military value of the Bakhtiari tribe is, Ty modern standards of warfare, lov/* Trihesmen would only he of use in their own area, under their own leaders and against their own kind. They are only accustomed to their own style of warfare which consists in direct attack, either on foot or mounted, on any opposing force. If the first charge fails the Bakhtiari warrior quickly hecomes discouraged while inactivity in the course of a campaign also rapidly reduces his ardour. Reza Shah confiscated most of the arms held by the Haft Lang Bakhtiari and some of those held by the Chahar Lang, A quantity of Government rifles certainly found their Sway into the tribe after the collapse of the Persian army on the entry of allied troops into Persia in September,1941. Later, Brno rifles were distributed to certain Khans by the Fifth Column and other rifles were bought in the open market. At present (February 1944) rifles are very deer, a Brno costing from 1800 to 2000 tomans (£130-5150) which must limit the buying of arms to some extent. An informed estimate of the present weapon situation in the Haft Lang Bakhtiari in January,1944, is that there are about 1,100 unlicensed rifles in the hands of tribesmen. 250 of these are Brno rifles and the rest Label 3-shot with a few Lee- Enfield, Mauser and Mannlicher sporting rifles. Martini single shot and Verndl weapons. Nearly half of these rifles are in the hands of the settled Bakhtiari in the Janeki Sardsir area. In addition Morteza 'iili Khan, Governor of Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari, was given 150 Lebel rifles by the Government on his taking up his post in 1943. It is unlikely that there is any large supply of ammunition. There is also a small number of light machine guns in the hands of the followers of Ali Asghar Khan who captured them from the Persian army at Izeh in the spring of 1943. Machine guns however are of little use to tribesmen. They do not know how to work them and they use up too much ammun ition. As regards fighting men it is estimated that a force of perhaps 8,000 armed and unarmed could be collected from the Haft Lang if this were done through the intermediary of a leader who was popular in the tribe. Of these 2,500 would be horsemen and 5,500 on foot. As regards Chahar Lang armaments available information gives the Mahhmoudsaleh 200 rifles, the Mamivand confederation 3,150, distributed as follows;- Zallaqi 400, Muguhi 500, Bushaq 500, Isivand 200, Salarvand 100, Qoid Khan Jamali 50, Hajivand 300, Hivedi 300(?), migratory Abdulvand 300. The Chaharbari and Asteraki are reputed to have about 500 rifles between them. These weapons are mixed Brno, Lebel, Lee Enfields and others and ammunition is probably on the whole short especially for the cider kinds. It may be said that at least as many fighting men as there are rifles could be collected from these tribes. The Chahar Lang Kienersi and Janeki Garmsir have /aboutabout 120 rifles of older types and could probably put about 250 horse arid foot at Government; $qrvice* The total estimated rjfle strength of the entire Balchtiari tribe is therefore 4/'20, It should be emphasized that this figure may be wide of the mark as it is impossible accurately to chtck information of this type. j '33 Bakhtieri,except in settled areas perhaps,pre much under populated and,were there more labour available in vhese areas for agricultural work,the useful yield of the land could be enormously increased, •‘■he settled arers rre in general fairly well populated but the population is con centrated. Shaxsxisxii There is little pursuit of industry in the Bakhtiari tribe. The coarse black woollen cloth used for making trib al tents is woven by the tribespeople who also make similar stuffs and coarse rugs for floor coverings for their own use. There is no carpet industry in the Bakhtinri tribe such as there is in the '^ashqai.* On the whole it may be said that,compared with the position before the Great ITar, the economic situation-end therefore the economic value-of the Bakhtiari tribe is am much less important now. .At that time men and animels- horses,mules &amp; sheep-were the tribe’s great assets. Now sheep and their products make up the bulk of the wealth of the tribe.This result has been mainly caused by Reaa Shah’s policy of breaking the political power of the tribes in general in the execution of which his officials,military and civi 1 ,oppressed the tribesmen heavily-and also by his attempt in the sourse of the last decade to enforce the settlement of the nomadis tribes in permanent dwellings either in the summer or in the winter quarters and in either case in unsuitable positions. This resulted in considerable'loss of human and animal life either from excess of heat or from excess of cold and was a serious blow to the Bakhtiari from which they have not yet re covered. *Note. What are generally known in Persia as ’Bskhtiari* carpets or rugs,usually with a pattern in squares, were,and still are,made in the villages of Ghahar wphal, either for order of the khans or for the trade. They are not made by the tribe. / »Both Haft Lang and Ghahar Lang aepts are sub-divided into many smaller tribal divisions which in turn are divided into tj rehs * In the appendices to this chapter will be found lists of the divisions and subdivisions rnd of the i.-.ft Lang and of the Chahar Lang septs with details of the numbers in each and of its winter and summer quarters. It —v should be borne in mind that the figures given are only approximate and that, in the case of the names of the winter and summer quarters, the district round each place given is meant.and not simply the village or point itself. A nomad tribe is rarely to be found concentrated in one spot but is more likely to be scattered over many miles of country. The question of the military value of the rribes is treated in a separate chapter. In addition to the lists of tribal divisions, ^ family trees are also given of the leading Haft Lang* and Chahar Lang Khans. Note. There are living in Isfahan a few thousand Bakhtiaris who have for various reasons left their tribal life. In Isfahan they are k^own as the f Bidabpdi Uirs’ from the district of the town which most of them inhabit. They are of a very low class but still speak the Bakhtiari dialect among themselves and in formor days when the Governor-General of Isfahan was a Bakhtinri Khan he used to obtain a number of his sowars from these town dwelling Bakhtiaris. They are said to have come mainly from the Mowri section of the Duraki sub-tribe of the Haft Lang. Note . Among the nomadic sections of the Bakhtiari there are no schools or provision for education of any sort. Neither are there any medical facilities^ In the settled areas there are a few ’mnktabs* or religious schools end,here and there,a doctor of sorts,but there is no organised medical service whatever in these remote areas.i.

In the 18th century Rashid Khan Kianersi (see family tree) quarrelled with the Chahar Lang Mahmoud Saleh and the Kianersi were driven out. The tribe moved to the ^leh Tul area, furth south, wnere it found the Janeki tribe which was an offshoot of the Kuhgilu confederation. Mohamed Taqi Khan (see family tree) was made Ilkhani of all the Chahar Lang in 1840 ( see Chapter 111) and his brother was made Ilbegi. It seems probable th^t in fact his authority was comparatively restricted although in theory wide and that this is the basis for the Haft Lang contention that he was never their rightful Ilkhani. On the downfall of M*hnnie&lt;P Tpqi: Ifheifc the Kianersi tribe disintegrated and has remained ir that state. Some sections are still living in Khuzistan, but only about 60 families. Others are to be found at Auragun on the southern edge of the Chnhar Lang winter quarters and some are settled in Isfahan.

MardanI’s bro ther, Ali Mardan Khan,was involved in the Bakhtiari ’revolt’ in 1929 and was afterwards executed. At that time Shuja’i was on the Government side-his father had been Ilkhani of the Chahar Lang under Reza Shah and he himself was also Ilkhani for a time. Both are untrust worthy individuals. Mardani,by virtue df his relation ship through his mother, Bibi Mariam,is at present sup ported by Morteza Suli Khan.60 greybeards,Amir Mofakham,aged 87,Serdar Mohtosham,aged 85 l^brteza ^Juli aQian,p£ed 67, the two first are so old that they are now incapable of any active participation in i tribal affairs exceot in the way of intrigue. Morteza ^li Khanis at present Governor of Bakhtiari (not IlKhani) and still has the physical and cental energy to be able to deal with tribal politics. Alter these three there is Amir Jang,deputy in the I4th. Majlis for Dizful,but his reput- younger khans there is Ahmad '}uli khan, eldest son of Mor- teza Quli * w han, who, though rotner colourless, is deputy for Shahr Kurd and Bnkhtiari,and his brothers Jahanshah Khan and Amir Bahman Khan. The former of these has considerable tribal experience and is respected; the latter is much less experienced and has the reputation of extorting mon ey. Apart from these there fs no one of any outstanding merit among the younger khans or who appears at presort likely to become a great leader under existing condit ions. Abul ^sim Khan’s influence among the tribe was gained by letting his immediate followers rob as they pleased and this terrorized others into submitting to , him. It is doubtful whether any attach.rment to him in 1 the tribe which did exist was based on anything but greed. The tribesmen,not unnaturally,is out for his own profit. So is the khan. In the past his power has meant thet he was able to squeeze the tribe and therefore he has become,fundamentally,unpopular with the tribesmen I who,provided he could secure good treatment from the government,would have no further use for the Khan who ihas not often treated him well. While many of the khans are personally of quite attractive character,hospitable and pleasant enough companions in the mass they ere an unattractive lot because each kh n n is oftrn on bad terms with all the other khans, 'ibis renders dealing with more than one khan on any given matter very difficult. It also means that if one does deal with only one khan he uses one’s name to further his own personal ends in dealing with the pthers.The majority of them are opium smokers. Most of the older khans have travelled in Surope and a number of the younger ones have been educated there, mainly in England. Some have been educated in France and one or two in Germany and Switzerland, i^ost of these speak the language of the country in which they studied. It is to be feared that,even where he has lived for ten years in Europe,the average young Bakht- iari khan is not greatly the better for it and is not thereby the more inclined to try and do good for his tribe or his country. There are however one or two ex ceptions to this rule. /There areThe-c* r nnn^or of families of khans of the ohehai' Dinp sopt'i'ut in general their influence has never haen ex- tonded out-ic-a thSir own particular tribal area.

In I94I-2 the khans blossomed forth with extensive political claims on the government such as the re-establishment of the old Bakhtiari governorate with the governorships of Isfahan and ^ezd but/later they wisely dropped such impossible demands and do not at present seem likely to revive them.At the same time they e.^ demanded the return of their oil shares by the government too,has been drooped because the forced sale in 1938-9 was done in the legal form and can consequently only be upset by parliamentary action which is unlikely to succeed* * Set -u therefore it is to be expected that there wi .1 be much talk on the part of the khans as to what Bakh tiari is nowadays and what it ought to be it is unlikely, i9 &amp;ross mismanagement by the Persian Govern- ment,that things will develop beyond that. The tribe ix±)t itself is most unlikely to take any action against the government independently of its khans. iero any movement against the government to start it would be more lively to do so in the Haft Lang that in the Chahar -^ang.

He cites the success of Colonel Mokry in Pusht-i-Kuh as an example of what can be done. He deprecates the present policy of playing off the tribes against each other, but H.M. Legation comments here that in view of the present state of the Persian Array there is no other course open to the Government. The Legation also disagrees with his suggestion that the Kurds should have their own officials, since it would be difficult to find Kurds with necessary qualifications who would be loyal to the G-overnment and would not use their official position to further their own ends.

Fletcher, Political Adviser, Ker- manshah, with two or three comments by His Majesty s Legation inserted in the text. The note was written with particular reference to the Kurdistan and Kermanshah region, but it deals with certain general principles, and I should be glad to receive your comments in due course, from the point of view of your consular district. I am, Sir , Your obedient Servant* D.O. No.l3C/PA KERMANSHAH, 30th December, 1943. My dear Sir Reader, Thank you very much for your D.O. 1370/3/43 dated the 11th December, 1943. 2. I have cut out the reference to the supply of arms from Iraq and I have re-drafted para.4(viii). regards civil versus military control I am afraid I cannot honestly alter what I have written. A 1 ! I have heard and seen during my two years here con vinces me that the less the army interferes in tribal affairs the more chance there is of solving the tribal problem. General Eraser mentions Razmara in his note as advocating a sensible and humane tribal rolicy. If General Fraser had been with me recently on the border of Luristan and had heard what the local people suffered from Razmara, I do not think he would call him an enthusiast for fair dealing with the tribes. 3 . I have not done anything on General Fraser f s suggestion about the implementation of that part of the Constitution allow ing for provincial tribal councils because I know nothing about it 'and so feel I cannot honestly say anything on the subject in / a note which represents my personal views. 4 # As regards c&amp;ntrol of the tribes by chiefs I think my views are the same as General Fraser’s, i.e., that the big chiefs should be eliminated and that control should be exercised through the headman who, as General Fraser says, are really chiefs. I have referred to them as Kedkhudas so as to make my meaning clearer 5. I have made alterations to meet Trott’s criticism that Reza 3hah did not in fact completely disarm the tribes. 6. I hope that the alterations I have made will meet the case. Yours sincerely, (3gd.) C. W. FLETCHER.

The question of attitude to be adopted towards tribes in Persia was discussed here with General Wavell and General Quinan. We agreed that it is undesirable to encourage the tjribes because Ca) it has been laid down by His Majesty s c&lt;rAo jGnvemment ( your telegram Nn« 7.40) that our.pbj^at must be &lt;to ' get civil administration running again and we cannot at 3.,present have a policy at the Centre and a different poli-cy &lt; tribal areas', (bj Otherwise we should^fin.d ourselves in endless family and sectional intrigues to little purpose, since serious tribal resistance to a German ;advance is not to be expected. (c) We must not hold out to the tribes promises which, as in the case of Sheikh Mohammerah. might not be able to save them from the Central Government. 2. It was however agreed that there was nothing against our raying tribal leaders or elements for specific services such as handing over Germans or helping to protect the oil areas. 3. General Officer Commandings at Kermanshah and at Ahwaz both concurred. 4. Copies of memorandum are being sent to all Consuls and also Government of India, Cairo, Angora and Moscow. ‘t It ^ V- P.o.
