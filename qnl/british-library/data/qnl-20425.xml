Mr, Hi Hard of the American Eiubassy came to see iae this morning on this subject, and said that a re-nort had reached tne State Deoartaent that H» Grovernunent had reached an agreement with Xbn vSaud 'by which the latter formally recognised the validity of ti.e frontiers in south-eastern Arabia established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913/14, The State De-oart ient would be glad of any information as to whether this were the case, 8. I explained to Mr, Mi'llard that the position was still as it had been described to the United States Government last summer (see K 2481 end K 4327), and as I had myself / explained it to Vr 0 Loomis on the 20th July (E 4784/2369/91), The boundary line agreed upon with the Ottoman Government in 1913 and T 14 was still internationally legally valid, since Saudi Arabia was one of the Succession States of the Ottoman Empire, and was therefore bound by the same frontiers, where they bounded its territory, unless some new frontier were established by a new and formal agreement. • We had made the position perfectly clear to Ibn Saud and to the United States Government, and as this position was the legal position in international Law it was unnecessary that Ibn Saud should formally recognise it. In point of fact Ibn Saud nad raised certain objections to our attitude, as he maintained that he had authority over certain tribes extending to the east of the blue and violet lines. But this did not affect the legal position. 3-/3, I aeked ! # r. Millard whether this enquiry was . concerned with tj.e Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Coumany of California e He replied that it was, as it might effect the Cotapany If there v.ere any question of moving the eastern frontier of Ibn Saud's dominions a few miles to the east or the west, I repeated that I had explained the position quite clearly to !'r # Loomis, and that, while Ihn Saud was perfectly free to grant any concession he liked within his dominions as hounded by the Anglo-Turkish Convention lines, he had no rights whatever to grant any concessions to the east of those lines, Mr. Millard said that this seemed clear and reasomtble enough, and that he would report accordingly. Be said that !'r. Loomis had left England Immediately after seeing me on trie 20th July and had not reported the result of his talk with me to the American Kmhassy. b 4. as it is -oossihle tuat we may yet reach some agreement with rbn Saud -nroviding for some modification of the 'blue and violet lines, I thought it well to tell Mr. Millard 'before he left that, while t;e legal position was as I had described it, the •nossihility was not excluded of sone small modification in the line being made later on by mutual agreement, to provide better local tribal conditions etc. Nothing of the sort had, however, yet been done, (Signed) G.W.Rendel, 19th Nove mber, 1954, (Copy forwarded to the Political Agent,Bahrain, under I.L.No.1179-3 of 12/12/34)./ 7 ' THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY'S GOVERNMENT 7 EASTERN (Arabia) CONFIDENTIAL. ■iVnoewRf afaMSNC* yft ii/'h iSi t OOWICIHTIAL imm i October 18, 1934 S ection 1. u ^ S [E 6371/279/91] No. 1. Sir John Simon to Mr. Calvert (Jedda). (No. 375.) Sir, Foreign Office, October 18, 1934. ' WITH reference to my despatch No. 368 of the 11th October enclosing a copy of a record of a conversation held on the 3rd October with the Saudi Arabian Minister in London regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, I have to inform you that on the 15th October Sheikh Hafiz Wahba called again at this Department to discuss this subject. 2. He said that he had communicated to his Government the views which had been expressed to him on the occasion of the conversation referred to above and that he had now received King Ibn Saud's reply, which was as follows. 3. King Ibn Saud's claims in South-Eastern Arabia were to the whole of the inland desert as distinct from the more or less settled coastal belt. The King had no desire to encroach on the settled, or even the nomadic, coastal areas, and had always maintained the friendliest relations with the coastal rulers. But the frontier which he proposed, i.e., the limit of the desert as distinct from the coastal belt, had always been the de facto boundary, had always been accepted by all the parties directly concerned and had never in fact been questioned. All the &gt; nomadic tribes in the desert area had always owed him allegiance and accepted his sovereignty, as was evidenced by the fact that they regularly paid him zikat tax. Their allegiance to him had never been disputed. On being asked whether^ this meant that King Ibn Saud claimed the whole of the Rubal Khali, the Minister explained that King Ibn Saud's claim was not specifically to the Rubal Khali, but to the 'desert' generally as distinct from the coastal belt. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was warned that many of these statements could hardly be accepted by His Majesty's Government. Moreover, a claim of this general nature was likely to lead to a number of special difficulties. So far as the information at present available went, there appeared to be very little in South-Eastern Arabia that was not desert, and indeed barren and uncultivated areas often extended to the coast. It would be necessary, therefore, in the first place to arrive at a satisfactory definition of the term '' desert, in the sense in which it was now being used, and this might be a matter of very considerable difficulty. 5. During the general discussion which followed, the Minister emphasised that King Ibn Saud was anxious to settle this question on a reasonable basis^ It proved impossible, however, to obtain from him a closer definition of the King s claims. It was suggested to him that King Ibn Saud might at least have given some further indication of the particular tribes over which he claimed over- lordship. Mention had, for instance, been made by Fuad Bey Hamza of the Murra tribe,, about which it was possible that there might be no very serious difficulty. On the other hand, the Manasir had also been mentioned, and this tribe, it was understood, had long owed a certain allegiance to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Minister admitted that certain tribes, whose wanderings took them over the desert, might properly belong to the coastal belt, but he did not pursue the matter. 6. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was told that his communication would have to be considered more fully before anything further could be said to him. It was important, however, that the issue should be narrowed down as far as possible before Sir Andrew Ryan left for Jedda, since otherwise the difficulties of reaching an early agreement—or, indeed, perhaps any agreement at all—by local negotiation were likely to be very greatly increased.

From: - 'olitical Agency, Bahrain, the 12th December 1954 Lieutenant-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf, Bushire. Position in Arabia east of th e I have the honour to^p^fer to the Secretary of State for India's telegram ^o; r 4l2 dated the 13th October 1934 and to our conversations on the subject of finding out the exact position regarding King Bin Sa'ud ! s activities in the hinter land of the Crucial Coast. On the PAth November 1934 I proceeded to the Trucial Coast in H.rr.S Shorehsm, ^de a short stay at Sharjah, whence T visited Dibai, and then embarked in H.M.S Lupin for 'Ajman, T Jmm al Qaiwain and Abu Dhabi. vas fortunately, though uncomfortably, stranded for m a motor dhow with Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu i hebi and his old and experienced uncle. Shaikh Khalifah bin • aid, and they talked more freely than would have been the case in more formal circumstances. Their views were expressed spontaneously and with but little enquiry from me. 4. T:.tj complained bitterly of the interference in Dhafrah (including Idwah) of the Sa'udi Arabian authorities and of the policy pursued by Ibn Jiluwi of encouraging malcontents and /others2. others to bring presents to him and to place themselves under his aegis. They are clearly v. 7 ondering what the policy of T is Majesty's Government is likely to be. 5. I enclose two statements (i) shoving that the coast line from Qatar to Ruus al Jibal belongs to one or other of the Trucial Shaikhs and (ii) showing the position in the hinterland east of the Blue Line. 6. The broad result of my enquiries is to show:- (i) that the coast between Qatar and the Ruus al Jibal definitely belongs to one or other of the Trucial Shaikhs, (ii) that the whole area east of the Sabakhah al Matti u p to Baraim i rightfully belongs to Trucial 1 Oman (in particular to Abu Dhabi) and not to ^dng Bin Sa'ud, but that the Trucial Shaikhdoms could not, as long as he is alive, hope by themselves to withstand his prestige and influence, (iii) that the payment of zakat is in fact partly insurance or blackmail (which is evaded when possible) and partly due to the desire of certain tribal sections to win support in their feuds, (iv) that east of the Blue Line and up to a line Sakak - Mabak - Jabrin, the country is locally, to some extent at any rate, regarded as under the sway of King Bin Sa T ud, (v) that between the west side of the Sabakhah al Matti and the line Sakak - Mabak - Jabrin there is a stretch of barren country, in which up to recent times no one has been greatly interested and of v/hich the ownership is indeterminate, and (vi) that, although in the far past most of Trucial f Oman seems by force of circumstances to have acknowledged the Wahhabi power, and even to have subscribed in a more or less degree to the Wahhabi faith, there does not appear to be the least disposition to do so now, save as an insurance against trouble. 7. I have been told that King Bin Sa'ud and * Abdullah ibn Jiluwi have heard of our enquiries regarding the payment of zakat. 8. In accordance • ith the instructions contained in your /telegram- i H.

The Qatar boundary according to Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani is Salwa - Khor al 'Cdaid. King Bin Sa T ud is said to accept Khor al T Odaid and possibly Salwa. Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi and his uncle. Shaikh Khalifah bin Zaid, say that Jabal Wakrah is within Qatar limits and that a spot called Bushairiyah (not far north of 'Odaid) and its vicinity is vithin Abu Dhabi limits. 2. They (Shaikh Shakhbut and his uncle) claim that the boundary between the Abu Dhabi area of Dhafrah (including Liwah) and Bin Sa ! ud f s territory is the Sabakhah al -iatti vhich extends in a south-western direction as far as Al Kimal (i.e.. The Sands - Ruba 1 al Khali). They grve no exact opinion how far their territory runs into the interior from the coast between Bushairiyah and the Sabakhah al Matti, out they reg;rd Sakak and Mabak as ^in Sa T ad T s. ^■ L ' , 3. They claim, as the boundary between Abu Dhabi and Dibai, Jabal r Ali (usually called Jubail) some 25 miles south west of Dibai: and point out that Dibai is historically theirs. Shaikh Sa^d bin Maktum of Dibai claims as his boundary between ^ibai and Abu Dhabi, ^hor al Gnanadhah. 4. Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi claims 1! all the islands' i.e., Sir Bani Yas, Dalmah and all the numerous small islands up to Halul. 5. The boundary between Dibai and Sharjah is Abu Hail, which is claimed by both. A certain tree on the Sharjah side xiy: Sakak is not as shown on Hunter*5 Map of Arabia, but is only some seven miles south oT the end of vohat al Salwa. It is probable that the Sabakhah al Matti begins further to the west than is shown on the Map. yis. of Abu ^ail is recognized as the boundary for practical purposes. 6. The boundary between Sharjah and ^jman is at certain plantations north-east of Hairah. 7. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah still claims authority over Dibah and Kalba. Khaimah seem now to be coterminous (in the past T Ajman and Umm al Qai ain vere eidaves in 'harjah territory, which included Ras al Khaimah), but the Shaikhs are vague about the exact boundaries. It should be noted that the Shaikh of Hamriyah is beginning to regard himself as independent, but in 1933 he came to a darbar with the Shaikh of Umm al Qaiwain. 9. It is established that there is no point on the coast between Qatar and Ruus al Jibal, which does not belong to one or other of the Trucial Shaikhs. e ter-j'itories of 'Ajman, T Jmm al Oaiwain and Ras al Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.Position in 1934 in the hinterland east of the Blue Line. 1. GI' OC-R/.PfllCAL &gt; (a). Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi claims the whole of the hinterland east of the Sabakhah al Matti which runs in a south-westerly direction to Al Rimal (The Sands - Ruba f al Khali). The southern boundary of this area is Al Rimal and the eastern Baraimi, which is under Shaikh Saqar bin Sultan bin Muhammad of the ia * im, but in which Shaikh Shakhbut and his uncle own seven afla^ (under-ground water channels). Shaikh Shakhbut keeps an official, Salim al Ya T ruf, in Liwah, through whom he collects 'ushr (tenth tax) on the date groves of the Bani Yas. (b). It is not clear how far inland from the coast between the ^ abakhah al Matti and Bushairiyah (the boundary with Qatar) Shaikh Shakhbut claims. He says that f Aqalah is his, but he regards Sakak and %bak as being under Bin Sa'ud. He was of opinion that the territory west of a line Sakak - Mabak - Jabrin would belong to Bin Sa'ud, but he would not commit himself to any definite statement about the area between that line and his own territory, though he said vaguely that it might belong to Qatar. (c). It seems that Shaikh ! Abdullah bin Oasim al Thani of Qatar does not claim beyond a line roughly Salwa to Khor al 1 0 3 a id . (d) • Neither Dibai, Sharjah, •Ajman or Unnn al Oaiwain appear to make any claim to territorial rights in the interior beyond a few miles from their towns. Abu Dhabi on the other hand very definitely claims the whole area mentioned in sub paragraph (a) above.14 &amp; 2. 2. TRIBAL- The main tribes using the area between the Sabakhah al Matti and Baraimi are:- Al Morrah, /lanasir, Bani Yas, Daru f , T Awamir, Al bu Shamis, Al Dhawahir, Bani Qitab, Bani Ka'ab and the Na'im. The position regarding these tribes is set out briefly below:- (i) . Al Morrah * The Al Morrah are mainly an Hasa tribe and their area extends to Jabrin. They have, however, had settlements at Sakak and ^abak for the last IS years. They are generally regarded as under ^in Sa^d and provide men in time of war, but are turbulent people whom even Ibn Jiluwi can barely control. They are said to have secret places where they hide their camels to avoid payment of zakat. They do not cone into Dhafrah except on casual visits. (ii) . ^cmasir . The majority of the Jfetnasir, though historically an Abu Dhabi tribe, pay zakat to Bin Sa ! ud because their paramount Snaikh, W.ashid bin Mani T , now resides in Hasa and is a friend of T 1 Jiluwi.. i-t is said that any camels or property looted by the 'tanasir are brought to Ibn Jiluwi, who takes a considerable share. Those sections living in Dhar^ah evade payment of zakat if they can by hiding their camels. Those who go to the pearling ^■-y c i'ving L .-.x to tne ;iaiich of Abu Dhabi* They own a number o' date gardens in Dhafrah, but do not pay f ushr (one-tenth tax) to any one. A number are said to have gone to the Yemen during the recent operations there. (iii). Bani Yas . Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi complains that Bin Sa T uci T s muzak'cLs (tax-gatherers) have taken zakat from the Bani Yas in Dhafrah for the last nine years (including the spring of 1954), as he has not the power to prevent them from /doing%/ 3. doing so. He, Shaikh Shakhbut, collects the 'ushr (one-tenth tax) on the palm trees of the Bani Yas in Dhafrah (including Liwah, v.here he keeps an agent for this purpose). Shai?^h Shakhbut also collects a diving tax on all pearling boats, in which both 3ani Yas and 'anasir tribesmen are employed. (iv). Baru f . 1 .A ■.amir. live in the neighbourhood of Baraimi. /.I bu Shamis. The m£ i Joritj r have not paid zakat to ^in Sa'ud, but certain sub-sections of each tribe have done so on at least two occasions, in 19SI3 and 1SS6. They put themselves under the aegis of ^in Sa ! ud in order to gain support against the Manasir and 3ani -as after hostilities in the time of 3haikh Hamdan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi,-v/ho had previously recon ciled them. (v). A1 Dhawahir . N Bani Qitab &gt; N live in the neighbourhood of Baraimi. Bj 1 ) V tl lLlt ) It is strtec' thr.t they do not pay zakat to ^in Sa f ud. In the case of these seven tribes payment seems to depend on whether the imizakkis have penetrated as far as Baraimi and on whether the tribes have thought it politic to pay. In about 1929 the muzakkis were roughly handled and none have gone as far as Baraimi since that year. Shaikh Shakhbut explained that the reason why certain sub-sections of these tribes paid zakat was that they wished to obtain the support and countenance of Ibn Jiluwi in their feuds, so sent him .resents and offered to pay zakat.

I learn from Mr. Mylles that Jabal Idkhan is i hat is more generally known as Jabal Dukhan, the low range running along the west coast of Qatar to just north of Salwa. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company and Bin Sa T ud are trying hard to get Shaikh T xVbdullah bin Qasim to admit that his boundary so runs that part at any rate of this range is outside his territory. This range seems to be similar to the Jabal Dukhan in Bahrain which is the site of The Bahrain Petroleum Company's oil field. 2. Mr. Mylles tells me that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's geologists have not examined the hills on the west side of the Dohat- al-Salwa (A1 Qarah), but that they advise that in viev, of the proved structure in Bahrain and probable structure in Qatar, the neighbouring hills on the mainland should be regarded as potential oil country till the contrary is proved by examination. s.6.

Apparently Shaikh Hamad has hitherto refused resents from the C &amp;lifornia Arabian Standard Oil Compa.ny, but says that once the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's option has expired he will have no scruples about taking them. 5. Galih al Vani is reported to be at the end of his resources financially and his wife's brother has taken her back to Zubair as Salih had sold some gear of hers.

V 2 m We have received Loch's air mail letter of expressed December* 12th but not ^owle * s comments so that viewtnow/ may require modification when those comments are received. 3. Cur main objectives are agreed to be (a) to prevent Ibn Sa'ud from extending his authority to coast south of ^atar or acquiring further in- -fluence over Shaikhs of v^tur and Trucial Coast who are in special treaty relations with nis Majesty's Government (b) to prevent desert area immediately bordering on territory of those Shaikhs from being exploited under the aegis of Ibn Sa , ud by foreign Companies for oil or minerals. 4. Loch's report appears to be based largely on self interested information supplied by Shaikh of Abu Dhabi but it proves (l) that Ibn Sa'ud has not yet established any prescriptive rights even of suzerainty much less of sovereignty over any part of the Trucial Joast between Sabbakah- 1-katti and .bahraimir Bahraimi• (2) that he does &amp;&amp;&amp; control desert east of line as far as Sakak - Mabak - Jabrin. He understand that if question falls to be decided on purely legal considerations it would not be possible to insist on observance of iilue Line frontier on the strength j j of 1913-1914 Anglo-Turki sh Conventions (vide opinion forwardec ; Cfl ,as enclosure to P.Z,6C52 dated 28th iiepteiober ife must therefore eventually concede some measure of sov» -reignty up to line indicated by Loch and question is how best to prevent further encroachment and grant of inconveni- 10^ -ent concessions immediately west of that line. 5* rfe a^pee with Fowle that a geographical fron tier laid down in the desert is objectionable and that frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by him and supported by Dickson aud Bertram Thomas would on general grounds be far more suitable. But such a solu- -tion does not appear to us calculated to achieve either of the main objectives specified above, since it would leave Ibn Sa'ud free to extend his authority and perhaps his territorial sovereignty at will through these nomadic tribes. Rendel's suggestion of •♦Desert zone' is free from these objections and we consider that this will be the best solu- -tion from our point of view even thought it will sterilise mineral development of this area for some years. It will obviously be difficult however to secure Ibn 3a , ud , s con- -sent to such an/ arrangement and should it prove impossible to progress with negotiations on this basis we consider that Minister should be given disaretion to offer recognition of Ibn Sa , ud , s sovreignty (either personal or territorial) up to line which Loch indicates as the limit of his de facto authori tyV 3. authority, with the proviao regarding necessity for consent of His Majesty*s Government to grant of concessions within specified distance from coast. V /e appreciate objections to such recognition but there seem to be no good le^al ^rounds for refusing it and in view of Loch's report we feel that an agreed limitation to ibn Sa , ud , s encroachment has solid ad- -vantage over the existing position. r\ Foreign (Copy forwarded tfo P.h.Bahrain under P.L.NO.1220-S of 29/12/34).Ref.our P.L Bo .121^-3 of 28/12/34. 3^No. 1220-S of 1934.

His conversation with the Sheikh of Koweit appears to have confirmed the impression on this subject which he had himself independently formed and which he mentioned to us during the course of the summer. The point is, of course, of importance, since, as Fowle says, 'Ibn Saud's authority over his subjects, especially over the tribal elements, depends a good deal on prestige'. 2# Ryan has, of course, by now left, and he will no doubt see the copy of Fowle's letter, which was sent direct to Calvert, on his return to Jedda.

Line recommended by him as limit of Ibn Saud's sovereignty appears to be substantially the sarr.e as tnat ^ &amp; i J3 reported by Loch and recomi.ended by us. Our impression was that even West of this line in strip of territory lying between Blue Line and line now proposed it would be in advisable to give Ibn Saud completely free hand regarding oil and other concessions. Fowle ap^e-rs to be satisfied that this is not the case and if His Lajesty's Government agrees we have no more to say. 3. We still feel that tribal boundaries east of this ^ line would be dangerous (vide paragraph 3 of note on 7^ discussion with' Thomas, sent as enclosure to India Of 1 ice P.Z.6893 of November 8th) and it seems unlikely that Ibn Saud in return for such a concession would agree to leave grant of oil ahd other concessions in this area entirely to us. Crux of.the matter is however Ibn Saud's attitude and we agree with the suggestion made in paragraph 4 oi Fowle's telegram as to tactics to be pursued. 7 * - Foreign- (Cony forwarded to i ..-v.Bahrain under I .L.

After consideration of views of Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf and Government of India, His Majesty's Government suggest following programme for negotiations with Saudi Govenimeiit. Concessions in each case are intended to form part oi the general settlement. 6. First Stage. Request for clearer indication of Ibn Saud's desiderata. If King merely repeats his claim to whole desert except for coastal belt he might be told that so vague and extensive a claim to so vast an area, to which His / 1His Majesty's Government do not recognise him as possessing any ?valid title can form no basis for discussion and that while His Majesty's Government are prepared to make some friendly concession this can only be within reasonable limits. ?• In any preliminary conversations with Ibn Saud you may not wish to proceed beyond this sta^e. But I fully realise difficulties with which you may be faced and I do not desire to tie your hands unduly* Matter is mainly one of tactics as to which you are necessarily the best judge and you are therefore ' authorised if you consider that no settlement is likely to be attainable otherwise to proceed either with King at Riyadh or subsequently with Fuad Hamza as and when you consider it necessary or desirable to mut further stages suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 below. 8. Second Stage. Offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a relatively small area or strip immediately East of Blue Line ^ as far as a line running from head of DOHAT-ES-SALWA to a point slightly south east of oAKAK (but leaving that place to Saudi Arabia) thence (leaving to QATAR and ABU DHABI a strip of territory extending inland for no less than 25 miles to West oi head of KHOR-EL-ODEID) to North Western extremity of a QAL thence due southwards via (but to west of) BANAIYAN to parallel 20 degrees North whence it would gradually rejoin Violet Line. 9. If this offer proves insufficient, His Majesty's Ipf ~ . (K * ■' ' '■' v f Government would be prepared to consider mut. to it as a third stage a settlement on the lines suggested in Rendel's -letter of November 7th to Mr .Laithwaite (copy in my despatch J No.436) involving creation of Desert Zone under a special regime for a period of ten or twenty years subject to re consideration at the request of either party at the end of that time. (See also Conclusion One of Middle East Sub-Committee j y /\j- L meeting of November 8th) • Ibn Saud would maintain in this Zone any personal rights which he at present effectively exercises over /over nomadic tribes there e.g. right to levy zakat but would not possess li^HHi^^^vereignty and would therefore not be able to grant a concession. Desert Zone mut. special regime would be defined by a separate agreement. Boundaries of Desert Zone would be approximately those suggested in Renders letter but would exclude BANIYAN. X0 # If you are eventually convinced that no satistactory general settlement can be reached on basis even of this conces sion, His Majesty^ Govefnment would be prepared in the last —— 77- resort and in order to secure their desiderata in other direc tions to offer Ibn Saud lastly full sovereign^ of a part at least of^Desert area referred to in immediately preceding paragraph subject however to ? undertaking that no concession would be granted therefor by Ibn Saud except after consultation with His Majesty's Government and to concessionnaires approved both by His Majesty*s Government and by Saudi Government. Precise limits to be suggested for this additional area are still under consideration and further instructions on this point, will reach you as soon as possible. Idea at present being explored is that part of proposed Desert Zone lying to West ol meridian 62 might possibly be thus conceded to Ibn Saud. South end of this line continue ? appaar to join 'ring tence' line ol Neutral Zone at northern end of boundary between Aden Protector ate and Sultanate of Muscat and Oman assuming latter to run inland from RAS MALIGAR mut. Ali at right angles to coast. In any case however it will be important to obtain from Ibn Saud a categorical renunciation of any rights or claim to any kind of sovereignty outside frontier line suggested in paragraphs 8 or 10 or mut. 'ring fence' of Desert Zone (see paragraph 6 of Rendel's letter to Mr.Laithwaite). It would also be desirable for His Majesty's Government to retain flying rights not only over Desert Zone but also over any area which might /-4- t =P\ a' eventually be conceded 'to Ibn Saud under paragrciph. iO* 12. You will no doubt in any negotiations make such use as you can of fact that any of these concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn ^aud of rights over very large areas to which he has at present no legal claim and would release him from obligations of existing 'Blue Line' Frontier from which he could not otherwise escape without great difficulty. 23, If you see any objection to any part ol aoove programme I shall be glad to consider any observations jrou wish to offer. I trust however that jpresent telegram will at any rate give you sufficient idea generally of desiderata of His Majesty's Government to enable you to conduct preliminary discussions with King Ibn Saud at Riyadh if you proceed ?there or with Fuad Hamza. 2^4 # Instructions on such point^-s as landing grounds and flying rights, Saudi Government Debts etc. will follow by despatch as soon as possible • Copy sent to P.A.'s Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat under P.I .ITo. 134-S of 25th Januqry 1935. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs-61/31 JCX.

Many thanks for those instructions which will certainly enable me to conduct the first round with Fuad although I must study paragraphs 6 to 11 more closely before I can submit any report by tele- - graph on them. Meanwhile I submit the following points in anticipation of first conversations with Fuad, who reached Mecca only yesterday and has not yet proposed a meeting. a* I am now disinclined to go to Riadh in the near future even if ?uad brings an invitation which latest indications make me think doubtful. Apart from reasons of practical inconvenience which have some weight but are not insurmountable, I see increasing political objections to an unofficial visit. I do not q expect Fuad to rt ^ ^ his impossible suggestion that ?all the negotiations should take place at Riadh but impression is widespread that such negotiations are im- -pending especially in view of position as re^prds Treaty of Jedda. This being so, my return, without having come to any definite agreement, might be misinterpreted locally ^ ^ r&lt; ' and 1 pressure. Moreover KingKing feels so nervous over the Blue Line question *■ that it would be better to confine myself to con- -versations with IViad as long as possible* I propose, therefore, unless you see strong obj ections, to side-track any invitation, if I can do so without risk of offence, but intimate that invi- -tat ion next summer would be welcome# I shall, of course, see King here in the interval. b. What maps are you using and what maps should I use in discussion v/ith J?uad ? Map Department of Foreign Office has, I think, list of maps available here. Further supply by bag of those to be used would be useful# c. I appreciate the effect of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovreignty but I am not clear as to how distinction should be defined jurid- -ically if necessity arises* May I have information on this subject, not necessarily by telegraph t if expla- -nation is lengthy.

On the other hand local considerations must clearly be decisive. If therefore you consider it more advantag- -eous to bring King into negotiations at the end rather than at the start and if you are satisfied that evasion or non-acceptance of his invitation will not give offence j I do not wish to press you to go to Riadh now. 2.

As re ^rds Power e-f Attorney for (b) and (c) see my separate telegrams lTos.8 and 9. As regards (a) I understood Fuad to say that Saudi Government would do anything we liked. He disconcerted me by approaching (d) from the standpoint that His Majesty's Government were bound under promise to King Hussein to recognise Arab independence. At one resume of of moment he said statement King* s suy iciCr desiderata would be produced but he seemed to rt that while Saudi Goverunent might be willing to make im- -portant concession to 'their Arab brethren* we should not come in between them. I naturally scouted this and repeated on January 21st my warning against danger of tak- -ing such line. On this rebuke Fuad toldjme that all he had said on the previous day except about (b) and (c) aboveabove was persoixal and unoffic.ial. I gave definite official views in second conversation • I asked vtfiether Saudi Government as such were ready to accept proposal which His Maj- -esty , s Government had (mut) _ approve d tor oo.- -prehensive negotiations on lines suggested in London last September and whether they would produce precise statement of Ibn Saud's desiderata regarding boundaries. £ I added that if comprehensive negotiations produce no result parties could only return to their positions in regard to legal question and expressed hope that any statement of desiderata would be such as provides reason- -able basis for discussion as His Majesty's Government contemplated only moderate concession.

The main poiivts appear 'to be as lollows; (a) If Ibn Saud can develop Ras Tanura then, in my opinion, he will do so whether the transit dues are given up by Bahrain or not. The amount which he, or his people, will gain by these dues being given up, i.e. Rs.30,000 or so per annum, while large enough tor Bahrain, is not enough to induce him to give up a scheme which will not only further his trade but soothe his amoii?! aropre by giving him at last a decent port in the Persian Gulf. (b) I see danger in Government of India's suggestion being mooted either directly or indirectly to the Saudi Government, whether at the Bahrain conference or otherwise, as having got this ia^a -iom us, Ibn Saud, knowing that he cannot from the practical point of view develop Ras Tanura (assuming he cannot do so) may put up a strong bluff that he is quite capable of doing so. In the face of this bluff the Bahrain Government and our selves may agree to remit the transit dues und so give something for nothing. The really important point on which we need cast iron information (whether we can get this informa tion or not I don't know) is whether (1) Ibn Saud can or cannot from a technical point of view develop Has Tanura into a port and (2) whether if he can, it would be worth his while financially to do so. Onee we can make up our minds on these two points we shall know what line to take. Failing this decision we shall have to wait and see. I will discuss with Colonel Loch at Bahrain.

His Majesty's Government are impressed by arguments contained in Metcalfe's demi-official letter of December 24th | ' No .F .166 -N /34 and agree that in the circumstances described 'f' there would be great advantage in persuading Shaikh to drop re-export and transit dues altogether, at any rate on material genuinely intended for Arab coast, in the interest of making it unnecessary for Ibn Saud to develop Has Tanurah and oi maintaining lucrative position of Bahrain as entrepot,. They appreciate Immediate financial loss involved. But this, as Government of India point out, is less important now with oil royalties than it would have been, and in any event is not comparable to loss which any developments at Has Tanurah would involve. 2. They think further that there are definite object ions at any rate ? at present to assisting Ibn 3aud to develop Ras Tanurah. 3. They agree finally that it is desirable if ?Saudis can be persuaded to agree to local discussion (see my telegram ^6 -of 26th January No.274 to Bushire) that concession should be made at Bahrain . 4. Subject to any further observations by you or Resident they would be glad therefore if Fowle would broach the / Ithe matter with Shaikh on his forthcoming visit; emphasise dangers of development of Ras Tanurah or some other port in Saudi Arabia (which with indications that Saudi Arabia is petroliferous we cannot overlook) and increasing difficulties of preventing direct shipments (it should be impressed on Shaikh that His Majesty's Government would be unable to agree to any penalisation of direct shipments and that in the absence of this leverage it is a question of providing the best induce ment we can to Ibn Saud not to develop his port)j Fowle should emphasise vital importance to Bahrain of retaining entrepot position and good results of establishment of free ports else where. We greatly hope that Fowle will be able to persuade Shaikh that on a long view proposal on the lines suggested above for abolitioij^might be made after fairly lengthy preliminary discussions as evidence of Bahraini good-will to Ibn Saud. Failing conference it could be made by Ryan on the same grounds. We agree with Government of India that (save in the improbable event of offer by Saudis to cease development in return for concession over transhipment) it would be un desirable to link the concession openly in any way with ?demand for guarantee that Ras Tanurah would not be developed. -Secretary of State for India- X l^c INSER T. •of reexport and transit dues promises to work out best his own interests.

When I approached the Shaikh in regard to (a) agenda and (b) date of proposed conference at Bahrain, he agreed after some . discussion between himself. Shaikh Abdullah i )i» f Isa and me. He Arab reminded we at once that for many years Sa'udi/Government had enjoyed rate of 2% on which His Majesty's Government had insisted, instead of 2^% for ^vhich Shaikh f lsa had pressed (in 1917 he had imposed 5^). I should judge, however, that he is friendly disposed in the matter towards Bin Sa'ud for whom he has a great personal regard. 2* I feel that I should at the outset warn you that it would be most inadvisable for us to be placed in the position of forcing (or appearing to force) on to Bahrain the giving up of the transit dues. Fact that we insisted on 2% instead of Shaikh f Isa f s 2i% (or m b%) has always been regarded locally and along the coast as an instance of our sacrificing the interests of our weaker friends to those with s • 6 • /power ml't—7s5s&amp;p—(m-iyi4)—18-8-33—2,00.000./9. power. 3. V/hile I appreciate arguments used, I think that proposal to do away with dues is based to some extent on misconception of actual situation. 4. In the first place our present information is (a) that Bin Sa f ud has done no work recently at Ras Tanurah and (b) that the California Arabian Standard Oil Company have made pier (and according i' to latest news living houses) at A1 Akhbar (some miles south of , I^ammam) where steamers cannot go. In view especially of (b), development of steamer port seems much less likely than it was when you wrote your letter No:1064-1?''dated the 20th November 1934. 5. In the second place, even if Bin Sa'ud were to make landing arrangements at a mainland port, it seems improbable that large town would grow up (a) because the Sa ! udi Arab Government have treated their merchants so badly over money, (b) because the leading Najdi merchants (Qusaibis and Bassams) are buying land and 'digging them- selves in' in Bahrain, and (c) because, m ost i mportant , all openly . infl B I fear chaos when Bin Sa'ud dies. 6. Although, in the event of a port being established on the mainland, some persons would no doubt leave Bahrain, it seems unlikely that the numbers who left would materially affect local consumption; and on the other hand if a port is not made there is no reason to suppose that any more people will come to Bahrain because of the reduction of the 2^ dues. 7. The figure Rs.30,000/- for the transit dues is now an under estimate, as the actuals for the last nine months are Rs.?4,474/-. This figure is likely to in^rove as the California Arabian Standard Oil Company is beginning to tranship considerable quantities of materiel to A1 Akhbar. 8. I am not happy over comparison of Bahrain with Singapore, Hong Kong and Aden as conditions seem so different. Incidentally, I presume those ports charge harbour dues, which Bahrain does not.5. 5 9« I would suggest that the Bahrain representatives at the Conference should hear the complaints of the Sa^dl Arab Government and try to find out if possible what their intentions are. As the Sa'udi Arab representatives will have come to a conference, it will no doubt be necessary to meet them to some extent in the interests of friendship and I believe that a settlement might be reached on the lines of giving a small reduction in the transit dues and granting a free pass for a fixed annual quantity (which might be generous) of certain commodities for the personal use of Bin Sa'ud. 10. I feel that it is important to retain some transit due *■ *•1 quote the general local belief 2 as ^when Hasa and Najd revert to chaos', it would be easier to increase an existing transit due than to re-impose one which had been abolished. .eut-Colonel, Political Agent, -Bahrain.* / 7^ &lt;S&gt;i bl/Slk 19/212 Telegram From To -Ho. 17 0 Dated 5th February 1935 K 27 Political Hesident, BuShire political Agent, Bahrain.

Dated the 7th February 1935. nof Correspondence ending with your telegram No.325 of 31st January. After consultation with Political Agent Bahrain I venture to express the opinion that there are most serious objections to action suggested in your paragraph 4. 2. Advantages put forward for Bahrain to surrender transit, dues would doubtless have weight if it were certain or even likely that Ibn Saud was about to develop Ras Tanura into a port and large town. But the very opposite is the case. Latest information is that Ibn Saud has done no work whatever recently at Ras Tanura, that what work he has done already has been of little practical importance (vide my letter N0.629-S of 5th July 1934) and that the Hasa Oil Company who are believed to have some arrangement with him for the development of Ras Tanura have (vide paragraph 3 of my telegram No.56 of 14th January) built a pier DAML/iA^i where steamers cannot go» Moreover leading Banr^in -^ejdi merchants Qusaibis and others who should be best judge of chance of developments on mainland ar© still buying land in Bahrain. 3. This being so proposal in your paragraph 4 woikld I am afraid give the unfortunate (though mistaken) impression to the Bahrain Government (who are of course well informed as to the position at Ras Tanura and who have not forgotten that /-2- that in 1920 under pressure from us they lowered their transit dues for what they considered was to the benefit of Ibn Saud) that we were now asking them to give up for the advantage of the Saudi Government a certain income of Rs.30,000/- a year to ward off a hypothetical danger which at present seems most unlikely to materialise. 4. Further if I were to put proposal to Shaikh and he were to ask me, as most likely he would, what was my personal opinion of the likelihood of the development of Ras Tanura, I do not see how I could avoid replying that the likelihood at present seemed rto me very small. 6. When and if the development of Ras Tanura seems probable, and presumably such a large undertaking could not be seriously contemplated without Minister Jedda and myself getting to hear of it, the question can be taken up on its merits. As things stand I most earnestly urge His Majesty's Government to abandon their suggestion. 6. For information.

J k '] of the position to the East of the Blue Line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913/14 and the attitude to be adopted in discussions with King Ibn Saud as to possible modifiraticns )_ of that line. 2. The valuable report contained in Colonel Loch's letter of 12th December, C.963-la/38, shows the present position, so far as can be ascertained, in the northern part of the area in question. Fran that report it appears: (a) that the Sheikh of Qatar regards a line running roughly from Salwa to the head of the Khor al Odeid as his southern boundary. Such a line is practically identical with that which has been recognised in the past by Kis Majesty's Government as the southern boundary of the Sheikh's territories (ccmpare India Office memorandum P. Z. 614/34: B. 430) , ji- and it corresponds closely (save at Sakak) with the limit/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.'&lt; 0 &lt;31 f * 2. limit which has been accepted 'by His Majesty's Government for the guarantee of protection which they were prepared to give the Sheikh in the event of his granting an oil concession in his State to a company approved by them. The statements made by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and his uncle as to the Western limits of the territory of Abu Dhabi are also sufficiently consistent with the acceptance of this line; (b) that the coast between Q.atar and the tip of the Musandim Peninsula definitely belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikha; (c) that east of the Blue Line, Ibn Saud is locally regarded as holding the territory west of a line running Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin and in particular as holding Sakak and Mabak, where the A1 Murra, 'who are generally regarded as under Ibn Saud' , have had settlements for the last 12 years; (d) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is not prepared r to commit himself as t o sovereignty in the area lying between the line Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin referred to in (c) and the western boundaries of Abu Dhabi described in (e) below. While Jabrin lies well to the west of the Blue Line, any negotiations with Ibn Saud in which His Majesty's Government take their stand on the Blue Line must, of course, proceed on the basis that all territory lying to the wsst of that line is in the undoubted sovereignty of Ibn Saud; (e) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi himself claims not only Aqal and the Sabhakhah al Matti with its hinterland as far as Al Rimal, but the whole of the hinterland to the east of the Sabhakhah al Matti as far as/as Baraimi. It may te noted that His Majesty's Government have in the past formally recognised both the Sabhakhah al Llatti and Aqal (with the Khor-al-Odeid) as forming part of the territories of Abu Dhabi (compare the Appendix to India Office memorandum p. Z. 614/34; B .430). Fran the note on page 262 of Mr.Thomas's 'Arabia Felix' it appears that the northern boundary of Al Rimal in the region 51° East longitude may be fixed at Banaiyan. While to the east of that point the Sands continue northwards to the shores of the Persian Gulf, this area is not, according to Mr.Thanas, regarded as Al Rimal by those best acquainted with the Sands. The Sheikh admits that within the area between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi zakat has in recent years been from time to time collected from certain trifces on behalf of Ibn Saud. But it seems clear that in the case of the ' ■ —' ' ■- 11 ■ ' ' ■ — — Bani Yas he has acquiesced in such payment only under protest and that there are special circumstances in the case of the Manasir. It seems unnecessary to attach any special importance to payments made to some extent in special circumstances by certain sub-sections of the seven tribes living in the neighbourhood of Baraimi, and the important point is that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi not only claims, but appears effectively to exercise a degree of jurisdiction in the hinterland, particularly in the Dhafrah and Liwa areas and as far East as Baraimi. (f) that despite the activities of his zakat collectors, there is nothing to show that Ibn Saud has/\ a 4. has ever established prescriptive rights of suzerainty, much less of sovereignty, over any part of the Trucial Coast between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi. 3. The question of the boundary in the south western area is primarily one for the Colonial Office. The Secretary of State notes, however, from Sir Bernard -j* . Reilly's despatches to the Secretary of State for the i. r f Colonies, No. 263 of 3rd October and II 0.29 6 of 14th ^ ^ p ? November 1934, that the Resident is of opinion that, ^ i subject to the result of further enquiries which are being made locally, it would be desirable to claim the edge of the Sands as the northern boundary of the Hadramaut and to include in the Aden Protectorate on strategic as well as on political grounds all territory lying to the south of the Empty Quarter and to the west of the boundaries of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. The information which has been collected places His Majesty's Government in a position to reach certain conclusions as to the maximum concessions in the area to the east of the Blue Line of the 1913/14 Conventions which could be made to Ibn Saud in return for a satisfactory settlement of the other points outstanding between the King and Kis Majesty's Government. The Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India that the main objectives of His Majesty's Government are: (a) to prevent Ibn Saud from extending his authority to the coast south of Q.atar or acquiring further influence over the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government; (b)/n fy f\ Jt ('b) to prevent so far as possible the desert area adjoining the territory of those Sheikhs from 'being exploited under the aegis of Ibn Saud 'by foreign companies for oil or minerals. 5. The geogisphical limits to be set to any concession to be made are examined in greater detail below. The first question for consideration is whether His Majesty's Government should aim at a settlement on the basis of: (a) a frontier based on tribal divisions; or (b) an arrangement providing for definite territorial limits to the dominions of Ibn Saud on the one hand and of the protege's of His Majesty's Government on the other. 6. The Secretary of State, like the Government of India, is much attracted by the suggestion of a frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by Colonel Fowl e and supported both by Colonel Tdckson, whose great experience of Arabia must carry weight in a connection such as the present, and by the observations recorded by Mr.Bertram Thonas. He agrees with the Resident that there is much to be said against a geographical frontier laid down in a desert, and in practice an arbitrary line in a desolate area, sparsely peopled by a nomadic and primitive population, is open to many objections. But on a review of the position as a whole and in the light of the information now available, he agrees with the Government of India, that, for the reasons given in their telegram of 27th December, such a solution would not appear/best calculated to achieve the • ^ ^ main/o 6» main objectives referred to in paragraph 4 above. He is apprehensive, too, that were His Majesty's Government in discussion with Ibn Saud to aim at a frontier based on tribal divisions, they might find it difficult, in the light of the information received from Colonel Loch as to the payment of zakat to Ibn Saud by individual tribes or sub-sections of tribes, to establish the position of their Arab clients as conclusively as they would wish, or to dispose effectively of Saudi claims which they might regard as devoid of any real foundation. 7. In these circumstances the Secretary of State J) t V P feels that His Majesty's Government have no option but to aim at a settlement on the basis of territorial boundaries. The main alternative solutions on this hypothesis are: (a) a relatively small territorial concession to Ibn Saud immediately to the east of the Blue Line. This concession might or might not be subject to the 'servitude' that no mineral or other concessions would be granted within it by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty's Government and to a group approved both by His Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government; (b) in addition to (a) the establishment of a desert zone, (within which neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty's Government would exercise any territorial sovereignty or grant any concessions) on the general lines put forward in Mr.Rendel's letter to Mr.Laithwaite of 7th November 1934; (c) in addition to (a) the cession to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty, either personal or territorial, but subject to the servitude referred to in (a), of a further area, much more restricted in size than the desert zone referred t o in (b). 8. The Secretary of State has closely examined the alternatives/ 0&gt;v 7 4 alternatives discussed in the preceding paragraph. He is strongly of opinion that it is desirable from all points of view to reach a reasonable settlement of the matters now in issue and he agrees with the Government of India that, given the element of uncertainty as to the legal position of the Blue Line and the unquestioned, even though somewhat vague and precarious, influence exercised in certain areas to the east of it at the present time hy Ibn Saud , it would be well worth making seme concession to the King in return for an agreed limitation of his encroachments and a formal and binding agreement which would delimit the spheres of influence or control of the ruler of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and of His Majesty's Government and their protege's on the other. But he considers {and he trusts that Sir John Simon will agree with him) that Kis Majesty's Government should in the negotiations make the fullest play with the general strength of their position. He notes in particular the statement made by Sir A.Ryan in the Middle East Committee, which has carried much weight with him , that 'Ibn Saud was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of His Majesty's Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the Blue Line', and in foming his conclusions he has not overlooked the indications available to His Majesty's Government that the Saudi Government, strongly as they may feel about the Blue Line, do not feel entirely certain of their position in a dispute on this question with His Majesty's Government. 9/8. 9. The Secretary of State suggests in these circumstances that His Majesty's Minister might open his negotiations on the basis of a relatively small concession to Saudi Arabia immediately to the east of the Blue Line. The Government of India would 'be prepared to go as far as the line Sakak-Habak, which corresponds to the area within which j-bn Saud exercises sovereignty, and possibly also (cf.their telegram of 3rd January) to cede a strip of territory running to the 20th parallel of latitude. Subject to the views of the Service Departments the Secretary of State would be prepared to recognise Saudi sovereignty within an area east of the Blue Line, bounded on the north by a line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa to a point slightly to the south-east of Sakak, but leaving Sakak to Saudi Arabia; on the east by a line running frcm the extremity of the northern boundary just described by the north-western extremity of Aqal (Lorimer, II: 88/9) due south via, but west of Banaiyan, to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Rub'al Kali. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that this would involve the abandonment of Sakak to Saudi Arabia, the acceptance of Saudi sovereignty up to the frontier of Qatar, and the attribution to Ibn Saud of the area between the line Sakak-Mabak-Blue Line and the western limits of Abu Dhabi to which his claim is at least doubtful. The latter area appears to be desert and of little real importance. The position is different as regards9. Sakak. The Air Council have in the past made it clear that they regard it as most important that this place should be regarded as falling within the dominions of Q^atar, so that it should 'be open to His Majesty's Government to make use of it in connection with the protection which it is proposed to give to the Sheikh of qatar in the event of his granting an oil concession to a company approved 'by His Majesty's Government, and that they should 'be at liberty if necessary to pursue raiders across the Q,atar protection limit. The strategic considerations involved in any relinquishment of Sakak to the riing of Saudi Arabia are primarily matters for the Service Departments, who will no doubt independently express their views upon them. Subject to those views the Secretary of State is at this moment content to say that, while he recognises the desirability of including Sakak in the territories of a ruler under our control or in special treaty relations with us, he feels that the confirmation now received from the Gulf that Sakak and Mabak are locally regarded as being under Saudi control and that the A1 Murra, who are in close relation with Ibn Saud, have been established at these points for at least 12 years, coupled with the information previously received as to the existence of Ikhwan colonies there, materially alters the position. He is in these circumstances disposed to think that the potential/10. potential inconvenience to which His ICajesty's Government may 'be sulDjected in connection with the grant of protection to Q.atar were Sakak to fall outside its limits would on the whole, from the political point of view, be a relatively small price to pay were it possible in return to secure the limitation of Ibn Saud 1 s encroachments elsewhere in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast. This is more particularly the case as it should be possible to demand retribution from Ibn Saud in the event of raids across the Q^atar boundary from territory formally recognised as appertaining to him. Within any area so conceded the Secretary of State would on the whole be disposed to agree to the full exercise of sovereignty, including the right to grant concessions without prior consultation with His Majesty's Government, by Ibn Saud. 10. If there seems no prospect of any settlement in return merely for the concessions discussed in the preceding paragraph His Majesty's Minister might then be authorised to offer a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in Mr.Rendel's letter, E.6769/279/91 of 7th Kovember 1934, to Mr.Laithwaite. Under such a settlement, in addition to the territorial concessions to Ibn Saud/mtm vi 0 11. I 'm mm ■ * ■ ■' Saud in the country immediately to the east of the Blue Line referred to in paragraph 9, a special Desert Zone would be created, within which rights would oe personal but not territorial. Within this zone neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty's Government (acting on behalf of their prote'g^s) would possess any exclusive territorial rights and His Hajesty 1 s Government and Ibn Saud alike would renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions and the establishment of permanent fortifications. Both parties would further undertake not to raise objections to the passage of each other's aircraft. The Desert Zone would be subject to a special Desert regime to last in the first instance for a period of say, 10-20 years, subject to reconsideration at the end of that time at the instance of either of the High Contracting Parties. The regime would be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights at present effectively exercised by him over the nomadic tribes/12. tribes, such as the right to levy zakat. The Desert Zone would 'be established and the desert regime regulated by a formal agreement between the two High Contracting Parties. 11. The boundaries of any such Desert Zone might be defined oy a line closely resembling that tentatively suggested in Mr.Rendel's letter of 7th November 1934, referred to above. Such a line would run fran a point immediately south of the 'ells of Banaiyan east-south-east to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 22, thence due south to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 20; thence (subject to the further observations of the Resident at Aden and the Secretary of State for tne Colonies) along the edge of the Southern Sands to a point a given number of miles due north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramaut; fran which point it would rejoin the boundary oi the territory to be recognised as belonging to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty. 12. Boundaries/ I13. 12. Boundaries such as those suggested for the Desert Zone would represent a generous concession to Saudi aspirations. It will be remembered that Mr. Philby, despite his special relations with the King and the fact that he was travelling under the protection 01 Ibn Jiluwi and with guides provided by him, never penetrated east of the 52nd Meridian or south of the 19th parallel; and Mr. Bertram Thomas, in conversation, has not taxen a serious view of Saudi claims or influence outside those limits. But on the assumption that the Desert regiue would be merely one of renunciation of exclusive rights and that its establishment would therefore be without prejudice to the rights in it of the Sultan of Muscat Or the Trucial Sheikhs, the Secretary of State, in the interests of a friendly general settlement, and on the understanding that the fullest play would be made with the concession represented, would be prepared to agree to the boundaries in question. A Desert Zone s o defined, and to the east, north and south of which all claims of any description were relinquished by Ibn Saud (His Majesty 's Government for their part relinquishing claims on behalf of their proteges to the area lying to the west of it), would have the effect of keeping Saudi pretensions weTT away from the coast. The belt of territory between the boundary of the Desert Zone and the sea coast would moreover be suffioxentlj d -ep to m it possible for His Majesty 's Government, should any question arise in future of granting oil concessions in the Trucial Sheikhdoms or in Muscat, to fi^- a limit for such concessions which would leave between that limit and the border of the Desert Zone an area within which the/14. the Royal Air Porce, in discharge of any obligations for protection undertaken to the local ruler, would be at liberty, should occasion arise, to pursue and punish raiders. 15. The Secretary of State recognises that the adoption of this solution would involve sterilisation of mineral development in the wide area covered by the Desert Zone for a considerable time to come, and that sterilisation is not only likely to be unpalatable to Ibn Saud but may even in some ways be unsatisfactory from the point of view of His Lilajesty's Government. So far, hov/ever, as His Majesty's Government are concerned, the Secretary of State feels that they have more to gain than to lose 'by sterilisation. The political problems involved in any development of this area might be expected to be considerable; the difficulty, given the climatic and the local tribal conditions, of satisfactory #r successful exploitation of such mineral wealth as it may contain would in particular be very great. So far as xbn Saud is concerned, the Secretary of State recognises that some difficulty may be experienced but hopes that it would not be beyond the power of His Majesty's Minister to persuade His Majesty to agree t# such a solution. 14. If the Saudi Government are not prepared to accept the Desert Zone solution, which, on a broad view, appears to be much the most satisfactory from the point of view of Hi s liaj esty 1 s Government, the Secretary of State, subject to the views of the interested Departments, vvo^ld then beready, as a compromise, to concede in full territorial or personal sovereignty to I'bn Saud not only the area referred to in paragraph 9 aoove*, cut, in addition, a further area, subject to the 'servitude that within/15. within that area no concessions would be granted by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty's Government, and to a group approved both by Kis Majesty's Government and the Saudi Arabian Government, The further area in question might roughly be contained in a rectangle running from a point due south of Banaiyan to the 20th Parallel of Latitude; thence due east to the point marked as Gardam on Mr. Bertram Thomas's map; thence due north to meet a line running due east from Banaiyan. Having regard to the uncertainty as to the Saudi position in the Central Desert and to the facts stated in paragraph 12 above, he does not consider that if there is to be any question of conceding territorial sovereignty to Ibn Saud any more extensive concession could be justified. ' The concessions suggested in this letter, and that now suggested in particular, are in fact substantially more generous than that recommended either by the Political Resident or the Government of India; and the Secretary of State feels justified in suggesting them only because of the great difficulties likely to be experienced in any exploitation of this area and the desirability of a general settlement, 15. In conclusion, I am to say that v/hile the Secretary of State's views as to the maximum concessions which could be made by His ikajesty's Government and the order of priority in which they should be considered are as set out above, he, like the Government of India, entirely agrees with Colonel Powle that 'before making any definite proposals to Ibn Saud', His Liajesty's Government should 'extract from him a detailed of his claim east of present Blue Line and thus get h?2^ to/to put his cards on the table before we do'. As Sir John Simon is aware, incidental information goes suggest that the Saudi Government are in considerable doubt as to the limits within which they should claim jurisdiction to the east of the _'jlue Line. His Majesty's Government, in the Secretary of State's •view, are in a strong bargaining position and he things it desirable, given the importance of the issues under consideration, thatths.fullest possiole use snould be made of this. 16. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that detailed consideration of the matters now under examination may take some little time and he is aware that nis Liajesty's Minister, in view of the possibility that he may in the near future have to interview Ibn Saud personally, is pressing for instructions. Ke would suggest in these circumstances that if it is impossible in the course of the next few days to reach agreement as to the detailed instructions to be sent to the Llinister, 3ir A. ryan should be informed that instructions will be sent at the earliest possible date and advised for the moment to concentrate, in any discussions into which he may be obliged to enter, on obtaining a clearer indication than has hitherto been afforded of Ibn Saud's desiderata. If the King repeats that he lays claim to tb.e desert as distinct from the coastal tracts, it would, in Sir Samuel Hoare' s view, be desirable, at any rate as a xirst move, to take the line that His Liajesty's Government could not consider anything so extensive or so \aguely expressed and that while they are prepared, in the interests of friendly relations, to make some concession to Ibn Saud, they must insist that it slrall be on reasonable lines. It would, in his view, go far to prejudice/(o 17. prejudice the position of His Majesty's Government in any detailed negotiations that may follow if the Saudis, after the conversations which have passed, in which no hope has been held out to them of any extensive territorial concessions, were to conceive the idea that Hi s Llaj esty' s Government were in fact prepared to make very extensive concessions, even though in an uninhabited desert, in the interests of meeting them. 17.

The Council again desire to point out that from a military point of view an extensive desert area west of Qatar would enable the greatest possible measure of protection to be axfonsd to (^atar. In such an area an intelligence organization could be set up to give warning of raids and over it aircraft could fly in pursuit of raiders. 3 / Under secretary of state, Foreign Office, Q W j . t i 1.2. 3. In the draft instructions, however, the council note that air Andrew ^yan is airected, after first emeavouring ta obtain from Ihn Saud a niore concise statement as to his desiderata, to offer him in full sovereignty an area east of the hlue line hounded hy tne line Baiwa, east of Sakak, the north-western hounaary of Aqai and thence to the south towards Banaiyan, Hiis, as Sir John Simon is aware, has the effect of making the boundaries of Ibn Saud f s territory for all practical purposes contiguous with those of the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Ehabi, and thus ruling out any possibility of obtalnlJifc, early Intelligence oX raiding activities or of pursuing raiders across tne frontiers of (^tar, in effect, tending to make the problem of protection one of extreme difficulty. 4. The Council realise, however, that for the last ten years Ibn 3aud has had virtual sovereignty over the area which it is proposed to conceae, that the territory contains muny settleaents of his tribes, and that it woula be out of the Question to expect him to renounce, at this stage, his sovereignty in the district. They understana also, from sut scanty information as is available, that the settlements are of a more pernb-nent nature than many in Saudi-Arabia, and they gather that in the opinion of the Foreign Office, the likelihood of trouble arising from tnis airection is remote since Ibn Saud should be capable of controlling the activities of his tribes in this area. 5. It is also unaerstooa that the Foreign Office appreciate that in the event of emergency arising it woula be necessary to allow aircraft to take action against raiders whilst in Saudi territory.W) 6* shoula these assumptions te Correct, therefore, the Air Council do not wish to raise any objections to the dralt instructions to sir Andrew f^yan. 7.

My dear ^endel, I write to confirm my telephonic message that the Admiralty have no objection to the despatch of the telegram about the boundary of south-east Arabia. As you know, we would have preferred a special regime for the area to the south-west of^atar, under whict Ibn Saud, although obtaining full rights over the tribes, would not obtain territorial sovereignty. This would enable us to have finger in the grant of concessions and would presumably give us a considerable degree of freedom in dealing with marauding tribesmen both before and after they had crossed the &lt;iatar boundary if we were called upor to implement the undertaking discussed in 0.0. S»32^ (a. 14 No.ll29B). We understand, however, that in the opinion of the political Departments, such an arrangement would certainly not be acceptable to Ibn 3aud, ana also that if he admits that he is unable to control his tribesmen in accordance with his duty as a territorial sovereign, it would be possible for His Majesty's Governiaent to claim the right t carry out punitive operations in his territoiy.

Repeated to Lt-0 A &amp; My telegraci w o* 7» In further conversation on February 7th ij'uad conveyed in studiously disarming language King # s views that it would be preferable not to make outstanding questions suoject of ^neral rjafaefti ttl ens but to deal with each on its merits as in the past. When conversations from wfiich present proposal had emerged were begun last June King ^hat he could not coordinate general policy. His Majesty's Government had diverted course of discussion to settlement of outstanding questions. His Majesty feared that if such questions were dealt with by way of general negotiations and these failed thsir result would be danger- -ously misinterpreted. After some discussion of this communica** -tion in vtfiich 1 took no strong line but was mildly critical, Fuad turned to question of Eastern frontiers. He asked to what form settlement of it would take. Would local Arab Rulers be in any way parties to discussion of it ? He assured me that Ibn Saud had no desire to interfere between His Majesty , s Government and those Rulers but said that King must consider Moslem and Arab opinion and must avoid any appearance of disregarding their position as Arabs.2S 3* I replied that His liajeaty k s Government had never approached matter otherwl ae than as a question of determining boundaries between Saudi Arabia and an area with which they and local Rulers were alone concerned# I stressed fact that latter had placed themselves in our hands as regards foreign relations. 4. Jftiad said that opinion which King had in mind was very ill-informed. he suggested that set- -tlement would be easier if Kulers could be represented in some way by experts or if they would affirm their desire to be represented by His Majesty^ Government# 5# In view of new turn given to whole matter by Ifcad* s communications I refrained from pressing him for precise statement re^rding Ibn baud's desiderata for which I had asked on January 2lst« 6* I promised Fuad a communication about fLuwait j l : - h but deferred it until I could study your telegram m. 23 with previous correspondence. I said that I was awaiting txHt instructions about agent for proposed local conference at Bahrain# We visualised on other questions including that of Trans-Jordanian frontier but only incidentally. 7. My own view is that proposal regarding negotiations cannot usefully be pursued any further, i do not consider now that ar^y of the concessions contemplated in paragraphs 8 to 10 of your telegram no. 8 would attract Ibn Saud sufficiently to induce him to give us satisfaction on our questions for the sake of such concessions. On the other hand Fuad was so profuse in assurances of Jiing settling all questions as to suggest that His Majesty ia nervoua. Thia may independent aettlement with tribe a of Kuwait and possibly other matters# j N : j (js 8# Concession contemplated in your telegram { J Ub# 8 were intended to form comprehensive settlement of outstanding questions. If these are to be dealt with separately question arises whether Hia Majealy'a GovernmentGovernment axe still prepared to offer them# 'Ihere can be no settlement if they simply fall back on Anglo-Turkish Conventions. Difficulty of settlement on any basis whatever is greatly increased by intro- -duction of Arab nation factor. 1 have explained y importance of this in my despatch^o^, 1? and . no . 28 w^c|i should reach you about 11 th and 18th February# Its is enhanced oy moderation of J&lt; , uad # s language under King's instructions on February 7th as compared with his private expression of his own sentiments on January 20th* 9» You may prefer to shelve question. If so» I can play for stalemate but this presents disadvantage that ibn Saud will be left with a sense of grievance and w ^ / y as to future attitude of His A Majesty*s Government. Alternative is, in my opinion, to follow out in your telegram Uo* 8 and to work simultaneously but independently for termination of xuawait blockade which is next most important outstanding question. 10. We must however be prepared for rejection Otg^ 5 of all proposed concessions not merely because of greatest of Ibn Saud's pretensions but because of his acceptance of principle that he must base his action to some extent on Arab nationalist view. i have been specula- -ting very tentatively as to possibility of a scheme based on that of i.e* that His Maj esty^s Government is an agreement between Ibn Saud Sultan of Muscat and ^man and themselves representing all Kulers from Mokalla to ^atar with express consent of those -tiulers on lines of general « a* all parties to recognise each others indepe ndence b. all parties to recognise for a period existence of a positive zone in which none woiild exercise any ri^its of territorial sovreignty. !!•II* ihis solution may be completely impossible. I cannot sa^y that it would be acceptable to ibn Saud# J.n any case it would obviously require long preparation and possibly some sort of a conferenffe to define the desert zone and to elaborate other details# JMevertheless I think it is worth examining, 12* 1 am sending full record of conversation by bag* Ryan# (Copy forwarded to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat under P .L .No•C/14 of 22/2/36).

In that case however you will no doubt consider the possibility oijfollowing up suggestion you yourself made at the end of Middle iiast official Sub -commit'tee Meeting of November 8th, that discussion of Kuwait Blockade question should be taken first. 2. Paragraph 2 your telegram. It is, I suppose, possible that Ibn Saud allow HUad his head in order to see how much he can extract from His Majesty's Government but that if His Majesty's Government reacted violently W Ibn Saud will tighten rein. In any case it must be made clear to Saudi Government once for all that His Majesty's Government will not abandon their established policy in the Persian Gulf in order that Ibn Saud may play with greater effect to pan-Arab gallery of whose intelligence they hold same estimate as Fuad. If King seriously intends to press this point, negotiations on frontier question affecting Anglo -Saudi relations as a whole will arise. i-2- arise • It is therefore essential to disabuse Fuad on this point without delay. 3. I approve generally of your language to Fuad on this question. His queries recorded in paragraph 4 mut« of enclosure in your despatch No.17 were ? impertinent . If he should again allude to promise given to Hussein (I assume he refers to McMahon ? 1916-17 correspondence) short ansv/er is that in that correspondence His Majesty's Government expressly reserved their rights under their treaties with Arab Rulers of the Persian Gulf. These treaties have been officially communicated to Saudi Government. 4, While speaking generally in above sense with whatever degree of firmness you consider necessary to drive home drain points, namely refusal of His Majesty's Government to be exploited in pan-Arab interests you may see fit to add that for their own part, as Ibn Saud is aware, His Majesty's Government have constantly been at pains to promote good relations between Arab States. It is for this reason that they attach particular importance to question of Kuwait Blockade, settlement of which they hope to negotiate with Saudi Government even if general negotiations are abandoned. 6. Scheme for general agreement proposed in paragraph 10 of your telegram under reference is being considered in V connection with your despatch No*28 on which I hope to address you shortly. -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (Copy forwarded to Kuwait, Bahrain and Muscat under P .L.No.C/14 of 22/2/35^.J Telegram From To Repeated to 61/31 &amp; 63/64 XX It* His Majesty's Minister, Jedda.

I have today addressed personal letter to Faud indicating in general terms two alternatives favoured by His Majesty's Government, and suggesting oral discussion with a view to overcoming difficulties which have hitherto delayed progress on those lines♦ Definition of first alternative is based . ^-9/ ^ /ij on my note to ?Saudi Government of August 19th, 1932. I have defined second as follows: ,, to explore possibility of agreement on one particular basis which has been suggested in the past, namely that trade across frontier should be at one or more customs posts in friendly relations with the tribes of His Majesty the King to which all trade should be directed# This second definition has presented some difficulty. I deduce from previous correspondence that solution really favoured by Shaikh is proposal for a single customs post described at (i) in paragraph 2 of Political Agent's report to the Political Resident, No. 126 of 22nd June 1933. Multiple posts were mentioned by Political Resident in the Inter-departmental Meeting of- 2 - of April 28th, 1933 and again in the Shaikh's reply of August 28th, 1933 to Ibn Baud's proposal for uni fication of customs duties. It is clear that, if Ibn Saud decided to have several posts. Shaikh would take same measure to ensure passage of trade through them as if there were only one ? If Faud agrees to second alternative, I presume further discussion should take place here. If so, I would propose asking him in the first instance name of place or places in which it was intended to establish posts. I am sending by bag copy of telegram to Bagdad enquiring as to present position regarding trade between Nejd and 'Iraq.

Paragraph 9 of my telegram No.23 referred only to questions of Eastern frontiers and Kuwait Blockade and contemplated simultaneous negotiations not necessarily simultaneous settlement of those but I have not yet (?omission) questions. Uty present idea is to run them more or less together without definitely linking them up and to deal with all other questions separately. 1 I am still anxious to give priority to Kuwait Blockade but not to the extent of making settlement of it conditional on settlement regarding Eastern frontiers lest L Itin Saud should think he was being asked Blockade under threat that failure to do so would cause His Majesty's Government to refuse any compromise regardiitg frontiers. you approve, I suggest that Kis Iwajestj/'s Government should take earliest possible decision as to whether they are prepared to offer concession in regard to Eastern frontier nothwithstanding Ibn Saud's refusal to bring it into a general settlement of outstanding questions. I strongly recommend this course as insistence on Blue Line would create hopeless impasse and because of doubt cast on tenability oi position by your legal advisers minutes of August 29th. Hafiz /Lj H a ^i z Wahba told me on February 19th that he thought King would be prepared to meet us half way as regards Eastern frontiers. He advocates settlement on basis of allocating tribes and seems to think that such allocation would be as adequate as our previous division though on this point his language was vague• He admitted that Saudi pretentions regarding tribes might be excessive and suggested that experts would have nothing difficult in allocating them fairly. Hafiz Wahba represented Kuwait Blockade question as much more difficult but assured me that customs posts would really be too and would not prevent smuggling. He urged payment in lump sum by Shaikh of Kuwait to Ibn Saud in respect of duty on goods destined for Nejd. I explained Shaikh's objection to this* , 1 started conversation with Fuad on February 20th by reading formal statement of text which is given in my immediately succeeding telegram. I explained that though oral it represented definite view of His Majesty's Government as telegraphed to me. Fuad copied out its exact terms. He offered no comment but presently reverted to question reproduced ys in paragraph 2 of my telegram No»23» I parried adding however that I had so far no detailed instructions as position had to be reconsidered in the light of his communication of February 7th regarding King^ general negotiations* It is easy enough to refuse to entertain Fuad's question on the technical ground that His Majesty's Government alone are concerned but on. wider political grounds I consider it important to meet it in manner which will take some account L. 1X0 ^ • — ■ , £.0f Arab sentiment and also to be prepared with answer to . question suggested in paragraph 4 oi my despatch In my conversation with Fuad I emphasised urgency of Kuwait Blockade question and importance attached to it byt —3 — /'vV His Majesty's Government who would like to see it settled in advance of anything else# Further report follows by despatch. -RYAN-Telegram:- R.

Paragraph 3 . See my telegram No .33. 3. First necessity is to elicit some concrete proposal from Ibn Saud which will indicate extent of his claims. Hafiz Wahba's remarks suggested that he may endeavour to press for a settlement entirely on a basis oi allocation of tribes. His Majesty's Government would not be able to agree to this - not the least because they might find great difficulty in rebutting- the extensive claims based by Ibn Saud on payment of zakat at one time or other by individual tribes Tor sections of tribes. On the other hand if detailed proposals for allocation of tribes are made His Majesty's Government cannot of course refuse mut. to consider them. In that event you should intimate that you will refer them for instructions but add t.iat in view of migratory character of certain tribes you are aware that His Majesty's Government regard a settlement on a territorial basis as the only one likely to be really satisfactory although they would have no objection to a subsidiary agreement if necessary to provide for allocation oi any doubtful tribal elements . 4. Paragraphs 6 and 7. I approve of your language. I assume however that you mentioned only Qatar and Trucial Shaikhdoms /Shaikhdoms because they will be mainly affected by proposed frontier settlement but your observations regarding their foreign relations apply of course equally to Kuwait and Bahrain. 6. No encouragement can be given to Saudi Governriient to hope that His Majesty's Government will allow direct participation of Arab Rulers in frontier negotiations# If j therefore question in paragraph 2 of your telegram No#23 is pressed reply should be that eventually frontier agreement will be between His Majesty's Government and Saudi Government but that views of Arab Rulers affected by it both have been and will continue to be taken into account by Lis Lajesty s Government who are responsible for their foreign relations. This does not necessarily apply in the case ox Muscat but I hope question of coterminous frontiers with Muscat will not arise, at any rate for the present. 5, i will telegraph further regarding renunciation c rights in desert zone but you will recollect from Article 16 of Treaty of Lausanne that there is insuperable objection to a renunciation of rights without specifying that tney are renounced in favour oi any particular partly • -Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs- (Copy forwarded to P.As .Kuwait j Bahrain and Muscat under P.L.No. 260-Sof 2/3/36).Ref.our P.L.

With reference to our recent conversation about Bin Sa ? ud and the R.E duty it may interest you to hear of a conversation which I had yesterday with Shaikh 'Abdullah bin 'Isa. He came to see me about some other matter and by chance began to talk of this matter. He reminded me that since the Turks were in Hasa Bahrain has charged dues on transit cargo which used to pay the full 5% until, very unwillingly. Shaikh 'Isa reduced it to 2% at the request of Colonel Dickson. He does not believe that Bin Sa^ud will make a port at Ras Tanurah because he cannot afford to and because it is not a suitable place for a port. If however a port was made he believes that apart from the loss of actual dues it would not affect Bahrain because none of the important mainland merchants would move there because if they did so they would become liable to the exorbitant taxation and frequent demands of loans by the Government, which are never repaid, and they would have to pay the very heavy customs duties which in some cases are over 100^. He says more merchants from the mainland are coming here mainly to avoid taxation in their own country. Also everyone knows that if anything happens to Bin Sa'ud there will be an end to all law and order in his country. He thinks that as Bahrain holds all the cards if any I i l 'Mm Mm ■iT l |i««jirii(iw-ri i H M IWWWWW—|- : concession is made it should be a small one such as exemption on a certain amount of the King's own imports, he was very doubtful at the idea of reducing the rate generally.

Dated 21st February 195&amp;&gt; Abu Dhabi. As a result of rny recent tour on the Trucial Coast it has been borne in on me that it might be wise to use our renewed friendship with Abu Dhabi and the historical position of that Principality to make for ourselves a key position in Trucial 'Oman. 2. I should have preferred to think over the question more deeply before addressing you, but I do not like to leave it unmentioned in view of Sir Andrew Rya^s negotiations. 3. The Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi have in the past exercised authority over the whole hinterland of Trucial 'Oman from Qatar on the west to Baraimi on the east. Their power has weakened since the death of Hamdan bin Zaid and the present Shaikh (Shaikh Shakhbut) cannot by himself offer effective resistance to the infiltration of Bin Sa^d, but he Btill has influence in Liwah and claims to collect a date tax and to keep an agent for that purpose in Liwah. He still has some influence S. 6. mfp —785S &amp;p—(m .1014)— 18-8-33— 2,00.000. \ /in the(SJ 5 K)l 2. in the rest of Dhafrah, though not, of course, comparable with that in the time of Hamdan bin Zaid. 4. I have fortunately been able to re-establish friendly- relations with the Shaikh and his relations and hope to be able to consolidate them by help in connection with his desire for an artesian water supply and in other matters. 5. After the signature of the air agreement on the 13th February 1935 Shaikh Khalifah (Shaikh Shakhbut»s uncle, an old man of great experience, who wields considerable influence with Shaikh Shakhbut) drew me aside and said that they were afraid that the 'sons of Saqar' (Saqar was the late Shaikh who was killed by a Manasir tribesman) might use the grant of air facilities as an handle against them and might try to enlist the sympathy .f Sa»ud (l gather that they have been in communication with Bin Sa'ud before). They asked for protection of the Government, I'his request was afterwards repeated by Shaikh Shakhbut in the presence of his relations. I made no comment but replied that I would think it over and tell you what had been said. There is, of course, an element of personalities in this, as I happen to know that Shaikh Khalifah is supposed to have arranged for the killing of Saqar. The 'sons of Saqar' live at Sharjah and have at present no following of any strength, but they might form a useful weapon with which to threaten Abu Dhabi. 6. I am not in a position as yet to make any definitive recommendation, but think that we should bear in mind the possibility of so supporting Shaikh Shakhbut that he can gradually re -establish the position of Abu Dhabi in the hinterland and so counter the infiltration of Bin Sa'ud. All that I would urge at present is that during the present negotiations we should use the utmost caution not to recognise as pertaining to B in Sa»ud any rights in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast which may have the effect of estranging Abu Dhabi and which we may deeply regret later on when Bin Sa'ud dies. -olonel Political Agent, Bahrain.Confidential * D.0*No:C/140. ^ ^ C\ -y S6th February 1935 UoV mhiiu -. ««**■ Will you kindly f-efer to the Government of India's telegram No:474 dated the SSnd February 1955 about the Bahrain Transit Dues. 2.

As a matter of fact, Beckett hus # I think, been working on rather insufficient data in one or two parts of his minute. In the first place, I do not think we have ever oontemplated that the ao-culled desert zone should be under any kind of Joint territorial sovereignty. My idea was that it should bj a complete vacuum us far aa territorial sovereignty goes, arid if it corrtaponda to anything, correspond rather to the high seas than to any kind of known territorial area. 3. Secondly, I do not think the India Office would agree to the suggestion that the territory to the north, east and south of the 'ring fence' in the desert area should be regarded as under British sovereignty. It is true tnut from the point of view of international law it is arguable that if a country controls the foreign relations d another country, it has thereby acquired sovereignty over that country for international purposes. You will remember that this was the line we took about Ibn Taud's original protectorate over ^sir, and it is a line which we ar6 increasingly/ Sir Andrew Ryan, X.B.K., C.M.GInoreuaingly inclined to take in regard to our own position in Bahrein and Koweit. But it io rather a Oarge order to say that His Majesty's Oovernment possess international sovereignty over the hinterland of the Trucial heik.hdoifl8 # and I feel sure that the India Office would intensely dislike such an implication* 4. aa regards the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, there is of course no question of our exercising sovereignty, but as we have a perfectly good independent sovereign in the person of the Sultan of Muscat - whose independence for that matter we and the French have by the Anglo-French :)eclaration of 186a specifically undertaken to respect, - the point is not of great importance, since we need only substitute the Sultan of Muscat for His Majesty's Government in the relevant part of Beckett's minute, 5. Ab regards the Hadraraaut, «hioh is now of course an integral part of the Aden rrotectorate, the case for regarding His Majesty's Government as holding sovereignty is of course very such stronger. But the main point is of course that such territories to the north, ea^t and south of the 'ring fence' 1 will be definitely foreign territory so far us Ibn Saud is concerned, while the territory inside the 'ring fence' will belong to no-one# 6. Personally I should prefer as regards the proposed desert zone the analogy of the Arctic regions or the hifh aeas. Ibn Taud will have complete sovereignty over the tribes wandering over this ar'a which are recognised as looking to him rather than to any of the coastal rulers* But he will have no territorial rights of any kind# His authority/authority over hie trihoa will however be greater, alnoe there will be no-ona elae In thia area to oonteat It. on the other hand, If a subject of a Truolal Shellch or of Muooiit or of the Hadramant get a into the desert area, he will be no more under Ibn Saud's authority than would a foreign ship on the high se&amp;B* 7. I have dictated this note very hurriedly in the hope of catching today's bag, as you may like to have Beckett's ralnute with my preliminary coomcnts thereon with the least possible delay. There has not been time to show the draft of this letter to Beclcett before the bag goes. But if he has any further comments, I will have taom Sciit to you as soon as possible• Yours ever, (Sgd.) G # W. KKNDKL.CO?Y. fP 31r A* Ryan aaya 'I appreciate the effoots of aistinotlon 'drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty 'but I am M not clear as to how distinction should be defined juridically 'If necessity arises'. He Is referring, if I understand It, to the outline of a scheme for the regime to be adopted In a certain portion of the desert in South Kastern Arabia which 1® set cut In paragraphs 3-9 of Mr. Rendel f 8 letter to Mr. i ^ ; Lalthwalte In &amp; 6769. The short answer to Sir A. Ryan would f ■be that It would not defeat the efforts of a draftsman to define the regime If the draftsman was quite sure what waa Intended, but he would probably have to do it in a number of articles and in doing so might not in fact choose to use the expression 'personal sovereignty' at all. But to stop there would not be very helpful. I am not quite sure how I can best help at the present stage, but perhaps It may aaalst if I set down (a) a few remarlca about peraonal and territorial aoverelgnty generally and their poaltlon under international law, and (b) my understanding of Mr. Rendel'a scheme, as set out in his letter. Personal aoverelgnty consists in the rights ana juriadlctlon which a 3tate possesses over indlvlduala which are Ita nationals, irreapective of where those nationals may be. Territorial aoverelgnty conaiats in the rights and powers which a 3tate possesses by virtue of its possession of territory. iliere the nationals of State A are in the territory of State A, peraonal and territorial aovereignty coincide and there la no neud to dlstinguiah between them, and you have a relation which in principle la of legitimate Intereat/f&lt;j? interest only to iState A and of no oonoern to any other State* 'hen the nationals of State A are in the territory of State B # you have a position where the two sovereignties exist simultaneously with regard to the same object, and international law has, so to apealc, to draw the boundary between them. It has drawn it in suoh a way a^, in general, to make the personal sovereignty give way to the territorial sovereignty to the extent that territorial sovereignty is held to include the jurisdiction over all things and persons within the territory irrespective of the nationality of the persons. But this does not mean that personal sovereignty, even in these cases, has been reduced to nothing. The liberty of the territorial sovereign as regards foreigners within his territory is limited by certain general principles of international law and possibly particular treuty obliga tions, and any infringement of them gives rights of objection and claims to the personal sovereign, i.e. all the rights associated with diplomatic protection. Further, though unable to exercise jurisdiction over his nationals directly while in the foreign territory, the personal sovereign may make certain demands upon them while they are there and enforce those demands upon them when he can find them within his own Jurisdiction - aemands which he would not be entitled to make in respect of foreigners in foreign territory. In certain oases, as a result of special treaty provisions, personal sovereignty is increased at the expense of territorial sovereignty by the creation of exterritorial jurisdiction - a system under which, to a greater or a lesser extent, the personal sovereign exercises jurisdiction over his/1/ his own nationals, even in the territory of another State. Migratory tribes always create to a certain extent particular problems, but nevertheless, speaking generally, the respective rights of the personal and territorial sovereigns are regulatea according to the ordinary principles in the case of migratory tribes which regularly pass from the territory of one State to that of another in the course of their seasonal moves. If the territorial boundaries are fixed and if, (which is not always the case with regard to migratory tribes but is more usually the case) the tribes are recognised definitely as being the nationals of otate A, these tribes during their migration in the territory of atate B will be subject, in accordance with the ordinary rules, to the personal sovereignty of 3tate A and the territorial sovereignty of atate B # This is, for instance, the case of the tribes that cross the border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia, though in this case the territorial sovereignty of x^thiopia is in any case less than the normal because of exterritorial jurisdiction (incidentally the nationality of some tribal sections is not determined). In some cases individuals may find themselves in a place where there is no territorial sovereignty, viz. when they are in territory which is under the territorial sovereignty of no State. These areas are relatively scarce now, but there are still, I think, portions of dar terri tories over which no State claims territorial sovereignty, and in this case, there being no competition from any terri torial sovereign, they remain solely subject to their personal sovereign and are under such Jurisdiction as he chooses to exercise over them.TX 0 I oome now down to Mr# Rendel's Boheme, of which I understand the main lines to be as follows. An enclave is to be created In South £i)ast Arabia whose boundaries are to be fixed between His llajesty's Government, aa suzerain of the Arab sheik dons on the oast, and the King of Saudi Arabia. To tho west of the wofctern boundary of the enclave the territory is reoo^nised as being under the territorial sovereignty of Saudi Arabia, and to the north, east and south of the northern, eastern and southern bound&amp;ry the territory is under tho territorial sovereignty of JIls Majesty's Ooverament as the suzerain of the sheilcdoas, and the normal division between territorial and personal sovereignty applies. The enclave itself is to be recognised as an area over which neither His Hajesty's Oovernraent nor Saudi Arabia will claim to exercise territorial sovereignty and the rights flowing therefrom, though they will also agree that the territory belongs to one or the other of them and is not simply H res nullius' and open to appropri ation by a third power# In this area they agree upon a rlgirae which they think will be convenient and suitable in the circumstances# Within the enclave, tribes or individuals who are undoubtedly nationals of Saudi Arabia (viz# to take the sxtreme case, persons who live at l^.ecca) or tribes and persons who are recognised as nationals of a truolal sheikdom will be solely under the Jurisdiction of their rospective persoual sovereigns# Other persons and tribes who are not recognised as being nationals of Ibn Saud and, though migratory, may be said to belong to the enclave itsel'T, if they can be said to belong anywhere, will, while the agree ment lasts, be subjected to the personal sovereignty of Saudi Arabia,/\W vo' Arabia, so that Ibn 3aud will axeroiae Jurisdlotlon over them to the extent that it is neoesaary and he thinks fit to do so* But this is only a temporary arrangement; this attribution of personal sovereignty to Ibn Saud is not a recognition that they are his nationals so that he would have any olalm arising out of the agreement to regard them as such when the agreement with regard to the enclave came to an end. Finally, as each party has agreed to refrain from claiming or exercising territorial sovereignty over the enclave, neither party must do things which only a territorial sovereign can do, such as grant concessions for oil exploitation within the area, (ouery, if the question of the grant of any such concession within the area arises, the two parties must consult together and, if it is thought expedient to make a grant, it will be given jointly.) If I have appreciated correctly the nature of Ur. Rendel's soheme, I can see no legal reason why it should not be adopted or why it should be impossible to express It in appropriate language. There may be other points in connexion with it which may require to be settled and defined in the agreement which have not occurred to anybody yet, but which will reveal themselves. One point which. It seems to me, will require to be settled is the manner in quarrels and disputes arising in the enclave between British nationals (i.e. nationals of the Sheiks) and persons who within the enclave are to be under the personal sovereignty of Ibn 3aud are to be settled. Some machinery may be required for this. (Sgd.) W.E. BSCKETT. January 2^, 1935.00PY SEK1 TO, 1/ p.Z. 378/35.

I now enclose copies of further telegrams. 2. We have gone into this question very carefully hereijn the light of the Government of India's views and those expressed by Powle and have provisionally reached the j following conclusions: (a) We agree generally with the Government of India that for the reasons they give there would be great advantage in persuading the Sheikh of Bahrein to drop the re-export and transit duties in the interests of making it unnecessary for ^ i ' ,n/ G.W. Rendel Esq.., C.M.G., Foreign Office.I \ 2. v( 0 I'bn Saud to develop Ras Tanurah, of maintaining the present lucrative position of Bahrein as an entrepot, and of avoiding or postponing the loss of trade and population which, so far as we can judge, would certainly 'be the result of any development of Ras Tanurah. It would seem well worth while for Bahrein, as an insurance against these losses, to sacrifice the small amount collected in re-export duties. The development of oil, and the probability that the Sheikh will receive not unsubstantial sums as royalty, has, moreover, reduced the immediate financial importance of these dues to Bahrein. (b) »ve also agree with the Government of India that it would be undesirable for us to give Ibn Saud any assistance in the development of Ras Tanurah or of any other port on the Arab coast. (c) On the other hand it seems questionable whether any definite assurance could be obtained from Ibn Saud not to pursue his plans for port development. But given his financial embarrassments elsewhere, it seems unlikely that he would be in a hurry (unless he could persuade the Hasa Oil Company to accept financial responsibility) to develop a port/1/ 3. port if he can be sure of obtaining his supplies via Bahrein without 'being liable to re-export duties. Accordingly, if the Sheikh agrees to the abolition of those dues, the incentive to the development of ports in Hasa will be very greatly reduced. (d) While we appreciate the importance of the concession to Ibn Saud which would be entailed if the Sheikh decided to abolish these duties, we agree on the whole with the Government of India and v^ith Powle that it would be better to continue to press for local discussion of this question at Bahrein and that the concession should be made to Ibn Saud's representatives in the course of discussion there. We should on the whole in these circumstances favour maintaining the instructions summarised in paragraph 15 of the record of the inter-departmental meeting of 8th October, taking the line with the Saudis that if they were prepared to discuss the question locally we would give all possible assistance and would ensure that pending discussion no further deterrent action on the lines of the Ahmedi case would be taken. We quite recognise that it may prove impossible to persuade the Saudis to agree to local/\i M r^ 4. ii^i ll ■ local discussion or that this question nay become of such decigive importance as affecting negotiations as a whole that it would be desirable to reconsider our position, and in either of these events we should of course be ready to consider the matter further. But at any rate as a first stage we think the best course is to proceed on the lines which had been agreed before the receipt of the latest correspondence. (e) The reply to the British India might be on the lines indicated in paragraph 5 of Metcalfe's letter of 24th December. 3. As you will appreciate, it would be necessary to bring the Sheikh of Bahrein into line before anything could be said to the Saudis (either in local discussion or in the course of Ryan's main negotiations) about the possibility of abolition of the re-export and transit duties. Yours sincerely, ^ C. WALTON.\1 p.Z.865/35. INDIA OFFICE, mnTEHALL, S.T/.l 14th January, 1935. m My dear Ken, V Many thanks for your letter of the 5th February, E 394/318/25, enclosing copy of Beckett's minute and of the correspondence betyjeen Hendel and Fiyan on 'the question of the legal distinction between 'personal' and 'territorial' sovereignty, which was raised in sub paragraph (c) of Jedda telegram No.6 of 18th January. 2. We agree, I think, generally with the comments on Beckett's minute which are contained in Kendel's letters to Ryan of 24th and 31st January, subject to the following observations, I .R.Johnstone, Esq., Foreign Office. 3. In the first place, as regards the status of the Desert Zone itself. We quite agree that it has not been our understanding that the Deserx Zone should be under any kind of joint territorial sovereignty. On the other hand, we see the dangers suggested by Beckett as involved in regarding it as res nullius and while we also agree with the arguments advanced by Bendel in his letter of- 2 - of 31st January in favour of discounting those dangers and do not dispute that the simplest course may be to leave the point alon^, we would suggest that it might be considered whether Y/e might not alternatively deal with the position of this area on the basis that yjithin it neither party recognises the rights of the othur or abdicates his own rights (or those of his protdgcs) such as they may be. 4. The second point which we would like to examine is Beckett's point that in as much as we control the foreign relations of certain of the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (and of the Hadramaut and the Aden Protectorate) wo have acquired territorial sovereignty over them. 5. We are, of course, now familiar with the strict legal vievtf to which the Foreign Office recently drew our attention, that a State whose foreign relations are under the control of another State is not, in international law, a fully independent State. But (particularly having regard to our frequent and. recent public statements as to the 'independence 11 of Bahrein and to the unreality of a suggestion that, e.g., the Trucial Sheikhs or Qatar, where our influence by land is so small, are not independent States/- 3 - States), we are very reluctant to take this argument too seriously on paper, Y/efeel that it might have a confusing effect, both on Ryan and on the authorities in the Gulf, if an argument -which, -while it may be sound legally, is certainly one which, politically, because of its international as vjell as local reactions^ it v/ould be most dangerous for us formally or publicly to accept, received more than a minimum of emphasis in official communications from His Majesty's Government. As you will appreciate, it would be impossible to suggest that the Persian Gulf Sheikhs (and the same is probably true of the rulers of the Aden Protectorate), when they relinquished control of their foreign relations to His Majesty's Government, imagined or were given to understand that they were surrendering sovereignty over their territories. And it would be equally impossible to ' '' 11 * mm , .iwaw KWI Wim substantiate any suggestion that in securing the pledges in question His Majesty's Government aimed at or thought that they were securing sovereignty or suzerainty over the territories concerned. It seems quite clear then that we cannot press this doctrine, except at the expense of the repeated public declarations referred to above which we have made in regard to Bahrein, etc., and there is/o a. is the risk, too, of facing quite serious issues 1/7 ith the Rulers of the Gulf Sheikhdoms, viho vjould in our viev^ he entitled to complain that they had been trapped into signing a declaration of fundamental importance so far as they were concerned, without any warning on the part of His Majesty's Government that any such importance attached to it. Any decision that we must proceed on the basis of the strict legal view would thus raise very serious issues and could clearly only be approved by the highest authorities. 4. On a minor point arising out of the correspondence, I do not think that we would go quite so far as the suggestion made in Beckett's minute that migratory persons and tribes not recognised as nationals of Ibn Saud, but who might be said to belong to the Desert Zone itself, 'if they can be said to belong anywhere, will, while the agreement lasts, be subjected to the personal sovereignty of Saudi Arabia, so that Ibn Saud will exercise jurisdiction over them to the extent that it is necessary and he thinks fit to do so'. I think all we had contemplated about people such as this has been that in so far as Ibn Saud was in a position/V—— ^ position to collect or had in the past collected zakat he v^/ould remain at liberty to do so, His Majesty's Government turning a blind eye?

It must^ however^ be borne in mind that, when eventually an agreement on the frontier question is reached, it will also be necessary to consider more closely what rights of retaliation His Majesty's Government can claim in the event of Saudi raids on ^atar, and in ceneral whether they should approach the Saudi Government on this subject* Subject to your observations^ I am inclined to consider at present that the best solution would probably be the conclusion of some kind of 'bon voisinage' 1 agreement between His Majesty's Government,on behalf of the Cheikh of Qatar^ and the Saudi Government« I should, however, be glad to have your views on this and on the other points raised by the Air Ministry and Admiralty letters.

The principal correspondents in the file are Andrew Ryan, the British Minister at Jeddah, George Rendell of the Eastern Department of the Foreign Office, Eric Beckett, Legal Adviser to the Foreign Office, and Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent in Bahrain.The correspondence details the preparations for, course and outcomes of a number of unofficial and official meetings that took place between Ryan and Fuad Bey Hamza, the Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs, between January and March 1935. Key points discussed include: Bahrain’s transit dues paid on goods, and speculation over Saudi plans to develop its own port at Ras Tanurah [Ra's Tannūrah]; where Qatar’s southern boundary should be established, based on ongoing geological exploration; what form the boundaries between Saudi territory and Britain’s protectorates should take (for example, geographical, tribal, or neutral ‘desert’ zone); and the legal status of Britain’s claims over its Gulf protectorates, specifically whether the British Government could claim territorial sovereignty over them.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000241#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
