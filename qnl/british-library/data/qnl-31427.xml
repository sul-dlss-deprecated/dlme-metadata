I have received a report from Mr. Gilby, the Officer-in-Charge, Muscat, in connection with the erection of the Engine for our emergency plant at Muscat, and I am writing to ask for your assistance to clear up some misunder standing on the part of your Treasury Officer, Mr. Stephens. In may last you very kindly consented to small structural alterations to one of the outhouses in order that our standby Engine could be housed there. These alterations have been carried out and the work of installing the Engine has been progressing slowly, but we are now faced with certain objections raised by your Treasury Officer, Mr. Stephens which have brought the work to a standstill. He has informed the Officer-in-Charge, thatj- (1) . The Exhaust pipe must not be less than i|5 feet long. (2) . The water tank platform is blocking up the road. (3) . No sketch of the installation has been supplied to the Agency. With regard to (1 ). As you know Exhaust pipes should be as short as possible and to have one the length suggested would mean endless trouble due to carbonization. We intend fixing an efficient silencer to the exhaust pipe so if Mr. Stephens* objection to a short exhaust pipe is noise, this will be reduced to a minimum. Moreover, the engine would be run between 6 am and noon and not during the hours when people are resting. With regard to (2). The cement plinth for the cooling tanks has already been built. If this in any way is an obstruction, Mr Stephens might have informed us before it was completed. I am enclosing a sketch shewing exactly where this plinth has been built. To me it does not appear to be an obstruction, but if you consider it is, ,1 shall have it removed to some other position, although the engineer erecting the plant consider that the Cooling tanks should be erected in this posit!2 With regard to (3)« We have not been asked to supply a sketch to the iigency but if one is really required we would be only too willing to do so, I shall be most grateful if you would kindly clear up the misunderstanding as soon as possible as we are anxious to complete the work, I hope Ziarat is treating you kindly and your health is better.

Dear Sir, As a result of your v message to Gilby today through Jask telling him he could proceed with the work and if possible to arrange the exhaust pipe to deliver through the wall of the compound. I am not sure if this can be effected as I am not in possession of the actual measurements. 24 th August 1937« POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONFIDENTIAL RECORD Date. 3 - SEP. I937 H. fi, M'S CONSULATE; MUSCAT, •W«l For your interest I append copies of letters received by Mr. Gilby from your Treasury Officer at Muscat. It is difficult to understood why this Officer should have raised objections to the site of the tanks at this late date. In April last the position was fully explained to your Treasury Officer on the actual site and as he did not then demur to the proposals it was taken to mean the work could proceed as described to him. Furthermore, as will be seen from another set of copies of letters attached, this particular entrance was opened with the permission of your predecessor, at the Company’s expense, solely to provide a separate entrance for our ov/n clerks and the members of the public visiting our Office. Presumably this was to avoid their having to enter the compound through the Main gate of the Agency. If the facts are as stated I do not see what possible grounds of complaint the Agency Clerks can have if this passage wqy is slightly reduced, although from my information I do not admit the reduction to be of any signi ficance. I am also informed that the area of ground upon which the plinth has been built was unmade ground in a PMcondition quit© unsuited to foot passengers. Regarding possible noise nuisance Mr. Gilby reports officially that he experiences no disturbance from the two engines which are close to his present quarters. And,as explained to you, verbally, our engine is provided with an expansion chamber which acts as a silencer while the engine will not be run,except in dire emergency, during hours when the inhabitants of the Agency Compound would normally be sleeping or resting. The question of fumes is one which I feel is being laboured unduly; one does not reques^stationary car outside one*s house to shut off its engine on account of fumes and many a car with a smoky exhaust gives off more fumes than does a Ruston Hornsby Engine. However high the delivery pipe of the exhaust is taken, the fumes, if any, will still be at the mercy of the prevailing wind. But I am bound to contend that the amount of such fumes discharged direct into the atmosphere is so small as to be as negligible as those of a motor car. I greatly appreciate the very frank way you have discuss ed this matter with me at our last interview and assure you that I desire to meet your wishes in every way possible. I am confident that the completed work will not give rise to any reasonable complaint from your Staff. V.P.S.

The telegram was undoubtedly not delivered and on my making enquiries from the Muscat Office of the Cable and Wireless Limited I received a iette a copy of which I enclose for your information. It is of course fantastic to credit that Government House will accept a telegram for a person who is not employed there as would appear to be the meaning of the enclosed letter.

I consider, however, that I should bring it to your notice that your Officer-in-Charge, Muscat, Mr. J.A. Faithful, is very much in need of a relief. 2. I quote a medical report' submitted to me by the Agency doctor:- 'Mr. J.A. Faithful, Officer-in-Charge, Cable and Wireless, Muscat reported sick on 20-11-41 with fever. He had malaria and gave a history of previous dysentery. This caused a sharp attacl of Hepatitis for which he was treated. The condition has now subsided and he is convalescent and has returned to duty. AS he has completed two years in Muscat I recommend that he should be transferred to Karachi before the next summer, whirt if usually commences in April. DT. Thoms of the American Mission was consulted and is of the same opinion.* 3. It does not take a medical man to see that Faithful is badly run-down. Last summer was one of the worst on record, even for ^ Thornton, Esquire, Divisional Manager, Cable and Wireless (Mid-East; ltd., Muscat.Muscat} and I believe that it might produce serious consequences if he were left here for a third consecutive hot weather. 4.

He did not agree to the erection of the Solar Still on it as he was not sure of our title to the land and he thought that it was just possible that if any new contrap tions were erected on it, the State might ask awkward questions which would raise the question of its ownership and deprive us of the control we exercise over it. Major Hickinbotham also suggested that we might reouire the land ourselves at some future date and, therefore,^ it would be unwise to give anyone else 'squatters’ rights” over it and f 4 .
