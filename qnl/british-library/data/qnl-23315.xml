Please refer to your telegram No. 28 dated the 10th April, 1948. I enclose a copy of a letter I have to-day received from Bird which explains why Thesiger's presence anywhere south of village Hafit would be an embarrassment to him. letter asking him not to proceed southwards beyond Hafit, firstly because he has shown no further signs of doing so, and secondly because I wish to avoid, unless it is absolutely necessary, having to try to restrict his movements. I hesitate to restrict them because, as far as I can see, I have no legal sanction for doing so and there are indications that he might disregard my instructions. I am handicapped in my examination of the legal aspects of this case by lack of copies of the Acts applied under the Trucial States Order * in-Council. 4. As a British Subject Thesiger has, I suppose, a much right to hunt the wild ass in the areas of the independent tribes of Oman as Bird has to penetrate them to negotiate for permission to survey them for oil; but, in view of the economic importance of Bird's mission on behalf of a British Company sponsored by H.M.G., I think that we should, as far as possible, try to prevent Thesiger from going into these areas if his doing so is likely to prejudice the success of Bird's mission. 3.

I thought that you might l£ke to have a few notes on his vfeews. 2 • H is journey . This has consisted of a preliminary excursion into the Hub AL Khali, followed by a trip down the Dhank, Ibri valley to a point beyond Hezwa* At one stage, he was under the protection of the Im n, who issued an Order stating that he should notbe molested. This app -ears surprising, in view of the Imam’s reputed zenophobia. 3. A bu Dhabi- Saudi Boundary. As ihis question will no doubt come under review eventually- nd as Mr Thesiger is one of the few Huropee.ns who have ever studied the boundary area in detail, perhaps H.M.G. might like him to give his views officially on the eventual boundary line which we shopld be prepared to recognise. He has already done so to me informally. 4. Slavery. Mr Thexiger says that the present appalling lack of security for women and children, and indeed for all unarmed persons, is regard -ed with almost as much distaste by the better type of Arab as by ourselves. So blatant has the slave trade now become, that he has seen a party of 43 slaves being driven out of Buraimi like cattle their owners having reverted to the more brutal and less expensive JBthods of former days. 5. - British influe nce• Mr Thesiger is of the opinion that the Buraimi area, so far from opposing an extension of our influence in that area, might eventually even welcome the introduction of such a stabilizing influence as we should provide. He is of the opinion that a Levy Horce of as few as 100 men with modern weapons might suffice to establish law and order in the interior and to put down the slave trade. He is at a loss to understand KX H.M.G’s apparent indifference to this question. He also mentioned the deplorable effect of the fact that, in the absence of any Levy Borce, the Beni Q,itab had been able with impunity to fire on you, Mr Bird, the Residency Agent and myself whilst we were returning from Buraimi. 6 . Shrdkh Rashid bin Said of Dubai. Mr Thesiger told me that ShaiHh Rashid tried to embarrass Shaikh Zaid of the A1 BU Ralah by sending letters into the interior s asking the tribes to impede Mr Thesiger’s progress. His efforts were without success. 7.1 have no doubt that he will be visiting you and the Political Resident when next in Bahrain and will be able to give you his impressions first hand.Ho.C/F-7-19/12 POLITICAL AGENCY, BAHRAIN, The 10th May 1949. Dear Communications Department, We are sending you at Mr.Wilfred Thesiger's request the enclosed cover addressed to the Director of the Royal Geographical Society and containing Mr.Thesiger*s notes on his journeys of exploration in Arabia. We should be grateful if you could arrange to forward it, and, as the notes are most valuable and virtually irreplaceable, we should be glad if you would take special care to see that they reach their destination safely. Yours ever, Agency.■m * y SECRET « &lt;207/8/490) PERSIAN GUt? RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 4th May 1949. I forward herewith a copy of a letter from Stobart containing some cotes on views expressed by Thesiger which you ray fled of interest* I.haw© also had &amp; long discussion with Thesiger myself and there are a few additional points he made which I think ere worth putting on record. \ 1. He is not in favour of stationing Aden Protectorate Levies at Sharjah. He regards the® as of poor quality, they speak a different language frer the local tribes men and he thinks generally that they would cut no ice and certainly not inspire the local tribesmen to enlist. On the other hand, he think© that if a good officer could be found he should be able to raise ® force re cruited from the bedouin tribes and not the local riff raff of the coast in a period of about three years. He is of the opinion that these tribesmen would enlist if they are well paid, fed end clothed and that they are not less promising material than Glubb had to work or to begin with. 2. He says that the Imam wields great influence and that complete security prevails in all the country under his administration from Xbri southwards to the sea. On the other hand, north of this nobody!s rule is recognised and there is great Insecurity. 3. The Huqf area opposite Mssirah Island where Petroleum Concessions Limited want to explore next autumn is the meeting place of four big tribes, all of whom acknow ledge the Imam. If the company*s party goes there with some of the Sultan*© retainers as they propose it is very unlikely that they will be allowed to land dnd if they do succeed in landing they will run into serious danger. 4. It is extremely unlikely that the present Sultan will ever establish his authority over either the insecure area oast and south of Buralmi or the territory to the south »f which at present is under the influence of the Imam. He is too weak and does not maintain suffi cient direct contact with the tribesmen. 2. I am afraid that Thesiger may bo right about the Sultan. With regard to the question of levies on the Trucial Coast I should like to wait until we can raise a local force provided we can afford to do so - a point about which I have some doubt. (Signed) W.

I believe that, if I can achieve a limited penetration in the next few weeks, 7 , ma *^ a ^ e tp progress to the walking-out stage with the Tamiraah Suleiman bin Himyar during this next winter. But, if anyone should intrude on the scene in the meanwhile, the ever-watchful chaperone in the guise of the Imam, Mohammed bin Abdullah al KJialili (whom we have rather appropriately named Mammy for the Sake of Securityl), would redouble her precautions to prevent the seduction of Oman. You may think that I have, perhaps, exaggerated Thesiger*s potentiality for harming my activities. As long as he remains here I can compete with him because the Al Bu Falah are as co-operative as is within their power. If Thesiger precedes me to the south, as I aaid before, no amount of explanation will dispel the suspicion that he is connected with the Company or even with the Daula. His arrival following on the passage of my car to Tanuf (and, incidentally^ that of Shaikh Suleiman also) would be 100^ certainly attributed to the machinations of myself or to you. The bedou’s suspicion and ignorance can hardly be overestimated and I will give you two instances* The Al Bu Shamis Shaikh’s first cousin Mana* (and hence next most influential member of that very obdurate people) still believes that if I even traverse their lands in a car I shall be able to steal a sort of super penetrative glance at their sands and locate the presence of oil or otherwise in one secondi I have done my level best to explain that my knowledge of geology is little greater than their own - but they think I am a deep one. Again, the erection by the Company of b}.ack (a pity it had to be black) flags in Dubai has led to a wild spate of rumours all round here to the effect that the dADIa has taken over Dubai and is paying Said bin Maktum up to, I think, Rs.30,000 per dayl I only mention these absurdities to emphasise what one is up against and Thesiger would most certainly not be Tpelieved when he claimed to be working on his own collecting plants, hunting the ibex and the wild ass.; 53 There was no point in my trying to disguise from vlJ him what I was doing here since he was hound to find out and he has co-operated to the extent that he does not intend moving from this area for some days. I have fortu nately located for him the particular wild goat in which he is interested. It is not an ihex and is, I believe, called Thar and I got a head some weeks ago off one of the locals who had shot it on Jabal Hafit. The horns were different to those of the Indian ibex and I had kept the head with the intention of finding out what it was. Thesiger seized on it and will no doubt present it to the British Museum with the appropriate subscription underneathl He is welcome. Quite apart, however, from everything else I find his activities most embarrassing from another point of view. It suits his book to express his contempt for western civilization and progress; the autombile is something to be abhorred, an invention of the devil ( M he has never owned one and cannot drive one to this day; the knobs on the dashboard are a complete mystery to him; he never rides in one if he can help it because it gives him a cold; he always accepts a lift from me without hesitation). The advent of oil companies on the ,, peaceful H scene of bedouin life is bound to seduce the Arab from his Virtues n it will destroy the bedou way of life and will substitute, in its place, an existence vhich he doesn’t hesitate to deride. A short time ago he slept with a rifle in his hand and awoke at the slightest noise which occured many times every ^ night - and so on. Finally, Shaikh Shakhbut and his brothers have more than once appealed to Thesiger, or Mubarak as he is known locally, for advice on matters concerning their relations with the Daula and I have no doubt concerning the Company. I will not malign him. I think from the little I have heard that his advice regarding With apolog- the Dafela has been sound; concerning the Conpany, I have no ies in that I knowledge of what he has said. But I regard him as a was only recent-menance to our activities whilst having nothing against him ly in a posit- personally; 1 would pay tribute to his intrepidity though, I ion to vouch- confess, I am not a great admirer of travellers in search safe this 0 f notoriety, opinion. This has developed into rather a diatribe but I have had a very difficult passage^here with the A1 Bu Shamis and Hai *m crowd and I am a bit jaundiced about things at present. If I do succeed in reaching agreement with these people, I should most heartily resent Thesiger’s presence in Oman. I shall not know for the next 7-8 days whether ^ I shall be moving south or not but if the first alternative is the answer I v/ould appreciate any help you can lend the Cocpany and, hence, my suggestion that you might care to vi sit these parts in the next 7-8 days. I would of course let you know how things go vi th me through Jackson but I thought you v/ould like to be forewarned. It is getting hot here and the west wind is extremely unpleasant bringing with it the sand and dust from the Enpty Quarter! I wish I could have finished earlier but Mohammed bin Rahmah of the A1 Bu Shamis is a hard nut — and he claims that Shaikh Suleiman wants him to mediate between the Company and himself! God forbid! Yours sincerely, Sd/- Dick Bird.5* 2 Thesiger has, I believe, entered Abu Dhabi territory without first obtaining permission or a visa for Trucial Oman. According to Article 83 (a) of the Order -in~Council the Political Resident is empowered to issue King's Regulations to regulate certain things; but I have no record of any regulation issued under the Order in Council or otherwise which makes it encumbent on British Subjects to get a visa for Trucial Oman before entering it. You might, however, consider moving £he Resident to issue an emergency Regulation under Article 85 (i). In any case, Thesiger has only to move out of Abu Dhabi into the territory of any of the independent tribes of Oman to be outside the scope of the Trucial States Order in Council without necessarily becoming subject to the Muscat Order in Council. 6. If Thesiger now shows any signs of moving out of Abu Dhabi to the south, I intend myself to go to Buraimi to try to dissuade him from doing so on the grounds that his action might seriously prejudice the success of the operations of a British Company which has H.M.G*s support; but I should be grateful if you could telegraph me any additional authority, information, or arguments to strengthen my representations to him. 7 # if Thesiger starts to move from Buraimi without warning before I can get there, my letter (which is already in Buraimi) will be delivered to him.ss BRITISH RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. 27th May, 1950. I fon»ard herewit] anslation of a letter from the Ministry 1 erior Affairs, Muscat to Woods-Ballard whl 1 latter has passed on to Chauncy. Mubarak bin London is the name by which Thesiger is known amongst the local Arabs and it appears that the Imam has now supported the/Sultan*s request report ed in my letter 289/1/50 of the 31 st January that he should not be allowed to visit Oman again. I gather that he has no intention of doing so but should he change his mind I think we should do whatever we can to discour age him unless he first obtains the Sultan^ permission. G.W. Furlo^ge Esq., O.B.E. , The Foreign Office, London, B.W.l.JTC ® TRAMSUTIOK OF A LETIi.fi DATED THE X8TH RAJAB, 1369 (6TH MAX 1950), HO.1202/8, FROM THE MINISTER OF INTERIOR AFFAIRS TO THE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MUSCAT. H We have received a letter from Imam al Khalili in which he says that a man from the British Government calling himself Mubarak accom panied by some Arabs landed at Oman. His entrance was without permission of His Highness the Sultan. He did the same on another occasion. His very movements are considered to be an infringement of the rules which ought to be observed by anyone who wishes to land at the borders of His Highness*s Sultanate. The people of Oman dislike such cases in which the visitor is not in possession of landing permission from the Government and they are afraid of misunderstandings and unfortunate results which may occur in due course, even at the hands of his own companions. It is requested that action may be taken to prevent the man in question and others like him from sneaking into the interior before he has made his application, and arrangements have been made, and the Government have been able to consider the advisability of granting or refusing permiss ion. The result may be intimated in due course.
