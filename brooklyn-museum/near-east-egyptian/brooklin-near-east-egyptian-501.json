There is no coffin associated with the body. The beige, linen wrappings, which seem to be bands of linen as opposed to sheets, are disorderly. \r\n\r\nThis animal is likely a Nile crocodile (crocodiles niloticus) since this is the only species of crocodile found in Egypt today.  Its tiny size suggests that it is a juvenile.  The fact that the crocodile was young when it was mummified suggests that it is a votive mummy. This type of mummy was given as a votive offering at shrines of specific gods, in this case Sobek.\r\n\r\nCondition: The object is in fair and moderately stable condition.\r\n", "medium": "Animal remains (Nile crocodile, Crocodylus niloticus), linen", "dimensions": "1 3/8 x 3/4 x 12 in.
