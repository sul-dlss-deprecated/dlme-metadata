            the Bombay Government (No 354 of 1822), which instructed the Resident to await the
            instructions of Henry Willock, HM chargé d'affaires at the Court of Persia, before
            he pays out compensation to the suffers of Charrack [Bandar-e Chārak] and Lingua
            [Bandar-e-Lengeh] for the loss of their boats. It is noted that as it is unlikely that
            Henry Willock remains in Persia, the Resident has written to his brother Major George
            Willock instead.It states that as for who the proceeds of the sale of the
            Lingua Battile should be awarded to, this is to be decided by the High Court of
            Admiralty in England. However, it is noted that as this deposit was made by Captain
            Walpole (who captured it), Messrs Remington Crawford and Co. (the firm which holds the
            deposit) are unlikely to follow instructions from the Resident respecting it.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054342.0x000032#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
