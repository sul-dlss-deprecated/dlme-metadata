'Jlauce (2) of tho firat paragraph of the Assistant Political Agent»£ letter quoted above seems to have been written under a misapprehension, for although a drawee would become fully responsible for a bill once he had accepted it* it does no„ appear ^though thsrs is no law on the subject in Banrainj that the fact that re too had accepted responsibility would ordinarily absolve other endorsers from responsibility till the bill had finally been p*t# 3 * l under star d that you wish to know whether what is said to tx; the usual practice that is to say, that Courts do not consider protests if not made within 24 hours - is extant in f, ihie is not the usual practice in the Court of the Political Agent, Bahrain* 4. m conclusion, I would add that it does not seem appropriate for the Political Agent to give opinions regarding legal position in hypothetical cases of a kind with which he nmy • • • • •f po3.itic.9l \?ront ?

Re (k) If the bill has once been accepted by the drawee, he becomes fully responsible for the payment and the prior endorsers should cease to have any responsibility.

Letter dated 8th December 1934 from the Manager, Eastern Bank. ^ . i have discussed the matter with Mr Ham who seems worried with Agency letter (S.NO.195; as he considers that it means that the negotiable instrument after it reaches Bahrain could not be negotiated here, he is in favour of discussing the matter with you whenever convenient and if you fix up time 1 shall let him know accordingly.i saw Mr ham and enquiryd from him by showing him his letter dated the 8th inst as what he was driving at. he showed me a bill of Exchange from hobe which had been accepted by the drawee as per his signature on it. he enquired that in case the acceptor becomes bankrupt what was the position of the Bank. 1 said the position was the one as explained in our letter 110.1678 of 26th .November which was according: to the local customs and added that as the cause of action had arisen here he could file a suit against the acceptor and recover his cl im from him. he said he did not agree with this letter as it meant that the collecting bank is entirely resposible for payment after the bill has been accepted in Bahrain and that bill once accepted immediately becomes not negotiaole. He further added that if the foreign banks happens to Know about this local law the British and the Indian trade would be blocked altogether and said that it would also be impossible for him to discount the local bills. l said it was for him and the P.A to consider over this matter. He suggested that if the Negotiable instrument Act applicable in india was introduced here as far as foreign bills were concerned it would save the position. Ke the letter under reference I said that it was difficult for the Agency to give opinion as whether the points raised by him were lega-l or not as it could not support it by quoting any law thereof. 1 advised him that it was safe for the Bank if the ’protest 1 was clone on the due date so that the original banks may not lose the chjance of their recourse against the previous endorsers who might raise objection that the ’protest’ was not done on the cue date, l said that whenever he does any ’protest’ he does it not to lose the recourse against the prior endorser and when he gets it done by the h.A he returns all the papers back and finish with them and knows nothing after that. 1 also said that there has not been any case here against any acceptor while we know nothing what happens in india after he sends back the papers. 17/12/54KaA 'V' SV- t~o yvA 7* ?&lt;^ A $J'lb$ uw ^' l ^'^fV : . i . c^jjl } c^wvxy*^*) \XC^X^ rwru^-y^ ^ MT ^7? ^ '^'v^- ^ T-J ; ^ prfpi I saw Mr Ham on the 9th January 1935. 7/hat he really wants to Know is :_ P ' A *’ s (i) Would the sixpiji&amp;iii Courts hold it necessary for a hill °i exchange to be protested for non-acceptance within 24 hours ? (ii) Once the last drawee has accepted the bill, do the P.A.’s Bahrain Courts regard the intermediate drawees as relieved from liability in the event of the last drawee finally refusing to pay up or oeinp- unable to pay up? A The Banx are frightened by para. 1 (2) of S.fl.195. iSThat was the authority for the statement that prior drawees should cease to have any responsibility ? I gather that the real point which is troubling the Banx io that in the still old—lashioned ways of Bahrain ,there is a good deal of laxity over meeting an obligation at any preci moment - for example if a bill were to fall due during some rejoicings,the man responsible might not meet it and later fefuse to - but the Bank, would not have protested within 24 hours.
