I now learn from a note verbale dated November 17th from Iraq Ministry of Foreign Affairs that Iraq Government have agreed to tne appointment of^ an Indian Vice-Consul at Basra who will enjoy all amenities normally granted to Foreign Consular representatives in Iraq on basis of recipient treatment on the part ^ nf India for Iraa Consuls in India.11 1 1 * ooNFuarriAL (By bag) 676/9/46 British i^nbesay, Bagdad* 2/th Sept.eraber, 1946 (De?r Crichton) You may remember that for some time we have been pressing the Iraqi Goveriijaeat to agree to the Government of India’s proposal to appoint a Trade Commissioner and a Vice-Consul to reside at Basra* The oorrespondence rests with our Notes Verbales of the 3rd and 12th August to the Iraqi Ministry of Foreign Affairs which were copied to the Government of India on the 6th and 13th August respectively* The Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs before he left for England told me that his Prime Minister was making difficulties about these appointments on the grounds that he had great admiration for Mr* Jinnah and did not see why he should grant favours to an India Government which the Prime Minister claimed was M brutally suppressing Moslems n * I made as good a case as I could for the two appointments and begged the Minister for Foreign Affairs to try and persuade the Prime Minister not to allow his personal prejudices to enter into international politics. However, when I saw the Prime Minister himself on the 21st September he made the surprising statement that the Iraqi Government did not recognize the new Government of'India because it excluded the Moslem League. ‘ The League had supported Iraq over Palestine and the Iraq Government would support the League* The Prime Minister went on to say that his Government would not therefore agree to the proposal by the Government of India to appoint a Vice-Consul and a Trade Commissioner at Basra. If the Government of India in revenge asked for the removal of Iraqi Consuls in India the Iraqi Government wauld withdraw them* J ^ *•' This surprising, though not uncharacteristic, caprice of the Prime Minister has reminded me of a remark attributed to Carlyle, I think who hearing that his female cousin had decided to recognize the universe, replied 'My God 1 She'd better.' I should explain that the present Prime Minister is a man of strong prejudices whom no amount of discussion or argument can move from a position he has once decided to take up. His tenure of office is now likely to be of very short duration, however, and I think we may take it that he will resign before the end of the year. It /therefore D. C. I. Crichton, Esq., Secretary, External Affairs Dept*, Government of India, * New Delhi*therefore appears to me that the Government of India is faced with two alternatives. They can either allow the question of the appointments of a Vice-Consul and a Trade Cocmissioner to Basra to pend until there is a change of Government in Iraq # which as I say may take place any time now; or else the Vice-Consul and Trade Commissioner could be appointed to the staff of the British Consulate-General at Basra. The Prime Minister said that although he would not recognize officials appointed by the Government of India he would not mind a Consular officer and a Trade Conmissioner being attached to the British Consulate General at Basra to deal with Indian affairs; and the Consul-General at Basra for his part has indicated that as far as he is concerned there would be no difficulty about such an arrangement. Nevertheless,* seeing that there is likely to be a change of Government in Iraq so soon, I imagine that the former alternative would be preferable to the Government of India* I myself would prefer it* t ' n * (signed) Douglas L.

X agree with the arguments set forth in iSr* Knight’s despatch and I consider that the iiaportanee of Basra froca the point of view of India entirely Justifies the establishment there of an Indian Vice- Consular post. Not only do very many Indian pilgrims to the Holy Cities of Iraq cosie through Basra, but -.any Indian merchants also have in ter eats in this country and go in the first place to Basra. It appears to me, frou* ay personal experience, than an Indian Vice-Consul is not leas neceasaiy in Basra than in Jedda or Bagdad. 3* I also agree with Itr. Knight in his rcoou^endation of Khan Eahib Klan Abdullah for the post of Indian Vloe-Ccnaul if it la created. I think there would be great advantage in having as Indian Vice-Consul a man with the experience of Khan Sahib Abdullah, and it would moreover be a fitting reward for his long years of service to the British Crown. I therefore trust that the Government of India will give this proposal their sympathetic consideration. 4« I am sending a copy of this despatch with enclosure to the foreign Office and (without enclosure) to His iEajeety’a Consul General at Basra.

December 6 t: 4 42 I O n ^ ! °46 Sir, 11 I have the honour to inform Tour Excellency that I have for some time past been considering the desirability of the appoint ment of an Indian Vice-Consul to this post. There is, as you are avare, a large traffic in British Indian subjects passing through Basra. The bulk of them is comprised of pilgrims going to and fro between India and the Holy Cities of Iraq. There is a large British Indian community in Basra itself who bring many of t&gt;eir problems to this Consulate-Ceneral, and there is a good deal of passport work in connection with the Journeys of local Indian merchants. There ln addition frequent enquiries in connection with Indian trade, ana taese will increase as business gradually returns to normal. A recent great increase in the pilgrim traffic through this post ^hich incidentally shows signs of increasing still further) obliged the Indian Pro-Consul, Khan Sahib Eian Abdullah, to put in very long hours in connection with this part of his duties, which also include shipping. 2 # in yiew of the amount of work and time devoted to Indians it would seem not unreasonable to expect the Government of India to appoint to this post someone to look after their own special interests, ana to remunerate him from Government of India funds. t 3 , Taking into account the long and loyal service of Khan oahib iiian Abdullah in this Consulate-General - he has now' been seventeen years at this post end twenty-eight years in Iraq - I have no hesitation in recommending this officer for the position of Indian Vice-Consul. 1 .e choice would in every way be an ideal one in view of his knowledge local conditions, his fluency in Arabic and Persian as well the principal Indian languages, never to speak of his tact and P^teness v^hon dealing with all .:ie:.iers of the public. I should accordingly be grat u if Your Excellency could see your way to approach the Government of India with a view to the Khan Sahib*s appointment to the prqposea new post. 4* Extra copies of this despatch are enclosed for transmission to the Government of India and the Foreign Office if desired. I have the honour to be, str , a Tour Excellency' s most obedient servant. (Sgd.) W.L.C.KNIGHT.
