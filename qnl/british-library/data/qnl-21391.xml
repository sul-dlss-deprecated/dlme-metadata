Ihe activities of the A. I. O. C. in their Central and Southern Areas (see footnote) in South Iran cover a triangular area of approximately 9,000 square miles, the points of the triable being Abadan (refinery and oil port) in the south-west S “ a &gt; In . t ie north and Ganaweh (port) (test area) in the '“on Whl,8t ° ther ^ - aVaiIab ^ ** future Che greater part of this area lies in the plains of Southern Arabistan (Khuzistan) bounded on the south by the Persian Gulf, on the west by the Karun River, while the line on the north- east side of the tnangle extends to the foot-hills of the Bakhtiari section of the Zagros mountains for a maximum distance of 30 miles. It is m these foot-hills that oil is found, the two producing north f PreSent being Ma 8 iid-i-Suleiman in thf north and Haft Kel, some oO miles further to the south-east Development work is progressing at Gach Qaraguli (Gach Saran) and a new main oil pipe-line has been laid from the Gach Qaraguli (Gach Saran) field to Abadan.

Thence to the most northerly point, Lali is a distance of 160 miles. M ' 8 a The whole, of Southern Arabistan is a flat alluvial plain being broken in one place only by a range of hills running W. N.’ .and E. S. E„ which the Karun river pierces at right angles at Ahwaz. These hi Is are of red sandstone and rise to 200 feet the entire length of the range being about 30 miles. The level’ so P rnh P tT n8 T m ° 8tly barren and thinly s P r mkled with desert scrub, though some portions of it are grassy and in the snrine bear patches of wheat and barley.

Date trees line the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab, of the upper Bah- pnfl.palnr channel bounding Abadan island, and of the Ivarun to 20 miles above Mohammerah (Khorramshahr). The only navigable river is the Karun. The Jarrahi river flows into the Fallahieh (Shadgan) marshes where it forms a large lake with an overflow into the Khor Musa. Some 40 miles further east the Hindiyan River enters the Gulf. Both the Karun and the Jarrahi run generally between steep banks of some height. North-east of the general line Sham Saidan—Khalafabad Dar-i-Khazineh—Ahwaz low slightly undulating country occurs up to the sharply marked edge of the foothills where steep, naked rocks rise abruptly from the plain to form a ridge varying in height from 1,600 feet to 2,000 feet. Thence a series of parallel ridges with steep stony slopes, running uniformly from north west to south-east, succeed each other, rising from about 1,500 feet to 2,500 feet with occasional peaks of greater altitude. The intervening valleys are undulating and treeless, covered with grass in the winter but more or less barren in summer. The water which drains from them is generally bitter, being im pregnated with mineral salts. This quality is characteristic of nearly all rivers in these hills, v. ith the notable exceptions of the Karun and the Rud-i-Zard ; (the upper .Jarrahi) the Marun and the Zuhra. The general layout of the Central and Southern Areas of the A. I. O. C. oilfields is shown on Map 1. The main oil pipe lines run from M. I. S. to Abadan. 1 hese are joined by three main oil pipe-lines (from Haft Kel) at Wais and two other lines (also from Haft Kel) at Kut Abdulla. The oilfields at Masjid-i-Suleiman cover about 104 square miles in area. The oil pumping station and the power station, on which the water supply to this field depends, are located at Tembi. The main water pumping station for the field is on the Karun at Godar Landor, immediately to the north-east of the field. The original water supply pumping station for the oil field at Masjid-i-Suleiman was situated at Dar-i-Khazineh. When the Godar Landor system was installed the Dar-i-Khazineh system was kept for a time as an alternative system in case of emergency, but the station has since been demolished, and the water pipe-lino lifted. An emergency water supply derived from shallow wells is being developed in the Naftak area at the north-west end of the field.The pipe-line itself is not considered especially vulnerable, as any damage can be repaired easily. 3 The oilfields at Haft Kel cover an occupied area of 100 square miles. The power house is located at Haft Kel, while the water pumping station is at Rud-i-Zard, at the junction of the Rud-i-Zard and Ab-i-Ala rivers, about 10 miles south-east of Haft Kel. The two oilfields Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Kel are con nected by a good metalled all-weather road. Masjid-i-Suleiman and Dar-i-Khazineh are similarly connected. Masjid-i-Suleiman and Dar-i-Khazineh are also connected by a light railway. Dar-i-Khazineh is the riverhead for main line communication by water up the Karun River from Abadan. Ahwaz is the capital of the province of Arabistan (Khuzistan) and an important Iranian political and military centre. The Karun in forcing its way through the low red sandstone hills at Ahwaz creates a series of rapids, which necessitate transhipment sj^stem between Tembi and Abadan, viz., M-- 11 - in', Kut Abdulla and Dorquain.

Masjid-i-Suleiman and Dar-i-Khazineh are also connected by a light railway. Dar-i-Khazineh is the riverhead for main line communication by water up the Karun River from Abadan.

The pipe-line itself is not considered especially vulnerable, as any damage can be repaired easily.4 A fair weather M.

T. roads. Other roads, fit only for light M. T. in dry weather, leading to the various test points in the Southern Area are shown on Map 1. A comparatively new feature in Arabistan (Khuzistan) is the southern section of the trans-Iranian Railway which starts from the port of Bandar Shahpur on the Khor Musa and runs through Ahwaz to Tehran. Owing to the undeveloped state of Bandar Shahpur and insufficient rolling stock, this line of communications is at present inadequate to meet the requirements of a large force. At Bandar Shahpur however, extensions to the existing jetty are in hand, and additional rolling stock is reported to have been ordered for the Railway.

Climate. 1 he climat&lt;‘ of the area, with the exception of the marshy localities of f allahieh (Shadgan) and Hawizeh (Havizeh), is on the whole healthy and can be compared favourably with that of Iraq. Of all districts possibly Ahwaz is the most salubrious, having a moderately dry climate with cool nights in the summer ; during the Great Y\ ar casualties from sickness amongst troops stationed there were very slight. Despite the rise in height, then is little difference in maximum temperatures between the hills and plains, though there is an appreciable difference up to 10 in minimum temperatures. The heat in the summer in the marshy districts is almost intolerable, while mosquitoes abound to such an extent that even natives take refuge inside nets. The winter, which may be reckoned from the beginning of November to the end of February, is ideal. Rain falls in December and continues intermittently until the end of March, with usually a break in February, which divides the rainy season into first and second rains. The average annual rainfall is 12 to 15 inches in the hills, decreasing to about half that amount in the plains. Cold north-west winds are a feature in the hills, but do not necessitate anything more than normal will ter scale of clothing and bedding.

Until the end of duly a strong north-west wind is experienced, moderately cool till June, after which it becomes hot by day but keeps down the temperature by night. In places where it comes off a sandy desert, as is the case along the Kanin after roughly the first 50 miles from Mohammerah (Khorramshahr), the dust carried bv it is very irritating to the exposed parts of the body. During August and September and sometimes as late as the middle of October, damp south-east winds are prevalent. They are most trying to endure and unhealthy, bringing with them mosquitoes from the marshes, and as a result malaria. Mos quito nets during these months are essential. Lack of water and extreme heat make operations, at any distance from the Ivarun river or the regular water supply system of the oilfields, impossible from June to September.6 Mirage is experienced at all times of the year but to a less degree in the summer. It is most intensive in March and April, when visibility is sometimes restricted to half a mile. Diseases peculiar to tropical and sub-tropical climates are few. In addition to diseases usually met with in temperate climates, the chief causes of wastage are malaria and dysentery. Heat stroke is not uncommon in the hot weather and small-pox is fairly common. Cholera is occasionally brought by travellers. Phthisis is not common, but occurs with some frequency in towns. Bronchitis and pneumonia are prevalent in February and March. Venereal diseases are common in all their forms, though rarely found, amongst the tribes. Eye diseases of every description and isolated cases of plague and typhoid are to be found. The water from the Karun and the Shatt-el-Arab at Abadan is sweet, but should be boiled or sterilized, particularly in the vicinity of towns and villages. Bathing in the lower Karun needs care, as sharks are found as far up as Ahwaz.7 CHAPTER III. Population. The tribes living within, or in close proximity, to the area of operations of the A. I. 0. C., can be divided into three main groups:— (a) The Bakhtiari, whose territory lies in the mountain* between Shustar and Isfahan and includes the foothills in which the oilfields of Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Kel are situated. (b) The Kuhgalu, a few of whom live in, but most of whom live immediately west of the A. I. 0. C. Southern Area. (c) The Arabs of the plains on either side of the pipehne and in the neighbourhood of Abadan, together with large settlements of Iranians from the interior, attracted by regular employment with the Company and on the State Railway. Sec. 1. The Bakhtiari, the most important division of the Lur race, are divided into two main tribal groups, the Haft Lang and the Chehar Lang. The Haft Lang are the main federation, estimated to number roughly 30,000 families, a«4 migrate between their-suminPE graaing-gronndn in the Chohar Mahal, and thair ■ witrtrr'TftlTrrtm)—m-the—foothills ; Masjid-i« Suleiman is situated in their territory. The Chehar Lang consist of two clans, each numbering about 4,000 families. One clan is non-migratory and lives in the foothills south of the Karun river • Haft Kel is situated in their territory. The other clan migrates between its summer quarters in Selakhor and Fereidun, and its winter quarters near Dizful. The number of fighting men among the Bakhtiari is esti mated to be roughly 30,000. As a result of the policy of dis armament of the tribes pursued since 1928 by the Iranian Government, it was estimated in 1931 that not more than 2,000 rifles remained in secret possession of the tribes in the whole of Bakhtiari; it is very unlikely that any increase in this number has occurred since that date. Formerly, the Bakhtiari enjoyed a reputation as formidable fighters. Long contact with Iranian civilization has deprived them of much of their warlike character. Their neighbours, the Lurs of Western Luristan, and the Kuhgalu tribes, are still in a8 more primitive state, and are better fighting men. It is doubt ful whether by themselves the Bakhtiari would stand up against any organized military force or even against their more warlike tribal neighbours, unless in greatly superior numbers. As a fighting force, they are no menace to a Central Government which has any power in the provinces. On the other hand, the Bakhtiari still possess much inde pendence of character, and are capable of great endurance for short periods in their hill country. Although their fighting qualities are questionable and barely 2,000 would be armed, their predatory instincts, their physical endurance and then- large numbers would make them a source of anxiety in the oilfields, if there were any loosening of control over them by the Central Government, particularly as the power of their Khans has been destroyed. With training and leadership, the Bakhtiari might prove useful auxiliaries. Sec. 2. The Kuhqalu, like their neighbours the Bakhtiari are a division of the Lur race. They inhabit the mountains immediately west and within easy raiding distance of the I A. I. O. C. Southern Area. A few live actually within the Sou thern Area. They are estimated to number 15,000 families, or roughly a total of 75,000 souls. They on - l^lt -“ a -^ t - J1 * innf ’ n»^-nrft-.en only frWB, the Taller i tti thn UMighlMniring —slopes. They are «- divided into two main sections, which are each farther sub divided into five sub-sections. Unlike the Bakhtiari, they were not under a central tribal authority, each sub-section being independent and often at enmity with one another. They are wild and lawless, more primitive, and definitely better fighters than the Bakhtiari. Their fighting strength is estimated at about 12,000 men, but, owing to inter-tribal feuds, combined action by the tribes as a whole is unlikely in the extreme. They were largely disarmed by the Iranian Gov ernment in 1930 and have given little trouble since. The number of rifles still in their secret possession is believed not to amount to more than a few hundred. The sub-divisions of the Kuhgalu are given in Appendix I. Sec. 3. The Arab Tribes in or near the area of the com pany’s operations number about 195,000 souls. They are divided into six main tribal groups west of the Kanin river, two9 main groups east of the river, and a third in the Abadan-Moham- merah (Khorramshahr) area. In addition to those groups there are some 20,000 Arabs situated east of the Karun who belong to no tribal confederation. The various groups are given in detail in Appendix I. Some of the tribes are settled, others are nomads, and others again are in a transitional stage between the two modes of life, but all are Arabs and are similar in character and customs. As there is no difference of race, a constant interchange of sections occurs. Intertribal feuds, bad harvests, and the migratory ha bite of some have, in the past, caused whole tribes to disperse and be merged into other groups. The tribal system is thus by no means rigid or permanent. It prevails only to a limited extent throughout Arabistan (Khuzistan), as the Iranian Govern ment’s policy of actively assisting the disintegration of the tribal system has met with marked success ; in a very few years it will have disappeared completely. In 1925, Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah (Khorramshahr) was removed and remained virtually a prisoner in Tehran until his death in July 1936. Since then the power of the smaller sheikhs has been completely broken and the tribes themselves disarmed. Iranian officials have been sent to the more impor tant tribal centres to administer the affairs of the tribes. Road Guards (Amnieh) have been established, and customs and revenue officials posted in these centres. The tribesmen have been left undisturbed to lead their ordinary existence. Each small group or section is under its headman, but the latter now receive their orders not from hereditary sheikhs but from the officials appointed by the Iranian Government. This almost complete disintegration of the tribal system, com bined with economic causes, has led numbers of tribesmen to migrate to Abadan to seek employment w r ith the A. I. 0. C., or to Ahwaz to work on the trans-Iranian railway. Others have moved into the date-growing belt along the Shatt-el-Arab. The fighting strength of the Arab tribes is estimated at 40,000. The extent to which the tribesmen have been disarmed is largely a matter of conjecture. Whatever quantity of arms and ammunition they have been able to retain in secret, the authority of the Government has completely put a stop to the open carrying of arms, and security, even in remote districts, has been effectively established. Energetic measures on the part of the customs authorities render smuggling of arms a difficult and dangerous business. It is, therefore, improbable that the num ber of secret arms is more than a few hundred.10 '['he fighting value of the Arabs of this province is not con sidered to be equal to that of their neighbours of Iraq. They are still in a comparatively primitive state of civilization. They are excitable and liable to be roused by religious propa ganda, although they are not essentially fanatical. During the Great War three of the main tribes, the Beni Turuf (west of Ahwaz), the Bawish (Ahwaz area) and the Cha ab [1 allahieh (Shadgan) district] were influenced by a jehad organized by the Turks, and the two former were a source of trouble to the British force sent to protect the oilfields. There is now, however, among the Arabs no feeling of hos tility towards Europeans. In the event of the collapse of the Iranian Government’s power in the provinces, tribal leaders might possibly again appear from among those of the deposed sheikhs who are still in the province or more likely from among the headmen of the tribal sections; the absence of a central authority would enable the more unruly sections to resume their predatory habits and there would be a recrudescence of lawless ness outside the towns. It should, however, be possible for the company to continue its operations without serious inconvenience from the Arabs by subsidizing the tribes in whose area its operations are situated.11 CHAPTER IV. Base Ports. Four possible ports exist for consideration as base ports for a military force operating in the A. I. 0. C. area. These are— (a) BASRA. (b) ABADAN. (c) MOHAMMERAH (KHORRAMSHAHR). (d) BANDAR SHAHPUR. Sec. 1. BASRA (MARGIL or MAQIL) is situated in Iraq and was developed as a base port for the Mesopo tamian Expeditionary Force during the Great War. loday it has every facility for use as a base port for a large force. It is situated on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab and approximately 70 miles from its mouth. It is the terminus of the Iraq railway system and connects with Ahwaz by river and a fair weather M. T. road. It is capable of accommodating vessels up to about 10,000 freight tons and 600 feet in length. Ample wharfage :s avail able. Under the terms of the Anglo-Iraq Treaty of 1930 should either signatory become engaged in war, the other is bound to come immediately to its aid as an ally ; the help of Iraq to consist of granting all facilities and assistance in her power, including the use of railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes and means of communfcation. Reasonable reliance can, therefore, be placed on the use of Basra as a base port for operations in defence of the oilfield area, if required. The possibility, however, that conditions in Iraq, or the actual circumstances, demanding interventions in the oilfields area might make it politically undesirable to use Basra as a base port should not be dismissed. Full details concerning Basra are given in Chapter VII of the R. A. F. Military Report on Iraq. A copy of this chapter is kept in Army Headquarters.12 Sec. 2. ABADAN is situated about 30 miles up the Shatt-el- Arab on the left bank. (See map 2.) / It is essentially an oil port and handles the entire output of the oilfields. It is capable of accommodating vessels up to 30 feet draught (and over) and about 400 feet in length. It connects with Ahwaz by river and a fair weather M. T. road. There are good facilities for landing stores, vehicles and animals. In an emergency and for a small force, Abadan could be used as a base port, but its protracted use on anything but a small scale is bound to affect its primary role as an oil port. Further details are given in Appendix II. Sec. 3. MOHAMMERAH (KHORRAMSHAHR) is conveniently situated at the mouth of the Karun river for transhipment of stores into river craft. .4 J ett y h as been built in the Shatt-el- Arab on the right side o*f the Ivarun with berthing space alongside for one large vessel or two small ones Only ships drawing about 20 feet can normally cross the Mohammerah (Khorramshahr) bar and enter the Karun river. Vessels usually anchor in the Shatt-el-Arab. Mohammerah (Khorramshahr) is the headquarters of the Iranian Navy. In general, the facilities are insufficient for a base port for a force of any size. Further details are given in Appendix III. Sec. 4.

Sec 2 ASSISTANCE BY A. I. 0. C.—The chief trans portation agency is the A. I. 0. C. It controls the whole port of Abadan above low water mark, including such Municipal services as water, electricity, fire craft, transhipment facilities, and its own road making ; and is capable of absorbing additional shipping. The chief exceptions to its complete control are :— (a) Shipping at Abadan, including berthing, pilotage etc., all of which are under Port Directorate, Basra. (b) Railway wharf and Iranian railway at Ahwaz. Any force operating in the defence of the A. I. 0. C., oilfields must, therefore, employ the A. I. 0. C., as its chief transportation agent. In addition the A. I. 0. C. are capable of providing materials required for the extension of existing services, such as water, electricity, the Abadan light railway and transhipment15 facilities at Ahwaz, and of commissioning and preparing river craft for military use. A temporary cessation of A. I. 0. C.’s own construction or transportation will not affect the delivery of oil from well to tanker, although protracted diversion of a large part of the A. I. 0. C.’s resources from their proper duties will affect their own maintenance or new works and hence affect the oil output in time. When the demands of a defence force are small, there is no objection from the point of view of the oil output, to the A. I. 0. C. assisting the Army to its full extent in the first couple of weeks and afterwards acting as carrying agents for the supplies of the force, even if that force is expanded up to a division later. There may be a few minor exceptions to the above, but it re presents a fair general principle on which to base the maintenance project. ruT^F *- 7 - tha-A— 1 „ (1 f maintain-a Binall Hoot of airoroft-for thci£* *- own ,tram»poTt--pui (nisr.*. A list of aerodromes and landing grounds is given in Appendix XVIII. iS'ec. 3. FHK KARl 1 y, RI\ER. {a) Abadan or Alohamtne.- rah ( Khorramshahr) to Ahwaz.—The navigation of the Karun river is very simple compared with that of the Tigris, as its channel is more permanent and less subject to variations in the positions of sand banks. It is, however, liable to more violent and irregular changes of level than the Iraqi rivers. Low water is generally from August to the end of November. The navig able draft at dead low water for steamers should not exceed 3 ' or for barges 2' 9'. In December and January there are usually considerable rises, which, however, vary greatly in extent from vear to year. Towards the end of January or beginning of February the river usually sinks, to rise against with the spring floods, which begin at the end of February or the beginning of March. At this period and as late as April very violent and sudden rises may occur and in the second half of April there is the greatest mean volume of wateu in the river, which sinks steadily through May and continues to decline through June and July. The difference between high and low wate/may be taken on the average as 12—14 feet. to the commencement of the rapids 1 1 miles below Ahwaz, the Karun is in most parts and in ordinary seasons navigable by a vessel of 5 or even 6 feet draught. Ves sels of 12 feet draught can reach Sulamania bend, 14 miles above Mohammerah.16 The rate of the stream in high river is 4 to 6 knots, in low river about 2 knots. The river is 2 to 5 cables wide. The channel is tortuous, especially above Ali Hussain, 31 miles from Mohammerah, and very narrow at the bends, where the deepest water is generally on the concave side. The tide is felt as far as Dorquain. In general, the river presents no difficulties regarding pilotage to experienced local navigators. But there are no navigational aids, many sharp bends and shallow stretches. Night navigation is possible by experienced men. The average turn round between Basra and Ahwaz is 2 days 6 hours, if the steamer is towing 2 barges ; if w ithout barges 1 day 14 hours. During times of Hood the average would natu rally be longer, depending on the state of the flood. (b) Rapids at Ahtoaz .—From Bandar Nasiri to Ahwaz ( 1 £ miles) there is a considerable rise in the river bed, and a series of 5 rapids, generally considered unnavigable, exists. The real obstacle to navigation is the second rapid from the top where a reef runs out from the left bank leaving only a channel 100 yards broad, broken up by islets into two or three passages, of w hich the one nearest to the right bank is the easiest of ascent, but has a width of only 50 yards. The water here rushes with a fall of 1 in 50. The total loss of height between the top and bottom of the rapids is 1' ih high and 7' in low water. These rapids can only be crossed by powerful light draught steamers during the months of April and May with any degree of safety Native boats can be brought over at any season. (e) Ahwaz to Dar-i-Khazineh .—This reach of the Upper Karun is less easy for navigation than the lower river chiefly owing to its narrowness, and its shallowness in places, in which only light draught boats can pass. Steamers can tow two barges except during the low water period between July and November, when the total carrying capacity of one haul is reduced by 50%. The rate of current is reckoned at 6 to 9 knots in flood and 3 knots in low water. , The average turn round between Ahwaz and D. I. K. is 1 day 12 hours if steamer is towing barges and 1 day 4 hours if without barges. During times of flood, the average is longer, depending on the state of the flood. Sec. 4. INLAND WATER TRA NS FOR T .— (Note.— Colonel Ward, Port Director, Basra, has a copy of a list of all I. W. T. river craft in Mesopotamia in 1918. No other copy17 © exists. At present, the vast majority of river craft in Iraq and the A. I. 0. C. area are wartime vessels. All details concern ing them are in the list in the possession of Colonel Ward, including carrying capacity for personnel, stores, etc., at various draughts. Headquarters, Hinaidi, have been asked to maintain a list of Mespers and A. I. O. C. fleets, showing the details men tioned in Appendices, V, VI and VII of this report. The principal owners of river steamers, barge and motor launches are Mespers at Basra, and the A. I. 0. C. at Abadan. There are a certain number of native-owned steamers and barges but their lift is small and performance unreliable. Country craft abound on the Tigris and Euphrates but only certain type are suitable for military purposes. Mespers fleet operates in the bhatt-el-Arab, and the Tigris as far as Baghdad ; the A I O C fleet on the Karun river between Abadan and Ahwaz and Dar-i- Khazineh. The majority of Mespers fleet could be made avail able for military purposes up to Ahwaz. As a general guide, it would probably be best to make oi the A. I. 0. C. fleet in the first instance and this tonnage, as may be found necessary, from to supplement Mespers fleet. The particulars of vessels dices:— are given in the following appen- A. I. 0. C. owned craft Mespers fleet and motor laun ches Basra Appendix V. Iraqi-owned craft Country craft The following points are important in considering the use of river crait i — Appendix VI. Appendix VII, Appendix VIII. (a) Ihe big drop in haulage capacity and number of craft available above Ahwaz. (b) All barges, with the exception of oil barges, are suitable for carrying M. T. At Basra M. T. can be loaded direct from sea-going vessels to barges. (c) For the carriage of troops and animals wooden decks are preferable. Steel decks could not be used in hot weather, unless covered with matting. Canvas or matting awnings are necessary and must be remov able to allow for loading of stores. Barges for military use should have decks and hatches MS235CGS(P)1 he necessary alterations to river craft can be carried out easily and quickly in the yards of the Port Directorate, Basra, in the case of Iraqi vessels, and by the A. I. 0. C. in the ease of their own craft. Three or four vessels could be converted to military use in about a week both at Basra and by the A. I. 0. C. (d) 1 he A. I. 0. C. propose to arm their craft by clearing the upper decks of superstructure aft of the bridge, and fitting protective steel plates. Naval guns will be mounted near the bridge on the large lower river steamer, Kalgah. The only armament that the other steamers could carry would be machine guns, which would be sandbagged in. If the river steamers are armoured, their draught will be increased to such an extent that they will become immobile at very low water. Hence armouring will not always be possible. At high water armouring would not affect the carrying capacity of troops, animals etc. The only armour which the A. I. 0. C. can fit is £' mild steel plate, which is not bullet-proof. (e) No steamers or barges are fitted especially for hospital work. Barges in particular would require structural alterations. I he A. I. 0. C. stern-wheeler steamers have cabin accommodation and deck space and wood en equipment throughout, including electric light, fans, fresh water and sanitary accommodation. They could be converted for use as hospital ships at short notice. (/) kor repair work slipways exist at Basra and Abadan for Mespers and A. I. O. C. respectively. In addition one floating dock is available at Abadaq (for details see Appendix II). (ff) All steamers burn oil fuel. I he A. I. O. C. estimate that with their own river craft they could cope with the following tonnages, provided all power craft were available, i.e., not under repair or being used tactically. Per trip initially. Per month / &gt;&gt; later.

Sec,. 5. RAILWAYS, (a) Light Railway, Dar-i-Khazineh to Md-md-i-Rnleiman —single line 2' 6 ' gauge length 36 miles of 40 miles including sidings. Rails 30 lbs. B. S. F. B„ (old section). Steel sleepers to which rails are secured by steel keys. 'Track ballasted with sandstone and river shingle. Curves 5° to 45°. Maximum grade 3-2%. There are 3 main bridge Hopkins Truss type of spans lOo, 120 and 120 feet. The line follows the metalled road from Dar-i-Khazineh towards Masjid-i-Suleiman to Abgah after which it turns south-east following the Tembi river to Tembi Power Station and thence runs to Masjid-i- Suleiman and Chashm-i-Ali. There are stations at D. 1. K. Abgah (12 miles) Batwand (16 miles) Tembi (27 miles) M. I. S. (32 miles) Chashm-i-Ali (36 miles). The average time taken from D. I. K. to Chashm-i-Ali is 4£ hours. From D. I. K. to Abgah and from Tembi to M. I. S. the maximum useful lift per train is 45 tons ; between Abgah and Tembi 85 tons. At present the A. I. O. C. run an average of one train per day moving 60 tons from end to end. The maximum ever moved by them in one month is 3,600 tons, or 120 tons average per day. The number of trains per day using daylight hours only can be increased to 4 in the summer or 3 in the winter. Over the limiting section, therefore, this means a maximum of 180 tons per day in summer, or 135 tons in winter. Assum ing A. I. O. C. average requirements to be 60 tons a day, a maximum of approximately 120 tons a day in summer and 75 tons in winter would be available for military purposes. Locomotives burn oil fuel.

Sec. 6. ROADS .—A full description of the main route to the oilfieds Mohammerah (Khorramshahr)—Ahwaz—Dar-i- Khezineh—Masjid-i-Suleiman—Haft Kel, is given as Route III in “ M. T. Routes in Iran.”0 21 The following are brief notes on the principal routes in the A. I. O. C. area. (a) Abadan to Ahvxiz. —About 80 miles. Mud surface* The A. I. O. C. maintain only the crossings over the pipe-line. Fair weather road only for all traffic. Alternatively in dry weather troops can march along the river banks the whole way, cutting across the concave bends of the river. There are few obstacles to the movement of M. T. or H. T. by such a route. Delay is imposed by the ferry over the Bahmanshir river, two miles north of Abadan. Details of this ferry are given in Appendix IX. (b) Basra to Ahvxiz. —About 90 miles. The route is not very well defined, but is not difficult to follow in daylight. Same character route as (a), but rather better surface. Water is obtainable at Qasr-i-Sheikh, about half way. (c) Ahvxiz to Dar-i-Khazineh. —From Mullasani there are two alternative routes leading to Dar-i-Khazineh, (i) direct between the Ab-i-Gargar and Ab-i-Shatait rivers, (ii) east of the Ab-i-Gargar, via Haddam and Abgunjik. Via (i) the dis tance is about 50 miles, via (ii) 8 miles longer. The whole route, whether via (i) or (it) is a fair route for all transport. In the summer, sand may cause some trouble, especially at about 20 and 32 miles from Ahwaz. Route (i) has a better surface than (ii) and is less liable to interruption in wet weather. At Band-i-Qir the road crosses the Ab-i-Gargar by a ferry. At this point the river runs between high steep banks, and the ferry is approached by cuttings which are unmetalled, and liable to be cut up by excessive motor traffic. The ferry boat can only take one light vehicle at a time, and is propelled by means of a wire cable between the banks operated by a capstan. (Details are g'ven in Appendix IX). If, in the event of operations, it was considered necessary to construct a new bridge, it would be advisable to place it about 4 feet above the level of the old war-time bridge (recently demohshed), as the approaches and greater part of the structure of the bridge were inundated under flood conditions. The banks are com posed of alluvial soil and excavation is, therefore, easy. In consideration of the passage of upper river steamers, a pontoon bridge would probably be the most suitable type. (d) Dar-i-Khazineh to Masjid-i-Suleiman.—^ miles. First class all-weather metalled hill road, kept in condition by the22 A I O. C. The road winds a good deal and the last 10 miles ai-e verv hilly.

FACILITIES FOR ROAD REPAIR.—Bond metal is plentifully available in the fields area and could be quarried almost anywhere along most of the hill roads. There is also road metal in the range of hills in the vicinity of Ahwaz, but this is soft and of little use. There is none to be had in the plains. Metal for road making in Abadan is usually brought by sailing craft from the island of Kharaq (Iranian territory) near Bushire.29 CRANES. Total. M.I.S. H.K. A.J. G.S. N.iJj. N.K.

TRANSFER POINTS. Ahwaz (Map 3).—Tran shipment is now effected by means of branch lines of Iranian State Railway aniffiiffnonted by M. T. A branch of the State Railway runs from the new lower-river wharf on the right bank of the river and joins the main line near the railway bridge, and another branch leaves the main line on the left bank near the bridge and runs to the A. I. O. C. upper- river wharf. Transhipment is thus from the right to the left bank via the railway bridge. The bridge is 1,000 yards long and made of steel and concrete with wooden decking. The construction of a road bridge immediately below the lower river wharf on the left bank has been completed. Goods easily handled can be landed at this wharf and be transported by M. T. to the upper river wharf. Town imnrovement schemes on a large scale now starting in Ahwaz provide*^ wide metalled road from the new bridge, through the town and to the A. I. O. G. s compound and upper-river wharf. Details of wharf facilities, accommodation, water, electri- citv, engineering facilities, labour and cold storage at Ahwaz, are given in Appendix XI. Dar-i-Khazineh (River head) (Map 4).—Unloading at D. I. K. is done from barges on to a wharf by means of steam cranes. Metalled roads give a good access to the wharf and there is ade quate parking space. The wharf is occasionally submerged during periods of floods. There is also light railway access to the wharf. Details regarding facilities at wharf, accommodation, water, electricity, labour, cold storage and railway locos, etc. at D. I. K. are given in Appendix XI. Details of a ferry over the river at D. I.

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.—Utile reliance can be placed on the immediate availability of foodstuffs in the A. I. O. C. area but there will always be some supplies available locally at Basra. The A. I. O. C. maintain small stocks of grain at Abadan, varying throughout the year between 50 and 400 tons, from which flour is produced at their mill. (a) Grain .—The amount of grain available in Basra, at any one time may vary between 1,000 and 40,000 tons according to the season, demand and transport available. A contractor will guarantee at 10 days notice 400 tons of wheat and 400 tons of barley. Estimates by various authorities for other centres in Iraq are given in Appendix XIII. No reliable statistics are available for Arabistan (Khuzistan) and authorities differ as to whether supplies over and above the needs of the population are available or not. While one autho rity says that supplies are plentiful, another states that they are insufficient for the civil population and that much grain is imported from other parts of Iran or from foreign countries. These conflicting statements may be accounted for by droughts of particular years. Arabistan (Khuzistan) is essentially an agri cultural country, but of recent years an appreciable proportion of the population has turned its attention to other pursuits. Periodical shortages of grain and other food-stuffs have occurred in recent years due to a variety of reasons such as the mono polising by (Government of the purchase and disposal of grain, excessive exportation of grain and to interruption to communi cations with North Iran caused by unusually heavy rainfalls and snow. (b) Fodder .—Grass grows in profusion over an area of many square miles in the neighbourhood on Band-i-Qir. There are two varieties known as sharib and fluih. The latter is a form of dried dhub grass and has the higher nutritive value. Lucerne is grown in Arabistan, but in very small quantities41 (c) Vegetables, Onions, Potatoes .—At Basra, supplies are well above local demand except during November and January. A contractor will guarantee as a daily supply at 10 days notice Vegetables in season .. 2,000 lbs. Potatoes .. .. 4,000 lbs. Onions .. .. Fairly plentiful throughout the area and no difficulty should be experienced in obtaining adequate supplies. Vegetables, including onions, are grown in the vicinity of towns. Potatoes are procurable in the hills close to Ram Hormuz, but main supplies are obtained from North Iran or India. With the exception of a few native varieties, vegetables are scarce in Arabistan (Khuzistan) for the greater part of the year. (d) Dates .—At Basra, a contractor will guarantee 5,000 lbs. of dates as a daily supply at 10 days notice. iZT^The neighbourhood of Khorramshahr and Abadan is a large date producing area, but it cannot be compared with Basra in this re spect ”, Sec. 2. LIVESTOCK .— (Note. —The figures given in this section are approximate only.) (a) Sheep and Goats for slaughter — At Basra a contractor will guarantee 5,000 sheep and 1,000 goats at 10 days notice. At Abadan, 100 head per day. At Moharamerah (Khorramshahr), 50 head per day. At Ahwaz, 100 head per day. At D. I. K., 2 head per day. At M. I. S., 75 head per day. At Haft Kel, 30 head per day. With the exception of Basra, these figures could be con siderably increased by a greater demand, particularly in the case of centres in tribal areas. At Basra, 56,244 sheep and goats were given as the Kodah count in 1929. (b) Cattle for slaughter .—At Basra, a contractor will guarantee at 10 days notice, 450 buffaloes and 1,000 cows or42 oxen. The Kodah count of 1929 for camels and buffaloes was 7,841. The average number of animals slaughtered daily in the Abadan bazaar is about 200 sheep and 8 bullocks. Otherwise up to date figures for Arabistan (Khuzistan) are not available but a considerable quantity could be obtained from the Hawi- zeh (Havizeh), Fallahieh (Shadgan) and Dizful areas. (c) Riding, Draught and Pack animals.—The following approximate numbers can be obtained in lower Iraq at the centres given :— Basra. Mules .. .. ' 25 Riding Ponies .. 500 Camels .. .. 500 Horses Larger numbers could be obtained by purchasing outright and giving good prices. Up. to date figures are not available for Arabistan, but the principal centres are, in order of importance :— Mules. —Dizful, Fallahieh (Shadgan), Shushtar, Ram Hormuz. Horses. Hawizeh (Havizeh), Dizful, Fallahieh (Shad gan), Hindiyan. Camels. Hawizeh (Havizeh), Shushtar, Dizful, Ram Hormuz. Very approximate numbers in native hands and im mediately obtainable are. Mules 1,200, Horses and Ponies 700, Camels 7,000. Sec. 3. DAIRi PRODUCTS .—There is a small dairy farm on Abadan Island situated midway between Abadan and' Khor- ramshahr. Its capacity is insufficient for the needs of even the British staff in Abadan, being not more than 100 gallons of milk and 150 lbs. of butter per day. It is possible that during the course of the next few years this farm will be developed bv the A. I. O. C. Sec. 4. COLD STORAGE AND ICE MANUFACTUR- ING FACILITIES .—Cold storage facilities exist at Abadan, Masjid-i-Suleiman and Haft Kel. Details regarding Abadan are given in Appendix II. Masjid-i-Sulaiman. —The refrigerating plant at M. I. S. has an ice manufacturing capacity of 15£ tons per day. In addition there is a series of cold rooms which have a capacity of 5 tons Nasiriya. A urara . 30 30 750 750 750 50043 refrigeration. These rooms are used for the storage of meat butter, fruit and fish from Abadan. M. I. S. Hospital has a 4 tons capacity plant which may be altered for the manufacture of ice but its normal duty throughout the summer is in connec tion with the air cooling plant of the heat stroke ward. Haft Kel. 1 his plant has a total ice making capacity of 9 tons per day. It is built up of one 5 ton and two 2 ton units. One 2 ton unit may be connected to a cold storage room. Cach Saran. This field has an ice manufacturing capacity of 5 tons and a cold storage refrigerating capacity of 2 tons. Agha Jari .—Ice manufacturing capacity is 2\ tons. Cold storage capacity is approximately 2 tons. Qanaweh. Two small A. S. Refrigerating machines supply a total of 1,000 lbs. ice per day. No cold storage capacity. i ( .if 2 ‘~. Two A&gt; S - Mac hines which have a total capacity of 1,600 lbs. ice per day. No cold storage capacity. Sec. 5. FIREWOOD AND TIMBER .—Firewood is very scarce in Basra and Arabistan generally. Such quantities as are available in Ahwaz are floated down the rivers Karun and Ab-i-I)iz from the Bakhtari hills in the form of rafts. Supphes are usually collected during the summer months for winter consumption. With the exception of the safsaf or willow, which is found at Mohammerah (Khorramshahr), trees are equally scarce in southern Arabistan. In Northern Arabistan, the banks of the Karkheh and Ab-i-Diz have large belts of brushwood, with gharab or Euphrates poplar, the sarim, the tamarisk, the blackberry and the liquorice bush or sus, in small quantities Nec. d. OIL SUPPLIES. M. T. /W.-Supply for the whole area, including Basra, emanates from Abadan, where the average daily output is 5,000 tons. The local market is served both from filling stations maintained by tank-lorries and by 4 gallon tins, which are manufactured and tested in Abadan. ! 8 seasonally, but are always in excess of l&lt;Ki,UOO tins in Abadan main storage. F i. d f° Areas.—The whole of the petrol requirements for the fields areas is manufactured by several small distillation umts which utilise a local crude oil supply as a charge for the plants. These small plants are situated at M. I. S., Haft Kel - g ia Jan, and Gach Saran. In addition the plants at M. I. S ’ Agha Jan and Gach Saran are capable of supplying gas oil for 7 g r S - Aviatlon s r &gt;irit is supplied from Abadan and small stocks are maintained at, or adjacent to, the landing44 grounds at Yahmaha, Haft Kel, Agha Jari, Gach Saran and Ganaweh. R. A. F. Iraq can make all arrangements with the A. I. 0. C. for supply of petrol, if desired, and in and near Basra can supply from reserves in emergency. Aviation Petrol and Lubricants. —R. A. F. aviation petrol and lubricants are in peace provided through, though not by, the A. I. 0. C. The A. I. 0. C. can produce aviation petrol in limited quantities by mixing their own spirit with imported miri spirit, but generally speaking their own spirit is not suit able for producing a high grade aviation petrol. The stocks of imported aero spirit vary between 1,500 and 2,000 tons. Stocks of imported aero lubricants are normally 4,000 gallons. M. T. Lubricants. —Normal supplies for the R. A. F. in Iraq are obtained from U. K. and take 2 to 3 months to arrive. A six months’ reserve for their normal establishment of vehicles is held, the actual reserves being as follows : — Basra. Hinaidi. Mosul. Galls. Galls. Galls. Oil M. T. extra heavy .. 600 2,100 500 Do. heavy 500 580 120 Do. thin 150 500 100 lbs. lbs. lbs. Grease yellow .. 720 3.212 1,120 It would probably be advisable for any force from India to bring an initial supply of 2 months of M. T. vehicle lubri cants. Crude. Oil. —The A. I. O. C. state that 400 tons light furnace or Diesel oil with adequate calorific values for field cooking can be made available. Distribution can be made in bulk, or in 4 gallon tins or 40 gallon drums, ample numbers of either of which are available in Abadan. Kerosene. —Can be made available and supplied in 4 gallon tins from Abakan. Stocks are held at Basra by the Rafidain Oil Company. Fuel Oil. —For Port and inland water craft is sent from Abadan in oil barges. At Basra, large stocks are held by the Rafidain Oil Company at their depot at Muftieh.45 CHAPTER VIII. Engineer and Ordnance Facilities. *S’ec. 1. WORKSHOPS. —Workshop facilities exist at the following places :— Abadan .. . . Details are given in Appendix II. M. I. S. —Fully equipped workshops similar to Abadan. The foundry is not equipped to produce ferrous castings but non-ferrous castings up to about one cwt. can be produced. Fully equipped for all types of general maintenance and small power forging. Special work entailing milling, etc., is done in M. I. S. Suitable for minor work only. Major repair work from these centres are sent to Abadan or M. I. S. Sec. 2. ROAD CONSTRUCTION .—Rond metal is plenti fully available in the oilfields area and could be quarried almost anywhere along most of the hill roads. There is also some in the range of hills in the vicinity of Ahwaz but it is soft and, therefore, of little use. Metal for road-making in the Abadan area is usually brought by sailing craft from the island of Kharaq near Bushire. There are several steam and motor road rollers in Abadan, Ahwaz, M. I. S. and Haft-Kel (Ch. V, Sec. 7). Haft Kel Gach Saran Agha Jari Lali .. ''j White Oil Springs Ganaweh .. f Kut Abdulla .. J Sec. 3. BRIDGING. —Pontoon equipment is not essen tial. Local boats, known as mahailas, were largely used during the Great War and are still so used for floating bridges and ferrying. (See Appendix VIII). Attention is drawn to Chapter V, Sec. 6 (c) regarding the possible need for bridge construction at Bandi-i-qir. Sec. 4. WATER SUPPLY. —Piped water systems exist at the following places, details are given in the relevant ap- pendices:— ABADAN Appendix II. AHWAZ Do. XL DAR-I-KHAZINEH Do. XI. From Abadan to Dar-i-Khazineh water is obtainable from the Karun river.46 It should be boiled and sterilized in the vicinity of towns and villages. Dari-i-Khazineh .—The water station is required to supply a very small staff at this depot. The plant consists of a three throw ram pump, which acts as a low lift pump from the river Karun, pumping to several small settling tanks. A small Diesel engine driven centrifugal pump, pumps from the settling tanks to an elevated storage tank approximately 25 feet high. This tank distributes over the small consuming area. The overall capacity of the plant is 35,000 gallons per day. Masjid-i-Sulaiman .—The whole of Masjid-i-Sulaiman Field domestic and industrial water supply is taken from the River Karim at Godar Landor. The entire pumping station is electri cally operated by power supplied by 11,000 volt overhaul trans mission from Tembi Power Generating Station. The Godar Landor station consists of centrifugal low lift pumps which draw from the river and deliver to settling tanks. Centrifugal high lift pumps of 500.000 gallons per day capacity at 800 lbs. discharge pressure, draw from the settling system and deliver to the Field main storage tanks at Sar-i-Gatch. The capacity of the station is 2,000,000 gallons per day. The discharge line from the station to Sar-i-Gatch is a composite one of 12 inch line and 13 inch line which has a capacity of 4,800,000 galls, per day at 800 lbs. initial pressure. At Sar-i-Gatch the total tankage capacity is 16,200,000 gallons. From Sar-i-Gatch the entire Field is fed by a distribution line net work. Chlorination is carried out at the Godar Landor station. Haft Kel .—The Haft Kel Field is supplied from a station situated on the River Rud-i-Zard. The site is at a point a short distance up stream from where the Rud-i-Ala joins the Rud-i-Zard. {Note :—The water of the Rud-i-Ala is very much harder than the water of the Rud-i-Zard.) The station consists of two steam driven centrifugal pumps capacity 500,000 gall, per day each at 750 feet head. The Boiler and line capacity limit the operation to one pump only. The Field storage, which is situated at a distance of 12-5 miles from the station consists of a total of 2,870,000 gallons. Chlorination is carried out at the pumping station. Oach Saran .—The present Gach Saran Field supply is taken from a series of water wells situated at Du-Gambadun (Pumping48 Two 12,000 gallon capacity elevated tanks contain the stor age for the depot. It is essential that all Ganaweh and coastal waters are chlori nated as they are always affected by organic matter which can not be eliminated from the wells. Sec 5 ENGINEER STORES.—Engineer stores for defence purposes in the A. I. O. C. area are held at Hinaidi in immediate readiness for issue. A complete list is given in Appendix XIV. Details of stores available at Abadan and the oilfields area are given in Appendix XV. Sec. 6\ ORDNANCE REPAIR .—The A. I. O C. maintain general stores at Abadan which are capable of undertaking the repair of tentage and clothing. The A I O. C. have no facilities for the repair of H. T. vehi cles, harness, saddlery or boots. Saddlery, however, is one of the most important native handicrafts in Arabistan. Ram Hormuz is a famous centre, while Dizful and Shushtar also pursue the trade.CHAPTER IX. Medical Facilities. Sec. 1. HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATION.—(a) Abadan.— The A. I. 0. C. have a well equipped, air conditioned hospital of 140 beds extendable to 160 by 1942. 50 per cent, can be added to the number of beds to meet emergency conditions. A comprehensive X-Ray apparatus of modern design capable nf any diagnostic work has been installed. There is no portable X-Ray equipment. There is a small pathological laboratory but a large up-to-date one is projected in the present building. A steam clothing disinfector is installed at the hospital and there is a large steam laundry capable of dealing with all hospital laundry work in the hospital. There is potential hospital accommodation in the clerks’ and other buildings of about 100 beds. There is an isolation hospital situated S. E. of Bawarda having a total of 60 beds, also a segregation camp of 2 separate enclosures. These are provided with cookhouses and latrines of brick construction. (b) Ahwaz. —The A. I. O. C. maintain a dispensary in asso ciation with the hospital at Abadan, in which 6 beds can be arranged. There is also a fenced area in which tents can be put up. There is also potential accommodation for about 50 beds in other buildings. (c) Masjid-i - Suleiman. —The A. I. O. C. has a well equipped air cooled hospital of 70 beds extendable to 100 with a well equipped pathological laboratory and X-Ray department. (d) Dar-i-Khaziruh. —There is potential accommodation for about 25 beds in the Rest House and spare quarters. (e) Mohammerah (Khorramshahr). —There is an Iranian hospital near the town with accommodation for about 50 beds. The building is new and reported to be quite clean and sani tary. In association with the hospital at Masjid-i-Suleiman there are dispensaries at the following centres :—Tembi. Maidan-i- Naftun, Chashm-i-Ali, Haft Kel. In association with the hospital at Abadan there are in addition to the one at Ahwaz, dispensaries at Kut Abdulla and MS235CGS(P)50 Dorquain. There are also dispensaries at Gach Qaraguli (GacL Saran), Ganawah and Agha Jari. The dispensary at Haft Kel has detention rooms and a store, and a similar building is under construction at Gach Qaraguli (Gach Saran). Sec,. 2. MEDICAL STORES .—A certain amount of furniture, some beds and almirahs could be made available in case of emergency for the improved hospital accommodation mentioned in (a), (6), (c) and (d) above, but it would be advisable not to rely on this. Alternative provision should be made. The R. A. F. in Iraq hold a reserve of medical stores which would be sufficient for one division for about one month. They also hold barrack and medical equipment sufficient for a 150 bedded hospital but no personnel are available to staff such a hospital. The R. A. F. advise that initial equipment of medical stores should accompany troops from India. Sec. 3. EVACUATION OF SICK AND WOUNDED.— Roads suitable for ambulance cars in dry weather exist in all parts of the area. From Masjid-i-Suleiman evacuation as far as Dar-i-Khazineh could be carried out in all weather by means of the metalled road and/or light railway. Thence as far as Ahwaz by river or fairweather road also from Haft Kel, Agha Jari and Pazanun to Ahwaz by fairweather road only. Interruption of road communication for more than 7 to 10 days at a time is unlikely. From Ahwaz to Abadan or Basra road communication should not be depended upon during the rainy season from November to May. Using Bandar Shahpur as a base port, sick and v ounded would be evacuated from Ahwaz by means of the Iranian State Railway. Ambulance cars should lie brought from India. During the rainy season evacuation could be carried out from Ahwaz (and D-i-K, if desired) by river. No steamer or river barges A. I. 0. C. or E. and T. S. N. C. are especially fitted for ambulance work. Owing to the limited facilities available evacu ation by I. \Y. T. could only be arranged if the medical cases were deck passengers, as cabins are not available for any numbers. During the hot weather this would cause considerable hardship to cases evacuated in this manner.5i The alternatives would be :— (a) Motor transport. (b) I. VY. T. and iliotor transport. (c) Aeroplanes. A total of two sternwheelers below Ahwaz and two above Ahwaz are available for all purposes. They should therefore only be relied upon at the commencement of operations until such time as barges are fitted out. All barges would need struc tural alterations. Transhipment from the upper to the lower river must be made at Ahwaz of all sick and wounded owing to the presence of the rapids. See page 16. From Gach Qaraguli (Gach Saran) evacuation could be carried out as far as Ganawah in all weathers, interruptions for more than 3 or 4 days at a time due to bad weather being un likely. From Ganawah sea-going craft must be provided. °The alternative would be aeroplane. Personnel and medical equipment for steamer and barges would have to be brought from India.53 APPENDIX L Sub-divisions of the Kuhgalu and of the Arab Tribes of Khuzistan. the KUHGALU. The .Kuhgalu are sub-divided into two main sections, (o) the Chehar Banicheh, and (b) the Liravi. These sections are again sub-divided as follows :— (a) The Chehar Banicheh. 1. Boer Ahmadi Sarhadi. 2. Boer Ahmadi Garmsiri. 3. Dushmanziari. 4. Churum. 5. Bavi. (6) The Liravi. 1. Bahmai Ahmadi. 2. Bahmai Mahmudi. 3. Taibi Sarhadi. 4. Taibi Garmsiri. 5. Agajari. (a) The Chehar Banicheh. 1. Boer Ahmadi Sarha li—A warlike tribe of nomads ; about 15.000 souls. Boer Ahamadi Garmsiri—a, settled tribe of cultivators ; about 5.000 souls. 3. Dushmanziari —a tribe of notorious robbers ; about 2 500 souls. 4. Churum —settled cultivators, not a warlike tribe ; about 5,000 souls. 5. Bavi —-settled cultivators, formerly wealthy but have lost much of their livestock ; the Company’s operations at Mishun are in their district; no longer warlike about 5,000 souls. (6) The Liravi. 1. Bahmai Ahmadi—about 15,000 souls, warlike. 2. Bahmai Mahmudi —about 15,000 souls, warlike; inter married to a certain extent with the Chehar Lang-i’-Janeki tribe of the Bakhtiari, who are their neighbours. 3. Taibi Sarhadi about 3,000 souls ; notorious robbers but now disarmed. Formerly responsible for most of the robberies on the caravan road in Bakhtiari.54 4. Taibi Oarmsiri —about 4,000 souls ; a quiet unwarlike tribe. 6. ^4^ajari—about 6,000 souls; an unwarlike tribe of culti vators, who live in the Behbehan district. ARAB TRIBES OF KHUZISTAN. The main tribal groups of Khuzistan are as follows 1. West of the Knrun River .— (a) The Beni Turuf. (b) The Beni Salih and Shurafa. (c) The Beni Tamin or Beni Malik. (d) The Beni Lam. (e) The A1 Kathir. (/) The Anafijeh. 2. East of th'e Karan River — (а) The Cha’ab. (б) The Bawieh. 3. Abadan—Mohammerah (Kkorramshahr) area — The Muhaisin. Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah belonged to the Muhaisin, but had extended his authority over all these tribes, though his control over some of them, especially the Beni Turuf and the Beni Lam was never very effective. Out of a maximum fighting strength of 40,000 in 1924, it was considered unlikely owing to tribal feuds and jealousies, that the Sheikh could ever collect a force of more than 15,000 men. After his departure in 1925, co-operation among the tribes against an external enemy has become even less probable than under his rule. Deprived of practically all their arms and without tribal leaders, the tribes of Khuzistan need cause little anxiety to a Central Government which maintains its authority in this province. 1. West of the Karun. (a) Beni Turuf- —about 40,000 souls; fighting strength 10,000. Shia’h Mohammedans. They inhabit the Hawizeh (Havizeh) district and the marshes of the Karkheh river, west and north-west of Ahwaz, and between Ahwaz and the Iraq border. Sedentary, cultivating rice and possessing large herds of buffaloes.55 Formerly a turbulent tribe who gave much trouble to the British force in this province during the Great War. Their disarmament by the Iranians took some years. They are now ruled direct by an Iranian Governor with a military escort of 100 men at Khafajiyeh (Susangird), the headquarters of the Beni Turuf. Road Guard and police posts have been established, with customs posts along the Iraq border. Destruction of their bu'Taloes in a rising in 1928, combined with bad harvests, impoverished the tribesmen, numbers of whom have gone to Ahwaz and Abadan to find work on the railway and in the oil company. (b) Beni Saleh and Shurafa —about 8,000 souls; fighting strength 2,000. Located in the Hawizeh (Havizeh) district west of Ahwaz. Sedentary, cultivating wheat, barley and a little rice. Allied to the Beni Turuf and would support them in war. Now very scattered. Controlled bv the same Iranian Governor as the Beni Turuf. ('■) The Beni Tumin or Beni Malik —about 7 ,.j 00 souls, with 2,000 lighting men. Sunni Mohammedans. Located between Ahwaz, Hawizeh (Havizeh) and the Karun. Nomadic shepherds who own large Hocks of sheep and herds of cattle and camels. Formerly notorious robbers ; only nominally under the control of the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Khorramshaiir). Now disarmed and under direct control of Iranian authorities at Qajarieh, (on the right bank of Karun river approximately 22 miles S.-S.-W of Ahwaz). Administration through remaining sheikhs who have to live at Qajarieh and are completely under Government control. (d) The Beni Lam. —10,000 souls with 2,000 figthim' men. Located on both banks of the Karkheh river, north of Hawizeh (Havizeh) and Beni Turuf districts. Main portion of the Beni Lam live in the Amara district of Iraq and are not included in this report. Iranian section gradually drifting away from Iraqi a* 1 u tnl&gt;e ' XeV(T com P leteI y under the control of the Sheikh &lt;&gt;f Mohammerah. Some sections were notorious robbers. They include both sedentary and seminomadic elements. Owing to proximity to Iraq border, may have retained a large proportion of rides than other tribes in the province. (e) The Al Kathir—about 8,000 souls, with 2,000 fichtimr men. Located between the Diz and Karkheh rivers. A sedenL .ary n ibe, who cultivate wheat, barley and rice and own large Hocks of sheep and goats and a considerable number of cattle and •camels. Inclined to be lawless and still, on occasions rob in the56 Mianab district of Shushtar. Somewhat scattered, each section under its minor sheikh controlled by the Iranian Governors of Dizful and Shushtar. (/) Anajijeh —about 3,000 souls, with 000 fighting men. Located on the right bank of the Karun in the Shushtar area. Partly sedentary and partly nomadic. Formerly an important tribe, but now greatly diminished in numbers. Their Sheikh Yarullah is nominally chief of the tribe but has little authority. 2. East of the Karun. (а) The Cha'ab.—About 40,000 souls with 8,000 fighting' men. Located in the Fallahieh (Shadgan) district south of Ahwaz and as far south as Qasbeh on Abadan Island. Partly sedentary and partly nomadic. Cultivate rice, wheat, barley and possess large date groves. Gave some trouble to the Sheikh of Mohammerah (Khorra ns'.i i rr) during the Great War. Now under the direct control of the Irani i i Government, to whom they pay revenue direct. The Sheikhs were deported to Ahwa&amp; but have now been allowed to return to Fallahieh and receive small allowances from the revenue collected from the tribesmen, (б) The Bawieh .—About 15,000 souls, with 3,000 fighting men. Located in the Ahwaz area. Partly sedentary and partly nomadic. They cultivate wheat and barley and own large flocks of sheep and goats and a considerable number of cattle. After 1916 came under the direct control of the Sheikh of Moham- merah. All tribal affairs now dealt with by the Governor of Ahwaz and the Iranian Revenue Department. Sheikhs have not only lost all power but have been reduced to |K&gt;verty, Bad harvests have recently r -duced their flocks and herds and the tribe as a whole is much poorer than it used to be. About one-third go to the banks of the Shatt-el-Arab every year in the autumn to obtain work in connection with the date harvest. The smaller tribes of Hamaid. Zirgan and Salamat, numbering 8,000 souls in all. are allied to them. 3. At Abadan and Mohammerah ( Khorram.diahr). The Muhaisin .—About 34,000 souls with about 7,000 fighting men. A sedentary tribe wl.o cultivate dates, wheat and barley and possess numbers of sheep. The Muhaisin are the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s tribe and were consistent!}- loyal to him and to the British during the Great War. Since the departure of the Sheikh, they have been disarmed, though, like the remainder of the tribes, they may have retained a few arms secretly. They pay taxes to the Iranian Government through their sectional headmen, who in return receive allowances from the Govern ment.57 APPENDIX II. Abadan. (See Map 2.) 1. General. —Abadan is situated on an island of the same name on the left bank and about 30 miles up the Shatt-el-Arab. It is as modern, in many respects, as an English industrial town, being the A. I O. C.’s refinery and port of export. It is the greatest oil port in the East. The island is approximately 50 miles long by 2 miles wide, with a population of about 150,000 natives, of which 25,000 are in the employ of the A. I. 0. C. Basra Port Directorate controls all shipping in the river and its harbour-masters and pilots bring all vessels alongside the jetties. Once alongside the jetties the Iranian Authorities exer cise the usual Customs, quarantine and police control. The frontier at Abadan is the “ Thelweg ” (the deepest part of the channel) since the conclusion of the Iraqi-Iranian Frontier Treaty of 1937. IT harves and Jetties.

Landing Places other than at Abadan Port. Other than a,t Abadan itself, there are only two places on the tions^HThese arJ - ^ f ° r Iandin « opera- is known ~ KMba (i) A stretch of four and a half miles in the centre of which is Khosrowabad. a new A. I. O. C. oil delivery point, one and a half miles south of Abdul Husain village. At both places the date palm groves, which at some places on the island run inland to a depth of about three miles, are only a few hundred yards wide. At Khosrowabad the bank is entirely open for about eight hundred yards to the south of the oil port f ° ll d be P osaible at both P laces for large self-propelled landing craft to be used- right up to the bank. TransportVcould stand in and men and animals could walk from the ships to lighters and ^ ^0 ' , h f hter8 to ^ shore. From Khosrowabad a good metalled road seventeen miles in length runs to Abadan. Elsewhere on the island mud flats, intensive palm cultivation ?mpos a sible yn ^ Water Channels make lan ding operations60 No. 7 Jetty is the only jetty suitable for the disembarkation of animals and M. T. Several oil jetties could be used for per sonnel but certain jetties, namely those which handle light oil, are dangerous. All jetties are fitted with electric light and hydrants and can be used at all times except in a very strong wind. There is a mean rise of tide of 6 feet with a maximum rise of 10 feet. There are two main wharves ; the South East wharf along side the Breim canal and the Central Stores wharf alongside the dredged channel on the east side of Abadan village. The Breim canal is always kept dredged for the movement of river craft at high tide only. Once berthed, craft can re main at the wharf during low water. To meet the requirements of a small force it would be best to use No. 7 jetty for all classes of cargo and the S. E. wharf for stores. The A. I. O. C. have undertaken to provide improvised cranes at the S. E. wharf. Three ocean-going steamers can be berthed at No. 4 jetty at one time and unloaded on the inner side on to the jetty and on the outer side into barges which when loaded can be towed to S. E. wharf. 4. Unloading Facilities etc. (a) Cranes — Central Stores Wharf .. One 2 ton electric jib crane. No. 7 Jettv . . Five electric travelling cranes 8 tens at 60' radius. Three additional cranes of same type on order. One 5 ton electric jib crane. South East Wharf Breim Creek One 15 ton steam crane. Two 5 ton steam cranes. A. I. O. C. can supply crane operators.61 (6.) Crane barges .—Three crane barges to lift 10 tons. II tons, and 34 owte., respectively^ (c) floating Dock .—One floating dock is moored in the river; Length over pontoon—172' 11' ; width between fenders —44' 6' ; draught of water over keel blocks—12' ; lifting power 750 tons. The plant allows of minor repairs to small vessels. (d) Harbour Craft .—Numbers and details are shown in Appendix V. 5. Other Facilities Available. (a) General .—The lay-out of Abadan is shown in Map 2. The situation of the town is modern with drainage in the Euro pean quarter ; incinerators provide sanitation^in the native quarter. A 3 foot gauge light railway and comprehensive metalled road system cover the refinery area. A suitable site for a depot and camp area is situated due north of Braim area of Abadan. This area is capable of expan sion and is away from the native quarter. (b) Electric Poiver .—The refinery has electric light which can be supplemented by searchlights. Supply is from a generating station with a maximum continuous output of 45,000 K.W Generation is at 11,000 v. 50 cycles and distribution carried out at 11 k.v., 3-3 k.v 440 volts. All three phase and 250 volts phase and neutral. D. C. Converting plant up to 2,000 k.v.a. is available. The present refinery load is 16,000—18,000 K. W. so that power is available for extraneous use which up to 2,000 K.W. could be converted to D. C. in quantity. Considerkble extensions to both generating and consuming plant are in hand and approaching completion. Generating Plant (total installed) 07,000 K. W. Generating Plant capacity (continuous) 45,000 K. W. Generation at 11 k. v. Distribution as above.02 Trucks .— Flat deck trucks 80 tons capacity 2 Flat deck trucks 120 tons capacity 1 Flat deck trucks 30 tons capacity 2 Flat deck trucks 20 tons capacity 212 Flat deck trucks 15 tons capacity 30 Flat deck tnicks 10 tons capacity 15 Flat deck trucks 7 tons capacity 69 Side tipping trucks 10 tons capacity 150 c. ft. 46 Side tipping trucks 20 tons capacity 300 c. ft. 38 Side tipping trucks 3 tons capacity 44 c. ft. 60 Side tipping trucks 7 tons capacity 150 c. ft. 83 Side tipping trucks 10 tons capacity 200 c. ft. 20 Side tipping trucks 20 tons capacity 400 c. ft. 8 Permanent Way Material .—There is about 45 miles of track laid in Abadan. About 25 miles of this consists of 40 lb. per yard rail but the newer sections amounting to about 20 miles is of 50 lb. per yard rail. The 50 lb. rail could be relaid if necessary but the 40 lb. rail could not be moved satisfactorily. In addi tion there is sufficient material in stock to lay about 12 miles of additional track with 50 lb. rail. [g) Cold storage .—There is a large cold store consisting of 8 chambers with a total capacity of approximately 40,000 cubic feet. There are also two cold storage chambers (total capacity 8,600 cubic feet) used for storing ice, each chamber being capable of holding 45 tons of ice. The maximum capacity of the ice making machine at Aba dan is 50 tons in 24 hours. (k) \\orkshops, etc. —(i) There is a well equipped main workshop. Castings can be made up to 2£ tons. 10 cwt. steam and pneumatic hammers are available for forging. It is fitted with electric and acetylene welding equipment, a planing machine which will take 3' wide, 3' high and 10' long and several lathes, the largest of which has a 27' centre and will admit up to 26' gap open and closed. There are also several portable cranes up to 12 tons capacitv.64 (it) Electrical Workshops and Battery Charging Station.— Well equipped with a fully qualified staff of three Europeans and a number of Iranian and Indian mechanics. The charging station handles approximately 2.000 accumulators a month. The workshop can undertake the repair of all signal equip ment. (Hi) General Stores.— There are facilities for the repair of tentage and clothing. No facilities exist for the repair of boots or harness and saddlery. (i) Medical.—Details of medical facilities are given in Chapter IX. (j) Laundry .—A small separate steam laundry is main tained, for washing clothes and blankets, at the western end of the town. (k) Labour.—The A. I. O. C. Labour organisation could recruit a labour force in ordinary circumstances up to about 5,000. Whether they would be prepared to serve the Military Authorities would depend on circumstances. (l) Mechanical Transport.— YnM details are given in Appendix X.65 APPENDIX III. MOHAMMERAH {KHORRAMSHAHR.) 1. General. —Mohamraerah lies on the northern side and about half a mile within the entrance of the Hafar channel which is about 40 miles above Fao on the Shatt-el-Arab. The town was formerly administered by the Sheikh of Mohammerah under the sovereignty of the Persian Government He was removed in 1925 and since then the administration has been carried out by an Iranian Civil Governor who is directly under the Governor-General of the Province of Khuzistan. ' Only ships drawing 20 feet or less can, except in the short flood season, cross the Mohammerah bar and enter the Karun river. Owing to the narrowness of the river channel, vessels he off the town close to the bank as there is no room to swing They anchor usually in the Shatt-el-Arab just above the entrance to the Hafar channel. Ocean steamers load and discharge cargo by means of lighters. Half a dozen lighters of barges are usuallv available at Moham merah and more could be brought down from Basra, if required (See Appendices VI, VII, and VIII.) 2. 11 harves and Jetties. —There is a wharf at the entrance of t r &lt; ' i?^ ar c ^ anne ^ I* a dilapidated structure consisting of old barges filled with mud and sunk. There are only a few inches of water alongside it at low tide, and only sufficient water for flat-bottomed barges and motor boats at high tide, i.e., about There are five jetties for motor boats on the right bank and one on the left bank. It would not be difficult to place two or three flat-bottomed barges alongside one another and quickly improvise a landing- stage almost anywhere on either bank. • Th u e L i!'. 0 '. have a Celling jetty on the right bank for river boats. This jetty is of steel pipe piles with concrete deck Length oO feet deck connecting with river bank 45 feet Iona' Depth of water at low tide 8 feet. The Iranian Navy have five steel jetties with timber decks on the left bank of the Karun situated in the last half mfle before the junction with the Shatt-el-Arab ; also a motor boat jetty immediately below the downstream steel jetty.6&lt;i 3. Unloading facilities .—There are numerous large mahailas (dhow-shaped barges) and many small heliums (large canoes) which are used for passengers and cargo. (For description of these vessels see Appendix VIII.) Approximate numbers are 60 mahailas and 150 heliums. In addition there are about 10 barges (unsound for cargo) available, not counting the six already mentioned (in paragraph 1 above), and about 15 open launches and 4 or 5 ancient steam boats and motor dhows, practically useless. 4. Facilities available at Mohammerah (Khorramshahr). The town is situated on the mainland and extends from the junction of the Karun and the Shatt-el-Arab up the banks of the Karun for a distance of about 2 miles. It has a population of about 10,000. The A. I. O. C. has a small settlement consist ing of offices, a Rest House and 14 dwelling houses. The town is composed of both mud and brick built houses. At the mouth of the Karun on the right bank of the river are the Iranian Customs House and Stores godowns. In this connection a steel jetty for cargo ships is under construction on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab about £ mile upstream of the junction of the two rivers. At the mouth of the Karun on the left bank is the Iranian Naval H. Q. and barracks. There would appear to be certain facilities for good billeting in the A. I. 0. C. buildings and in the town, though in the latter case the question of sanitation would prove an obstacle. With the exception of the A. 1. 0. C. buildings, the sanita tion of the town is primitive. (b) . Water, light, etc .—The water at Mohammerah is plentiful and good in the Shatt-el-Arab, but purer and cooler in the Hafar channel, a difference of 16 degrees in the summer having been recorded. It should always be boiled before drinking. Water from wells is not suitable for drinking, being salt and brackish. There are no ship-building, engineering works or oil fuel stocks. (c) Iran Navy—The Iran flotilla in the Persian Gulf consists of three gunboats (armament two 4' guns, two 3' anti aircraft guns and two machine guns on bridge) and four patrol vessels (armament two 3' guns in bows and two machine guns in stern).67 In addition, the Navy possesses one tug and some lighters for service in the Persian Gulf. The Naval Office, Officers Club, barracks, stores, engineering workshop and elevated water tank have been completed and are in use. A metalled road along the left bank of the river connects the naval offices, barracks, etc., with the A. I. O. C. road to Abadan. There are five naval jetties on the left bank of the Karun in front of the naval offices and barracks. There are no naval wharves or docks. A 6,000 ton floating dock for the Navy has recently been delivered from Italy and is located at Bandar Shahpur, there being insufficient room for it in the Karun or Shatt-el-Arab. (d) Medical .—Details are given in Chapter IX.68 APPENDIX IV. Bandar Shahpxjr. 1. General .—Bandar Shahpur was officially declared open by H. I. M. The Shah in December 1932 and has been used by a few ships&gt;every month. Ships of 24. feet draught can reach the port but a great deal has still to be dWe in the way of survey and navigational aids in the Khor Musa before the port can be considered safe for regular shipping. The port itself li^son the seawawt-^edte of a large mud flat, which extends back soVe seven miles before becoming what mav be properly termed thy mainland/ At high tide this mud flat is flooded to a depth of 2 to\] feet. It has not yet emergecNirom a state of a railway construction terminal and an accumufytibu /f steel, rails, sleepers, etc., occupies most of the storage sWcef The port consists of an area about | mile long by 200 wirdsUvide at its broadest point, which has been filled to a height offivot to eight feet above the natural level of the mud bank^ An additional area 800 feet long and 200 to 400 ft. wide hasvdlso been \unded off with a view to reclamation. \/ / The main linerof the Railway runXlength-wise through the raised area and leaves ont on to a jetty. 2. Wharves chtdjetnes. —At present tliyre is one jetty. This is approached EivlHNfiduct some three hundred yards long of tim ber construutjoiiNyrrving a single line of raiWay. The jetty is also of wooW^K^onstrnction on piles and carnV; two tracks for a length of J^out 400 feet. An extension to tVs jetty on steel piles haw betn completed and the face of the old portion has been takoqj/ further 15 feet out into the stream. Thus the depth of water at the face of the jetty is probably \ver 30 feet. Total length of face is now 850 feet. The extra wid\h provides space for a third railway track but the single track Approach about 1,000 fret in length on wooden piles still limits theVapacity of the jetty. Movement of barges to and from the unloading berth is only possible at high tide. The depth of water 45 feet out from the jetty face is 60 feet L. YV. O. S. T. The depth of water at the bar at the mouth of the Kf Musa Channel is about 22 feet L. YV. O. S. T. The width of the Khor Musa deep water channel is from l mile to | mile.67 APPENDIX IV. BANDAR SHAHPUR. I. General. Bandar Shahpur was officially declared open in 1932. It is situated 30 miles up the Khor Musa Channel and lies on the seaward edge of a large mud-ilat which extends back some 7 miles before what may properly be called the mainland is reached. At high tide this mud-flat is flooded to a depth of 2 to 3 feet. i he port is on the deep water channel and consists of a reclaimed area about 1 mile long and 400 yards unde at its widest point which has been filled to a height of 5 to 8 feet above the natural level of the mud-bank. ^ The total population of the port amounts to some 3,000 people. I here are two good brick bungalows occu pied by the Port Manager and the Port Maintenance Engineer. There are also three blocks of 6 to 12 bunga lows each for the customs and railway staff and n few other brick buildings used by shipping agents and con tractors. There is also a primitive brick-built rest-house. Coolies live in mud-brick huts and reed shacks. Other buildings are a brick railway station, six small steel-framed corrugated iron sheds used for customs and raihvay warehouses and a brick loco shed and workshop. A brick fire station has recently been installed with simple fire-fighting equipment, A new brick customs iiouse is in course of construction. In 1940 about 80 ships entered and cleared in the foreign trade of the port, while 5 German and 3 Italian ships have taken permanent refuge since the outbreak of war with their respective countries. II. Naval Organisation. Tvo Iranian naval sloops are usually anchored in the channel. The Port Manager is an Iranian naval officer. A naval barracks is being built but at present only a handful of naval ratings live on shore.68 III. Defences. Apart from the sloops above mentioned the only defence force consists of an infantry detachment of about 75 men who are quartered in 3 blue-painted wooden huts. There are no defence works. IV. Port Facilities. The port is the terminus of the Iranian State Railway which runs north by a single track to Ahwaz, Tehran and Bandar Shah on the Caspian. On the raised area there are 4 main railway sidings and a Y for turning locomo tives. The main line runs lengthwise through this area and leads out on to a jetty over a wooden viaduct some 300 yards long. The original jetty was also a timber construction but an extension on steel piles has been added giving a total length of 850 feet. Th e jetty carries a, triple railway track but its capacity is limited by the single track approach. There are no fixed cranes. Loading and unloading is carried out by ships' derricks supplemented by two 15-ton travelling steam cranes operated by the railways. There aie also two 10-ton caterpillar cranes for manipulating cargo in the customs. Under present conditions the cargo capacity of the port is about 800 tons a day. Recently b\ a special effort &lt;,500 tons of bagged wheat was dis charged in 8 days. Cargo is also occasionally discharged into barges which are unloaded over planks to the shore. There are 7 steel barges m the port ; 4 carrying an approximate load of 100 tons are owned by the Port authorities and 3 carrying an approximate load of 250 tons by the German Hansa Line. The latter are not worked. The following motor craft are also available 1 small tug used to take pilots to the mouth of the Khor Musa. 1 powerful towing launch belonging to the Hansa Line. 2 small motor boats belonging to the Lloyd Triestino. 2 small naval motor boats which are used for handl- ing baiges with Iranian Government cargo.GO All lo.iflin' and unloading is a Government monopoly and is carried out by Iranbar, a department oi’ the Ministry of Finance. Communications apart from the railway are either poor or altogether lacking. There is no road or telephone and the only telegraph is the railway telegraph which is available for public use only between 1 and 2 p. m. and after 9 at night. There is a Post Office at the railway station but letters to Ahwaz take 3 days. A new Post Office is under construction. (a) Berths and Anchorages. Th*e width of the Khor Musa deep channel is from i to £ mile and ships of 28 feet draught can reach the jetty. The depth of water at the bar of the Khor Musa is about 22 feet L. W. 0. S. T. The depth of water at the face of the jetty is over 30 feet, while 45 feet out from the face of the jetty the depth is 60 feet L. W. 0. S. T. The approximate rise and fall of tide at spring tide at tl'&lt;e bar is 11 feet, at the port 18 feet. Two ships can berth alongside the jetty simultaneously. (b) Fuelling Facilities. None. Fuel oil could be supplied to ships at the jetty from 40-ton railway tank wagons, if required. It is delivered to the German and Italian ships by the Iranian naval tank barge. (c) Water Supply. None. All drinking water is brought by rail from Ahwaz and boiler water by rail from Gurgur, half-way to Ahwaz. The Iranian navy brings its water from Khorramshahr in a 100-ton tank barge, which is also used for delivering water to the German and Italian ships. (d) Provisions. Local produce (mutton, beef, foAvls, eggs and Persian vegetables) are available in small quantities.69a (e) Repair Tacilities. A G,000-ton iloating dock supplied from Italy is moored a little upstream from the port hut is rarely if ever used owing to lack of workshop facilities, it was constructed in three parts so as to be self-docking but it is reported that the parts have been rivetted together. Its bottom is said to be already in a very bad state. (f) Recreational Facilities. None except wildfowl shooting. Y. Air Facilities. None at Bandar Shahpur but there is a landing ground at the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company’s survey camp at Bandar Mashur, about 10 miles upstream. YI. Hospitals and Medical. None other than the Iranian port doctor. YII. Meteorological. None. VIII. Target Facilities. None other than the buildings, dock and shipping already indicated.

Iraqi-owned River Craft. (a) Steamers.APPENDIX VIII. Country Craft. The total country craft registered on the Tigris and Euphrates are 5,560 comprising :— Mahailas with a capacity varying from 5 to 150 tons with an average capacity of 50 tons .. 554 Bdlums with a capacity varying from 1 to 80 tons and an average capacity of from 5 to 10 tons • • • • • • •. .. 2,500 Miscellaneous Smaller Craft with a capacity of less than 5 tons .. .. .. 2 506 No accurate statistics are available as to the distribution of these craft on the Tigris and Euphrates, nor of the number based on Basra. No information is available as to the numbers that work up the Karun, though they are believed to be considerable. The Mahaila varies in length from 30 to 80 feet. It has an average draught fully loaded of 3 to 4 feet, but the largest Mahailas may draw up to 6 feet. It ie broad in the beam, has one mast with a lateen sail, and is particularly noticeable’for a high sheer forward and aft. The Bellam is a long, narrow, double-ended, very shallow draught, canoe-shaped craft, absolutely flat on the bottom and with no keel. Fully loaded, it rarely draws more than 1' 6'. Both stem and stern are rounded and finished off with a curve. The sheer is not so exaggerated as in the case of the mahaila. Both types of craft are admirably adapted for the water in which they have to work. A mahaila can do the journey from Basra to Amara, 132 miles upstream, in four days under favour able conditions, and with a suitable wind can do the return journey in under twenty hours. Mahailas and bellums when proceeding upsteram against wind and current and unable to sail are towed by a long tow rope led from the stem through a block at the mast head to the crew on the bank. Mahailas were used during the Great War forfloaurg bridge and are still so used in certain places in Iraq.84 APPENDIX IX. Ferries. 1. Over Bahmanshir River, two miles North of Abadan .— Consists of a raft of two pontoons connected together and decked in. Deck space 25 feet by 10 feet. Maximum load 12 tons, dead weight. Time of turn round of raft—16 minutes. Ferry is actuated by an engine (I. C.). Only restriction to use of ferry is that it.is prevented from working by rough weather, on very rare occasions only. Ferry can be operated by night. A. O. I. C. personnel operate the ferry. Approaches. Concrete ramps laid down to ferry on each bank. No stacking or parking space exists within 600 yards of the banks owing to date palms. Vechiles are run on and off over a moveable tailboard on the raft. Vechicles run under their own power. No ford exists nearby. Except very occasionally animals can swim across. The river is 754 feet wide and tidal. Banks consist of shelving mud. 2. Over Ab-i-Gargar at Band-i-Qir — Consists of one raft or boat. Deck space 20 feet by 10 feet. Capacity 2 tons dead weight. Turn round about 20 minutes. Ferry actuated by hand winch. Use restricted by periodical floods, generally about February or March. Can be operated by night. Iranian Government employees operate ferry. Vehicles are run on and off by ramps.

E. of Behbehan.89 APPENDIX XI. Facilities at Transfer Points. 1. AHWAZ. (a) WHARF FACILITIES.—A. I. 0. C. old wharf down stream of rapids (left bank). —This wharf is no longer in use and the cranes have been dismantled. It could possibly be put into operation again in a few weeks. The bridge limits its use to vessels under 18' high. A. I. O.C. Netv Wharf donmstream of rapids (right bank). This wharf is part of a transit depot in use for handling packed oil and bulk Diesel oils from barges and loading on to rail for despatch upcountry by Iranian State Railways. There is also a stores site for handling material received from Abadan bv river and consigned to Fields areas. Two 15-ton cranes Scotch derrick type are in use for handling barges. Barges are moored at dolphins 40' from bank. The rise of the river from lowest to highest flood is 23£ feet. A. I. O. C. Wharf upstream of rapids (left bank). —Well constructed. Can take 5-ton axle loads. Two steam jib cranes (one 7-ton, one 3-ton). One barge at a time can take in or dis charge cargo under the 7-ton crane all the year round. A second barge can tie up under the 3-ton crane in winter when the water is high. The A. I. 0. C. provides crane operators and functions as Port Trust ” at these wharves. (b) ACCOMMODATION. —Iranian State Railway has good godowns, workshops, etc., and ample space for depots Iranian military barracks’ have accommodation for 3,000 and will be increased. Town improvement schemes well in hand. (c) WATER. —There are small piped supplies in the A. I O. C. and barracks areas; these would probably be insufficient for military requirements which would have to be obtained from the Karun river. (d) ELECTRICITY.—Railway area; right bank of river. A. C. supply from Diesel-driven generators, totalling 1,500 k. v. a., 3 phase, 50 cycles, 3,300 volts. The supply is transformed down to 440 and 220 volts. A. I. O. C. area ; left bank of river. —3 phase, 50 cycle A. C. from Kut Abdullah power house, 8 miles away, bv over-head transmission line at 11,000 volts.90 Line capacity 205/300 k. v. a. transformed down to 440 and ‘ 220 volts at Ahwaz. (e) ENGINEERING FACILITIES. —Fairly well equipped railway workshops. No constructional stores. There is an ex-workshop building which could be made available for plant imported from other sources. There are also six empty sheds which could be used for storage accom modation. (/) LABOUR. —No organised labour is available. Much of the casual labour which is available has had experience with railways or A. I. O. C. Two thousand men could be recruited within 48 hours or 5,000 within a week for temporary or permanent duty. &gt; (g) COLD STORAGE. —There is no cold storage. A. I. O. C. have a small ice machine which is only sufficient for their own needs. There are one or two local contractors who could probably supply one or two tons of ice daily. 2. DAR-I-KHAZINEH. (a) WHARF FACILITIES.— Length of wharf 150 to 200 feet. Can take 5-ton axle loads. Access to the wharf is by good metalled roads and the light railway. The wharf is occasionally submerged during periods of floods—say, once in 5 years. Two cranes serve the barges. One 15-ton Scotch derrick and one 10-ton travelling crane. A. I. O. C. can supply drivers. (6) ACCOMMODATION. —Very limited accommodation exists within the A. I. O. C. area and there is suitable additional space adjacent thereto. • Buildings suitable for offices would be available. Sites are easily accessible to roads, light railway and drinking water (river). It is very unlikely that any of the available space will be built over in the future, but if it were, there is ample additional space close by. It is possible that some of the existing buildings will be removed during the next few years, but if so it will create addi tional space for depots or camp sites. (c) WATER. —The existing pij&gt;ed supply would be in sufficient for military requirements which would have to be withdrawn from the river.91 (d) ELECTRICITY. —There is a small D. C. supply (110 volts) in pumphouse. Probably only a small amount could be made available for military requirements. (e) ENGINEERING RESOURCES.—Nil. (/) LABOUR. —No organised labour is available. 300 men could be recruited within 40 hours or 1,000 within a week for temporary or permanent duty. (g) COLD STORAGE. —There is no cold storage. A. I. O. C. have a small ice-making plant which might be able to Produce J ton a day for military requirements. (h) LOCOMOTIVE AND ROLLING STOCK ON DAR- -I-KHAZIN EH — MASJID-I-SULEIMAN RAILWA Y.

In Abadan a stock of major engineering stores and mechanical plant for the special use of Fields areas is maintained. I his stock is centred in Abadan, in preference to one of the inland areas, in order that it may more readily and economically be transported to the area in which it may be required. The value of this stock is usually around a figure of £(39,000 and is composed of the following. Bridging Material .— 3—120 feet Callender Bridges. 1—100 „ 1 80 ,, yy yy Note. —These may be made up into 140 feet spans or any number of shorter spans. The units are 10 feet long and the above stock represents 54 units. 200 sections of troughing for Callender Bridges or the forma tion of any other type of bridge. 14 lengths of 18'X 8' X 30' joists. 12 lengths of 15' X 6' x25' joists. 150 varying lengths of No. 2 and No. 0. G. B. Larssen steel piling. Tankage .— The following tanks are of bolted construction :— 500,000 gall, capacity 50.000 12.000 2,500 1,000 400 miles. •r n ii104 APPENDIX XVI. Maps and Map Reproduction. Maps. 1. In addition to the maps accompanying this report the following maps are available :— (а) War Office 1/M and 1.250,000 series for Basra area. (б) Survey of India 1/M, and 1/4 inch series covering the whole area (see footnote). (c) Survey of India 1/2' series covering the Central Oilfields Area only (see footnote). 2. The Basra Port Directorate publish a chart “ Shatt-el- Arab and Basra Harbour ” Sheets 1 and 2, scale 10^' = ! mile and 16'= 1 mile respectively. 3. The A. I. O. C. have a 1 mile survey of the Oilfields in the Central and Southern Area. These maps are not on any regular sheet system. Map Reproduction. The A. I. O. C. have a small drawing and printing office at Masjid-i-Suleiman with three draughtsmen and one hand press. The Vandyck process is employed, using zinc plates up to 40'x26'. The hand press is capable of 40 impressions in a normal working day. Note .—These sheets are at present largely out-of-date and are being redrawn.11)5 APPENDIX XVII. Provision of Intf.kpreter.s. Good interpreters are not at present plentiful. It is very ■unlikely that as many as 8 first grade interpreters with a sound knowledge of English, Arabic, Persian and Turkish could be produced from Basra. Men of the second grade with a satis factory knowledge of English, Arabic and Persian could probably be found in Abadan. There are .'100—400 British employees of the A. I. O. C. who have a knowledge of English and Persian, though in many cases only of the spoken language. The maxi mum that Basra could provide of third grade interpreters with a satisfactory knowledge of English and Persian (written and spoken) is about 12. The pay of interpreters varies according to grade and pro ficiency. 'The minimum pay per month without rations, being in the neighbourhood of Iraq dinars 10 (Its. 133 or £10) and maxi mum I.
