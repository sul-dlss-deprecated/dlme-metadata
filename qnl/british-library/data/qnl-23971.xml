The sneeches in Arabic and Persian contain no political or unsuitable sentiments, they con sist of compliments etc.^ The ManamahBaladiya speech mentions some of its recent activities such as telephones and mentions a recent reduction in house taxation. 1 am sorry not to have sent these speeches before but they have been so slow coming in. 1 should be much obliged if these speeches could be returned to me after the Resident has received the originals which will be given to him by each speaker at the Durbar. CAddress on behalf of H. E. Shaikh Hamad. Your Excellency the Resident, Ladies and Gentlemen:- It gives me great pleasure to welcome the Hon’ble Lt, Col. T.C.W.Eowle, C.B.E., on this occasion which is his first visit to Bahrain in his capacity of Resident in the Persian Gulf; I welcome him myself, and on behalf of my father, Shaikh Isa, the members of the Khalifah family and our beloved people. His Excellency the Resident Colonel Fowle is an old friend of ours. We were acquainted with him some years ago as Political Agent in Bahrain and though his previous appointment here was only for a few months we annreciated then his honesty and straightforwardness, his sympathy and courtesy, and his directness and decisiveness. The presence of Colonel Gordon Loch as Political Agent also gives us very great pleasure as he too is an old friend of ours and has returned to represent his Government for the second time in Bahrain. Ladies and Gentlemen:- It is very fortunate to have with us these two friends at tj-is critical time, the former in Bushire and the latter in Bahrain, for our country isjpassing throughthrough a time of crisis caused by the world financial depression and also from other local reasons. All of you, Ladies and G-entlemen, know that the progress of our country and the welfare of our people depends on the demand for pearls: this demand has shrunk as the resources of the world have been strangled. People desist from buying pearls and other luxuries during a crisis. Recently we saw the following report. During 1929, three years ago, the value of pearls imported into America during July, August and September was over three million dollars, during the same months this year, the import was only 162,000 dollars. America bought three years ago nearly twenty times as much as she bought this year. This great difference in the amounts shows the present serious condition of the industry. The present adverse conditions have resulted in decreasing our revenue to half what it was some years ago. But in spite of these adverse conditions the essential services provided by the Government are not materially affected. The public peace, praise be to God, is well main tained by local men who constitute our recently re organisedre-organised police; education for boys and girls is provided free in our numerous schools, which are pro gressing with a firm step; free medical services sre provided and the indigent sick are cared for; the two municipalities carry out useful work, being paid a monthly subsidy from the Government, and all these things are evident to all who visit our towns. What is worthy of mention is that taxation is nearly non-existent, with the exception of Customs duty and a small municipal house tax, nor is there, at present, any income tax. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen, tiiat lately no important projects have been carried out owing to the financial conditions. The bridge (sea-road) between Manamah and Maharaq is not yet completed owing to lack of funds. This is a matter which we much regret because such a work would employ hundreds of labourers who are now unemployed. We are hopeful however that financial conditions will improve. ¥ou are aware that oil has now been found in Bahrain and we hope that its extraction will be carried out with vigour and expedition. Mechanism is increasing in the world and oil is being be needed more?0 -4- more than before* We hope that the prosperity of Bahrain will be increased from beneath the ground as it has flowed in the past from the pearls beneath the sea which made Bahrain so famous in ancient times. Finally we thank Colonel Fowle for his presence here today and we look forward to many meetings with him in the future. Usual ending. and fortune will flow freely to Bahrain this source Hamad bin Isa-a'From. £^ : j.0 1 $- ■- The Hindoo Community, Bahrein. To Hon'able Lt. Colonel T.C. W. Fowle, 'f-rf-E Resident in the Persian Gulf. On behalf of the Hindoo coiauiunity, I beg to offer four Excellency, most cordial and whole-hearted welcome to this port and express our deep sense of appreciation of the honor that has been conferred upon us to see Your Excellency as a humble marie of respect. Your excellency's arrival at this port after a lapse of about sixteen years refreshes our memory ol those critical times created by the 'The Great war'. Even then as H.B.M's Political Agent though for a very short period, through your kind exertion and sympathy our difficulties were averted. We take this opportunity and pride in seeing Your Excellency exalted to the present post and feel proud in congratulating Your Excellency. We are inspired with great hopes the welfare of British subjects in particular will always be at Your Excellexicy 1 s heart. In spite of Your Excellency's old connection with this port, it may not be out of place to mention that Bahrein is one of the important ports in the Persian Gulf, having special trade pecularities. Of late there have arisen grave difficulties .and hinderances in freedom of trade-which ultimately may result into diversion of trade from the hands of BRITISH SUBJECTS— these are receiving the attention of h.3. M's Political Agent but Your Excellency sympathy and support iwhich we have been, enjoying for will revive our lost Lraa^ waxou nc no. more than a centuary. In conclusion I may again be permitted on behalf of the Hindoo community to offer our most humble and loyal homage and express our pleasure at this opportunity of welcoming and pray that Your Excellency will enjoy a happy tenure of office.&gt; ^ '3 ( ^ Yuur iixcell*iiG/,La^i«s anti Gantlemtn, I thank you with all my heart for the warm welcome you have given us and for your good wishes which I deeply appreciate. A&amp; you know,! was,for a short time,ten years ago,Political Agent in Bahrain ana I am very pleased to re-visit the island and to see ray old frienas again. 1 am also very glad to see for myself tne signs,of which I have heard so much,that Bahrain has progressed rapidly and has established herself as a model State among tne acuainistrations of the Persian Gulf. I congrat ulate Your excellency most heartily upon this happy state of affairs. But the very success that lias attended Your Excellency’s Government brings its own problems: for good government attracts people from foreign countries to settle within its sphere,and increased population and new institutions mean increased calls upon all Departments of State. I am sure,however,that the progress of the past five years will be continued and that a recovery of world prices,for which we all earnestly hope,will enable still further progress to be made,and also enable greater attention to be given to places away from ianaraa and Muharra^. 1 would especially inpress upon Your Excellency the need for agricultural develop ment,as a means both of obtaining foodstuffs and of providing employment for many who now have but scanty opportunities of getting work. Not only have great advances been made in the internal administration,but Bahrain has been brought into closer touch with the World by the development of communications - a weekly stear^-mail service,a telephone service anu last ana most spectacular of tht pioauets of aodem science, the weekly service of imperial Always* 'ou have all seen how flying has developea - at first tnere were simall ira chines ana there was much Discomfort ana but few people oared to travel by air* Today you see the magnificieftt ana ccuforteble aeroplanes of i perial Airways bringing you within a few aays of Europe and. Inaia. Banrsin is inueea fortunate in becoming: an airport as well as a s^a port* I have come to you for tue first time as Political hesioent in the ; ersian Gulf at a time when the thou^chts of all are centreu on the terrible failure of trace,which uas been felt in Bahrain very utraly because the chief article of exportpearls,is a luxury ana is,therefore, one of the first things to be affected when people have less money to spend. I have watcheo with deep concern the difficulties that have been felt in tae pearl traae ana among the divers owing to Urn tienvy arop in the prices obtainable for pearls. You will remember that last season there was a riot owing to tne aivers being discontentec with the aavances. hatorally,looking back,we can ail sympathise with poor men who fina their small earnings growing less,but it is essential that law ana order should be maintained ana all must learn and remember that violence is not the correct method of obtaining tne rearess of grievnnces and i am giaa to Warn that the Police / Force behavec admirably in trying circumstances ana the trouble was prevented from spreading and causing widespread damage to life ana property \ iin the Town. This is pest history ana,I trust, will not recur; ana 1 ad glau to find that tne position oas improved as there Las been in the last few months an increase of some 2Q$* in the prices of pearls at Behndn and that there seem to be feigns of' an improvement in the European fnc indisn markets* This should help cx)th the traacrs and the aivers to pass through the prase hard times, lam improvement sec-ms,moreover,to be taxing place in tne a&amp;te market and in otl^er directions* As you all know,prospecting for oil has for sometime past been carriea on by tne Bahrain Petroleua Company and oil has been founa ? but it is too early as yet to fona an opinion as to whether a profitable oomneroial fiela can be aeveioped* The next few months shoula make it possible to form an opinion on tne subject,and, in the seantin*e,though it is possible that the financial pesition of Bahrain will be improved by the development of an oil field,yet it would be unwise to count upon it* These improvements in the pearl ana ante markets,aim the possibility of the aevelopraent of an oil inaustry ere unaoubtealy hopeful signs: but the ship of State xs not yet out of tne storm - ail that we can say is that there are slight signs of the aaverse weather abating* The budget position is giving cause for very serious anxiety,the revenue is less than last year and even after arastic curtailment of expenditure it is likely that tne State will have to take money from tne j eserve Fund in oraer to meet its current expenditure. This cannot go on for long anu,unless there is a marked rise of prices in tne marketsin the next two months it will be necessary to consider oven more rigid curtailment of expenoitur* than has been curried out in the past. I aw sure that Your Excellency will do &lt; all tuat is possible n to ensure that expenditure ic brought down to a level r&lt;hich ie covered by the revenues. There are two other Ratters on which I should like to touch. One important direction in which,I unaer- stand^ublic opinion is beginning to demand a change is the administration of wa^fs. in tue past unfortunately,it has been only too often, the case tnat the property of widows and orphans has been made away with,even by inose entrusted with tneir care. 1 know tuat tnis matter is unaer tue active consideration of Your Jtcellency f i , Government and 1 feel assured tnat this state of affairs will no longer be allowed to continue* hut in this kind of matter Government alone can qo f little: there must be a sound public opinion to help them,end i hope that the leading men among you will assist the Government of Banrain in tneir efforts jo safeguard Jlhe property of those unable to look after their own interests. There is another matter to which I should lik&lt; to refer. In recent years it has been found that water can be obtained easily fro/a artesian wells, it is no doubt an excellent tiling that tuere shoul&lt; be a copious supply of fresh water for all,but 1 understand tuat tne widespread use of artesian wells m haurain is lively to give rise to two dangers against which it is necessary that we should be on our guard* in tne first place, allowing water to run unchecked from these artesia; I wells may low#v tue he*u of water ana it may be Ittmt ia /wars to coma shall fina tiiat we can no longer enjoy the benefit of an artesian water supply because we shall have aissipateh t±ie water tl * greater ra^e than it collects undergrouna. in the secum. place,the presence of water on the surface of the land has caused an increase in ■ malaria ana i fear that unless care is aaaax exercised the abundance of water may prove to ori%; a serious danger to tne public .health in tae form of malarial fever* i believe that a persons who wish to wake artesian wells oust obtain peraiaaion ana i think that the Government of Bahrain would be wise to exercise a strict control,both in granting permission to bore fresh task,and 1 aa sure trial 1 speak for all of you as well es nyse!f,of congratulating v -nan hahaaur Abaid Rahman ^iyani on his well deserved nonour. it gives me great pleasure to see him here nis afternoon ana to nave the opportunity of ofienng hi® my congratulations* Finally,! thank Your excellency ana you, i^aies and Gentlemen,once ag? in lor ill* welcome which you have given me and i woulu express my most sincere hope that unaer lour ixoellency , a Government Bahrain may see a continuance of progress and a return of prosperity.

Before 1 end ny speech I have the pleasantCaptain - rior hns juet left liftfirain after turee ariu a naif years during which he has none much to neip jfour ..xceliency ana four ..xcellenc^ f s officers in carrying tnrougn improvements in the aomini strati on. i an sorry that he is not present for ne to bid hiia Goc-speed. i need narnly introduce your new Political Agent,^aiut Colonel Loch. Hot only haa Le been here before himself &amp;s 'olitical Agent but o.ne of his feraily, Cep tain ^oc*a K.H*,aade the first agreeaent between the British Govemnent eoc four excellency's ajocestw-rs no less than 11 b year a ago. L_!i our excellency,wadies and uentlemen, i thank you with all my heart for the warm welcome you have given us and for your good wishes which ± deeply appreciate. as you know,! was for a short time about 16 years ago, political iigent in Bahrain and i am very pleased to re-visit the island and to see my old friends again, in particular i am delighted to have had the opportunity of meeting once again our r old friend nis excellency shaikh sir isa bin ali al khalifa, i am also very glad to see for myself the signs,of v/hich i have heard so much,that Bahrain has progressed rapidly and has established herself as a model state among the administrations of the rersian ijulf. i congratulate *our excellency most heartily upon this happy state of affairs, sut the very success that has attended ¥our excellency's government brings its own problems: for good government attracts people from foreign countries to settle within its sphere,and increased population and new institutions mean increased calls upon all departments of state, i am sure, however,that the progress of the past five years will be continued and that a recovery of world prices,for which we all earnestly hope,will enable still further progress to be made,and also enable greater attention to be given to places outside Manama and Muharracf. ^ i would especially impress upon iour excellency the need for agricultural development,as a means both of obtaining foodstuffs and of providing employment for many who have now but scanty Opportunities of getting work. not only have great advances been made in the interhal administration,but sahrain has by the exertion of your government, assisted by those of the British government and those of British companies,been brought into closer touch with the world by the development of communications - a weekly steamer mail service,a telephone service and last and most spectacular of the products of modem science,the weekly service of imperial Airways. iouhave all seen how flying has developed - at first there were small machines and there was much discomfort and but few people dared to travel by air, xoday you see the magnificient and comfortable aeroplanes of imperial Airways bringing you within a few days of ijiirope and India, jaahrain is indeed fortunate in becoming an air port as well as a sea port* i have come to you for the first time as political resident in the rersian ^ulf at a time when the thoughts of all are centred on the terrible failure of trade,which has been felt in .Bahrain very hardly because the chief article of export,pearls,is a luxury and is,the re fore,one of the first things to be affected when people have less money to spend. i have watched with deep concern the difficulties that have been felt in the pearl trade and among the divers owing to the heavy drop in the prices obtainable for pearls. iou will remember that at the beginning of this season there was a riot owing to the divers being discontented with the advances, ivaturally,we can sympathise with poor men who find their small earnings growing less,but it is essential that law and order should be maintained and all must learn and remember that violence is not the correct method of obtaining the redress of grievances. ± am glad to hear that the rolice j?orce behaved admirably in trying circumstances and the trouble was prevented from spreading and causing widespread damage to life and property in the rown. This is past history 5trust,will not recur5 and 1 am glad to find that the position has improved as there has been in the last few months an increase of some 20 # in the prices of pearls at Bahrain and that there seem to be signs of an improvement in the European and Indian markets. Ihis should help both the traders and the divers to pass through the present hard times, oome improvement seems,moreover, to be taking place in the date market and in other directions. as you all know,prospecting for oil has for sometime past been carried on by the Bahrain Petroleum company and oil has been found, but it is too early as yet to form an opinion as to whether a profitable commercial field can be developed. # - ihe ne *t few monthsshould make it possible to form an opinion on the subject,and, in the meantime,though it is possible that the financial position of Bahrain will be improved by the development of an oil field, it would be unwise to count upon it, xhese improvements in the pearl and date markets,and the possibility of the development of an oil industry are undoubtedly hopeful signs: but the bhip of state is not yet out of the storm - all that we can say is that there are slight signs of the adverse weather abating. xhe budget position is giving cause for very serious anxiety, the revenue is less than last year and even after drastic curtail^ ment of expenditure it is likely that the state will have to take money from the very small reserve which it has been possible to build up in order to meet its current expenditure. rhis cannot go on for long and,unless there is a marked rise in the markets in the next two months,it will be necessary to consider even more rigid curtailment of expenditure that has been carried out in the past, i am sure that your excellency will do all that is possible to ensure that expenditure is brought down to a level which is covered by the revenues. There is another matter to which i should like to refer. ±n recent years it has been found that water can be easily obtained from artesian wells, it is no doubt an excellent thing that there should be a copious supply of fresh water for all,but 1 understand that the widespread use of artesian wells in Bahrain is likely to give rise to tv/o dangers against which it is necessary that we should be on our guard, in the first place,allowing water to run unchecked from these artesian wells has lowered the head of water and it may be that in years to come we shall find that we can no longer enjoy the benefit of an artesian water supply because we shall have dissipated the water at a greater rate than it collects undergound. in the second place,the presence of water on the surface of the land has caused an increase in malaria and i fear that unless care is exercised the abundance of water may prove to be a serious danger to the public health in the form of malarialX fever, i believe that a proclamation has already issued ordering that persons who wish to make artesian wells must obtain permission and i think that the government of Bahrain would be wise to exercise a strict control,both in granting permission to bore fresh water wells and also in checking any undue waste from those wells which are already in existence. uur friend captain rrior has just left Bahrain after three and a half years during which he has done much to help iour excellency and lour excellency's officers in carrying through improvements in the administration, i am sorry that he is not present for me to bid him cod-speed, i need hardly introduce your iMew political Agent,j_»t colonel cordon eoch. jwot only has he been here before himself as political Agent but one of his family,captain coch .tc.IT. .visited tjahrain and made the acquaintance of *our excellency* s ancestors no less than 113 years ago. before i end my speech i have the pleasant task,and i am sure tha^ i speak for all of you as well as myself,of congratulating nhan bahadur Abdul nahman ziyani on his well deserved honour, it gives me great pleausre to see him here this afternoon and to .have the opportunity of offering him my congratulations, finally,! thank *our excellency and you,cadies and centlemen, once again for the welcome which you have given me and i would express my most sincere hope that under Your excellency-s covera- ment bahrain may see a continuance of progress and a return of prosperity, ee assured that i will do all that lies in my power to help Your excellency achieve those objects. ■ __INCORPORATING:- STEPHEN LYNCH g&lt;C9 LYNCH BROTHERS, LTP GRAY, M ACKE N Z I E A C9 and GRAY, PAU L &amp; C9 Telegraphic Address:- 'mespers’.'
