It could be argued that His Majesty’s Government are owners of line from Hamadan to Huraitu out as Irak skeleton staffs have been withdrawn Persian Government now have nine points of the law. I am therefore in favour of making virtue of necessity and of formally handing over to Persian Government control of line which we reconstructed without prejudice to claim for our expenditure which could be discussed later. If His Majesty’s Government decide to maintain that claim Director of Indo-European telegraph Department thinks it would be advisable to take off a percentage of capital cost as rent for use of line during British Irak occupation as in the case of central Persian line.

I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a despatch, with enclosures, from nis Majesty’s Consul- General at Meshed, regarding damages done to the telegraph line in the Khaf district. The position taken up by the Persian Administration in this case appears to me tenable and not unreasonable, even if somewhat ungraciously expressed, and I concur with Colonel Prideaux that a ruling regarding the action to be taken in such cases is desirable, pending the settlement of the telegraph questions between his Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government, of which the latter’s claim to the control of the Meshed-Seistan line is one. It is obvious that, in the circumstances, I am not in a position to formulate such a ruling, and I therefore refer the case to you for such action as you may deem necessary.

It will be seen fro® the second paragraph of the India Office letter of June 28th, that the Secretary of State for India sees no objection to the restoration of the control and operation of the Meshed-Seistan line to the Persian Government, subject to an assurance from them that the line will not again be allowed to pass into Russian hands, while paragraph 3 contains the recommendation that such a transfer should not be accompanied by a claim for the value of the improvements made in the line during its occupation by British telegraphists, as the cost of such improvements hae formed part of the war expenditure incurred by the Bast Persia fores. 3. The Secretary of State is disposed to agree to this procedure and has telegraphed accordingly to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as will be seen from the accompanying copy of a telegram addressed to Sir P.Loraine on the subject. His Lordship has, however, refrained from Issuing The Secretary to the Treasuryissuing definite instructions to Sir Percy Lorains sending the concurrence of Their Lordships which he will be glad to receive at Their early convenience, 4* copies oi this letter are being sent to the India Office and Colonial Office* 1 &amp;m 9 Sir, t our obedlent Servant, (8i4fied) LANCELOT OLIPHANTFOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l COfXt.

It will be seen from the sixth paragraph of the India Office letter of June 28th that the secretary of state for India while recognizing the importance of maintaining control over the Tehran- H&amp;m&amp;d&amp;n-Ehanikin telegraph line, is unable to assume any financial responsibility in case of any loss incurred in the working of this line by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Government of India. 3. Lord Balfour considers that British control of the main telegraph line from Bagdad to Tehran i® an undoubted political asset which it is desirable to maintain in British hands. If Mr. Churchill holds the same view, His Lordship will be glad to learn whether he is prepared to accept, on behalf of Iraq, the contingent financial responsibility in case of any resultant lose to the Indo-European Telegraph Department on the working of the line* 4.

The Secretary of State has now addressed to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran a telegram on this subject, a copy of v/hich is enclosed, from which it will be seen that His Lordship concurs in the proposals of Viscount Peel regarding the disposal of the Meshed-Seistan and Eamadan- Kazvin lines and of the telegraph offices at Mohammerah and Abadan. 3. As regards the suggestion, contained in paragraph 3 of your letter under reply, that the claim against the Persian Government for the value of the improvements made on the Meshed-Seistan line should be waived, the Secretary of State is of opinion that, as these improvements were paid for as war expenditure of the East Persia force, the sanction of His Majesty’s Treasury will be necessary for the waiving of His Majesty’s Government’s claim for repayment, and he is approaching the Lords Comnnissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury accordingly. 4. In view of the political importance of maintaining direct telegraphic communication between Bagdad and Tehran, Lord Balfour is enquiring whether Mr.Secretary Churchill will accept financial responsibility for possible loss in the working of the Khan ikin-Hamadan-Noberan line.

For the maintenance of the land line from Karachi to Jask the Department pays certain small stipends to various chiefs, both in British and in Persian territory. V Various alterations/in the land line and cable arrangements from Karachi to Bushire between 1860-70, towards the end of which period the line was duplicated. (The 'inner” land lines shown on the map as part of the Mekran system are much later in date). ilo. 2 . . Bushire to Tehran and No. 2.A. Tehran to Khanikin were originally constructed in 1860-70 as a route continuing the line from Karachi to Bushire on to Tehran and so to Khanikin. (The section 2 A from Tehran to Khanikin was no longer required by the^ Department when the ( Kwtn'it - Tik&amp;t*n. ) Indo European Telegraph Company’ s line, No 1 . 5, was built, and it was allowed to pass into Persian control. It is this section which, having been improved during the war by the British forces, it is now proposed that the Indo European Telegram Department should ' resume ”. as it has the right to do under Art.XVI of the Agreement of 1872.) The Bushire-Tehran line was reconstructed by the Department, witn iron instead of wooden poles, between 1869 and 1872 in which year the Department was given the control and maintenance of two out of the three lines carried, the third being reservei for the Persian Government for Persian local traffic. The Agreement of 1872, which remains valid till 1945, referred primarily to the Bushire-Tehran line, but is explicitly stated to apply also to the Tehran Khanikin line (No.2 A) should the Department resume this line. No. 3.No. 3 . known as the Central Persia line, (in combination with No. 3 A. the 'Indian extension of the C.P. Line' - ■‘i. ^ gives direct land communication between Tehran and India. (The extension^is wholly in British territory: the gap between it and the eastern end of the C.P. line at Hurmak is bridged by the Department renting two wires from the Indian Telegraph Department on its line from Quetta to Hurmak). The Central Persia line, constructed between 1902 and 1907, is held, i.e. maintained and operated, by the Indo-European Telegraph Department under a concession obtained from the Persian Government in 1901: the concession, which is similar in general to that of 1872, is also valid till 1945, as is that of 1916 in virtue of which the Department constructed maintains and operates the connection between the Central Persia line, at Hurmak, and Seistan (No. 3 B )• No. 4 . The Arabistan lines from Borasjun, on the Tehran-Bushire line, to Ahwaz and from Ahwaz to Bizful on the one hand, and Mohammerah on the other. By the agreement of 1913 the Indo-European Telegraph Department undertook the reconstruction and maintenance of these lines : the offices however remain in Persian Government control. (Practically the whole of the Arab istan lines were taken over by the British forces, and,later, the Iraq Telegraph Administration^ during the war, and the latter has not yet withdrawn from the offices at Mohammerah and Abadanj. This arrangement, which involved on the Department an irrecoverable expenditure of £5000 and further expenditure recoveraole in instalments to the extent of £18000, is not in itself remunerative to the Department (there will be £11000 - £12000 unrecovered at the termination of the arrangement in 1945), but was entered into to obtain from the Persian Government extensions o± the more important concessions, Nos. 2, 2A and 3, till 1945. (Note. In respect of lines Nos. 1, 2 and 3 tne In do -European Telegraph Department obtains revenue by taking 2/3 oi the terminal charge on international messages which originate or terminate in a departmental office, and 2/9 of the charge on such messages originatingoriginating or terminating in a Persian Government office: in view of this last fact and the fact that the Arabistan lines (No. 4) are connected with the cable at Bushire, not directly, but by means of the Borasjun-Bushire section of the Departments Tehran-Bushire line, No* 2, the Department gets 2/9 of international traffic originating or terminating at Arabistan off!ces*) No* 5 *: I Jill 1 J iiii iiil Ill II I * If If II if is the Indo-European Company 1 s line from England via G-ermany and Russia to Julfa, Tabriz, Kazvin, Tehran. It has been interrupted since 1914 but will, it is believed, be re-opened shortly for traffic between Tiflis, and possibly Russian offices, and Tehran. No* 6* from Ramadan to Kazvin was started by Russian forces and completed by British military forces during the war, to establish and maintain communication with Dunsterforce and Norperforce. It is now of no particular value (beyond the value of its material) to British interests and we have no right to it. The Persians recently seized control of it by force and His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at once demanded Rs.90,000 compensation, its constructional cost. It is proposed to let the Persians formally take it over, and possibly the withdrawal of the demand for Rs.90,000 might prove a useful lever in negotiation for other points especially in regard to ratification of the agreement for No. 7. No. 7 . wit. »n Jnin ti,. Jfc.* hA- from Bunder Abbas to Kerman with branch to Saidabad / was constructed during the war for military reasons. There is no agreement for it; but negotiations for one have been in progress for some time and also for two extensions ’ to Lingah on the west and Jask on the east respectively. No. 7. - vr from Tehran to Meshed is a Persian Government line. In 1885 at the time of the Penjdeh crisis when reliable communication with Meshed was important the Indo-European Telegraph Department undertook to maintain the line in an effi cienti efficient state, and this arrangement has been perpetuated. There is no formal agreement. The Department’s outlay on the line originally some Rs. 20000 annually is now limited to Rs. 40,000: the Persian Government puts up a corresponding but less sum annually for maintenance,and takes the receipts for traffic. 8 . f rom ^ es hed via Birjand to Seistan is also a Persian Government line. Before the war the Russians without any real justification assumed control of it, ejecting the Persian staff and establishing their own. When after the Russian revolution the Russian M cordon' in E. Persia withdrew and General Malleson’s force went to Meshed, the British force took control of the line and put in some improvements, value not known. It was contemplated to try to ne 0 &gt;tiate for the Indo-European Telegraph Department to maintain control for the whole line from Seistan to Meshed, or at any rate to Birjand; but as the Government of India are satisfied with their means of communication with Meshed ,via Tehran 5 and are not willing to expand money to secure other than Persian efficiency between Seistan and there is no reason why the line should not be allowed to revert to Persia. /3 - w. 2 iSECRET.

II. Translation of an Agreement with the Jam of Beyla, dated the 21st December 1861. M hereas it is in contemplation to carry on as far as India the communication now opened between Great Britain and other high States of Europe and Asia by continuing the Line of Electric Telegraph from Constantinople and Bagdad through Persia and Beluchistan to Karachi, and whereas, in the prosecution of this scheme of universal benefit, it has become necessary to take measures for the security and protection of the said contemplated line, the high Government of Bombay have deputed Major F. J. Goldsmid, for the special purpose of entering into such negotiations with the several Chiefs, holding territory between Karachi and Guadur, as may be deemed necessary for the due furtherance of the aforesaid undertaking. Now the line of coast from the Hubb River to Khos Kulmut or its vicinity, a distance of 240 measured miles, being within the Territory of Jam Meer Khan, Chief of Lus Beyla, the undersigned, Major F. J. Goldsmid, on the part of the British Government and with the knowledge and consent of its firm ally, Khodadad Khan, Ruler of the Sovereign State of Khelat, hereby makes agreement with Jam Meer Khan aforesaid, for the construction, maintenance and protection of the Line of Telegraph between the above-mentioned places. The detailed agreement is as follows :— I. The materials for the line may be landed on any part of the coast between the Hubb River and Khos Kulmut, and all reasonable assistance will be rendered by the local authorities in ensuring its security and facilitating its construction, due payment being made for labour or articles supplied. II. There will be two telegraph stations erected for the residence and office of Signallers, one at Sonmeanee and one at Ormara. III. All individuals authoritatively employed in the construction, maintenance or use of the line aforesaid shall receive such protection and assistance from the local authorities as will enable them to prosecute their work without let or hindrance, due payment to be made for labour or articles supplied. IV. A sum of rupees 10,000' :!: ‘ yearly shall be paid by the Political Agent at Khelat to the Jam of Beyla, on the understanding that he keeps up an establishment of not less than men, on salaries of rupees per mensem in the aggregate, for the due protection of the line, and rendering such assistance as from time to time may be required by the telegraph employes stationed on the coast. * * The amount of yearly payment must depend on further reference as to the actual work required. But the undersigned is of opinion that the full sum may be double that fixed for the pay of a watching establishment here entered. For instance, supposing such establishment to be Rs. 330 per mensem, the yearly amount would be Rs. 3,960, of which the double would be Rs. 7,920. This would be estimated in round numbers at Rs. 8,000. A 24 . , rp-norted at any time that the said establishment is Y.

Consequent upon die exchange of notes which has taken place between the Embassy of Her Britannic Majesty and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Sultan on the subject of the extension of the line above ground from Baghdad to Bussoia and to Khanakain, with the object of connecting by two different hnes the Indian Telegraphs with the telegraphic net-work of Europe, the Ambassador of Her Britannic Majesty at the SublimeT’orte and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Sultan, with a view to tins, hare decided on the following arrangement: Article I—The Ottoman Government will extend at its own expense— m tLa Ptia nbovp pround from Baghdad to Bussora. n (2) It will construct a line above ground from Baghdad to Khanakain on the lereian Frontier. These two lines shall consist of two wires, of which the one shall be kept exclusively for direct messages. 2. The Indian Government, on its side, at its own cost, shall carry the Indian submarine cable, which joins at Bushire, either to Bussora or to some other point at the mouth of he Shat-el-Arab,-which shall be designated later, and which shall be connected with aboveground^^ ent sW1 famish to the Gttoman Gojnment Ml the necessary materials, including the poles of iron, for the construction of the two lines who'are already at Baghdad, as also the Inspector and the four sub-officers of the British Engineers who are soon expected to amve m that city shall be placed at the disposal of the Ottoman authorities to.co-operate in the construction The' Ottoman Government shall pay bAhffi 6 messag™ from lla^Wch'shall ^“iroft eTeTeX^eandrontie? o? the Ottoman Empire, be it to Bussora6 arrangement which the two Governments and the period of: the payment of eras far as Khanakain, according to a special reserve to themselves to establish, to determine the mode th6 f he ^'Engbeers to be paid by the Indian Government.

The Sublime Porte shall take care, if need be, to employ, for the working of these lines, persons acquainted with the English language. T j- n n i P 9 ®A11 the despatches addressed to or coming from India shall be equally divided between the line from Bagdad to Bussora on the one hand, and that of Khanakain on the 0tL To avoid all difficulty of execution, the application of this system of division shall be as follows :— „ i i All despatches coming from India shall pass by the line from Khanakain. On the other hand, all those for India shall be sent by the line from Bagdad to Bussoia, 10 The stipulation of Article 9 shall remain in force for ten years, at the end of wnich it can be revised by means of a new understanding between the two Governments. ^ 11 The two Governments reserve to themselves the right to determine on ana. conclude a Telegraphic Convention on the basis of the Act of Brussels, which constitutes the International Law of lines of Electric Telegraphs.

SIGNED IN TLIE ENGLISH and French Language^ at Constantinople, 3rd September 1864.1 Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans, being desirous to establish between their respective States telegraphic communications, by means of which India, connected by a submarine cable with the Ottoman territory at the'mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, will be in telegraphic communication with Turkey, and consequently, with all the other States of Europe, have agreed to conclude a Telegraphic Convention, and with that object have named as their Plenipotentiaries, that is to say, Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the Right Honourable Sir Henry Lytton Bulwer, a Member of -^ er Majesty’s Most Honourable Privy Council, Knight Grand Cross of the Most Honourable Order of the Bath, and Her Majesty’s Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the sublime Porte. . . , And His Majesty the Emperor of the Ottomans, His Highness Mahomed Emm All lasiia, Minister for Foreign Affairs, decorated with the Imperial Orders of the Osmanie of the Medjidie, and of Merit of the first class in brilliants, Grand Cross of several Foreign Orders, who, after having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following Articles : — Article I. The Ottoman Government will continue, at its own cost, to the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, the main telegraphic line of Asia now existing between Scutari of Constantinople and Bagdad, and will connect the said main lines in the direction of Khanakain, with the Persian land lines which communicate with the submarine cable at Bushire. The maintenance and repairs of the said Ottoman lines will be at the charge of the Ottoman Administration. * On 9tli December 1863, an additional article was added to the protocol, stipulating that instead of dividing the traffic equally between the Bussora and Khanakain lines, messages should be forwar e indifferently by either line, and that payment should be calculated on the mean between 375 and 89 miles, e distances between Bagdad and Bussora, and Bagdad and Khanakain respectively, so long as both lines are kept in efficient working order, t Ratifications exchanged at Constantinople, 31st October 1864.^ be i Wnunent ^ ernm ®t e^ 10se Nielli- “goftlieseii^ efiualh- ^ banakain oat isionsliallfe: 5 end of wit nts. a and conclalti the Intematifi ister for Fom Ireland, aiii i their respetti 1 ' i submarine®;' e in teleg®! 1 of Europe. i&gt;- i Member -.

III. His Majesty the Sultan authorises the establishment on Ottoman territory at the month of the Shat-el-Arab, of a British Telegraph Olfice, with a staff, which shall not exceed in number 50 persons, placed under the exclusive orders of a British Station Master and which, as well as the apparatus and all the instruments requisite for working the submarine line, shall be at the expense of the British Government. IV. The aforesaid British Office shall be located in the same building occupied by the Ottoman station at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab, with a view to facilitate the combined operations of the common service. The apparatus of the Ottoman service and that of the British service at that joint station shall he placed in separate compartments, but in close proximity to each other, and shall not he connected. The exchange of messages shall take place immediately on their receipt, the officers handing them to each other through a window, and the service of the British and Ottoman offices shall he permanent. The rent and cost of maintenance of the mixed telegraphic station shall be shared in equal proportions by the British and Ottoman Administrations. V. It is well understood that the active service of the British Office on Ottoman territory shall be limited to the receipt and delivery by hand to the Ottoman Office of the messages arriving from India by the submarine cable ; to the tranmission of those which are delivered to it by the Ottoman Office ; and lastly, to the superintendence and maintenance of a safe and regular submarine communication between the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab and India. The Direction-in-Chief of the mixed station shall devolve on the Ottoman Administration, hut without the right of interfering in the internal administration of the British Office. VI. In order to ensure promptitude in the Indo-European correspondence and its regular transmission and receipt the Ottoman Government will not fail to establish a permanent service at Bagdad and Fao, as w T ell as at the majority of stations on the main line of Asia between Constantinople and Fao, and to appoint thereto a staff possessing a knowledge of the English language sufficient for the perfect performance of that important service. Moreover, the Ottoman Government being desirous that the expeditious transit of the Indo-European messages over its territory should he rendered still more satisfactory, engages to establish at Constantinople an office of transmission devoted exclusively to the service of messages to and from India. Its officers, and especially the Station Master, shall be selected from those of the Ottoman telegraph officials who are thoroughly conversant with the English language. VII. The Ottoman Government will take the necessary measures to secure that one wire of the main line from Constantinople to Fao, shall be always exclusively devoted to Indo- European messages. In case this wdre should get out of order, or in case of a press of traffic, the official Indo-European messages may be forwarded by one of the wires intended for local traffic, hut after the official despatches of the Ottoman Government. In that case private Indo-European despatches shall be forwarded, together with private messages already deposited at the office, and in alternative order with those messages, whatever may have been the hour at which the latter may have been deposited. VIII. The Convention of Brussels, of 30th June 1858, in all that relates to the details of the telegraphic service shall be mutually observed by the two contracting Governments, in so far as it is not opposed to the terms of the present Convention. IX. It is agreed between the High Contracting Parties that the rates for Indo-European messages sent by the Ottoman lines in Asia throughout their whole extent from Constantinople to Eao, or to the Persian frontier in the direction of Khanakain and vice versa, shall not exceed the limit of 27^ francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Fao or vice versa, and of 22§- francs for a single message sent from Constantinople to Khanakain or vice versa, as also that the rates for messages traversing the whole submarine line from India to Fao, or to Bushire and vice versa, shall not exceed the limit for the former of 62J francs for each single despatch and for the latter of 50 francs. X. The administrations of the two contracting Governments will communicate to each other with the least possible delay the tariff of their stations and frontiers, in so far as they may have reference to the Indo-Ottoman frontier of Eao. According to that tariff the rates shall he mutually accounted for in the monthly accounts of messages exchanged between the two administrations at the aforesaid frontier of Fao. XL The mutual account for telegraphic rates, expenses of postage, and of expresses, &amp;c., shall be checked at the expiration of every month and settled quarterly. The liquidation and payment of the surplus which may be due to either administration shall take place at the close of each quarter. The accounts of each administration shall enumerate only the rates in debit: they shall be drawn up by the Ottoman Administration in francs and centimes, the total being * A •; \ I I I SI ! i * 118 reduced to shillings and pence ; and hy the British Administration in shillings and pence, the total being reduced to francs and centimes.

As Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of. Great Britain and Ireland, and His Maiesty the King'of ail the Kingdoms of Persia are desirous of regulating the te eg p communication, between Europe § and India, and of placing this work «n the sur mid friendly basis, 'they have resolved that a_ Convention for that purpose shall he cone wherefore their Majesties have named as their Plenipotentiaries : ^ i tr Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland ; is EX lS C M^ °* Persia ; His Excellency Mirza Syud Kl1 And the aforesaid distinguished representatives, after meeting in the capital ° £ Teheran and perusing and exchanging their letters of full power, and finding them to be in due order, have concluded the following Articles , T v Article I. In order to improve the telegraphic communication between Europe an&lt; T . 1 ’ the Persian Government agrees to attach another wire to the poles now standing from Bushire to Khanakain, and to bring it into working order as soon as possible. I he wi e solely for international messages sent in European languages.II. In. order tlmt tlie second ire ina,j lie nttnclied m o, complete nnd effective manner the Persian Government also agrees that it shall be done under the direction and supervision of an English Engineer Officer and staff; and the Persian Government will use its best endeavours to collect the necessary materials and lay down the wire with all expedition HE The British Government agrees to procure for the Persian Government at a reasonable price and with the cognizance of a Persian Commissioner all the wire, insulators, morse instruments, &amp;c., that may be requisite for this work, inclusive of 200 iron posts for the marshy tracts of Bushire* and to deli\ei them ovei to llie Government Commissioners at anv seaports or frontier towns of Persia that may be suitable, receiving payment in five years in five instalments. IV. The Persian Government, moreover, agrees that an English Telegraph officer with the necessary staff not exceeding 50 in number exclusive of families, shall be engaged from the opening of telegiaphic communication through the new wire for five years in organising the Persian line of telegraph, and giving instructions in telegraphy. And the British Govern ment agrees that the English officer and his staff shall, at the expiration of the prescribed period, make over the said line to the Persian Government and cease connection with Persian Telegraph. V. The conditions under which the English Officer shall exercise control over the second wire during the prescribed period are stated in the following rules:— 1 . His Royal Highness, the f tizad-es-Sultaneh, Minister of Science, or any other person, who, by the Shah’s order, may be appointed in his plane, is to be considered the head and absolute chief of all the Persian Government Telegraphs. 2. Any order which His Royal Highness, or such other person in his place, may issue, concerning the protection of the line, its working, and the Persians employed on it, shall be given through and with the approval of the English Telegraph Officer. 3. For the protection of the line the whole distance from the Turkish Frontier to Bushire shall be divided from station to station into six sections as follows:— From the Turkish Frontier to Hamadan. „ Hamadan to Teheran. ,, Teheran to Cashan. ,, Cashan to Ispahan. ,, Ispahan to Sheraz. ,, Sheraz to Bushire. To each of these divisions the Itizad-es-Sultaneh shall appoint a Persian Officer, who will be responsible to His Royal Highness for the protection of the line situated within his limits. To enable the said Persian officer, or Yaver, of each division to carry out his duties efficiently, a certain number of horsemen shall be stationed under his orders along the line. The Yaver will, of course, accept any suggestions which the English Telegraph Officer may give with reference to his charge, due regard being had to the customs of Persia and her power of carrying out such suggestions. 4. The organisation of offices and instruction of employes shall be exclusively in charge of the English Superintending officers, who will be responsible for the working of the line in these respects; and the Persian signallers shall be ordered to obey implicitly the instructions which the English officers may give in the performance of their duties. 5. In case of insubordination or misconduct on the part of the Persian Signallers, His Royal Highness the Itizad-es-Sultaneh engages to use his best endeavours in lawfully supporting the authority of the English Superintending Officer, exercised under the last rule. On the other hand, the English officer engages that the bounds of that authority shall in no way be exceeded. 6 . The English officer shall have nothing whatever to do with receipts of money. A Mirza will be appointed at each station, who will be directly responsible for the accounts to the Itizad-es-Sultaneh. But the English Superintending Officer shall render to his Royal Highness, or any person who may be appointed by the Persian Government, such account of the telegrams despatched under his authority as may be sufficient of full information. These rules, however general in some sense, are understood to have special application to the second wire. VI. In filling up vacancies, which may occur among the signallers employed under Article IV, the English Telegraph Officer shall give the preference to natives of Persia, provided they be qualified, in his estimation, by knowledge of the English language, and other attainments necessary for this service, to perform the duties required. VII. As the Telegraph Offices of these two wires ought to be distinct, the Persian Government shall build a new office adjoining the existing one, wherever there are not separate rooms. VIII. If any injury befall the second wire, or delay occur through press of traffic, the first wire, which is specially used for internal communication in Persia, shall give assistance to the second wire and vice versa. IX. For every message of twenty words or less from Khanakain to Bushire, or vice versa, one toman, five krans and eight shahis in Persian money, or 14 shillings in English money, 21220 B10 shall be charged with proportionate rates for the intervening towns. The Persian Govern ment accepts the tariff laid down in the last convention between Turkey and England so far as regards the rates of messages sent by the two Governments from Bushire to India and from Khanakain to Constantinople or Europe. 1 n . ^ + , ,, + , X The yearly receipts will be credited to the Persian treasury, but should they reach a higher sum than thirty thousand tomans, the surplus will be made over to the officers of the English Government for the cost of their establishment. 1 I XI. All Indian messages at whatever part of the line or from whatever place received shall be given over 10 the second wire, and the accounts regularlv kept. XII. Should the traffic so continuously increase as to demand more than is in one day the fair day’s work on the second wire, the excess of telegrams shall be handed over for despatch to the' first wire, the money received on them being separately credited to the Persian Government. The adjustment of this matter shall rest with the Itizad-es-Sultaneh and the English Superintending officer. This article is quite irrespective of the provision for mutual assistance in the event of a slight and temporary delay. ^ : XIII. The cost of all other than Indian or submarine cable messages shall be separately credited to the Persian Treasury, although conveyed by the second wire. XIV. The relative value of coin shall be calculated for purposes of account at the following rates:— One pound sterling = 25 francs = 22 krans. One shilling = 1 tranc = 25 centimes — 1 kran = 2 shahis. One penny = 10 centimes = 2 shahis. As a rule accounts should be kept in English and payments made in Teheran in Persian currency. XV. ' The telegraph accounts shall be made up by the English Superintending Officer monthly and sent to Constantinople where, by comparison with the Cable and Turkish accounts, they will be checked by the British Commissioner appointed for that purpose. On the return to Teheran of the audited accounts from Constantinople, the amount due to the Persian Government will be certified by the English Officer and speedily paid every six months, as stated in the last article. The above account shall always be open to the inspection of the Telegraph Agent of the Persian Government at Constantinople, or any person recognised by the Persian Minister at the Ottoman Court for the settlement of accounts of international traffic on the Persian-Turkish line. XVI. The Telegraphic Regulations drawn up at Paris on the thirteenth of April, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five shall be carried out under the superintendence of the Persian Government so far as not opposed to the terms of the present convention or the institutions of Persia. XVII. Any disagreement arising between the Telegraphic employes of the two Govern ments shall be referred to their Excellencies the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs and the British Minister at Teheran, in order tliat after necessary investigation, a just decision may be pronounced. XVIII. This convention shall take effect from the opening of correspondence on the second wire, and remain in force for five years from the day that a telegram is first despatched hereby. At the expiration of the five years it shall be null and void. If at any time within the term appointed the capabilities of Persian Telegraphers for their works shall be proved to the satisfaction of the Chief of the Persian Telegraphs and the English Telegraph Officer, the full period shall be curtailed, and the line made over altogether to the Persian Government. XIX. The present convention shall be ratified, and the ratifications exchanged at Teheran within five months or sooner, if practicable. Done at Teheran on the twenty-third of November, Anno Domini, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-five. VIII.

(Signed in the English and Persian Languages.) Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, being desirous to continue the system of telegraphic communication between Europe and India, through Persia already established m virtue of previous Treaties, have resolved that a convention for that purpose shall be concluded, wherefore their Majesties have named as their Plenipotentiaries— Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Ronald Fergusson Thomson, Esq, Her Charge d’Affaires at the Court of Persia, and His Majesty the King of all the Kingdoms of Persia, His Excellency Mirza Syud Khan, His Minister for Foreign Affairs, &amp;c, &amp;c. _ And the aforesaid distinguished representatives after meeting in the Capital of Teheran and perusing and exchanging their full powers which were found in good and due form, have agreed upon and concluded the following articles:— Article I. To expedite and facilitate the transmission of international messages, the English Government will at its own expense and under the superintendence of its own officers erect a third wire, in addition to the two already in operation between Teheran and Buslnre, and will also substitute iron standards for the existing wooden poles. The English Dovern- ment agrees to substitute the above iron standards at the rate of 500 annually ; and the Persian Government engages to pay in ten annual instalments the sum of 10,000 tomans to tne English Government towards defraying the expenditure incurred on these iron posts. During this work the Persian Government engages itself to render the Superintending officers every assistance in its power of which they may stand in need. II. Whereas all British subjects in Persia are entitled to the protection of the Persian Government under the operation of Article XII. of the Treaty of Paris of 4th March 1857, it isnow provided that the British employes of the Telegraph Department being charged with public duties shall be everywhere placed under the special protection of the local authorities, who shall furnish guards when necessary, and otherwise assure their personal safety. HI. Until the completion of the third wire provided for by the above Article I., the appropriation of the existing first and second wires for local and international messages shall remain as at present, viz., as regulated by Article VIII. of the Convention of the 23rd November 1865. IV. After the completion of the third wire, notice of which will be given to the Persian Government by the Director of the English staff, the appropriation of the three wires shall be as follows:— The first wire, viz., the one set up originally in 186d, shall be used for local traffic, while the second and third wires shall be used for international traffic, with the exceptions herein after specified in Article VI. V. To prevent any confusion in the working of the different wires, the first wire shall be worked by Persian Government employes, and the second and third wires by English Government employes, separate rooms being provided by the Persian Government for the said English and Persian employes in telegraph offices considered suitable by both Administrations. AT. (a) Should the first wire be broken at any time, one of the others shall be temporarily lent for Persian correspondence, until communication by the first wire is restored, provided always that both the second and third wires are at the time in good working order throughout their length, and free from contact. ( 6 ) Should the first wire be in contact with either the second or third wire while the remaining wire is clear, the wire in contact with the first wire shall be insulated to allow free working by the Persian employes on the first wire until the contact is removed. (c) Should the first wire be in contact with the second or third while the remaining one is interrupted, or should both second and third wires be interrupted ; or should all three wires at any time be in contact the resultant single line shall be used by the English and Persian Administrations in the respective proportions of two-thirds to one-third of the day, the exact hours to be fixed by mutual agreement between the English and Persian Directors. ATI. The revenue derived from the local traffic on the Persian wire shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. By local traffic are meant messages originating at one Persian station and terminating at another Persian station. ATII. The Persian Government having already made an arrangement with the Indo- European Telegraph Company, regarding the revenue derived from the Indo-European traffic, the English Government will abide by that agreement so far as they are concerned ; that is to say, the Persian Government, in consideration of a fixed annual payment by the said Company of either 12,000 tomans or of two francs per message of 20 words, renounces all claims to any portion of the revenue from transit traffic over the line from Julfa (on the Russian frontier) to Bushire. This revenue shall therefore be divided between the English Government and the Indo-European Company in such manner as they themselves may decide, and the accounts between them shall be settled without the intervention of the Persian Government. As regards international messages originating or terminating in Persia, the Persian Government agrees to cede to the English Government, for a term of three years, the entire Persian terminal tax on such messages in consideration of a fixed annual payment of 2,000 tomans to be paid to Persia by the English Government. After the three years the Persian Government shall be free, either to accept an annual payment calculated on the basis of two-thirds of the average terminal receipts, or to claim two-thirds of the receipts from all bond fide terminal messages. The Persian Government agrees to leave it to the sense of justice of the English Government to decide vdiich are bond fide terminal messages, and which are to considered as transit messages, being forwarded to Persia evidently for the purposes of being re-transmitted to other countries. During the time this Treaty remains in force, the Persian Government engages itself to oppose at the International Telegraph conferences any alteration in the present transit and terminal rates, unless a previous agreement with the English Government shall have been made. IX. The English administration being responsible for the correct transmission of all international messages and for the adjustment of the accounts, will collect the payments for these messages according to the rates of the prevailing International Telegraph Convention. All international messages originating in Persia shall, before transmission, be registered and sealed by officials appointed by the Persian Government. International messages terminating in Persia shall be delivered to the addressees through the agency of the same officials, who shall be bound to give receipts for such messages to the English Administration. The Persian Administration shall at all times have free access to the English offices and to all records connected with international traffic. International messages are those which pass over the wires of more than one State.14 , irpnairs and tlie appointment, control and X. The maintenance of the line m q£ ^ Englisll Dh'ector and staff.

XX. English Translation of the Persian Concession of the 24th May 1869. The conclusions accepted by the Congress of Vienna having changed the basis of the Concession of the 11th January 1868, granted to Messrs. Siemens and Halske and Siemens Brothers, in forcing the actual Concessionnaires to fix a tariff which, is under the minimum ot 100 francs, stipulated in Article VIII of the said Concession, the Persian Government and the Concessionnaires having agreed to the following articles : I. The Persian Government concedes to the actual Concessionnaires for the period since the 1st January 1870 up to the expiration of the Treaty of the 23rd October Ifebo, all the rights that that Treaty gives them on the receipts accruing from international messages transmute over the Teheran-Bushire line. _ ... After the expiration of that Treaty the Teheran-Bushire line will be made over to the Concessionnaires, unless the Persian Government has made, meanwhile, a new convention on the same financial basis with the English Government concerning this line. In case the Treaty should be renewed, the Persian Government concedes to the Concessionnaires for the period up to the 1st January 1895, the date of the expiration o± t e Concession of the 11th February 1868, all the rights which would have accrued to the Persian Government, and that the renewal of the Anglo-Persian Convention would have still gnen them on the two-thirds of the receipts accruing from international messages transmitted ovei the line between Djulfa and Bushire, the third part already belonging to the grantees, as it is stipulated in Article IX of the Concession of the 11th January 1868. _ , . The Concessionnaires will themselves collect the above-mentioned receipts and to tnat effect will arrange with the English Government. f n™ In return, the Concessionnaires will pay to the Persian Government during jears r the 1st February 1870 to the 1st January 1895, at their option either a duty of 2 francs or each transit message which passes over the Djulfa-Bushire line, excepting service messages or an annual rent of 12,000 tomans. They shall pay this duty or the fixed rent in me iv cases, whether the Teheran-Bushire line be made over to them, or whether it remains un e the existing administrative conditions, the Concessionnaires then enjoying the revenue on y which may accrue to the Persian Government and to themselves. ^ .. Moreover, the grantees are prepared at the request of the Persian Government to pay a the debts which that Government has contracted up to the present with tne Eng isGovernment for the purchase of telegraph materials as well as the debts which the adminis tration of the I ersian Telegraphs has incurred with the same Government for the construction of the line. The amount of these debts should be determined before the 1st January 1871 bv the Persian and English Governments. Beginning from this date the Concessionnaires will be authorised to reimburse themselves, by deducting each year the twenty-fourth part of the sum agreed upon by the aforesaid Governments from the rent or the duties pavable to the Persian Government. J In case the settlement of the account between the said Governments has not taken effect at the date mentioned, then another term shall be fixed for this settlement—a term which is not to exceed one year. The Concessionnaires shall then have the right to reimburse themselves by retaining each year a sum equal to the twenty-third part of the sum determined upon. H again the accounts shall not have been settled at this last term, then the Concessionnaires will be freed from this obligation. II. 1 . *In addition, the Persian Government grants to the actual possessors of the Concession of the 11th January 1868 a concession exclusively for the construction and working of a telegraph Ime^ of one wire between Slmaz and Bunder Abbas.

The Concessionnaires bind themselves to complete the construction of this line as soon as possible. 3. The Concessionnaires bind themselves to construct the line and to maintain it in good state of preservation during the whole period of their administration. The telegraphic wire shall be made of iron of the best quality, and shall be six millimetres at least in diameter. The supports shall be of iron ; the apparatus shall be of the best quality. Whenever possible the stations shall be located at Shiraz in the offices of the Persian Telegraph ; in other places in such sites as the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Conces sionnaires shall deem suitable, and which shall be gratuitously granted to the latter, from land belonging to the Persian Government. 4. Like the lines already existing, the new line is equally destined for the despatch of international messages, which shall pass over the line of the Concessionnaires between London and Teheran. 5. The line will be considered as if it was an institution of the Government and will participate, under the relations of its organisation and of its security, in all the rights granted to the lines of the Persian Government. 6 . The Concessionnaires are exempted by the Persian Government from the payment of customs duty on the importation of materials for the establishment and maintenance of this line and of its offices, and they are freed from all local duties. The customs authorities shall, however, have the right of inspecting the consignments belonging to the Concessionnaires on the frontier. 7. The Concessionnaires shall have the right of constructing their line in the direction sanctioned by the Government across towns and villages along roads, without being bound to pay any indemnity for the land occupied by the line. In those places where the lines shall traverse private or common property, the Concessionnaires shall enjoy the right of forced appropriation conformably to the laws in force, and to the extent that the Government shall judge indispensable. 8 . The duration of the Concession is fixed at 25 years, to reckon from the day when the working of Shiraz-Bunder Abbas line shall have commenced. After the expiration of this period the privilege shall cease ; and the Concessionnaires should come to an understanding with the Persian Government on the subject of the continuation of their possession of this line. In the case of no arrangement having been concluded on this subject, all the line constructed by virtue of this Concession, as well as the buildings of the stations, shall be given up to the Persian Government without any indemnity. 9. The duration of the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas Concession expiring after the 1st January 1895, the precision and rapidity of the international traffic which depends on the uniformity of administration might be threatened if the Government should take back, at this date, the Djoulfa-Teheran and Teheran-Bushire lines while the Shiraz-Bunder Abbas still remained for some time in the hands of the Concessionnaires. * Paragraphs 1 to 10 of Article II. were subsequently annulled by the Concession of 1882.

It is agreed that the number of foreign employes along the whole Shiraz-Bunder-Abbas line shall not exceed 50 in number. III.

In accordance with the approval of the said respected representatives and this official letter it is permitted that the Indo-European Telegraph Department, without delay, will take action to renew and continue the Arabistan line with iron standards according to the following agreement, so that the work may be completed by the end of the coming spring. ^ When the Medjliss will be again assembled the agreement of the year 1327, with the amendments I have made in certain articles with the approval of the Cabinet Ministers of the Persian Government, and which are enumerated in this document, will be submitted to the Medjliss, with the exception of article 3, which refers to the extension of the three former conventions, and which is now sanctioned : the remaining articles of the agreement m review are to he submitted to the Medjliss for approval, and the Persian Government will harmonise with the Indo-European Telegraph Department accordingly.

Tehran, M. le Ministre, 9th January 191o. . Your Highness is doubtless fully cognisant of the arrrangement proposed to the director at Tehran of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, respecting the reorganisation of the Arabistan telegraph lines, and the prolongation of the existing Telegraph Conventions to 1945, by His Excellency the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, with the sanction of the Cabinet. I am submitting this document to my Government, but, as the original agreement was signed by my predecessor and His Excellency Saad-ed-Dowleh on the 17th June 1909, I have the honour to transmit herewith to your Highness copy of the letter from the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, which has been communicated to me by Mr. King \\ ood, director at Tehran of the Indo-European Telegraph Convention. I have, &amp;c., Walter Townley34 XXXI. Acrffmf'Jt between Great Britain and Persia respecting the construction of a Telegraph Line connecting Seistan with the Central Persia Line at a point near Malek Siah Kch on Persian Territory (1916). Whereas on the 17th of Shaval 1332, according to an official note addressed hy the Ministry of Foreien Affairs to the British Legation, the extension of a telegraph line from Seistan to T\nh i-Alalek Siah was authorised, and as in the above-mentioned note this authorisation was nn/le suhiect to an agreement to be concluded with the representative of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, the following articles are hereby agreed upon Article 1. The line shall connect Seistan with Malek Siali Kuh at a point near the Perso-Baluch frontier where the Persian Telegraph Administration may open an office, the wire being ] e d into the Persian Telegraph Offices, the Persian signallers being free to transmit local traffic. Article 2. The Persian Government reserve to themselves the right to liquidate the cost of the line, less 2,5001., hy payment extending over 30 years, and to assume contiol of the line at that date if the liquidation he complete. Article 3. Should it become necessary at any future date to add a second wire to the line the Indo- European Telegraph Department can do so at its own expense, and in 1945 this wire too will become the property of the Persian Government under the proviso of Article 9, and revenue derived from work on this wire will he treated according to the terms of Aiticle 7 of this Agreement. Article 4. None but Persian subjects or employes of the Indo-European Telegraph Department shall be employed on the Seistan Line or in the offices. Article 5. The Indo-European Telegraph Department shall be responsible for the control and the cost of the maintenance of this line, including repairs and renewals, control and payment of the Gbolams, and in return for this, the Persian Government agrees to allow messages^to and from the British Consul, Seistan, being passed free of charge up to an extent of 150L per annum. Article 6. The salary of the British Inspector and clerks of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment employed on this line will he paid hy that Department. Article 7. The revenue derived from the local traffic, messages originating at one Persian station and terminating at another Persian station, shall belong entirely to the Persian Government. _ As regards International messages originating or terminating in Persia, the Persian Government shall receive two-thirds of all bond fide terminal messages, and as regards transit messages—as this line is merely an alternative one—the arrangement already made as detailed in Article VIII. of 1872 Convention will be applied. Article 8. The line from Meshed to Seistan being merely a single wire line it is understood that this route can only be used for international transit traffic, within such, limits as will not interfere with the ordinary traffic of that line and only when the communication on the two existing routes between Persia and India is totally interrupted; whenever the Director of the In do-Telegraph Department requires to use the Seistan Line as a route for transit inter national traffic, the permission of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs must he obtained.

Sir, 28 JW19?' With reference to nay letter P.18 of 2nd February** and subsequent correspondence ending with your letter! of 30th May 2.5531,5421, and 5438/ 9/34 and Colonial Office letter of 1st June No. 26352, to the address of your Department as well as this Office, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a copy of a telegram from the Government of India regarding the disposal of certain telegraph lines in Persia which have been in British c ontrol. As regards the Meshed-Seistan line the Government of India are unwilling to incur the additional expenditure involved in the alterna tive methods propounded for maintain ing effective control compatibly with recognition of Persia’s rights; and they .are satisfied with the adequacy i of communication which they already have by reliable lines to Meshed and ^ Seistan. In these circumstances Viscount Peel concurs in their view that there is no objection to the restoration of the control and operation of the Meshed-Seistan line t 0to -she Persian GovernmenT?, subject to an assurance by that Government that the line will not again be allowed to pass into Russian hands. The promise of evacuation of this line will no doi^bt be a useful lever for His Majesty's Minister for securing what is desired in respect other lines; its utility would be enhanced (as the Director in Chief Indo-European Telegraph Department points out in his note of Erd May or which a copy i£ enclosed) if he could also promise that the evacuation will not be accompanied by a claim for the value of the improvements made in the line during its occupation by British telegraphists. The cost of such improvement will have been included as war expenditure incurred by the E. Persian Porce; the Secretary of State has no information as to its amount but is advised that little more was in fact done than the replacement of worn poles by new at no great expense. As regards the resumption by the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the line from xHianikin via Samadan and Uoberan to Tehran I am to invite attention to the second paragraph of the Director in Chief's note, and to suggest that His Majesty's Minister might now be instructed to request the Persian Government to hand over this line. Whether, in view of His Majesty's Covernment'smmsmm Draft Paper. 5042—2 2000 1/22 Department. Governments gratuitous surrender of the Meshed Seistan line, there is any necessity to forego a claim - W' Ml n for the/betterment of the IQianikin- Tehran line, would no doubt he left to dir P. Loraine T s discretion; but it would seem desirable that the waiver of this claim should not be offered unless absolutely necessary. It is noted from your letter of May 15th E.4734/9/34 that His Majestyb Minister has claimed from the Persian Government the value (Hs.90,000 as reported by dir P. Cox) of the Hamadan-Kazvin line. As Mr. Barker indicates, his Department can effect recovery of this sum, if authorised^o do so, in its accounts with the Persian Government. When a decision on this point has been taken it would appear possible, and (so far as the Indo- European Telegraph Department is concerned) desirable, formally to hand over the Hamadan-Hazvin line to the Persian Government^which seems in fact to have seized it by force. It is recognised that this recommendation^; (which was adumbrated oral■ in my letter P.18 of 2nd February) directly contravenes the suggestion made in my letter of 12th October last P. 4365 paragraph 3; but the circumstances have been changed by the i i 11 / i l! 1 fi I | J ' II a i:the Persians* forcible interference with the line and the presentation to them of a claim for its value; •nid, moreover, the Secretary of State for In while ready to co-operate in any measures regarding telegraph lines in Y,. Persia which may he considered to be expedient, has, (as will be seen oy reference to my letter of 4th June lySl P. 2293) always doubted the value to British interests of the control of this particular section of line. To the Indo-European telegraph Department and to Indian interests generally it is of no value. It id indeed questionable whether the acquisition of control of the Tehran-Hamadan-Ehanikin line is likely to De advantageous and not an actual cause of loss to the Indd-Suropean •Telegraph Department. (In this connection I am to invite reference to the last four paragraphs of Mr. Barker T $ note now enclosed, and Mr. Blocombe 1 s memorandum which accompanies it). As was stated in my letter of 4th June 1921 above referred to, the importance to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran and High Commissioner Baghdad, as well as to His Majesty’s Consuls at intervening points, Kermanshah and Hamadan, of the efficient maintenance of this line is fully recognised; and the Secretary of State in Council is for this reason willing that the Indo-European Telegraph Department should assume Pfre control^/ 1 ' theDraft Paper Department. But the interests of India in this region are so slight, and the finan cial consequences to the Department of this extension of its functions so speculative that Lord Peel feels that he must stipulate that, in the event of a loss being thereby caused to the Departmentjsuch loss shall he made good hy the Imperial Exchequer, It is observed from the most recent papers^referred to at the beginning of this letter.that the High Commissioner in Iraq has agreed of the Abadan and Mohammerah offices shall be settled in whatever manner appears to His Majesty^ Minister most likely to serve British telegraph questions now at issue with the Persian Government. Lord Peel has : nothing to add to what has already been said in previous letters from this Office regarding these two | |1 Offices. I am to express his regret that a final s sate mem; of his views his hope that Sir P. Loraine will be to the settlement of the various issues forthwith.

Arabistan office and lines were taken over, etcetera, for war expedition only and their ulterior return was officially promised to Persian government (see Sir C. Marling*s despatch No.124 of 1916). Persian government has more than once and again within last fortnight officially requested their surrender and has stated its inability to discuss exercise of our rights as regards Khanikin-Tehran line which it does not, however, deny, pending their cession (see Mr. Bridgeman’s telegram po.foO). We 2239 [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, an d should be returned to the Foreign Office i f not required for official use.'] ^ —f—We have no valid grounds for refusing their retrocession hut on the other hand success of other negotiations may depend on our frankly offering it. Though I am most anxious to help Irak interests to the test of my ability I cannot hut feel that her desire to retain these offices is incompatible withnore general British interests and that any advantage she might obtain thereby would be altogether outweighed by continuous friction with Persia which would inevitably ensuee I think that you must under-rate strength of Persian feeling against operations on Persian soil, without any form of Persian consent, of administration belonging to foreign and hitherto unrecognised state. Furthermore, I share secretary of State for India’s view that only effective way of settling outstanding telegraph questions between Persia and Irak is by conclusion of limitrophic agreement and I do not think that Persia would agree to participate in such negotiations unless assured beforehand that the two telegraph offices would he returned. py opinion, therefore, is that hesitation to promise surrender of two offices, besiu.es being contrary to our previous assurances, would prejudice prospect of two main British interests (1) Control of Khanik in-Tehran line.

Do you agree to this mode of proceeding ? If so, I will approach Persian government, and fix the date for a representative of Iraq telegraphs to negotiate a limitrophic agreement here. Repeated to London No. 214 and India.This decision of the Government of India to hand over the Beistan-Meshed telegraph line to Persia* subject to an assurr ance that the line will not be handed over to the Russians* should ease the situation, vis-a-vis Persia, to some extent^ as its surrender should render the solution of the other out standing matters less difficult ^specially if we make no claim to betterments. As I have already remarkedsee no good reason to offer anything in return for our resumption of control of the Teheran-Khanekin line;but if it should be considerjpolitic to make such an offer I consider that the renunciation of the coat of the improvements that have been madO to 'fefye line by us is an adequate recompense for such resumption, In view of the violent measures taken by the Persians in respect of the Hamadan-Kasvin line I trust that the refund of the Rs.90,000 expended on it will be insisted on and lhAt I may be given authority to recover it. I assume that its restoration to our control will not be demanded; I think we sx shall have all we can do to make.the T e he ran- Khane k i n line pay its way without having such additional burden attached to it. Mr.New has raised a point in connection wiuh the arrangament of a limitrophio rate for messages exchanged between Persia and Iraq. In my letter of instructions to him I wrote: to be arranged for as between Persia and Irttit a limitSiccrate for the exchange of telegrams between those two territorial areas and | would SSlt f?™ fSty to sixty osntims. » bsing sn appropriate amount to be divided equally • Mr.New has asked what proportion of Persia's share should the Indo-Suropean Telegraph Department take for telegrams transiting apy portion of the departmental telegraph linos and he proposes to arrange to take one third of it whatever the stationstation of origin or termination in Persia may be. In reply I telegraphed that th^iivision of the Persian share of the Persia-Iraq limitrophic rate should be avoided if possible until after that rate has been settled as premature discussion might have the effect of causing Persia to raise it higher than she otherwise would. I put u$ for information a note that Mr.Slocombe has written on the subject and would submit that I may be authorised to instruct Mr.New in the sense of that note as soon as we resume control of the Teheran-Khanekin line and have to come to terras with Persia in accordance with the second part of Article XVI of the telegraph convention of the 2nd December, 1372, With regard to messages from countries other than Iraq traversing the Teheran-Khanekin line I would submit that I may be authorised to arrange with Persia the division of the terminal rate in the proportion that obtains in respect of telegrams reaching Persia by the Teheran-Bushire and Central Persia telegraph lines. 3rd May, 1922,Note on Rate for Telegraph Traffic exchanged between Persia and Iraq. There are two regular telegraph routes between Persia and Iraq*; viz.,, one via Khanekin which is wholly a landline, and another via Bushire and the Bushire-Fao cable of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Before the War a great deal of the traffic between Turkey'in* As aa and Persia went via Bushire, even though the rate that way was hi^i, because the Khanekin route as worked by the Persians was very unreliable. The present rate via the Gulf cable for Persia-Iraq traffic is Fes.1.20 a word, made up thus For the Persian terminal Fes.0.60 ,, l&amp;o-Bushire cable ' 0.20 ,, Iraq , 0.40 Total , 1.20 and, until the Khanekin route is put into working order and properly staffed, it is probable that most of the traffic between the two countries will still pass via So: Bushire. It is desirable that traffic should be allowed to pass by the best working route open at the moment at a uniform rate. It is fair to assume that the Bushire route will always be the least liable to interrupuion and would therefore in any case carry a large share of the traffic, and often the whole of it, i.e., when the Khanekin route is interrupted from snowstorms and other causes. If the rate for telegrams were assimilated for all routes, it would mean that the Gulf raoe o* 20 centimes, which wholly goes to the Indo-European Telegraph Department, would have to be dropped. Of theOf the present rate of Fcs # U20 mentioned above, Iraq gets 40 centimes?or one-third. If the through rate were reduced to 60 centimes for all routes and- Iraq were willing to accept the same proportion, that is one-third or 20 centimes, there would remain a balance off 40 centimes?to be divided between Persia and the Indo- European Telegraph Department. The present division of the Persian terminal rate between the Indo-European Telegraph Department and Persia is (a) one-third to the Department and two-thirds to Persia on messages which originate or terminate at a departmental station, and (b) two-ninths to the Department and seven-ninths to Persia on messages which originate or terminate at a Persian Crown station. This arrangement has always held good and the Persian Govern ment will probably want to stick to it. But in view of the fact that the Department would be giving up its cable charge under the arrangement of rate assimilation suggested above, the Persian Government might well be asked that the Department’s third share of the Persian terminal rate should apply to all traffic between Iraq and Persiaa with effect from the date the proposed reduction of the through rate comes into operation. But before considering any reduction of the through rate, Persia will naturally require to know what is the lowest figure that Iraq will take as their share of it. I think this should be ascertained first of all. With this information in his possession, the British Minister can ask the Persian Government what is the lowest Persian terminal rate that Persia will accept on this traffic. The mm sum of these two terminal rates will be tiiiproposed new assimilated rate for all routes. Persia could then be asked if she will accept two-thirds • of theHEM/RE Dated Received 24th April s 1922 0 509-So Your telegram of the 25th We are not in favour of either of the Director-in^ Chief &amp; Indo«Iuropean Telegraph Department's proposal (sic) c We have adequate communication with Seistan and Meshed otherwise^ and have no need of direct communication with Vice«Ccnsul at Birjando Eence we see no justification for incurring any additional expenditure 0 We have no objection to the line being handed over to the Persian Government, subject to the assurance(s) suggested in (? paragraph No,,6Minister at Teheran's No,.fo We can trace no record of having expressed any such wish as that ascribed to us in his paragraph No#?

It seems to me that in as much as there is a distinct agreement that the Director can Teheran to Khanekin there is no reason why Persia should receive a quid pro quo for such a resumption. i If we relinquish our claim to repayment of our expenditure on the line from Kasvin to Khanekin it sbcfuld be in return note of the 13th January last. Mr.New asks in the last part o$ his telegram whether he may negotiate with Persia to station British telegraphists at Mohammerah and Abadan at Indian expense, jin the telegram of the 28th March to which he refers I 1 had deprecated the opening of Indo-Buropean Telegraph ;Offices at those planes but had informed him that he ■ might agree to lemd Persia supervision for those offices ^ on payment until she is able to stand alone. He appears tU to anticipate t&amp;at refusal of such an offer. My reason for proposing to make it was that it might assist in dstablishing public confidence in the new regime after the closing of the offices of the Iraiq administration. Il am not at all in favour of providing supervision at Indian expense as | see no chance of obtaining any return for such expenditure and.

Consulate. Office at Mohacrnerah Sir, In coninuation of my letter Ho. 448-S of today I have the honour to refer to that portion of the letters forming the first enclosure which refers to the Telegraph Office in Mohammerah Consulate. When the first portion of I.E.F.D. came up the Shatt- al-Arab and took Basrah telegraphic communication between Basrah and Mohammerah was found to be very bad, and it was decided to join Mohammerah Consulate by a short cable with This was done and an Indo-European Telegraph Department Office the Basrah Fao telegraph'line and open an office^bpened in Mohammerah Consulate when I was there as Consul at the end of 1914. The Indo-European Telegraph Department Office remained for some time, but as Mohammerah was in Persia and Basrah in Occupied Turkish territory the Indo-European Telegraph Department had to charge international rates. This resulted in unnecessary expense and inconvenience, and the office first, I think, became an I.E.F. Telegraph Office and then later when the Mesopotamia Telegraph Department was established certainly became a Mesopotamian Office which it still is. The ifThe object of Keeping it a Mesopotamian Office and not handing it over to the Indo-European Telegraph Department has been to enable messages to be sent at inland rates between Mohammerah \ and basrah c-inn bagudad* it is this system of Mesopotamia rates to which the Karguzar objects more than actual fact of the office being in existence, and in his letter he puts the losses caused by this at the extravagant figure of 5000 Tomans per mensem, as naturally all the Persians telegraph to Mesopotamia by this office at inland rates rather than by the Persian Office at Foreign rates. Now that the war is over, and the troops and influence of the Mesopotamia Expeditionery Force entirely withdrawn the existence of a Mesopotamia Telegraph Department Office in Mohammerah working as an inland office seems to be entirely indefensible. On the other hand the office itself is very useful to Sovernment and British firms at Mohammerah and persons elsewhere who desire to telegraph to the latter, as it obviates the delays of telegraphing via Bushire (cable) and Ahwaz (Persian Line), In the circumstances I venture to suggest that we might agree to abolish the Mesopotamia Telgraph Department Office at Mohammerah Consulate, which would do away with Mie anomally of an office in Persia telegraphing at inland rates to offices outside the country, and endeavour to get the Persian Govern- — ment to agree to a combined Post and Telegraph Office run by India (such as formerly existed at Bandar Abbas) on the understanding that telegrams should only be received from British Government officials and British firms for places out side Persia or served by the cable from Fao, and be charged Indo-European Telgraph Department rates. CP if the Persian Government would not agree to this, as the additional cost of having a telegraph office would not be great if it were combined with the Post Office, perhaps the Persian Government would agree to the Telegraph Office bein used for Government work only. inin the event of the Persian Government not agreeing or if the combined office not paying its way as a result of the extra cost of Telegraph portion of it, I see no alternative ,ut to close the Mohammerah consulate Telegraph Office altogether.

'Ln. tu,r 4 1 I 5 4532—2 3000 8.21 [3413—1] As to the control of the Seistan-Meshed line I suggest, to cover our retreat to some extent, a compromise' viz., that we tell the Persians in a diplomatic maimer that as we must have safe and efficient communication with our Consul at hirjand we'ask thorn either to let us put up a wire of ouw own on their posts from Seistan to Birjand and to leave us to control the maintenance of the line so far or to allow us to construct an independent line for our own purposes from HurmakA.(the fi-fst point of junction of the telegraph lines from German, Duzdab a and Seistan) to Birjand, part of such a line I take it already exists, see top two pages of P.5118/17. This suggestion is made on the assumption that if we have communication with each of our Consuls without having to depend for it on a line maintained by Persia we do/inot require to control an alternative affoiding the same result. We have control of a line to Seistan and can communicate with Meshed via Teheran hencehence given the control of a line to Birjand from the south the control of a line to the same place from the north becomes of minor importance and may be surrendered. If Persia agrees to one of these proposals we on our part would, in the first alternative / surrender the control of the line from Me shed as far other, as Birjand and, in the/altemative, the control or the line from Birjand to Seistan as well. Probably they will prefer the latter alternative as being the less likely to offend Russia. I think that when we aeassume control of the I’eheran-Khanekin line we mi$it either remove, seller give away, as may be decided-such part of tne Hamadan Kazvin line as we const meted; such a line did not exist before the war and I understand only a portion of it had been constructed by the Russians when we relieved them. AsBurJpncas as proposed in para.6 of the Minister’s telegram^ should in both cases be given. The chief monetary advantage Iraq derives from maintaining telegraph offices at Moharnmerah and Abadan is due to the exchange of traffic at the inland (Iraq) rate of two annas a word (with a minimum charge of one rupee) for ordinary telegrams which in the absence of auch offices would,(in the absence of an agreement with Persia for a differential rate) cost one gold franc e word to exchange with Persian telegraph offices at those places. This one gold franc is made up of the Iraq terminal rate of forty centimes (gold) and the Persian terminal rate of sixty centimes (gold). A secondary Advantage, the only ene referred to by Sir Percy Cox, is derived by Iraq x from the acceptance of foreign telegrams at their offices^ the revenue under existing circumstances is obtainedfrom the collection of a terminal rate of ten centimes (gold) a word* This rate, it will be recalled, was fixed early in the war at the instance of the Treasury and although the terminal rate for foreigi messages exchanged with Iraq was from the date()f the establishraait of civil administration changed to forty centimes the terminal rate for Mohammerah and Abadan has not been altered and remains at the war rate. The reason for this is that any change of rate has to be notified to the International Telegraph Bureau at Berne by the country in which the offices to which such rate applies are situated so that Iraq could only notify the change in J * respect of offices in their own territory and shrank from asking Persia to n®tify the change in respect ex their ex-territorial offices. Article 17 of the International Telegraph Convention reads 'The higji Gontraitng Patties reserve to themselves respectively the right to make separately, among themselves, special arrangements of any kind in matters of service which dLo not concern k Contracting States generally'; hence it is open to Iraq and Persia to come to a mutual arrangement either in respect of the continuance of Iraq offices in Persian territory or to the estaolishmen* of a special rate for the exchange of telegrams between Iraq ' generally or between Irao &gt;rah and At ^^Stof^^d'ibada^IrparticSlar. During the war e P.4831/21 and since the Armistice up to the 27th July, 1921, it will be recalled that the line from Mohammerah to Dizful was taken over by the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force and Persia was compensated for the loss of revenue derived therefrom. Since that date, however, Iraq has been paying no compensatior hut nevertheless continues to appropriate most o» the revenue. Persia; having discovered this / pretests and the High Commissioner suggests one remedy and the Ministerat Teheran another, but neither of them aeem^adequate to remove the grievance* The high Oommiasioner for instance leaves out of account the question of the exchange of traffic between Iraq on one side and Mohammerah and Abadan on the other and only deals with that which the latter offices exchange with countries other than Iraq while the loss to Persia is probably much larger in the former case than in the latter. * The reason for the Minister’s proposal to replace Mesopotamian by Indo-European signallers I am frankly unable to grasp the meaning of. The deflection of through traffic from the cable to the land route between Bushire and Mohammerah will enhance the rate by half a franc i.e., the difference between the h’ersian terminal rate of 60 centimes and the existing Iraq terminal rate of 10 centimes and Sir hercy Cox’s telegram of the 14th Uecembetr (No.791) proposed such an enhancement by the cable route in order to equalize the rate by both routes but how the exchange of signallers would in any way cheapen the 'throu^i rates between India and those two offices” I am at a loss to understand. I would suggest.the handing over of both Iraq offices to Persia. It seemsprobable that there will be so loud a protest from the public that F however reluctant Persia , may be to have dealingSwith the Arab government of Iraq it will be forced upon her by public opinion. I would suggest that when l/UM “ l/UM “ this occurs the telegraph authorities of the two gDvernments should meet-and mutually arrange^a tariff for the limitrophic exchange of telegraph traffic between their respective countries., As regards the figures in the Hi^i Commissioner s inclu&lt; 20 cei telegram, 1 put up a note by Mr.Slocornbe on the subject from which it will be seen that the share of the Indo-European Telegraph Department of the Persian terminal rate for messages emanating^ and received at offices on the Arabistan telegraph line f) y includingincluding Mohammerah and Abadan is 131f centimes and not 20 centimes as the nigh Commissioner is informed. 13th January, 1922* ^ ^ k xFrom the point of view o^the International Telegraph service, Abada^ and Mohammerah are Persian telegraph stations and, as such, are properly subject to the same uniform notified Persian terminal rate of 60 centimes as applies to all other Persian stations which accept international messages. In actual practice, however, the terminal rates charged for these atations at the present time / and pocKeted entirely by Mesopotamia^are the old Mesopotamian rates of (a) 10 centimes a word on Traffic with India and trans India via Bombay, and (b) 75 centimes a word on Traffic with trans India via Madras If \ messages should be received for these stations from a foreign country, say Japan, the terminal rate collected for them from the Sender would be the proper Persian terminal of 60 centimes which has been notified to all countries through the International Office at Berne as applying to stations in Persia. Thus the position regarding the Abadan and Mohammerah terminal rates, as they are irregularly applied by Mesopotamia, is anomalous and confusing. International telegrams, according to the International Telegraph Convention ; should follow the normal, i.e.,the cheapest route, unless the Sender orders otherwise. The normal route between Persia and India is via Bushire ( or via the alterna tive Central Persia line route). The rate Persia to India by this route is made up as follows :Persia ' 60 Persian Gulf *60 t « India - 23 Total ^*7. 1.43 The present normal route and the only existing practical route between Persia and the United Kingdom is also via Bushire and the rate for telegrams Persia to Great Britain is made up as follows : Persia 60 Persian Gulf 60 India transit 23 Ois India 1.87 Total 3.30 and these rates should be applied to traffic to and from Abadan and Moharamerah also since they are Persian stations. The allocation between the Persian Government and the Indo-European Telegraph Dept, of the Persian terminal rate of 60 centimes on traffic via bushire or via the Central Persia line is as follows : (1) Por telegrams to or from stations on the Teheran-Bushire or Central Persia linee the Persian Govt, gets 40 centimes and the Department 20 centimes * &lt; (2) ^ Kor telegrams to or from all other stations in Persia, the Persian Govt gets one-third of the terminal or 20 centimes as a first charge and the remaining 40 centimes is divided in the proportions of two-thirds for Persia and one-third for the Department From (2) it will be seen that the Persian Government is actually credited with 46Tcentimes a word on all telegrams sent via Bushire or the Central Persia line from and to stations tn Persia not worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Dept, and 40 centimes a word on telegrams to and from the departmental stations.From Sir Percy Gox’s telegram it would seem telegrams passed via Bush ire 'and did not transit Mesopotamia at all. * To accomplish this he proposes, in effect, to make the Persian terminal rate for these stations 40 centimes ( to be credited to the Persian Govt.), to claim a transit of 20 centimes for Iraq, to give 60 to the Gulf and 20 to India^ Incidentally it may be noted that the Indian terminal rate is 23 and not 20 centimes and the total rate Persia to India is 1.43 not 1.40 as assumed by Sir P. Cox. Persian terminal rate is 60 centimes for all Persian stations unless the Persian Govt, notifies otherwise through the International Office at Berne. The only regula r way in which the rates for telegrams exchanged between Abadan and Mohammerah / on the one hand and India and trans India on the other, can be made the same whether the messages pass via Iraq or via Bushire, is to apply the Persian terminal of 60 for those stations and charge nothing for the Iraq transit. The division of the tariff would then be The division of the Persian terminal of 60 centimes as between Iraq and the Persian Govt, would oe a matter for formal arrangement. It is doubtful tHt Iraq wishes to retain the working of the Abadan and Mohamraerah stations and to maKethe rates from these Mesopotamia, the same as would be charged if the lirtciL • But, as already pointed out, the correct Persia Iraq transit Mi Persian Gulf India Cis India 0 1.43 23.3 —~ Total rate to.

Indo-European telegraph department have not at any time controlled line nor possessed any right to do so* Cost of im provements to line effected try British military authorities estimated at about 25,000 tomans. Persian government however demand evacuation and restitution of their line, which we have no valid grounds for refusing. | 2.

Persian government flatly reject proposal and avow orally their fear of offending Russia. In the present Persian temper, and certainly so long an present government is in power, it is useless to pursue this negotiation and I have therefore reconmended director not to offer (b). 4. Alternative is to agree to hand line back and to claim payment of improvements bill but Persians will not admit this liability. 5. Procrastination is difficult as Persian govern ment has technical right on its side. 6. It might be possible to get an assurance from Persian government that line will not be handed over to Russians if we svacuate it, but I do not know whetner this would satisfy government of India. It would any way be better than nothing. 7. Further difficulty is that Persian government seem determined to bracket this Question with others viz: Ramadan-Kazvin line, Abadan and Mohammerah telegraph offices and decline to discuss right of Indo-European department under its concession, which they do not how ever deny, to take over &amp;££&amp; line Khanlkln-Hamadan- Noberan-Tehran until satisfactory settlement reached on other three questions. 8. If Abadan end MohenmeraJi question could be dissociated would an agreement on following lines be acceptable?acceptable?

If pressed as regards Abadan and Mohanmerah, where again Persians appear to be within their strict rights, would it be consistent with our general interests to propose replacement of Mesopotamian by Indo-European department signallers: would mean (?benefit to) Persia and Indo-European department through enlargement of terminal rates by consequent deflection of through traffic from Basra and slight cheapening of through rates between India and those two offices, while the latter would be under affective British control. 10. Director of Indo-European depart' .ent concurs in suggestion offered in paragraph 9 but we cannot tell whether Persian government would find it acceptable. 11.

HEN JAM - BUNDER ABBAS LISE. UNDER an Anglo-Persian Agreement of May, 1905, the Persian Government authorised the Indo-European Telegraph Department to lay cables and to construct a land line on Kishn Island to connect Bunder Abbas and Henjaxn by telegraph at a cost not exceeding Rs.75,000 and guaranteed the repay ment to the Department of their expenditure on that account THE work was begun in June and completed in December, 1905, but owing to the obstructiveness of the local authorities the cable was not connected with the Persian Telegraph Office at Bunder Abbas till 3 years later, while 8 months more elapsed before the office was opened for international traffic THE expenditure incurred up to March, 1911, amounted to Rs.68,983:2:9 (£4,598.17.7) and a bill for this sum was forwarded through the Foreign Office to the British Minister- 3 - at Teheran for presentation to the Persian Government at a suitable opportunity* The bill was not however presented (P t ,¥.284/i2)* Accounts of the further expenditure incurred on this line year by year have been kept and bills including such further expenditure were transmitted through the Foreign Office to the British Minister^ Teheran (P,W 1979/12, P t W P 4616/l4 and 2865/16) s for presentation to the Persian Government but no favourable opportunity occurring they have not been presented (P,W 3 271l/i2 and 1485/15).

If it should be found necessary, in order to facilitate these negotiations g to remit any portion of the debt on the Henjam-Bunder Abbas line the Treasury has agreed to bear one-half of the eost(P,W*1842/l5) ARABISTAN TELEGRAPH LIHES RBCONSTRUCTIOH UUDER the Agreement of 4th January, 1913, the Arabistan telegraph lines r/ viz., the lines from Borasjun to Ahwaz, from Ahwaz to Mohammerah and Ahwaz to Bizful, have been reconstructed by this Bepartment. The estimated cost of the work was £23,060 (P W,828/13),but the actual total cost has not yet been ascer tained. On the 28th January, 1915, the work had been completed, except for a short section of 36 miles from Shuster to Bizful at a cost t as reported by the Birector at Teheran but subject to audit, of £22,121 (P.W*1432/l5), The Section from Shuster to Bizful was completed pn the 28th November 1915* BY the terms of the Agreement £5,000 was to be deducted from the total cost of the work as a grant to Persia in return # for the renewal up to the 1st January, 1945, of the Conventions (1) of the 2nd April, 1868, (Gwadur-Jask line) (2) of the 2nd December, 1872, (Teheran-Bushire line) and (3) 16th August, 1901, (Central Persia line). If the actual cost of the work is found to be as estimated* the balance outstanding after this deduction has been made, viz, £18,060, constitutes the debt due from the Persian Government. It was also agreed that from the date of commencement of the work and up to the 1stJanuary * 1945, the date of termination of the Agreement, an annual contribution of £300 should he paid to the Persian Gcverninent for the maintenance of the line. It has since been agreed between the Director at Teheran and the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs that'this sum is not to be actually paid but is to be retained and used to redeem in part the debt of £18,060, and that the cost of maintenance is to be recovered by deductions from the periodical collections made by the Department on behalf of Persia, The first payment of £300 was made in the year 1914-15 and the last payment will be due in the year 1944*45 so that 31 payments in all will be made amounting to £9,300 and this will reduce the debt due from Persia to £8,760* No arrangements have yet been made for the liquidation of the latter amount, THE Treasury have agreed to pay a moiety of the grant of £5,000 to Persia and to share in the advance made to Persia for the balance of the estimated cost of the worh, viz., £18,060 (Pol e 66/L4), It has been arranged(Pol ,912/14) that the share of the Treasury in the advance shall not exceed £9/030 and that if the expenditure on the work is found to exceed the estimated cost of £23^060, such excess shall be met from the Indian Exchequer, It was further arranged (Pol,66/L4) that the part of the advance made by the Treasury should be repaid in 18 annual instalments from Indian revenues, such repayment was not to depend on the realization of recoveries of equivalent sums from the Persian Government, The first instalment was to be the difference between £8*500 and the actual sum advanced up to the agreed limit and the subsequent seventeen instalments were to be each £500. The Treasury also agreed to pay a moiety of the annual payments of £300 to the Persian Government for the maintenance of the line (Pol.66/14). AS a result of these arrangements, the Treasury paid in 1914-15 (Pol,3143/14):- A moiety of £5,000, the grant to Persia A moiety of £300, the annual payment due to Persia 2,500 150 Total £2,650 When the work had been completed as far as Shuster at a cost to that date of £22*121, the Treasury were asked tocontribute their share of the advance made to Persia up to that time p viz*- £ Total expenditure on work as far as Shuster 22,121 Less grant to Persia ... 5 .000 £17,121 Moiety due from Treasury ... £ 8,560 The Treasury consequently paid in 1915-16 (P,W 6 1734/L5) £ Moiety due as above ... 8,560 Moiety of £300, the annual payment due to Persia 160 £ 8,710 No payments have been made to or by the Treasury on this account for the year 1916-17, pending the receipt of inform ation as to the total actual cost of the work which is shortly expected. THE sums paid by the Treasury as above have been credited to the Capital Account of this Department to which account the total cost has* in the first instance, been debited, and a statement is attached showing how that account will be affected up to the year 1944-45 on the assumption that the total cost of the work proves to be as estimated, £23,060. It will be seen that at the end of the period there will be a debit to Capital Account outstanding of £11,260, of which £8,760 con stitutes the balance of the debt due from Persia and £2,500 the permanent debit to Capital, i.e., the moiety payable by this Department of the £5*000 grant made to Persia in return for the renewal of the Conventions of 1868, 1872 and 1901, up to the 31st January 1945.ROBAT-SETSTAN L1HB- P.W a 1204/l6 THE construction of this line hy the Indo-European Telegraph Department was authorised lay the Persian Govern ment in September 8 1914 (P*W 0 3424/14) 8 subject to an agreement being thereafter concluded between the British and Persian Governments• The agreement was concluded in Marchg 1916^ and ratified by the British Minister at Teheran and the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 12th July &amp; 1916 (P^W®2272/16) t Under this agreement (Art.2) the total cost of the line less £2,500 is repayable by the Persian Government in thirty annual instalments.

Reference to correspondence ending v/ith Foreign Office telegram 665 of December 15th regarding Arabistan telegraphs. There is no chance of Persian Government agreeing to our continuing control ary longer than necessary and they are continually reminding me that there is no longer ary reasonable ground for maintenance of present arrangements. I am of opinion therefore that we might now con sent to revert to arrangements' provided for in (? agreement) of January 4th 5 1913 provided that it is agreed that so long as ary British troops have to be retained in Arabistan, they shall be at liberty to erect and manage an extra wire for their own use. Bagdad Administrations main interest in this question is that it is of great practical importance to them and to British interests to retain control of their special offices at Abadan and Mohammerah as outlined in paragraph 13 sub-section 4 to enclosure to Colonel Alison’s despatch 26-648 of September 1st,1919. I fully agree that we should decide to retain control of these oifices but am somewhat in doubt as to best way of achieving that end. Subject to ary further views which Bagdad may wish~ 2 - wish to express I am inclined to thi rk that it would he better for us not to raise question in con-* nection with reversion of Arabistan line. I doubt if Persian Government have any official knowledge or record of our Abadan and Icohainnerah offices* If how ever they should raise question now or hereafter, are we not justified in replying that they are a domestic necessity of AoP^CACo and we are not prepared to hand them 5 over T Should Persian Goverrment adopt unaccommodating attitude in the matter, we could explain to them that if they give us trouble in the matter we shall simply transfer offices across the river to our own Banko Present Minister of Telegraphs is astute and assertive where rights of Persia are concerned and if we ourselves raise question now he will probably obstruct or press for quid pro quo,hence my advice to wait until they raise it* Addressed to Foreign Office 47o Repeated to Bagdad 26, who will please conmenbo (2« 2o 8-* i 4)[This Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and sh ouId ^ th e j;oreign Office if not required for official use,] a ,o v ' ?o/B (160831A/34.)

Two cables were laid across the Shatt-el- Arab at Mohamrnerah on the 1st- December, 1914, to connect the British Consulate there with Pao on one side 'and with dasra on the other. At that date there was no connection by wire between the Consulate and the Persian telegraph office a distance of two and a half miles; this connection was not made till the 19th February, 1915. Probably the telegram quoted refers to a third cable which was laid later than the first two for the purpose of giving through communication between Basra and Ahwaz. was in consideration of the loss of^revenue they derived or hoped to derive from the Mohanmerah” . Ahwaz-Dizful telegraph line not from the Shushter - Taking the points of Colonel Wilson's Para.5. The compensation accepted by Persia Diiz-ful 11857. I. 1991. 1000.—10/1911.Dizful section only. Para.6. Liberal compensation was no doubt agreed to on account of the line having been appropriated by force. Para.7. 1 do not follow the reasoning of this paragraph but assuming the argument to be sound why is Mesopotamia willing to pay so long a price indefinitely (see para, 13)? It would seem more prudent to set a time limit to this figure and to propose a re-adjustment at the end of the period to accord with the experience gained during it, both sides to have access to the accounts to be kept during the period. There are no remarks required on paragraphs 8, 9 and 10. Para.11. Wheh war broke out the only line from Mohammerah to Dizful then existing was the old Persian -Line since dismantled^ the new line from Ahv/az to Mohammerah was no/t completed till the 19th December, 1914, from Ahwaz to Shushter till the 27th January, 1915, and from Shushter to Dizful till the 28th November, 1915. 'To revert to the status quo' (Sir P.Cox) or 'to revert to pre-war arrangements' (Col. Wilson) would connote the displacement of the new line and replacement of the old Persian line a state of things even Persia can hardly desire. New arrangements in accordance with the terms of the Anglo-Persian Agreement of the 4th January, 1913, (Collection XXX) were in proce^ of evolution and had not been completed when the IV^hamme rah- Dizful line was appropriated by the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force 'D'. Presumably all the Persians are now asking for is that the terms of the Agreement shall be carried out and not that the pre-war conditions shall be reverted to. Para. 12. The fact that the pre-war rate from basra to EuropeEurope was 6d a word while that from Persia to Europe was 18d had, I suggest, as much to do with fcnns sending theynessages to Basra for transmission as the inefficiency of the Persian line. Para.13. The line from Mphammerah to Pizful is only telegraph about two-fifths of the Arabistan/system as defined in the Agreement, the line from Ahwaz to borasjoon constituting the other three-fifths. If the Mesopotamian Administration proposes to take over th© whole systen^the Persian Adminis tration would appear to be within their rights in demanding about three-fifths as much again in compensation as they now receive. I take it however thatnotwithstanding the manner in which this paragraph is expr4ssed / Mesopotamia only proposes to retain the section they now administer. The Ahwaz-Borasjoon section is at present incomplete, the portion from Bonder Rig to Borasjoon was destroyed in 1915 and has not yet been restored, but I gather from the fact that the Persians have applied for its restoration at the hands of the Indo-European Telegraph Department that they consider its restoration and subsequent maintenance to be an obligation of this Department, it' is not strictly true therefore to say that that section 'is purely Persi?m at present. As regards the first of the four stipulations contained in this paragraph the Indo-European Telegraph Department are only the ^ents of the Persian Government for the maintenance of the Arabistan telegraph system, hence if they take over any material from sopotamia it must he with the knoweldge and consent of Persia in order that its cost may ^e acknowledged as recoverable from that government. Article 17 of the International Telegraph Convention permits of the second stipulation being arranged between Mesopotamia and Persia without the intervention of the Indo- BuropeanEuropean Telegraph Department or other party. The privileges conceded to the Indo-European Telegraph Department by Persia do not include the exploitation of public telephone systems hence the third stipulation would seem to require the consent of Persia before the Department can undertake the proposed obligation. If obtainable the Department will, with the permission of higher authority,undertake to maintain the installations provided that it is made clear that they will obtain some return for the ^payment at a reasonable rental”. If Mesopotamia wants to retain possession of these installations on Persian territory, as seems to be inferred, it would j be preferable that the Department should hand over the revenue, if any, to them less the expenses of maintenance. If there be no telegraph of” telephone revenue and there would probably be very little telegraph revenue from the Dizful-- Shushter line, since the Department is under an obligation t Jjo pay all inland revenue to Persia (Coll.XIII, Art.VII) and all international revenue less a third part of the Persian terminal for such messages as pass to or from it over the departmental system (Art.VIII)^it is not easy to see whence the Department would obtain a quid for the Mesopotamian quo. The fourth stipulation can perhaps be arranged at the same time as the second by a direct agreement between Mesopotamia and Persia. By ”on payment of a nominal rental' is presumably meant ”on payment of royalty”. % Paras, 14, 15 and 16. The Indo-European Telegiaph Department possess no claim to q, share of the revenue derived from traffic exchanged between Mesopotamia and the offices of the Arabistan telegraph system. Only when traffic is exchanged between Mesopotamia and one. of the offieds of the Indo-European Telegraph .Department system do the latter receive a third of the Persian terminal rate0 VP) 111 T N rate. If the proposed terminal rate of twenty centimes a word is eventually arranged Persia will receive the whole unless the traffic originates or terminates at an Indo-European Telegraph Department office ; in such case the latter will receive centirae^and the former centimes. In the first line of paragraph/^'the rate quoted does not agree with the notification sent by Mesopotamia to the Berne Bureau and has been circulated by the latter. The proposed terminal rate is therein stated to be 40 not 30 centimes. Para.17. Lord Milner at a discussion of the Imperial Communications Committee pronounced that while the Indo- European Telegraph Company could be refused access to Mesopotamia the Indo-European Telegraph Department, should the Company succeed in eventually resuscitating their normal route or in opening a new one, could not refuse to accept^4 traffic as the Company might offer nor to pass to them such as might be marked in India or beyond for transmission M via Indo'. The desire of Mesopotamia to elbow out all competitors for east and west telegraph traffic (except perhaps the Eastern Telegraph Company) is therefore probably unattainable. Para.18. I am sure the solution suggested will not prove agreeable to Persia. If they could afford it,they would give all foreign enterprises their conge with the least possible delay I consider that it would be only fair to Persia to give the terms of the agreement of 1913 a trial, these terms in practice are that the Department maintains the lines and Persia the offices. We have had many years experience of the working of this system on the Teheran- . Meshed line where it is quite successful and 1 see no reason why, if Mr.New of the Persian Telegraph Administra tion selects the right men for the offices and Mr.King Wood i-Du-fe Jthe right man for Inspector it should not work as there are British military detachments subject to Mesopotamia cantoned in Persian Arabistan they should be connected with their head-quarters by a separate wire separately ipanned, this wire to be confined to military use. This should prevent such friction as might arise from the joint use of a single wire.No • TM/W / To O 9 o 9 ^ ....i ( 1 ) The Under-Secretary^of-- dt«4e~for India, London, S* 1 |, 1 (3 copies).

' ■ S' f* O Clf, In accordance with memorandmn N0.25-M., dated the 5th September 1923 from the Government of T ndia in the Fereiyn and Political De■ :• artmert, I have the honour to submit a report on the incident reported by the Jlssistant Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Turbat, in Ms two telegrams dated 13th and 14th August 1923, respectively. Delay in submission is due to the pr tracted absence of 3alar Amj ad, Of fi cer 0 ommandi ng Si st an and Kaina t a re a, wi th whom it was necessary to discuss the case. 2. The telegraph line between Sistan and Meshed, via Bandan, is at present being maintained by the Indo-European Telegraph Department, who employ Persian linemen for the upkeep of the line. Ait 11-C s.m. on the 11th August 1923, Akbar Ali the lineman at Labi Baring, 2C miles west of Kasratabsd, noticed that communication between Labi Baring and Bandan, 36 miles west of Labi Baring, was interrupted. He set cut to investigate and at 4-C p.m. on 11th August reached Hauz, where he was captured by some 22 Afghan raiders, some of whom had rifles. These raiders had already captured and roped together some 60 B Persian pilgrims, who were travelling from Sistan to Bandan. The raiders deprived the lineman of his horse, rifle, telephone repair eouipment and 7 tomans in cash, and made him join the pilgrims where they sat roced together. JV © At sunset of the same day the prisoners saw two horsemen eominp from the direction of Bandan. The raiders fired on them, and mortally wounded one of them, who was a Persian soldier. Tie ether horseman was dli Hasan, the Persian lineman from Band an, who had also set out to repair the fault on the line. Ali Hasan appeared to have made good his escape but was afterwards kxxh caputred and killed by the raiders - His body was found on the 13th August 1923 four miles south of the Afghan border, and was taken to Bandan for burial. It appears that Ali Hasan mended the line, but it is not known whether he did so before or after he saw the raiders. The xk raiders, after taking the personal property, camels, and donkeys of the pilgrims, and the horse, rifle, arid ether property of the lineman from Labi Baring, departe:- towards the Afghan border, leaving their captives roped together. 3. On receiving information of the raid Persian Amniya from Labi Baring, Bandan, and from a pest 5 miles west of the scene of the raid, left in pursuit, and Persian regulars were also despatched to intercept the raiders, who were followed up to Bangun, near Rui Khaf, where they entered ^fghan territory near Chahar Bazl. Salar Amjad states that the Afghan authorities arrested the raiders, but refused to -and them over or to help the Persian pursuit party in anyway, and took the raiders to Herat. 4. One s used clous nerson was arrested in 'Asian ps shortly after the raid. Hepsaid to have admitted nis cemplicity, and to have stated that the raidsrs numbered 2C , all MMKMX Afghans. 5. In order to appreciate the circumstances of the raid it is necessary to review certain other circumstances of the last few months, s c recounted to me by Sals.r -rnijad. On the 21st June 1923 at Hauz: Rustam, some 20 miles from Bandan,Bandan off tr: Afghan raiders killed two lersian men, ee Persian women, and some 700 sheep and and carried If camels. Persian regulars and irregulars from Keh, and also from 01stan, immediately went in pursuit and to cut/ off the r - ’ rit of the raiders. The Beh party came up with the raiders on the Harut Hud, which is in Afghan territory, recovered all the sheep and camels, and took 3 ,/erndl rifles and 12 of the robbers, who are now in custody in Sistan. The Persians lost one Non-Bommissioner Officer, died of wounds. It is not known whether the raiders lost The party from Sistan went as far as Farah. The ^fghan auth-rities are said to have offered no help. The three women have not yet been sent back to any men kil^s Po- Cn 24th September S Afghan raiders attacked a Persian caravan at Pishe, 35 miles north-west of Band an - Persian troops givin' chase recovered the property and captured 2 raiders who are now in Sistan. The ather 6 raiders escaped. j There have been similar incidents in the neighbourhood of j Duzdap, of which the most recent is that, on the 27th j September, Bahadur khan, said to be a British subject, I was robbed of 6 KMX camels and 700 krans in cash by • Afghan raiders near Shamidar, halfway between Suzdap and | Hurmuk. Persian troops went in pursuit and are said to ■ have brought back the stolen property on 19th October from Ohahar Burjak. On the 16th October Afghan raiders attacked the Persian Customs post at 3ungun (a place already mentioned in paragraph 3}, looted 19,000 krans, the prcpertv (f the Persian Customs Department, and killed one Persian soldier. Salar Am]ad has been ordered to despatch troops to gu^rd the place, although it is net in the area of his command. On 20th October the Military authorities at Birjsnd, under orders from Tehran, executed 2 Afghans and two Afghan Baluchi sBaluchis who lad been concerned in raids in the Band an area during February 1923. 6. It is thus apparent that the local Persian military authorities, who are in charge cf the defence of the ifghsn frontier, are active in their attempts to cope with hfghan raiders. They complain that the Afghan authori ties dc nothing to prevent raids in Persia by Afghan subjects, and Baler Amjad has. made a full report to Tehran, suggesting that urgent representations on the subject be made to the Afghan government in order that those who have committed raids may be mnished and restitution made for darnage inflicted to persens and t rcperty. In the case cf the raid of the 11th August, 5alar Amjad suggests that it would be well if the Indian Government supported the Persian Government by a simultaneous protest and claims for restitution. 7. The value of the property and equipment of the two gxx linemen which was takan by the Afghan raiders may be placed at Bs.ICCC. In addition to this there is the question of exacting retribution for the murder of Ali Hasan (who leaves a wife and four young children). The Persian view cf the rights of the family cf the murdered man is that blood should be exacted for MI blood. It is for the family to say whether a sum cf money, and if so what sum, may be accepted instead of blood, and to claim compensation. I submit that, in the present case, this aspect of retribution and compensation may be left to the Persian authorities , for consideration in connec tion with the death of the two soldiers in the raids of 21st June and 11th August. His Britannic Majesty’s minister at Kabul would perhaps be able to support any reasonable Persian claims. The Hs.lCOO, due on account of the equipment etc. of the two G-hulams, being /)/ property cf the Indian Government, may be claimed oy us either direct or through the lersianauthorities. 3. There remains the matter of the immediate needs of the family of Hi has^n, the murdered lineman, hny negotis- tione with the Afghan authorities are likely to tak^ time, and the family ivS in want. The Persian lineman have served us with great fidelity both during the war and since. The Heshed-3irjand-Bandan-Sistan line is new to be handed over to the Persian authorities. I submit that it is a fitting occasion for the grant of a compassionate gratuity to the family of Hi Hasan, and suggest that the amount of such gratuity should be 25C tomans - roughly equal to Bs.BCO. Whether the amount of such gratuity if granted should be reclaimed from the Afghan Government is a matter which will no doubt he decided by the Government of India.

It will be observed that the last sentence of the paragraph headed 'Liaison des Reseaux persan et mesopotamien' has been excised, and the first sentence of the next paragraph, headed 'Henjam-Bander Abbas', has been altered. The Under Secretary of Posts and Telegraphs called on June 27th to ask me to make these amendments. As regards the former of the two, I agreed that it was unnecessary to mention the interpellation in the Majlis, which was not directly connected with the matter; as regards the second, Mukhber-ed-Dowleh explained that he must have been misunder stood, as there had been no need for a decision by the Council of Ministers in this case; such decision had only been required in those questions in regard to which there existed no Agreement, i.e. the transfer of the Meshed- Sistan line, the purchase of the Merind - Quraltu line and the arrangements to be made with the r Iraq Telegraphs. Mukhber-ed-Dowleh has now signed the minutes.

His Excellency has signed this document and coni'iimed its accuracy in writing. Your Lordship will observe that I have not yet acquainted the Persian Government with the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to waive a claim for expenditure on the Meshed-iieistan line, and that the Minister of Posts and ‘ Telegraphs proposes payment of AOfo of that expenditure# In view of the reluctance of the Persian Government to admit liability for our claims in respect of the Hamadan-Kazvin lines, it is satisfactory to have this concession in hand. I should be glad to be infonned as soon as possible of the amount of the Hamadan-Khanekin claim, and whether I shall be authorized to accept any reduction thereof. I have asked His Majesty's High Commissioner at Baghdad whether I can count on the despatch to Tehran at short notice of a delegate to discuss with the Persian Telegraph Administration questions affecting Iraq and to conclude a limitrophic agreement, in the event, which I confidently/ The Mos t Honourable, Marouess Gurson of Hedies ton, K*G#, etc•, etc., etc., His Majesty's Principal Secretary of Htate for foreign Affairs, foreign Office, London.confidently anticipate, of the Persian Oovermient agreeing to the proposal. With regard to question Or, I had some time ago prepared a reminder to the Persian Government, hut had held it hack for fear of prejudicing the chance of securing pay ment out of the telegraph account of an urgent claim (the Mackertich case), A9 will h e observed, I have now hrou^it the matter to the personal notice of liasr-ul-Ilulk, who appeared to have no knowledge of it, 1 have also considered it better to present to His Excellency the claim under H, and to draw attention to the situation as regards I, and he has thus been presented with a complete statement of the questions dealt with in Mr* Barker’s memorandum, with the exception of J, in regard to which point I concur in Mr. Barker’s opinion. I had been promised long ago that idasr~ul~Mulk or his brother the Under-Secretary, Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, who has a far greater knowledge of these questions than the Minister, should come to negotiate with me, but, in spit© of several reminders, it was not till May 28th that the promise materialized, although Mukh b e r - e d - howl eh had already had a preliminary conversation on some of the questions with the Director cf the Indo-European f el ©graph Department, Since the above was written, I have had a farther meeting with Mukhber-ed-IKnirleh, of which minutes are enclosed herein. Unfortunately the Government which, once it had made up its mind to negotiate, was showing real alacrity to arrive at a settlement, has now fallen. Mukhber- od-Dowleh, however, as Under-Secretary, remains in charge of his Department pending the appointment of a new Minister,so that the negotiations need not be entirely interrupted.

This correspondence relates to damage done to the Meshed-oistan telegraph line.

(1) Mokhber intimated acceptance of the offer com lunicated to you in my telegram dated 5th Movember, 1921 but I informed him offer has been withdrawn and could not be renewed, lie then proposed that Persian Telegraph Administration should take over * the control and maintenance of/line and that Indo-European Telegraph Department should give assistance by lending officer to carry out maintenance as in case of Arabistan telegraph lines all expense inclusive of all pay and allowances of officer to be paid by Persian Government. Do you agree ? ( 2 ) As Indo-European Telegraph Department is not now concerned in settlement of question discussion was confined to an endeavour to obtain acceptance of pecuniary liability but Mokhber declared that he could not consider matter without knowledge of extent of liability. Incidentally he expressed keen desire to have Teheran-Khanikin line connected with Baghdad and consented to make limitrophic agreement with Iraq but only throu^i medium of British. (3) Mokhber agreed to Indo-European Telegraph Department placing Persian Section Si^mll ers in each of the three telegraph offices Abadan, Moha/nrnerah and Ahwaz for the purpose of supervision of traffic arrangements and to deal with latin character traffic so as to insure its prompt and accurate trans asa-ion pay and allowancesallowances of these Persian Section Signallers ^il- be paid by Persian Government and Persian Section Signallers would be under control of Officer-in- Charge, Arabistan Sub-Division.

So far as the financial aspect of the transfer is concerned it does not appear thao this Pepe.rtmen u ie iiiCe.L — | ested if, as it appears, the line was constructed from British and not Iraq funds and the Iraq operators are being withdrawn from both tne Hamadm —i_arind. anci the Karino.— Qureitu Sections. 4 .

(B 2826/75/34) BRITISH LEGATION, TEHRAN. 12th Pebruary, 19 23 My Lord, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's telegram No.36 of February 10th calling for a report on the present position of the negotiations regarding the Abadan and 1 ohammerah telegraph offices and allied questions. The negotiations have not advanced materially since the date of the Ksrl of Balfour’s telegram to me No.174 of July 11th, in which 1 was instructed to keep the Persian Government in play pending an interdepartmental agreement regarding liability for losses on the working of the Tehran-Khanikin line in the event of the Indo- European Telegraph Department resuming control thereof. In a memorandum dated September 20th the ' inistry for Foreign Affairs pressed me for a settlement of the question of the l?eshed-Sistan line, and the Prime Minister did the same with regard to Mohammerah and Abadan in a note dated September 26th. I replied on October 3rd, reminding the Persian Government that it had made the settlement of the various telegraph questions a matter for one com on negotiation, that I had informed Wahid-ul-Mulk, the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, of my willingness to enter into ’he Most Honourable The Marquess Curzon of Kedleeton, K.G., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office. : ?into suoh a negotiation, that I had expressed to the prime Minister a hope that the Wahid-ul-Mulk would be ( invested by the Persian Government with authority to conduct it, that unfortunately no advantage had yet been taken of this offer, and that I was prepared to proceed accordingly as soon as the competent Persian authorities were authorised to do so ♦ At the same time I enquired Your Lordship by my telegram Ho.362 regarding the progress of the interdepartmental discussion referred to above. Thus the matter has remained, the only change in the situation consisting in the construction by the Persian Telegraph authorities of the line from Kerind to Qusr-i-Shirin, referred to in my telegram Ho.462 of December 22nd, which appears to have been completed with extraordinary rapidity about the middle of January. It now appears, from the correspondence referred to f' ^ in m y telegram Ho.41 of February 10th, that the Iraq telegraph officials are being withdrawn from the Hamadan- Khanikin line and that His Majesty’s Commissioner contemplates a separate negotiation with a view to the conclusion of a limitrophic agreement between Iraq and Persia and the settlement of the Abadan and Mohammerah question. This will leave the questions of the Meshed- Sistan line and the claim on account of Harnadan-hazvin constructions to be settled separately on their own merits, and, as the Persians are actually in possession of the latter line, it will be seen that I shall not have much in hand to bargain with. As reported in my telegram IJ3A I have thought it well at least to gain as much credit as possible by informing the Persian Government of the withdrawal of the Iraq officials.

If Their Lordships raise no objection to this suggestion the Secretary of State proposes to despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran a telegram, of which the draft is enclosed, authorizing Sir P.Loraine to proceed with the contemplated negotiations with the Persian Government. I am to enquire whether Lord Peel concurs in the draft telegram, end to request that a reply may be given at His Lordship’s early convenience. 3. As regards the Hamadan-Kazvin line (line C. of Mr.Barker’s memorandum) the proposal that ninety thousand rupees should be recovered from the Persian Government by the Indo-European Telegraph Department appears to be the best solution of the question.

Jr gen t. 11 ■■ ' ' '■ Sir :«* With reference to my letter No .E 6444/9/34 of July 13th, 1^22, relative to telegraph lines in Persia, I am directed by the Marquess Curzon of Kedleston to state that the time now appears to have arrived for a settlement of the various questions raised therein with the Persian Government* 2. In my letter of July 13th to the Colonial Office, a copy of which was sent to you, the subject of the Tehran- Hamadan Khanikin line was raised, and the Colonial Office were asked to accept on behalf of Irak the contingent financial responsibility in case any loss should occur if that telegraph line were taken over and worked by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 3. The Colonial Office have now replied that the Government of Irak are unable to accept any responsibility in this matter, and the Secretary of State does not, in the present financial stringency, feel justified in inviting the Lords Commissi oners of His Majesty’s Treasury to accept on behalf of the Imperial Exchequer any liability in this respect. 4. In these circumstances there appears to be no other course open but to hand back the line to the Persian Government, who appear, indeed, to be already in effective occupation of the line on account of the action of the Irak Government in withdrawing their skeleton staff from the whole line between Khanikin and Tehran. The Secretary to the Treasury 55. In view of this action. Sir P.Loraine hag already informed the Persian Government of the withdrawal of the Irak staff in order to gain what credit he can from the Persian Government for a step which they have repeatedly asked for* Sir P.Lora.ine proposes, therefore, now to make a virtue of necessity and to hand over the line formally to the Persian authorities, without prejudice to any claim for British expenditure on the upkeep and recon struction of the line, which could be discussed at a later date. 6. I am, therefore, to request Their Lordships 1 sanction forthwith to the action proposed above, and to ask that in due course Their Lordships’ will state what sum should be taken as a basis in calculating the claim of His Majesty's Government in respect of this telegraph line, on which, it is understood, considerable sums were spent by the British military authorities during the control of the line by the Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force• 7.

Thin line before the wnr was under Russian control but during the war it passed under the control of the military forces operating on the Last Persia Frontier. &lt;fhen the military forces were withdrawn the administr ation of the line passed to the Indian Post end Telegraph Department who still control it. 'The Persian Government have repeatedly asked that the line should be handed over to them and in a letter, P.2317, of the 28th June 1922, fro- the lnr!is| . • Office to the Foreign Office it is stated 'there is no objection to the restoration of the control and operation of the Meshed^Beistan line to the Persian Government,subject to an assurance by that Government that the line will not again be allowed to pass into Russian hands**• It was also added that such restoration should not, be * accompanied by a claim for the value of the improvements made to the line during its control by British telegraphists. • This view wan con curred in by the Foreign Office in their letter of 13th July 1922 (P.2934) to the Treasury and alsoaleo by the Treasury in their reply of 31nt July 1922 (P.3269)• I^xmi'i&lt;hanikln. Line . Before the war this line wan operated by the Persian Government but the Indo-European Telegraph Department could re sume control of it at any time under'Article XVI of the Agreement of 1B72. The line was taken possession of by the Mesopotamia Field Force during the war and afterwards by the Iran Civil Administration. In the letter quoted above,P.237^,from the India Office to the Foreign Office it is stated 'the importance of this line to His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and the High Commissioner, Baghdad,as well as to His Majesty’s Consuls at intervening points,Kertimnshah and Hamadan.of the efficient maintenance of this line is fully recognised;end the Secretary of State in Council is for this reason willing that the Indo-European Telegraph Department should assume control of it. But the interests of India in this region are so slight,and the financial eonsoouences so specul ative that Lord Peel feels that he must stipulate that,in the event of a loss being thereby caused to the Department,such loss shall be made good by the Imperial ^xcheouer'. The High Commissioner for Iraa in his tele gram of 31st January 1923 (P.498/23) states that the Iraq Government are unwilling to accept liab ility for any resultant loss to the Indo-European Telegraph Department consequent on its assuming control of the line,and,no contribution being forthcomingC o kk- viu- h lo forthcoming from the Imperial Treasury,no other course seems open hut to hand hack the line to f’ereia. Thie in fact seeme to have now been done as the High Commissioner for Iran in his telegram of 8 th February 19C3 (P.542) states that the Il*Q Government are withdrawing the skeleton staff from the whole line between Khanlkin and Teheran, moreover Sir P.Loraine has so informed the Persian Government (P.616) in order to gain 'what credit we can from the Persian Government for this step which it has repeatedly requested'. Since the above was written Sir P.Loraine has sent a further telegram (No.be' of 23rd February 1923) from which it appears that the skeleton staff from Iras, has been withdrawn and that Persia is now in possession of the whole line from Quraitu to Hamadan and he therefore proposes to make a virtue of necessity and to foimnlly hand it over without prejudice to a claim for our expenditure. What such expenditure has been is not known and it was incurred at the cost of the British Bx- chewer. It does not seem to be therefore a matter in which India is interested but one that it is more for the Teaasury to advise upon then the India Office. Now that it has been decided that the Indo-European Telegraph Department is not to take over the control of the line the sub sequent negotiations thareanent are no concern of the India office,though they are willing to cooperate in the recovery of such claim as it is decided to put forward.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000dd_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/326</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x0000dd</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/326</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 80/1913 Pt 2 'Persia: Telegraphs'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1924</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-01-20T18:26:36</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">fre</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (405 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.
