Of 1365 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, 22nd j/^vval, 1365 i a .jm a • . . - S?..^..Date I *a.i&lt; a Ac - April 24, 1946. RqJ, H. B. M f s political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum: - Reference your endorsement No. 128/d dated 7th April 1946. The facts of this case were as follows: One Abdulla bin Hussain Matter, a Bahrain subject, died in 1363, leaving heirs, some of them minors. An estate case was opened and referred by the Bahrain Court to the Sheraa Court. The question of legitimacy of one of the sons was questioned and after many hearings in the 3heraa Court it was proved that the son was legitimate. The complainant at no time during the hearing claimed to be a foreigner and she appeared in person in the Sheraa Court. Only after the judgment was given by the Kadis did she present a petition, not to the court but to you, stating that she Jhad married a foreigner. It has in the past been agreed that if a person is a party in a case and during the hearing of thq^ . case does not object to the jurisdiction of the coart then, after judgment has been given, it shall not be possible for the party to claim that he or she is a foreign subject in order to have the case re-tried. In this particular suit I believe the Agency Court would have passed the matter to the Sheraa Kadis in the same manner as was done by the Bahrain Court.

AY.&amp; .Bahrain, 9th. ^uly 1949 To, She Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, I beg to place the following facts before you for your kind consideration. &gt; ^ 1 ara a Paki stani subject, native of Bombay. Before tne partition of India I was a British-Indian subject and am holder of Passport ho. 22674 issued m Karachi in 1945. ^ was married in Bahrain to the daughter of byed Anmed Nihari, a native of lemen, in 1930.1 have tour children by her, now with me in Bahrain. They are inc uded m my passport as Pakistanis, hy wife expired here on 15th. i^ay this year and now I desire to take tnem back with me to* Karachi.my business cc 1'vlihood is m Karachi. I had come over here for a short stay when 1 received information that my wife was seriously ill*. a . ^ Borne days back I was informed by the Judicial Assistant to the Political Agent, that 1 could not take my children back with me from Bahrain as information had been received by him to the effect that the Ruler of ^ a hrain did not wish that my children should accom- pany me. i intend to take them with me to give them the benefit of education and training and for-their better-' ment. 1 have no work or business in Bahrain and if they s ^ a y.°9' iir2re » will be at their own risk, nor have ± sufficient means to maintain two establishments. l therefore request you to grant me pernrilss- lon to take them along with me. So) Thanking you, i beg to remain, lours obediently, .i. K. Lukmani.No.1762 Political Agency, Bahrain, July 14, 1949. Doar Smith, Your memorandum No.2106-23 of 1368 dated June 19# I enclose a copy of a letter I have received from the Pakistani Abdul Kayum Lukmanl about his children. I don^ know what considerations led His Highness to decide on the retention of the children in Bahrain but it seems to me that the father has a clear prior claim to his own offspring and inspite of the intervention of the dead wife's relatives I should be glad if you would bring the matter again before His Highness. Yours sincerely, H.G.Jakins G.W.R. Smith, Esq., Acting Adviser to the Bahrain Govt., Bahrain.D.O. No.^/ Adviserate, August 17&gt; 19U9 Reference your letter No.1762 dated 14th July 1949&gt; I 'brought the matter again before His Highness this morning. His Highness is under the impression that there existed an agreement between the wife and husband that the latter would not take the children away from Bahrain. He does not wish the husband to violate the terms of the agreement, especially as the husband for many years past lived separated and apart from the family and made no effort to support them. H. G. Jakins, Esquire, H. B. M’s Political Agent Bahrain.No. /&lt;//— of 1369 Office of the Adviser to ser to the Government, Bahrain Dated 16th Muharram 1 369 November 7, 1949* H. B. M’s Political Agent Bahrain. Memorandum:- His Highness has asked me to enquire about the administration of estates of deceased persons who in their lifetime were foreign subjects but whose heirs are Bahrain subjects. His Highness considers that after the owner of the property is dead the estate is automatically owned by the heirs. If these heirs are Bahrain subjects His Highness considers that the Bahrain Courts should deal with the administration and division of the estate. 2. Such situations are likely to occur frequently because many of the offspring of foreignervS have A acquired Bahrain nationality by birth or in sbme cases by naturalisation. A case in question which occurred some years ago, was that of Sulman bin* Muttar, a large landowner and boat owner who at some time acquired British Indian nationality though he was born a Bahrain Arab. His sons and heirs were all Bahrain subjects. His estate however was dealt with by the Agency Court. 3- I should be interested to hear' your views on this matter. Adviser to the GovernmentNo. POLITICAL AGENCY, v BAHRAIN, 20th November, 1949. The Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. Memorandum. Your memorandum No.l41-9A, dated the 7th November, 1949, regarding His Highness the Shaikh*s enquiry about the administration of estates of de ceased persons. 2t The law as it stands is laid down in Article 44 (5) of the Bahrain Order in Council which reads as follows: n hen a person subject to this Order dies in Bahrain or elsewhere intestate, then, until administration is granted, his property in Bahrain shall be vested in the Political Agent.*' i.e., jurisdiction over such property depends upon the nationality of the deceased not of the beneficiaries. I have consulted ar legal authority and can confirm that this is the universal practice in every country in the world. To make jurisdiction in this matter depend upon the nationality of the beneficiaries would clearly lead to administratively impossible situations when it is considered that under such an arrangement if, for example, a Bahrain subject died here aith a Turkish heir, the administration of the property would vest in the Turkish Courts. Doubtless you will explain this to His Highness.V-K A INDIA OFFICE RECORDS 'microfilm</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002ad_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1950</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002ad</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1950</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File J/1 Correspondence with the Adviser'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1946/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-05-09T13:51:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (27 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 29; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
