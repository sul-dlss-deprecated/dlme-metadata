The British Political Resident at ^ushire in his capacity of Chief Political Representative in S. Persia exercised a sort of political supervision over our interests, while such commercial matters as arose were generally dealt with by the British Agent at Basrah on account of the propinquity of that place as com pared to Bushire. f When the Karun was opened to navigation in 1389 it was con sidered advisable to post a Consular Officer at Mohammerah, and Mr. C. McDouall of the I.S.T.D. was appointed to establish a Vice-Consulate in Mohammerah, under the supervision of the Resident at Bushire whose oommisslon as Consul-General (original! y granted in 1378 for pars and the Coast and Islands of the Persian ^^Qulf) was altered so as to include Arablstan, In 1904 the appoint i'Lt ) If ^ ^ '' ^ment of Vice-Consul Ahwaz was created with the special object of e11ing the Residency and the Government of India in closer touch with the Bakhtiaris had been possible when Bakhtiarip affairs \ —v had been solely dealt with by the Consul-General Ispahan, ^vho in addition to being in the Foreign Office service and therefore not in touch with India, was too far off to get into direct personal relations with the Khans, more particularly as unier the Foreign Office svstem Consuls are practically imnoblle except when de puted for particular jobs. Vice-consul Ahwaz was therefore in structed to be in Ahwaz and Arabistan in cold weather and tour up to Ispahan through Bakhtiarl land in the hot weather. Capt a D.L.R.Lorimer was the first Incumbent. About this time (1904) Mr. McDouall went to England on leave, and while there got his appointment improved and made Consul for Arablstan, with head-quarters at Mohammerah. This made a complication as ordinarily with a consul for Arabistan in being, the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, at all events while in Arabistan ought toto be directly under the Consul, However this was got over 'by arranging that Gapt. Lorimer should deal with the Consul in coTnmero-ial matters and direct with the Residency in political matters, and as his work was practically all political this was 3-11 that Residency required. As lo^g as }'r. icDouall remained at Mohammerah practically immobile, and only taking up work which he was compelled to do, this arrangement worked fairly well, though it offered great chances for friction e When however the Anglo-Persian Oil Company took up business in earnest in 1909, and i«lr. McDouall was trans ferred to Kermanshah, the Foreign Office and India Office having exchanged the Consulates at Kermanshah and Mohammerah friction between the Consular Officers at Mohammerah and Ahwaz began and continued off and on as long as there was a regular Consul at Mohammerah. The late Capt. Ranking argued that the Consular Officer at Ahwaz should be the principal Consular Officer in Aral istan. This was manifestly impossible as long as the Ahwaz Officer was only in AraMstan for 5 or 6 months every year while the Consul at Mohammerah was there all the year round. For a few years from about 1906 owing to the appointment of l. r. Gratama a merchant as Dutch Consul , the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz was given the local rank of Consul, After the departure of l.r, Gratama this was dropped, Uy own opinion when in Arabistan (and before) was that the Vice-Consul at Ahwaz should be under the Consul at Mohammerah while in Arabistan and always for Arabistan questions and be independent ^hen out of Arabistan and for Bakhtiari matters 0 In 1913 a special officer was appointed t ■ Dizful to deal with Luristan affairs with the status of Vice-Consul. Capt.A.T. Wilson, C.M.G., was the first incumbent, md when the war started Capt. C.G.Crosthwaite who had succeeded him was there, Hatters continued in this undefined way till the war which altered everything in Arabistan for a time.. About 2 years after the war staged Col, Kennion then Consul at Mohammerah was transferredtransferred to Kermanahah and Assistant Surgeon Lincoln ia %93Sr the quarantine officer, who had 'been made British Vice- Consul at liohamnerah at G^l. Kennion f s suggestion, became A acting British Consul and has remained so ever since. During the war an Assistant political Officer was appointed ♦ at Ahwaz and the Dizful appointment was converted to an A,P.O., and an A.P.O. appointed at Shushtar, The A.P.Os at the two last places carried on the local administration (nominally through the local Persian officials) to a great extent. Later on the A.P.O. at Shushtar was suppressed and one A.P.O. retained in charge of Dizful and Shushtar. The posit'.on at present (Llarch 1920) is thus:- An acting consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah (Assistant Surgeon Lincoln I.M.D.)- an officiating Vice-Gonsul at Ahwaz (CapL.Peel) an A.P.O. at Ahwaz {Capt. Ellington) and an A.P.O. for Dizful and Shushtar (Major :'eade). The status of the acting Consul ■ is actually less than that of the vice-consul and A.P.Os; this is not as it should be in my opinion. / Lieut-Col. f» # Deputy Political xiesident, Persian Gulf.

Sir, I have lately been receiving many oompiaints from the Persian G-overnment regarding the extent of o-ur interference in the aoministration of Arabistan which apx^ears from various official reports and teiegrams received from His Llajesty^ Vice Jonsnl at . Aiiwaz to amount almost to the administration ofMthe province 'by our consular and political officers through the agency of the officials appointed oy the Persian GrOvernment • I am aware of the circumstances in which we were virtually compelled, during the war, to undertake ohe control of this province, 'but those circumstances no longer exist. r Sir Arnold V/ilson has warmly advocated the continuance of existing arrangements, that is to say, 4)f our administration of Arahistan, on the ground of the great improvements which we have introduced and oi the general superiority of our administration to that of governors and other officials appointed from Tehran. I fully recognize the efficiency of our ? 1 « &lt; • administration, which reflects great credit on the political officers responsible for it, 'but it is impossible for me to Justify to the Persian Grovernment, on these grounds, an# interference which is deeply resented and which is inconsistent with the promises andand assuranoes repeaied^giVQii 'to the Persian jSoverimieirt, and recently reiterated by Lord Ours on in a speech in the House of Lords, to the effect that we shall^irjtall / re-y-yR-g. circiunstances respect the independence and integrity o- Persia. It is,at tne present time, when the question of the ioiblo-Persian Agreement is about to be considered by the Llajlis, more than ever important that we should avoid all appearance of intervention in the domestic affairs of Persia, or of seeding to anticipate the position which may be ( und3r the Agreement, obtained by British Advisers. I must therefore request you to furnish me as soon as possible a full report on t this matter explaining in detail the nature and extent of the interference of our consular and political officers in the administration of Arabistan.

P6th November 19P0 I have the honour to transmit to Your Lordship herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty's Consul General Bushire re»*ard- in«r Consular representation in Arabistan. t I see no objection to the proposals contained in the last paragraph of that despatch, but consider that the Government of India are in a better position th«tn 1 am to appreciate the niceties of Consular rep resentation as far as Arabistan alone is concerned. The question of Consular representation in Bakhtiari is however one in which this Legation is directly interested. t Recent events have shown that His Majestyb Vice Consul at Ahwaz cannot leave his post without inconvenience and that he can no longer enjoy the mobility which fonaerly enables him to devote his attention to Bakhtiari affairs. I therefore venture to surest that a special Vice Consul be appointed for Bakhtiari. In my opinion, he should be subordinate to His Majesty's Consul General at Ispahan, which is the centre of Bakhtiari attraction. He should have his summer headquarters at D ehkurd in Chaha Mahel and his winter headquarters in 'Bakhtiari l»wland«. He ahould, in fact, be penrntnftntly reeident with the tibe, though of courae he should frequently visit Ispahan, As His Majesty's Consul General at Is pahanlapaban is 8el«ct«d fron the Levant Consular service, it would aeem natural that hia subordinate in Bakhtiari should be chosen from the same senrice, but this point would doubtless form the subject of discussion between Ifour Lordahip'a Department and the India Office.

In continuation of my raenoranda 3571/111/7 anci 3572/III/7 dated respectively the 15th and 20th of October 1920 I have the honour to subrait for your consideration revised budget estimates for the Consular establishmentB at .«ihvfaz,?lohanmerah Dizful and ahushtar for tlie financial year 1981-22. 2. Hy original esuimates were nrepared at extremely short notice to enable bir Arnold Wilson to discuss them with your self before handing over charge of the office of Political Resident in the Persian vrulf, and were based on a combination of the Budgets rfanctioned by the government of India and by the civil Administration at Baghdad for the year 1920-21, 3. I have sire e had leisure to eBamine carefully the whole question of future political expenditure in Arabistan with die regard to the urgent necessity for retrenchment on which the government of India is likely to insist now that it has resumed complete financial control of -oolitical expenditure in Arabistan and I venture to submit that the budgets now proposed reduce expenditure to the absolute minimum consistent with the maintenance of uritish prestige in this area find the fulfilment of the government of India's pre-war resnonsibili^i ties in ArablHtan, These responsibilities have greatly increased during the last few years for reasons quit* unconnected with the War, 4. The following comp rative table shows clearly how far the revised estimates exceed the normal political expenditure of the government of India in Arab if3tan.-p.- 70- nornal expenditure icatinates for 1921-88 neviBed estimate rorwarded with thir office Heraorandtt 15571 &amp; 3572 dated Ibth ^ 20th October 1920.

The difference between the revised estimate of ub .186,670 and the original estimate of Ks.275,410 is partly due to the subsequent appreciation of the kran value of the rupee. 5. I attach for your information a note showing in more detail how the various Consular establishments are affected by the new proposals. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd/- E.Gr.B. Peel. Oapt. li.B.M's Vice Consul.lO'. A note regardlnf; the etTeot on oonsular EBtablis^ments in Arabiatan of the revised budget estiraates forwarded to the Hon'bla the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf by H.ll's Vice uonaul, Ahwaz in his letter Jifo.lbBl dated ^1/^/1921. The existing and proposed disposition of political and consular Agencies and Officers in Arabiatan has been fully discussed in paragraphs 86 to 39 of Uolonel Wilson 1 # letter No.W.9 dated aushire October ^Oth 1920 to the Secretary to the government of India in the roreign and Political Department. Paragraph ibidem summarises his proposals as follows:- (a) One senior officer as consul for \rabistan at Ahwaz. (b) One junior but experienced officer as Vice-consul Ahwaz. (c) One Junior but experienced officer as Vice-Consul Dizful. (d) One junior officer under training as Assistant to vice- Oonsul Dizful with charge of the iiagwand levy. (e) One Assistant Surgeon at Mohammarah to hold charge as Vice Consul as at present. (fl) One Persian Oonsular Agent at Shushtar as at present. 8. It will be seen that the above sunnary makes no mention of a uivil Surgeon for Arabiatan to oe localted at Ahwaz although a salary of Rs .l8 # 000/- per annum was inser ted under H Salaries' in the Anwaz budget estimates for 1921-22 which were forwarded to the resident at aushire under cover of this office memorandum No. 15571 dated 15-10-20 and to which Colonel Wilson gave his anproval. In view of the excellent p-l whitfh is supported work done by the Ahwaz Civil Hospiv entirely by funds locally subscribed on the understanding that a qualified Medical practitioner holds charge, I would press strongly for the retention of the post of Civil Surgeon. The present Incumbent is Major A .C. Oldham who is under contract to the government of Iraq. The detailed budget estimates of the Ahwaz Civil Hospital for 1921-22 which provide for the pay and allowances of all clerical and menial staff, cost of drugs etc will be found atbached to the budget estiraates of7 2 60 the Ahwax vice oonsulata. xhe only exoention la the Sub -Aeais- tant Surgeon who ?fas fonoerly in charge of the charitable dispaneary attached to the Ahvvaz vice consulate and wboae pay Is at ill met from the Vice (jonaul'a budget. 3. Ho provision has been made in the revised Dizful eatimates tor the pay of a 'junior officer under training as asaiatant to vice uonaul Dizful with chiirge of the Sagwand ]^evy u , However deairable it may be to have a young officer under training at Dizful who could act in a leave vacancy either as Vice consul Dizful or aaaiatant to the Vice Consul, Ahwaz, I have excluded this item from the budget as not being absolutely necessary so long as three Consular officera are permanently located in northern Arnbiatan exclusive of the Consular Agent at Shushtar• 4. The revised estimates for hwaz represent the irreducible minimum whether the status of the Vice Consulate is raised to that of a Consulate or not. If the status is nermamently raised some further increase will be inevitable in two or three years' time to admit of the expansion demanded by the continual increase in the duties which the Vice Consul (or Consul) is required to perform. 5. There can be no doubt that the centre of gravity, so far as the political situation in Arabistan is concerned, has during recent years shifted from Hohammerah to Ahwaz which is now the point from which British political interests in Arabistan and its vast hinterland consisting of : 5 ust-i-Kuh,Luri8tan,Ba^htiarl and Kuhgilu can best be supervised and co-ordinated.The location at Ahwaz of the senior political officer in Arabistan is inevita ble sooner or later. The chief drawback to putting the proposal into effect immediately is the l»Ki8k lack of adequate accommoda tion for both gazetted officers and clerical staff and their offices at Ahwaz. It was never intended that the existing Vice Consulate should be anything more than a winter residence,the practice before the war being for the vice Consul to shift his headquarters to Isfahan during the summer months. One clerk uaed to remain at Ahwaz with a very small establishment to-3- dispoue of minor ratine work. 6, Conditiona have changed completely since the beginning of thC war though not by any means solely on account of the war. In view of the ever increasing importance of British interests in Arabistan and the growing number of aritish subjects, both European and Indian, who are entitled to British protection it has become impossible for the Vic© Consul to absent himself from his headquarters for more than a few days at a time without leaving a competent officer in charge. At tne same time, with the closer relations established with the tri^s in the hinterland as the result of the war. It is lubt as necessary as before for the Vice consul to be constantly on tour and to maintain ciose touch with the tribes. 7. The lack of accommodation at Ahwaz mak^s it virtually impossible for the consul (if such a status be sanctioned) and the vice Consul efficiently to separate their offices and functions, and if existing condiEons continue it will be xound in practice that the vice Consul can be little more than an assistant to the Consul whose work will not 'he appreciably lightened. The difficulty is aggravated when, as at present, the assistant to the vice consul is married and is accompanied by his wife. 8. Another point is that, with the Consul definitely located at Ahwaz, purely consular work, such as registration of persons, documents etc,will tend to focus itself at Ahwaz instead of at Mohammerah as hitherto. This will still ^Uither increase the routine work at Ahwaz and necessitate e::tra staff for which no accounodation exists. 9. In ray opinion the one ursent need Is the erection of suitable raol lenoos for consular officers and their fanilios at Ahwaz which nigh, toe aecorapanied toy a special project for convertinf? the existing Consular touildinss into proper offices and quarters for the clerical an^ menial staff. The need lor new touildings at Ahwaz is far more urgent than at Hohanraerah where the Assistant Surgeon, Who at present coratoines the dutiee/wC residence separate irora the existing insulate.Il- ; ; -I |- 1^1 -4- (g) An extroiaely favourable site I'or a iiew Vice Oonsulate (or Gonaulata) at Ahwaz has been ©nrraarkod for years, but c. the 8hei)rh of liohamm^rah, wearied by the continued pootponjaent of negotiations, has now infomed rae in writing that the lien on this site will be for^feited unless a definite arrangement is rwle during tne current year (i.e. 1921), 10. The solution would an-near to be that the uovernment of India should allocate funds at a very early date for the cons truction of new consulate buildings at Ahwaz, so that a start ray be made this auimaer, and that until such time as the new buildings are ready forjoccupation the consular officers at liohamraerah and Ahwaz should each be given the rank of acting consul thereby giving official sanction to an arrangement which has been in force for the oast few years and which has given good results with the minimum of friction. 11^ The enclosed budgets will I trust be found self explanatory. I would merely draw attention to the item ' IS scort charges' in the Ahwaz budget. The reduction of the estimate under this read to Ms.ft,500/- ner annum is condi tional on the removal of the Indian Oavalpy escort (including a Soldier Purveyor) hitherto maintained at Ahwaz. ror the Indian escort I propose to substitute 4- Persian or Kurdish sowars who are much ch.eaper in the long run and more useful on tour. A similar eucort has be-^n oroposed for the Vice (jonsul at Dizful, la. If the pay of the uivil Surgeon a'd Assistant to the Vice oonsul is excluded it will oe seen that the total estimated expenditure for the Ahwaz Vice Consulate stands at ns.7:5,6:10 practically the same figure as that proposed in ray letter lio.«757 dated 18-B-20 to the Treasury officer mishit when submitting the ordinary budget estimates for 1981-22.Full details of actual expenditure in support of those estimates were furnished in that letter.

'A (si) u T1 ** r In ny letter lio. 97«ii dated 2nd !iay 19ai, I had the honour to report for the Infomatlon of the viovemnent of India the roaulo o * ry recent tour in Arabietan, and co sug gest the following appointnmts to supervise our political interests in Arabia tan f L,ur is tan and S. Wakhtiari?- {!)• One fairly senior officer to be Mis Majesty's Consul i hwaz, to take oh irge of our Interests in Jorthern Arabistan 9 conduct our relations with wakhtiai^is, sunerintend the Vice- Oonsul at Dizful and ..hushtar, and tlirou^h hin naintain relations with the Liar tribes. Later on f if considered advisal^l the Consulate at Mohannerah ni^it be 'nlaced^his superiiitendence. He would in any case be recognised as the principal Political Officer in Arabistan, and his post should be conside ed 'Superior*. (8). A Junior but experienced officer to be Consul Hoharamerah to conduct our relations with the Shaikh of Moharmerah, look after writish Interests in HohaTinerah and Abadan, and all southern Ar ibistan except the district adninistered by the Shaikh's Deputy v»ovemor at Ahwaz, and do all ordinary Consular work in connection with shipping^ registration of uritish subjects, marriages, registration of nirths, deaths and marriages. This post I should have suggested to be 'inferior' but for the expensiveness of liohainnierahi for this reason I suggest that the post should be considered 'superior', but should ordinarily be held by an officer of less than 9 years service who would thus be enabled to draw ks.^00/- additional charge allowance. (5). One Junior but experienced officer to be Vice-consul Dizful and ittiushtar, to have charge under Ahwaz of Britishto O C&gt;/ oritish Interests In that region and/conduct our relations irith Lurlstan, (4). One Junior officer to be Vice-consul Ahwaz, to relieve the Consul of all routine and petty case work, and enable hin to devote hlnself to political work and pemit hira to travel to oakhtlari, Kuli^Qhlu or Lurlstan when necessary, (5). One Persian Official to be Consular Agent at ^hushtar under the supervision of the Vice-Oonsul Dizful and Shushtar. ((?)• One Medical Officer to be Consul ir 3iir ^eon for Arabistan, with headquarters, for the present at Ahwaz. V /liile I was awiy at Cairo, Captain Peel,with whon I had discussed the question before I started, went into the financial aspect of t.he natter again, and subnitted fresh estinutes which I have taken practically en bloc as the basis of the T3ror&gt;osals submitted herewith. I attach statenents showing the fin?incial effect of those proposals, and conparing prewar expenditure^the snnctloned budget for 1020-iU, the estiraates put forward in October when Sir A # X, ./ilson nade his 0)X)po3als, mid the present estinates.

It also shows that the proposed estirantes show a reduction of more than us.39,000/- or 16^ on the sanctioned budget for 1920-.' 1. on the other hand the exnenditure is ks ,80,830/- nore than the last prewar budget 1913-14; in those days, however, there was no expenditure at all at iihusiitar which accomts for hs. 15,750/- of the increase, while the salary of the Vice-consul Ahwaz,Ahwaz, and Inoreaseo to pay of oat ibliahmerit, and uw-keep of 2 motor oara acooimt for wo. 10,800/- Ha. 12,000/- and jt8«8,000/- respoctivoly or the reminder. 3 # . 'i'he detailed statenents attached fehow that the following itema mentioned in the eatinatea aubnltted laat October have been eliralnated, (%)• Aaalatant to Vice-consul Dlzful and O.C # Leviea saving aB • 'Z , 200 /— • ■ f-nr* ~ (2), Motor car for Aarjiattmt vice-Oonaul Ahwaz saving iiB.4,000/-. The grant for 'Kacort chargea 11 , too haa not been increaaod as would liave been necesaary, owing to increased cost of gran^ and fodder, by the expedient of auggeating th it. the Indian Cavalry fa- eiicort ohould^roduced and local aowara aubatitut ^d. I rei^ret the necessity for the disappearance of the Indian Cavalry escort, which is a feature of every consulate in Persia, but as retronchnent is absolutely necessary I have accented Captain Peel's suggestion that it should be reduced. Should,howover, the i*ovemnent of India be prewired to maintain it the figure of 'escort charges** at /Oiwaz nust be raised to h8 .16,000/-. When discussing the (iuestion of the local, or Kurd, sowar eacort Captain Peel informed ne that he would like to keep one Indian aowar or penaioner to aunervise the feedlng etc of* t]ie horses, take charge of saddlery and other Government property, Kurts and Persians being unreliable in these mattera. Captain Peel forgot this when fixing hi a eacort allotment at ns.fi, 5005/-,and now suggests Ka.7,200/- the old sjmctioned rate for eacort charges, which will enable hin to keep one aowar or a pensioner for this mirpose. I have accordinj^ly included us.7,^00/- in the revised budget. It will be noticed also that the escort at Hohamnerah has also disappeared: it was dropped during the war under orlers of the Civil conraiasioner, mghdad. It is a matter for the consideration of the uovemment of India whether it would not be advisable to maintain a small Infantry guard at each Consulate of say 1 aavaldar 2 other H.0.0S. and 9 men. «uoh a .guard in -a.■ '?/• ■ in places ahBre at any raonent the Conaul nay have to deal with rei 'aotory wntioh aubjecto would be very useful, and would or course be les.j costly than the old cavalry escort# 4» Hy toior in Ai*aoistan h is shwon ne the enomoua advantages in rnobil ity uriich thB possession of a riotor car ^Ives to ^olittcax i. i'^ors i!i country, over nost or which cars c?ui go in any direction. Distances are very great,e.g. Ahwaz to Dizful about 90 miles, Ahwaz to Shushtar about no, Ahwaz to Oil Fields about 90 etc., and the nxiws value of the en o mo us anount of tine saved by doing these trips in about the sane nunber of hours as it would take days caravaning is incalculable. It is, however, c, vlous that wear and tear of cars constantly covering such distances is very great, find I do not think it would be rair on ofi icors to expect then to naintain their own oars; besides, r/ere they to do so, they night hesitate to nake tours for fear of d^nage to their cars when the nublic interest really deiaandod iL. I strongly reconnend the naintenftnoe of one car at Ahwaz and one at Dizful: this I think is the nininura with which efficiency can be naintained. 5. before the war a Consular Surgeon for Arabistan was sanctioned, but the post was kept in abeyance. During the war, however, a Civil Surgeon was established at Ahwaz and ilajor Oldhan n./ui .0. (T) is now there unier contract with the Mesopotanian Adnlnistration on a salary of ^s. 1,000/- per nensen. He has a snail hospital naintained entirely by voluntary contri butions with the exception)/ of his own salary and tho original Ks. 1,800/- per annum sanctioned by the vjrovemnent of India for a charitable dispensary. The subscriptions to the hospital are of course nale on the understanding that there is qualified nedical nan tojtako charge, and if the civil Surgeon was abolished the hospital would disappear. I strongly reconraend that the sanctioned post of Consular Surgeon for Arabistan should be Minqra merged with that of Civil Surgeon Ahwaz and that Major Oldham should be naintained on his contract salary, if he wishes to stay and iieso^otania can spare hin, and on his departure an officer of the I.U.S. on pay of rank plus H3.200/- local a llowance- 0 - allov/ance be appointed to auooeed hin. At aone laterdate it nay be DOBslble tor the A .P.0,0. to take over the Civil Hoaiiltal f when the [ueation of the Oonaular iSur^eon onn be reoonaidered; at ^resent the A.P.O.G. are not in a poaition to take over. Aa long aa the Gonaular burgeon koepa up the Civil HoaT?ital it will be necesaary to maintain the oub-Aaaftatant oUrgeon at Ahwaz and continue the old eatabliahed jqrant I'or drugs etc. 6. Captain Peel*a revised eatinateB for Ahwaz araounted to ks . 95 # B30/- wlier^aa nine cone to 118.97^970/-. Of thia Ha.700 is accounted for by the increase in escort charges mentioned above; the rest is due to the fact that I have su^gesttod special local allov/ance for Arabia tan ror the clerical eatablishmont, as foreshadowed in paragraph 6 of ny letter .:o.2B41 of 18th uecenber 1920, Hs.lOO/- for Mead Clerks and ks .50/- ror others nay seen a large amount but when I say that the A.P.O.C. have recently been compelled to give their establishments a 60^ increase of ^ay and now pay youngsters frosh from school Hs.200/- per mensem, while experienced clerks never get less than Hs.rsOO/-, and many get 4 and 500/- per mensem, it will, I trust, be seen that my suggestion is reasonable. The cost of living at ohanne- rah and Ahwaz is enormously hijgi, and it is simply impossible to je ) a yoiang man in uovemment service at the salaries now given or even at those proposed in ny letter Ho.^341 dated 18th Decembe; 1920. In the circumstances explained I trust Government will be pleased to sanction the special Arabistan local allowances suggested. 7 # ror the same reasons I have now suggested thai-. Head ol^rk at iohaiamerah should be a Ist grade clerk on Hs.200-10-250 as well as the Head Clerk Ahwaz, and not that only one of them should be first grade find other second grade as suggested in my above mentioned letter. 8. In conclusion I beg to submit that the present estimates have been reduced to the lowest figure Consistent with efficiency and I trust that the i»ovemment of Xndia will be ath able to sanction the amounts proposed.26/157 12 T) Talegram R.

I am just going to make the following representations to the Foreign Office. Ahwaz to be superintending Consulate under the general supervision of Bushire, Dizful and Mohamraerah subordinate to Ahwaz # Main reason is the convenient central situation of Ahwaz between the Bakhtiaris and the the Sheikh of Mohammerah's dominions and opportunity for needful coordination. Mohammerah to be allotted in principle to the Levant Consular Service as at present the Vice-Consulate at Bushire is the only place where junior members can familiar ize themselves with tk* conditions in the South and get train ing in commercial and shipping matters. I discussed these proposals with Wilson and we were in agreement, I shall not send my despatch pending a reply from you as to whether you have any criticisms or observations to offer. Loraine.26/157. Itl Telegram 'P From Resident, Bugjilre. To Ministar,Tehran• No.205/1291. Dated 218t July 1922. Private. Reference your telegram No.156 I had hoped that this question which has been longout^tandlng had been sattled. As youjf are doubtless aware Wilson himself raided the question in October 1980, and no doubt you are familiar with the voluminous correspondence on the subject. I fully concur with the proposals contained in the second paragraph of your telegraTn. in my opinion to having a Levant Consular Officer at Mohanmerah is the fact that there are some two or three thousand Indians at Abadan within his Jurisdiction. There are very few A.P.O.C. men who can talk Hindustani properly and it is as a rule only the Consul who can understand their grievances etc. Recently whenever any trouble arose at Abadan Lincoln has always had to be called in as intermediary and interpreter. Secondly Arabistan is under the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council under which Indian law is adminis tered and all cases etc. between the Indians have to be dealt with under Indian Law^- Appeal lying from Consul's decisions first to Consul General here and then to High Court Bombay. In ordinary times (apart from War period when of course such things lapsed) officers of the cadre of the Indian Political service go through a course of training in,these matters in a district in India. In these oircumstsn ces I deprecate appointment of Levant Consular Officer as Vice-Consul^Mohammerah. If it is legally possible I think Vice-Consul As regards the third paragraph the objection1^ \ tx) Mo ha 1 -me rah/ should b9 Vice—Consul for ths 0I9 consular district and be vested with present powers of the Consul to perform narriages register births and deaths etc (see para. 12(2) of my letter 97~S dated May 2nd 1922)» It is more conven lent to hve theae functions performed at Mohammerah, the port of arrival in the province,and it might be awkward to transfer them to the Consul at Ahwaz owing to his prolonged absences in Bakhtiari and elsewhere.( 6,VS The Residency, ^ Buahlr e, 18th AURUet 1922.

Sir, Conaul ar Hepresentatinn at drraanta.r '. I have the honour to attbmit in duplicate the following report on tn^ above subject in accordance with your telegram .No • 1702 dated 22nd October 1922. I beg to submit that the question of the necessity of further Consular representation at Shushtar is one v'nich should be considered along with that of Dizful. At the present time Shushtar is a Consular Agency and Dizful a Vice-Consulate. 1 • SHlidilTAjri , Tnere are in my opinion more than sufficient grounds to justify the retention of a Consular Agent in Shushtar. As far ss work in connection with British firms and inte rests is concerned Shushtar is noip of ccnsidorahly more inportance than Dizful. The Imperial Bank of Persia have a Branch in Shushtar with a European Uanaser in charge. Uesars the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited have en office in tills town with a Persian Agent in charge and carry a good amount of merchandise between Ahwaz and Shushtar by river steamer on the Karun. The Shusntar Agency has a large amount of work in connection with Llessrs Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited atat Maldan -i -liaftun and Dar-l -Kazineh. Shuahtar supplies a lar 3 e amount of the labour both skilled and unskilled to the Oilfield®, cases regarding which when they arise are settled by H.M«s Consular Agent who represents them to the Governor General. A most important factor in favour of the nece ssity of the Consular Agency at Shushtar is the fact that this town is the fixed headquarters of the Governor- General of Arabistan. Only by means of the Shushtar office is h.H's Consul at Ahwaz enabled te keep in telegraphic touch with the Governor General. From observance of tne period of office of tne late Governor General H.E. Uuayyid-ed-Dowleh, it is likely that in the future Governer Generals of Arabistan will play a raore leading part in local politics and have more power than a Governor General of tnreo years ago who was dependent almost entirely on us for his position and money. The present Governor General has asked me to consider trie possibility of appointing a Vice-Consul in bhushwar tc enable him to iceep in closer touuh with H.M's Consul at Ahwaz. The recent disturbances in bhushtar which H.M 1 s Consul at Ahivaz was; able to get the Sheikh of Uohommerah to ni P in t' 6 ^d, by exerting his influence, may be taken as a good example of the value of the iihushtar Agency in reporting an unsatisfactory political situation which it allowed to ferment could not help but react unfavourably on tne Arab tribes to the tiouth with the consequent danger •0 the Oilfields and pipe line. dizful. Captain Peel's memorandum ho.901, dated 7th March i'J22, forwarding a copy of a note on iizful and bhushtar, ivhich fully covered our policy at the time it was written, m the light of political events this summer requires some modi fication. Control of the town and district which had^a Inrge- -. . m h&amp;d^a large extent remained in our oherge up to the autumn of 1922 has now 'been entirely handed over to the Persian authorities and we exert no direct form of interference. The correspondency of the Imperial Bank of Persia iias been closed and. the Agency of Lessrs Mesopotamia Persia corporation v,i31 shortly also be closed. The Dizful Vice- Consulate is acle to 'be of assistance to Messrs the Anglo- Persian Oil Company Limited at their workings in Dehluran and it should be borne in mind that should oil \ie struck there, a direct line of communication with Ahwaz would un doubtedly be opened through bhush as well as a pipe line and possibly a railway. As in Shushtar the^alue of the reports received rom Jizful have been tested during the recent disturbances following the expulsion of the Governor General when h.M 1 s Consul at Ahwaz was able to keep in close touch with the trend oi events and to press the Sheikh of I&amp;ohammerah to exert his influence to restore lav/ and order. Tnese distur bances proved that Dizful bears no ill will towards the Vice-Consulate and consequently the Head Clerk there was in no danger. Lad a British Officer been present he would have experienced more difficulty and might have had to leave f and would be able to do little else to stop them other than report to Ahwaz, whereas an Agent would probably not have been so affected. For these reasons I most strongly beg to advocate that the status of the Dizful office be changed to that of a Consular Agency until such time as necessity again demands the appnlntment of a Vice-Consul. Owing tfb to the possibilities of oil in Dehluran and the importance of H.M's Consul at Ahwaz being kept fully in touch with the tribal situation it would I think not be to n withdraw altogether as contemplated in Captain Pee^s abov^ mentioned note. If we do net v /ish Bizful to slide back into its former state of disorder with detrimental effects to the Lur tribes and Arab tribes to the S.W. such as the powerful-4- powerful Beni Lam tribe we muat dc all possible to suppi wxioever is the Deputy Governor end I doubt if any Deputy Governor could maintain his position in Hizful without the presence and moral support of the British Flag or of r. c y of Persian troops the presence of which in Arabis- - vi 02 e present ^.M's Government is opposed to. Ihe JJizful Vice-Consulate controls the Dizful Bridge Company which was formed during the war, some £0, ssD0/ - its capital having been found by h.M's Govern- ment. If a Vice-Consul were not posted in Idzful this tridge coulu quite well be controlled by a capable Consular Agent important questions regarding dividends, or repairs, i ej.ng referred to H.M 1 s Consul at Ahwaz for orders. It would appear that if H.M's Government consider the presence ol a vice-Consul in Northern Arabista^i neceasary, he would be of far more value in Shushtar than in aJiziul :or the time being, where he would be in close touch with the Governor General. In conclusion, if we suppose that H.M 1 s Government is anxious in view of the present financial stringency to reduce their commitments as far as possible, they can ^ the retention ot the 5hushtar Consular Agency and the reduction of the Vice-Consulate at Dizful to the status of a consular Agency still effect a similar monetary saving as if the bnusxitar Agency was closed down. Rs. 44,400 is the sanctioned budget allotment for the Dizful Vice-Consulate. -l5,600 is the sanctioned budget allotment for the Shushtar Consular Agency. Rs. 60,000 represents the total expenditure for Dizful and bhushtar at the present moment. If the above mentioned proposals meet with the approval of h.M 1 s Government I would suggest that:- Hs.20,000 be provisionally allotted for a Consular Consular Agency at Dizful. * see below) R8.20,000 be provisionally allotted for the iihushtar Consular Agency. Rs.40,000 Total. By this means a saving of Rs.20,000/-fat- -5- Rs.20,000/- per annum instead of Rs.15,600/- could be effected and the v/ork be carried on satisfactorily v.ith a reprooentative ol His iilajesty in both towns, * I have mentioned the sum of Rs.20,000 as it to proce^]^ that in future years the Shushtar Agency badget allotment will have to be increased as the work of the Agency increases. The present budget on which bhubiitar is working is the absolute minimum and some nc^ ease uixder iieads such as 'Ordinary Secret Service' is now necessary. There is considerably more difficulty in obtaining intormation in iihushtar and Dizful than in Ahwaz now that we interfere in afimini strati on in no wayj and If a Governor General who was not genuinely friendly to H.Li 1 s Government were appointed the need for some ordinary secret service money would be even more marked than now# If considered advisable I would suggest that after Mr.Peal has returned and has had time to study the political position his views on this question might be obtained by telegraph.

This correspandence snows clearly the causes which led up to our political bupremacy in Arabistan and the nature of the attempts made to reduce our commitments in that pro vince from the end of 1920 when the Dizful Vice-Consulate first came under the control of h.B.M. Consul at Ahwaz. 4. In paragraph 6 of my memorandum 1*0.5327 dated 25th ljovem'ber 1921 I indicated the lines which I proposed that n.B.M.Vice-Consul at Dizful should follow in his dealings with th6 new Governor General at bhushtar and his Deputy Governor at -bizful. The undertaking given to the Governor- General was loyally carried out, but a good deal of friction occurred owing to the hostile policy which he pursued towards the bheikh of Mohaxnmerah and owing to his determination to / / destroy the influence of our former proteges in the diutrict. The situation was further complicated by well founded charges of bribery and extortion on a large scale brought against I.iirza Mahmoud the Head Mirza of the Dizful Vice-Consulate. The events which culminated in the bhalil incident and the recall of the Governor General are too well known to need recapitulation here. It is only necessary to emphasize the fact that the transition foreshadowed in the above-quoted memorandum was carried into effect without serious distur bances amongst the tribes and that future Governors-General are not likely, with the example of h.E. Muayyed-ed-Dowleh before them, to try and extend tneir influence in southern Arabistan, until such time as the Persian Government is in a position to place adequate forces at their disposal. 5^ ^ long as the Central Government in Teheran remained impotent the interposition of the neutral zone of Dizful and Shushtar between the territories of the Bakhtiari Khans and the bheikh of ? ohammerah served to minimise causes1 s i -3- f&amp;o causes of iriction between tine rival chief b witJri beneficial rebulta to Arabibtan generally. A forward policy on the part of the Persian Government naturally draws these parties together vith a view to protecting their common interests and renders the position of any British Representative one of extraordinary ditiiculty in attempting to reconcile the opposing vi ev. s 01 the l ersian Government's Hepresentative and the powerful chiefs whose territories lie to the north and south. The position is rendered still more difficult by tne fact that our Consular Representative at jjizful was until a year and a half ago the de facto Governor of that district. In view of the present political situation in Persia I have no doubt that the wiser course is to eliminate the British Representative at ijizful and allow the 3 opposing forces in northern Arabistan viz the Persian Government, the takhtiari Khans and the oheikh of Monammerah to work out ( their proper equilibrium without aid or hindrance from us. 6. Major Hinde has shown that the only British interests of any importance in the i^izful area are the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and the x)izful Bridge Company, oo far as I am aware there is no immediate prospect of striking oil in the Dehluran area - the only factor which would from the poirt of view of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company lend any importance to the question of the retention of a representative of the British Government in uizful. 1 am inclined to think moreover that in existing circumstances the Oil Company can attain its objects more easily by working through its own representatives as a purely business concern than by depending on the inter vention of h.B.M. Consular officers. The iJizful Bridge is, in the opinion of J.^ajor Hinde and rayseli, a liability rather than an asset and will form the subject of a separate communi cation. We should welcome any arrangement which would finally relieve us of responsibility for this concern. 7 # The foregoing remarks will, I trust, have shown that British political interests in^x&gt;izful ar ^a^in the nature of a 'damnosa h^-ereditas' and tnat no time should be lost f*-4- lost whether on political or economical grounds in closing ibt iNiOvember 1922 has already proposed the transference of the headquarters of ii .B .iu. Vice-Consul at Dizful to ohushtar and the elimination of the Consular Agent at the latter place. Alternatively he proposed the substitution of Consular Agents at 'both Dizful and ohushtar in place of a Vice-Confc&gt;ul' 4t Bizful and a Consiular Agent at ohushtar as at present. experience of Arabistan has convinced me that the second proposal is not feasible. If British Officers cannot be afforded or spared it is better to have no one at all, except perhaps an unofficial news writer on a small retaining fee. Apart fro i the difficulty of obtaining really reliable Persians to act as Consular Agents experience has shown that the position of a Persian Consular Agent vis a vis the authorities of the Persian Government only breeds suspicion and friction even when the said Agent is unsually nonest and capable. 9» The position at bhusntar is somewhat different from that at JJizful since there is no tribal situation to be reckoned with. But even so my remarks in paras 4, b and 6 supra do apply with some force to onushtar as well, ohusntar is the headquarters of the Governor-General of Arabistan # contains a flourishing branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia under a European Manager and lies next door to the oilfields with the result that there is constant correspondence betweer the officials of the Oil Company and the Governor-General through the Consular Agent on an infinity of questions relating to supplies, labour, thefts, etc. etc.i am certain that all important questions of tnis nature can be settled with less friction through the mediation of a British vice- Consul than through a Persian Consular Agent. On the other hand tnere are many minor matters which are at present dealt vith by the British representative (Persian Consular Agent) which could equally well be dealt with by a represen- down the x&gt;izful Vice-Consulate. 8. Captain Wall is in his memorandum .No. 414 7, dated-5- representative of the Oil Company located at ohuehtar. It is not advisable in ray opinion that the British represen tative at uhushtar, whatever his designation may 'be, should appear to he acting as an Agent of the Oil Company. 10# Another question which may 'become urgent in the near future is that of Consular representation for British and British Indian subjects at the Oilfields. Dr. Young has enjoyed the powers of a First Class Magistrate for some years and has occupied a unique position at the Oilfields where his tact .and sympathy nave facilitated the settlement of many questions which would otherwise nave had to be dealt v .ith by n.B.M. Consul at Ahwaz* 1 view his approaching departure with misgivings more especially as intensive drilli operations are shortly to be undertaken which will increase the personnel at the Oilfields by at least 50 %• 11, For all these reasons I do not feel able the moment to propose any permanent scneme for Consular represen tation in northern Arabistan and at the Oilfields. I feel strongly nowever that any vithdrawal should be made step by step and with one eye on the potential needs of the near future. I therefore urge that immediate orders may be given for the abolition of the Dizful Vice- Consul ate and the trans fer of the Vice-Consul's headquarters to bhushtar eliminating the ohushtar budget but leaving the uizful budget intact. I wpuld then propose that the Vice-Consul at ohushtar should relieve the Consul at Ahwaz when the latter maJces his summer tour and that ohusntar should be left throughout the summer with only a small office and staff. By the autumn it will be possible to determine whether the retention of a Consular officer at iihushtar is a necessity.

The -troops left Shush early in 1«20 and in the autumn of that year the designation of the Dizful office was changed from*Assistant Political Office^ to 'Vice Oonaulate ,, • At the end of 1921, as mentioned above, the enttre control of the administration was handed over to the Persian Authorities and the duties of the British s Officer in Dizful became purely Oonaularu ActiWdt administation having ceased, it is now proposed to examine the question whether exlstinf British interests in Dizful and its neighbourhood necessitate the permanent presence of a British Officer# rhese interests may be conveniently grouped under the headings Trade, Oil, British Subjects, Hews and the Bridge Company 0 I take them seriatim# trade.

The Company ia a ^oin^ concern but &gt;oin a superficial inspection it appears that the pier which supports the Southern ena of the suspension bridge is beinf eroded to the danger of the bridge and expert ad/ice would sesia to be necessary if the bridfe is to stand® I Kiay mention here that the money to buy the Government shares was oriirinally advanced in the form of loans and grants bv the Political Authorities in Moaopotamia and that neither they nor their successors the novemment of Iraq have wade any enquiry with regard to this mone|i or its interest since they ceased to excercise political control in Arabistan earlv in 1921 # so I am unaware whether a final debit of the amount has been made to British, Indian or Iraq Funds. The amount of the dividends due on these Oovarnment shares for the past two years has been placed on fixed deposit with the Imperial Bank of Persia, Ahwaz pending orders as to its desposal. From the above it appears that with the exception of thy Dizful bridge Company British interests in Dizful and the surrounding District are nebulous in the extreme and the aaviskblitv of retaining further the post of British Vice -Consul demands sertous consideration particularly at a time like the present when strict economy is the order of the day and a Ketrenchment Oommittee is actually in session in fcHta India® It will be admitted at once that trade is nefrlipible and in the event of oil beinr atruck at Dehluran and the Company daoidinft to build a pipe line via Shush the proposal to have a Britiah official representative in these repions oan alwave be reconsidered and it in by no neans certain head- that Di'iful would be the best^quartera. as regards the collection of news a local news writer-(6)- writer oan easily be found t ; o furniah regular reports In oonBx Aeration oS a arnall monthly payment and there oan he no neceaaity ^o k^ep the Vioe-Conoulate open on this account^ The Dizful liridge (Jonpany presents a fcl^Qr profclem and I queation wlietiier it would not be ka to our eventual interest, to surrender our obligation and responsibility with regard to the bridge at as early a date aa possible.Undoubtedly it is of great importance to Dizful but I venture to point out that it ia of no apparent value Military, Political or Oommeroial to the British or Indian Governments. When AraMstan was oooupied by troops the Military authorities consistently refusoito recognise it as a military necessity though they assisted generously in its construction # ita political importance has declined to vanishing point sinoe the withdrawal of iolitical control from Arabiatan and its value to British trade ia, as shown above, entirely negligible. The bridge is in working order now but I have Irawn attention in a previous paragraph to the erosion of the subaqueous structure and if my fears are justified a large expenditure of money will probably be entailed in the near future. I need hardly noint out where this money will be expected to come from and the future provision^ of funds may shortly loom aa an embarrassing feature on the horizon. Another point in connection with the bridge is a manifestation of diHaatisfaction on the part of a section of the Dizful shareholdera aa to the manner in which the bridge is run and this dissatisfaction ia likely to grow. The general idea seems to be that the best arrangement (from the Dizfuli point of view) would be farm out the revenues to a syndicate for a fixed sum out of which dividends and repairs would be paid - The responsibility of maintaining the bridge remaining with the Vice Consul. Needless to say the scheme hardly commended itself to me but I note it as a straw showing that the chill wind of criticism is arising. However, it will be necessary-(7)- /&gt; recsnnary a oon to call th fl Annual G,n,ral Keetinr and I shall no dou&gt;t ba faood with a daflnlte request aa to our future policy in regard to the bridge. ; y opinion la that the sooner we wash our hands of rarv '■ hii h ^tor, foreign control of undertaking in F^raia is naturally never popular and if it is necessary to Veep up a Vice-Oonaulate coating £ 3,000 a year to safeguard an interest wofcth e fl,500 the obvious thing to do is to get n . t ; interest.

In reply to your letter o£ the 9th February, fa7 /s, v ?e bave the honour to express our views as follows. )i We e°^ider - and we believe that His Majesty's Consul at Aiiwaz agrees - that it is to the advantage of this Company and of British interests generally that the Governor-General of Arabistan should be encouraged to refer direct to the Connpany on minor matters arising from time to time, affecting the Company's interests or those of its employees, without the intervention of His Majesty's Consular Officers. We consider that the permanent establishment of a British Vice-Consul at Shuster is likely to have the effect of discouraging this tendency, and we are therefore, all things considered, not in favour of the permanent retention of a British Consular Officer at Shuster. With regard to Dizful, no early development of the Company's activities in pusht-i-Kuh is anticipated and we a-re not, therefore, as at present advised, disposed further to press for the retention of a British or Persian Consular Officer at Dizful. should we find oil in Pusht-i-Kuh in quantities sufficient to Justify a pipe-line, and should that pipe-line be laid in Persian territory from pusht-i-Kuh Shush to Ahwaz, the Government of India would doubtless De willing to consider afresh the question of Consular representation at Dizful. It follows from the foregoing that the interests o^ the Anglo- Persian Oil Company would be satisfactorily met oy the complete with-- ( 2 ) - '7 2&gt; (n^) ( qo^timjap ) drav .al in due course and at a convenient juncture of British Consular Oiiicers. Doth from Shuster and Dizful.^We may add that the Gompany attach the greatest importance to the retention at Atiwaz of a competent Assistant to His Majesty's Consul, who will be in a position to officiate for the latter as necessary and to act on his behalf whether at the Oil fields or elsewhere in Arabistan, both in a judicial as well as in a Consular capacity; and we trust that if the reductions adumbrated above are carried into effect, measures will be taiten to ensure that the Staff of His Majesty T s Consulate at Ahwaz is strengthened in such a way as to make it possible to deal promptly and effectively with emergen cies arising at a distance irom Ahwaz. in this connection we should like to point out that Pusht-i-Kuh is officially within the sphere of His Majesty's Consulate at Ahwaz, and it would appear to De important that His Majesty's Consul should be in a position to visit this area personally or by deputy when occasion arises. The present tendency of the Viali is to deal direct with the Company as far as possible, and this tendency we are doing nothing to discouragt The Wali t however, has recently invoked our intervention in various matters at issue between himself and the Iraq Grovernment. We have done our best to meet his wishes; out our intervention in such questions is liable to be misunderstood and resented by the Iraq Government, and it would be undoubtedly to the advantage of British interests generally if His Majesty's Consul at Ahwaz were in a position to see more of the Wali during the Winter months. at Ahwaz.
