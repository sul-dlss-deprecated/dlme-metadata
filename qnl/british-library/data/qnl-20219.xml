The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ^Dated Kuwait, the 9th June rials. Sir, According to the ' Times ',Lord Curzon of Kedleston is reported to have remarked as follows on the occasion of an address by Mr P.Landon on Basrah and the Shatt-ul-Arab, at the Society of Arts, on 15th April last;- Hitherto we had had most friendly relations with the Arabs, it was rather a ouzsle t-o him why at those earlier stages of the fighting the Arabs appeared to have sided with the Turks, and it certainly should be the object of our diplomacy to detach them xrom the side of the Turks and to resume those pleasant relations with them which had characterized our policy during the last 50- years.' And again in the House of Lords on 20th April 'and they (the Turks) appeared to have succeeded in pressing into .their service the greater part of the Arab tribes in the lower part of Mesopotamia. This was a matter of extreme importance, for we had always maintained, and he thought were still maintaining, iriendly re.lat.ions with the tribes in that part of the world.' The Right Honourable the Secretary of State for India is reported to have replied on the latter occasion that;- A considerable number of Arabs had joined the Turks in the attacks. At the battle of Shaiba, where there were certainly not -e^s than 10,000 Turkish troops engaged, probaly approaching the a s0k, i same number of Arabs took part in the operations, it had beeh/Vf perhaps too hastily assumed at first that all Arabs, when Turkey joined the G -ermans, would take part in breaking the Turkish yoke. Of some Arabs, particularly many of the desert tribes, this was no doubt true. How far it applied to the more sedentary Arabs who he took it, supplied the Arab forces now operating, it was not so easy to say. it was reasonable to suppose that probably a ,qon- -siderable number had proved willing to join Turkey now because they had had it dinned into their ears that islam was being attacked. Some of them might even believe the amazing stories that were told about the conversion to islam ,of eminent Germans including the Emperor himself.' I have the honour to submit a few notes of information which I have collected regarding the extent to which the Arabs have co-operated with the Turks in the Shatt-ul-Arab country; the considerations which have led them to co-operate: and the results to themselves and to the Turks of such co-operation; with some remarks upon the position of those Arab tribes which have held aloof or tacitly sided with His Majesty's G-overnment. 2. The Arab forces which took part in the recent operations in the neighbourhood of Shaiba were composed mainly of 4000 members of various communities from Iraq and 6000 of the Muntafik tribes from the country lying on the banks of the Euphrates and the Shatt-ul-Gharaf between Khamisiah on the south and Kut-ul-Amarah on the north. The only other Arabs who appear to have helped the Turks on this occasion are a few hundred men of the Bani Hakam and the Bani Hasan who inhabit the swampy region adjoining Sukh- us-shiyukh. cJ.The Iraqis have had very little connection with us and dwell too far away ever to have come under the influence of our Persian Gulf officials. The Resident at Baghdad has in all probability had little opportunity of cultivating their friendship or of ma -king his influence felt amongst them, and no astonishment need be expressed at their having joined the Turks which was natural. Of the Muntafik much the same may be said. Their country nowhere touches upon Persian Gulf ^dministr^.tj.ve limits, and I learn that no decided efforts have ever been made by H-M's Consuls atBasrah to establish friendly relations with theirii in fact they probably did not consider such a proceeding to be part of thei duty as it would have been regarded by the Turks with grave sus- -pioion if not with resentment. It may also be remembered that the Muntafik land lies in the direct route of Turkish troops ad- -vancing on Basrah from Baghdad and in districts which have for centuries been governed or mis-governed by Ottoman officials. It would have been strange indeed had they elected to oppose the Turkishe forces with, so far as they could see, everything to lose and nothing to gain thereby. The small tribes west of Bas- -rah mentioned above, who know little of the British, were bribed or forced to give what help they could like the Basravis,numbers « of whom had been compelled some months earlier to join in oppo- -sing our first advance, on pain of destruction of their lives and property and those of their relatives. 4. The conduct of the Iraqis seems to have been correct ^rom the Turkish point of view, except that they occasionally displayed a lack of discipline and perhaps courage. But in the course of the engagements of April 12-15 the Muntafik shewed clearly that their hearts were not in the struggle from any national or reli- -gious enthusiasm, but that while motives of self preservation had led the chiefs to take up arms, the common people were out for plunder from whomsoever it might be taken. On 13th April, these same Muntafik plundered the Turkish encampment during their retreat after being repulsed by our troops, the ostensible reasor according to eyewitnesses, being that the Turks had promised then victory whereas a severe rebuff was all they received. 5. In the circumstances detailed above, little need be said upon- the subject of the Tu&amp;kish efforts to arouse religious feeling among the Arabs of these regions. Such an aspect of the war has entered but little into the considerations of the Muntafik, and the Basravis seem to be quite unaffected by it. The attemjbtto raise a Jehad has had no effect upon the large and important tribes of Central and North-Central Arabia, and I have not met any Arab who has taken seriously the supposed conversion of prominent Q-ermans to Islam.6. in oonneotion with the tribes and localities referred to 'in this oommunioation, a reference is invit.ed to the (gazetteer // Map of Arabia whioh was oompiled in the Foreign Office, Simla, during the years 1905-08; and I now pass on to some mention of the tribes further south, who have had more or less acquaintanc with British officials and have come more under the influence of our friends among the Arab chifs and notables. First come the Zaffir, a large and scattered tribe who inhabit uhe country W.and N.W.of Kuwait, as far as Samawah. The Zaffir, who could probably put five thousand fighting men into the field, have throughout declined all Turkish invitations to take up arms on their behalf, giving as their reason a feud which exists be- -tween them and the Muntafik, but they have also been advised by some of our friends to stand aloof. The Yuarin, who dwell nearer to the coast in about the same latitude, and whose strength is perhaps from 2-3000 fighting men, have also remain- -ed neutral, partly owing to enmity with the Muntafik and parti; to the influence of Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait, who has also induced the Bani Malik, a roving tribe who come from the left bank of the Shatt-ul-Arab to pass the spring and winter in Kuwait territory, to take a similar course. 7. For the neutrality of the Shammar, the numerous inhabitants A/ of the eastern portion of the desert tract known as the Nfud /X which lies to the S.W.of Kuwait, and the powerful Umm Tair who dwell in the Summan tract S.E.of the Nafud, we are indebted partly to the influence of Shaikh Mubarak and partly to the skilful diplomacy of Bin Saud the Amir of Nejd, who by organi sing a campaign against ibn Rashid the Shammar Chief, and en- -listing in his service the warriors of the Umm Tair, not only provided himself with an excellent excuse for declining to assist the Turks who were pouring invitations upon him, but compelled Ibn Rashid and the Shammar to attend to their own defence. There never was any doubt as to what line Bin Saud himself would take, but he might not have found it possible to induce his people to take up our cause at an early stage of the war, or to restrain them from assisting at our discomfiture had we suffered a severe reverse at the hands of the Turks at a similar period.&amp; 8. it is impossible to speak too highly the oonduotkof H.E. whioh I informed him that war with Turkey was imminent been that of a loyal and honourable gentleman. He said on that oooasion that all that he had was at our disposal and that he would be victorious with us or perish with us, and everything that he has said or done sinoe has borne out the sincerity of his professions of friendship. He has written to every Shaikh of importance throughout the country urging him to maintain friendship with and confidence in His Majesty's G-overnment, and the full effect of his efforts on our behalf will probably never be known. I conclude this report with the following extract from a letter sent by a Mr Chandavarkar of Malabar to the ' Times of India ' which speaks for itself;- 'Arab merchants,' followers of the Shaikh of Kuwait on the Arabian coast who come here for the purpose of trade are becoming helpful in enlightening the Mahomedans on the correct situationabout the war and the folly of Turkey in allowing her- -self to be made a catspaw of G-erman ambition.' 9.

The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Kuwait, the 6th July 1915. I have the honour to report an incident which o^wurred during a visit which I paid to Shaikh Sir Mubarak bin Subah on the morning of the 5th inst. During a lull in our conversation, the Shaikh suddenly ob served that there was something he wished to tell me secret^ly, and having satisiied himself that we could not be overheard, announced that he had decided to hand over the management of his customs tq us at the conclusion of the war. I asked what had prompted him to come to this decision as there was little fault to be found with the present administration. He replied that the resent arrangements were satisfactory enough, but that he wished to give the other Shaikhs of the Persian Gulf, the Shaikh Ox Bahrain and the Sultan of Maskat etc, a proof of his affectio J^or and confidence in His Majesty's Government, in the hope that ^hey, might follow his example. He said that last year the Shaikh of Bahrain had refused a generous offer from the Govt of India ^espjecting the management of his customs owing to want of con- -fid (ence, and that a lead from Kuwait would doubtless set that rigr it. I replied that the plan was a very excellent one, whioh Wher parried out would increase the satisfaction already felt - b .y fn -s Majesty's Govt at His Excellency's loyal and consistent - &gt; * attit ude. 3- Sha ^uld it be considered advisable I could suggest that it is iAhardly neoessary to wait until the end of the war, adding that nobody oould tell when that would be, but I thought it best to refer the matter before doing so as, so far as Kuwait is oon- oemed,it matters little whether the change is made now or later. 4, A copy of this letter is being sent to Basrah.

Dated Kuwait, the 6th July 1915 Sir, I have the honour to make the following report in connection with the arms trade in the Persian Gulf, and Shaikh Sir Mubarak's attitude in regard thereto. 2. At the beginning of May I received information, the first of its kind for many months, that a boom had left Kuwait for Qatar with seventy cases of arms and ammunition on board destined for a party of Afghans. A subsequent statement by the same person mentioned two booms as having sailed with arms. 3. Enquiries elicited the fact that my informant was in serious A' trouble with the shaikh who some monts before had imprisoned him A for a fraudulent action in connection with the removal of goods from the customs, and J suspected that he was trying to make trouble between H.E. and myself to serve his own purposes, a suspicion which subsequently proved to be well founded. 4. j asked the Shaikh about the arms, and wrote to Major Keyes at Bahrain informing hin of what I had heard, sir Mubarak at first told me that no arms had left in the booms mentioned, but a day or two later, after further enquiry, said that some few of the -a tured Turkish rifles of German manufacture whioh Arabs had brought from ^ubair, had been conveyed to Qatar for sale there unacoompanied, however, by ammunition. He added that he had con fiscated all that remained in Kuwait of these weapons. 5. i am glad to see that the information supplied in Major Keyes' memorandum,of which a copy has been sent to Bushire, largely - _GonfirmB that given by the Shaikh, and the incident tends to (13 su port our belief that praotioally no anas traffic is now carried on in Kuwait. 6.

On receiving the report from Colonel Grey, T asked for further details on certain points, before placing the matter before Government; meanwhile the Shaikh arrived in the River on a visit to the Shaikh or Muhammareh, and came up to see me. At a long interview he expressed himself as follows:- He has arrived at a great age and cannot hope to live for many years more; his affairs and the material development of Kuwait have greatly prospered during the last few years, ow ing to the support given him by the British Government; he has several sons and relations, some harmless, some danger ous; it is his very earnest wish that the edifice which he has taken so much pains to build up may not be rent into fragments by a family scramble for tiie patrimony on his demise. He has devised the follov/ing Scheme of insurance against such a calamity. He wants Government to farm from him or manage for him, now and in future, all sources of revenue, and simply pay him the income. He can then in his Will leave his various beneficiaries their inheritance in the form of specific sums payable to them by Government from Revenue. Foreign and Political Department, 2. He recent-made a suggestion to the Political Agent, Kuwait It43 It is an ingenious and wise Soheme worthy of his fine old character, and I very much hope that, in view of his unwavering friendship with us and his strong and Drogressive rule, the Government of India will vouchsafe a response which will not disappoint him. It is difficult to go into matters in detail with him un til Government have expressed their willingness in principle to find a basis for meeting his wishes, and I therefore beg that the Government of India will be pleased to intimate to me their reply on this point as soon as practicable.

'}.*■&lt; ■ ' A.P.O. f^ , I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegram No 3078 B and to report the steps taken in regard to the purchase of camels. 8. In connection with the funds required lwo difficulties presented themselves; (1) the impossibility of obtaining Rs in sufficient quantity at the mo ent owin(/ to merchants not requiring bills on Bombay and (2) the fact that dollars over the amount of 11 or 12000 are difficult to obtain locally within a short time. I have disposed of difficulty No. 1. by borrowing Rs.15000 from Shaikh Jabir and would be grateful if you could have this amount in cash sent over from the Bushire treasury for payment to him. In regard to dollars I have to day received a supply from Basrah which will suffice for pur chase up to a total of 500 camels or so. 3. We have bought with the Rs.15000 mentioned above at the current rate of exchange 11808 dollars, of which roughly 4000 dollars nave been disposed of in tne purchase of 40 camels locally. Shaikh Muhanmad of Zubair has given 3000 dollars to men v .hom he has sent out to purchase from the Um Tair tribe; ' and will now despatch another party to the Bfeni Khalid and Awazim for the same purpose. The AJman camels are in bad .on- cition and not worth buying.4. Shaikh Jablr in add tion to leading money as stated has given pernission for all camels procured by us 'oo ^raze in hie private grazing ground free of charge and has declined to accept the usual royalty on purchases made. He is moreover, giving all the help in his power. • r '. Shaikh Muhammad tells me that you ish the caiaels despatched by fifties or more at a time, and it is hoped that the first instalment will leave Kuwait in about two days time. 6.

St.A Wake, C.B., on board. Previous notioe had not been given; otherwise it is probable that the Shaikh who is now in the Shatt-al-Arab would have returned to receive the Oom- -aodore. 2. Tile Poliuioal Agent called on the Cozaaodore officially at 5—30 P.M. the same day. o. IJext day at 9-30 A.M. Shaikli Salia, Governor of Kuwait in the aDjenoe of hij br^ti^er (riiaikh Jabir), aooompanied by the Politija Agent visited the Gommodore on board H.M.S. 'Lawrenoe' and was given a salute of 5 guns on the termination of his visit. 4. This salute haj been granted to the eldest son of the fhaikh on oooasions when he visits one of His iiajesty's ships,a. hi father's representative, and was not strictly due to Shaikh Salim^ who is only the brother. However as the representative of the Shaikh, he occupies the Palace and enjoys full ruling powers when thet ■■ ^ vo! .0^ the latter is away fx^oia Kuwait. Tlie salute wa.-&gt; thus perhaps in aojordanoe with tlie spirit of the regulation, whioh was made dur- -ing the life time oiT ohe late ^hailth, v/hen it was oustomary for his eldest son, the present r haikh, to represent his father on suoh oooasionj. 5. The oase of a brother or .other aeaber or the ruling family representinc the Shaikh, when out of his dominions, lias not pre- -vioujly ooourred and owing to the unexpected nature of this visit, it wa .i not possible for me to refer to you for orders on the poinL. When consulted by the Commodore, I -.ugjejted that ShaiJda Salim should be given a salute of 5 guns at the* termination ox his visit as on ocoa^ions when tae Siiaikh's reprejentative was his eldest son. In so doing I orust I have not created an unde- -sirable precedent, but in any event I venture to recommend tmat the case, which is lively to recur at intervals during Shaikh Jabir's reign may be considered with a view to extending the sa- -lute of 5 guns, now receivalile by the eldest son, to any member of the ruling family who has been appointed regent of Kuwait dur- -ing the absense of the Shaikh. 6.

Meanwhile txie man of influence and authority in Kuwait, next zo Shai^di jabirm is Thaiidi Salim who besides having a oonjiderable personal following, is oo^imander of the lojal forces. The arrangement is made by Shaikh 0 abir himself and I do not believe he would think of making any other, unless(possibly) he were pressed or en couraged by u i to put f orward his eldest son. The latter is a man about 152 years of age. He is said to be devoted to the Bri- -tish and to be in other wnys a promising young man. Meanwhile he remains in the background and it would be leaving well alone that we should not go out of our way to bring him out but rather to allow that to come about in due course or as policy may dic- -tate, at some future time. 28-8-1653/32 III.

No further trace of him was discorered but later rumours were current in the bazaar that a w G-ermani n had been in Kuwait. One of the Mission servants stated to Dr.Mylrea that he had spoken to the man whose Arabic was good** I am somewhat sceptical regarding the report as my informant,a European,saw the man on three occasions but did not re ort the matter till some time after seeing him. (9). On the ni^ht of August Lieut,MeCollum ,aaiJ: 2/Lieut Collier and Messrs Q-ray (of Oray Ma«)cenzie) and Bradshaw (of Striek Scott )who were all dining in the Rest House were apparently drugged,probably by opium administered in their dinner. There was nothing stolen and no ordinary explanation of the occurrence. Subsequently Lieut.HcCollum suffered slightly from symptoms suggestive of copper poisonong though he has no copper coolcing pots,Mr,Gray complained of similar symptoms. It should be added that at the time they vere ex periencing difficulty in getting a cook and various temporary men were being tried,, 'Abdul Latif,Mmdir of the Customs,who is regarded by the Shaikh with very considerable disfavour as being an anglophile,visited the Shaikh's maglis and then lulla Saleh (the Shaikh's Secretary)and shortly afterwards was extremely ill with symptoms whi jh pointed strongly to poison,probably arsenic.0 A few days later a well-lcnovm merohant died of an atta«lc with similar symptoms but the matter was hushed up. This merchant had nothing to do with us. (3)• On the afternoon of the de :X )rtation of Yusuf al Dawairi it seemed doubtful if the man would be produ«ed at the hour named by us and Lieut. Tie Co Hum telephoned to the Mudir of the Customs who went to see the Shaikh about the matter. As no reply had come shortly before the ship was to sail (I had detained her till the afternoon) Lieut.M«Gollaii went round on my behalf to enquire whether Yusuf al Dawairi would be handed oyer. He waited with the Shaikh's son on the reranda and the Shaikh sent out a message that he was busy in his malctub and that the m :.n would be sent. He actually had with him Mulla Saleh and a relation of Yusuf al Dawairi and they were no doubt discussing the possibility of a final refusal,as even after receiYin^ Sir Percy Cox' message the Shaikh wae much against acceding to our request. I consider that in not seeing Lieut.MeCcllum the Shaikh was guilty of ^rave discourtesy,but I decided to take no steps in the matter as the Shaikh was much upset at the time and I think that any further unpalatable action on our part rai^ht very possibly hare driven him into open defiance. ^ 1 Captain,X.A., Poli tical A^ent,Kuwait.•..•.

On October ^?nd I received a telegram from Philby saying:'When are you coming London? Kuwait people hope to see you.' I left home next day and arrived in London on the ?4th. That niJit I dined at the Savoy vith Philby and the Kuwait and ^ajd Missions. I had not rauph time with Shaikh Ahmad that nijit but called at his house next day where I remained with him several hours. He was very depressed and had a lon^ list of complaints for me. He had been about a fortnight in London at this tim^. He evidently disliked- both Bowman and Philby. The former,he informed me,wanted to have his boxes searched at Bombay to look for two towels which the cabin-boy of the Lawrence'' said were misain^ from his cabin when he was le vin^ the ship, finally on his refusing to subrait to suai an insult,Bowman appe .rs to hi.ve told him he would pay the 'Lawrence' the cost of the towels and debit the amount to expenses There were some other incidents too in regard to lo*man which he did not like. Then on arrival In -^njland ^hilby was put in charge with Bowman to help him. His complaints ajainst Philby were first that the latter did lot wire to me until the ^?nd though he (the Shaikh) had been askinj him to do so every da^, since s arrival in England,and secondly that the TTajd Mission was bein^ treated with partiality. As regards the.latter complaint I think Philby had been doin^ 'lis best to be impartial and that the real cause of discontent was that he lid not wish to be with the Najd people. Anyhow I wont to the India Office and put the whole case before the Political Secretar^ who arranged that neither Philby nor Bowman was to have any more to do with th« Kuwait Mission and thai I was to take charge of it as from October c 7th inclusive. It vopearc that through s )me mista/te the India Office was not informed of the arrival in England of the Missions until a day or so before they actually arrived. The hotels w.re all full up and the only accommodation found for them the first ni^ht -yas in a small hotel out in Norwood. They were hours -^o n^ arouna in cars before they ^o . there and of course this upset them. ^Text. day they were given accommodation in a privat- house in Pimlico (49*, St. Georges Road), and here they had to remain until October ! ~'7th when ;cc mmodation became available in the Carlton.From this onward they had excellent accommodation everywhere they went.Whilii in the ,private house in Pimlico they had their meals at the Savoy but of course it was a bit of a nuisance having to ^o out for their meals and very -oftnn the Kuwait Mission had to do without food as they lid not feel inclined to jo out for them. Both Missions /ere in the ~a 'Iton from October ^th to November 3rd when the ?fajd Mission went on to Cambridge k XX m . while we went on to Gdas^ov where we were to embark five days lat^r. At the Carlton we dinet apart and saw very little of the pia^d party. Oar last ii London was spent mainly in shoppin^ buying such things as cloth,saddl ry,ru^s,watches,dressing _owns^ sportln3 -^uns and ammunition,trunks,binoculars,etc,to the value of upwards of £700. Before I assumed charge they had } e^n Greenwich Observatory,the Houses of Pariia.ient,Westminster Cathedral,under ground London. I ook them to .Hampton Court,the Zoological Gar em etc. There was a very ^ood exhibition at the Theatre of I^st. ri s* ■^hich I took them to one nighw. They were delighted and in fact astounded at what they Sxw there. They did not much care for ordinary theatres so we usually filled up our-nights by ^oing to Cinemas vhich they did appreciate^ On October 30th I took them to Buckingham Palace.A detailed account Of this is attached. The Jajd party were pre sented before us. The^ had 8 minutes audience with the Kin 0 while we had 17. The Kuwait party.actually timed it and consider they made a ^reat scort; over the others. On Octoht.r 31st, I-took my party to see the Secretary I &lt;of State for Inlla. Thera is nothln._ social to record re^urdinj this sxcept perhaps that the Interview as a vfer v pi •a ant one.^ V* left London on November 3rd and arrived In GIub^ow next morning. Here we stayed at the Central Station ^otei. On ^o /eiaber 5th we had lunch on at the Oity Chanbers with the Lord Provost, aldermen and friends. After luncheon ve inspected th«t Clt w ■ Chambers and then went to see the University and Art Ciallories. ^ext day vre motored to Queensf erry . via Edinburgh, saw the ?orth Bridge and were taken through a submarine. The next day was to be our last In Britain;w# visited some shipping yards and then went to the aerodrome at Renfrew, 'lere we saw scores f aeroplanes of different ty .es,then exhibitions of flyln^ and finally the ShalkrA three followe s and myself went up in seoarate Planes. We tried very hard to ^et the Shaikh himself to fly. He ^ot so far as to get dressed and into one but then his courage forsook him and he made excuses saying it was not big enough for him,that he /as afraid he mijht touch what he was told he should k-ep clt ar of,etc ani finally ^ot out. It was a gre.t pity we could not get him to jo up. ^ext dajf,November 8th '/e sailed from GKLas^ow. The Shaikh is a very poor sailor and as we had exception ally bad weather almost the whole of the way it cannot b^- said ' that he enjoyed his time on board. We passed a floating mine in the edit ;rranean. This added to his liscomfiture. He vas very x nervous after that until we arrived in Alexandria. We jot there on the morning of Movenber 'Ust. 7e were met by Mijor layer Anderson,R.A.M.C.,an officer attached by the Residency,Cairo to the ission during its sta^ in Kgypt. saw as much of Alexandria s possible that day. 7e stayed at the Savoy Hotel that night and next morning set out for Cairo which we reiched about noon. Here we stayed at Shepheard's iiotel. In the afternoon of the first day we attended a race m.;eti»j ing. ^ext day (FTovember ^^rd) we visited the Zoologlc-1 Gardens and the Pyramids. November ''-Ithytha Mission was received by Lord ,Allenby who presented the Shaikh vlth two autographed photographs - one for inself and the other for Shaikh Sallm. In the afternocn we visited the Citadel an l were shown through the^ Mos i'ue of a.m. had I '^ohamme , . 'All and afterwards we attended an At Home given by the Arab bureau in honour of the Mission. November ^6th,Shaikh Ahmad accompanied by the Residency ^irst Assistant an I myself was re ceived by the Sultan. It was ^ulte a friendly interview. In the afternoon Shaikh Ahmad ani his suite were taken to # the Azar University by a Mohammedan gentleman arranged for by Major And rson aa we could not accompany them there. November ICth, r e went to the useum in the forenoon and around the bazaars in the afternoon. November ?7th,we left Cairo for Suez to rejoin our ship. As however the ship lid not arrive, in time we had to remain in hotels that night. Next morning we embarked. All the way up the Persian Gulf the weather vas again very bad. ^Te reached Fao bar at noon on December 10th.-'Te^^ot up to ^ao at midnight ind waited there several hours for the Shaikh's yacht which we saw on our way up. It arrived about 3 next morning. The Shaikh and his party then transhipped but I to go on to ^asrah where the 'Lewis Pelly' was waiting for me rejoined the party next day (Decenber l^th) and then we were weatherbound at Pao until the morning of the 15th. We got to Kurait a little before sunset that evening, decorated (by arrangement)and both our ships coming in. There was a huge crowd,estimated People and extending from the Agency to well palace. The Shaikh's battery boomed out five _ Ahmad as his ship dropped anchor and seven for me as I step ;ed ashore to pay him an arrival visit. He (Shaikh Salira)met me'at the landing steps and escorted me to there ajaln when takln^ my leave. ShV l th Ahmad went lirect to hi? own house and did not even enter,the Palace. Shaikh Sallm was,! unde-stand,very upset at our' cholbe of.Shaikh Ahmad. This will form the subject of a further communication. Shalch Ahmad is very popular in Kuwait and in view of his possible succession I am very glad Shaikh Sallm was not given an option. The trip has done him a very ^re^t deal of ood and If we pay him sufficient attention in the future I have no doubt when his time comes we will have a really ood.friend in hia &amp; m VC The whole town was were also dressed at over 6,0 0 beyond the Shaikh's ;uns for Shaikh W m £he - The Kuwait Mission will pay their homage to the King at 12 noon on^Thursday 30th Ootober. They will oonsist ot; — (1). Ahmsid ibn Jabir ibn Subah. (2). Ah.nad ibn Abdul Jalil. (3). JasiiQ al Yaqub . with a suite of one. On being introduoed to His Majesty's presence the three mentioned above will be presented by captain D .V. MaoCollum, Political Agent, Kuwait. The King will then weloome them to England and as^c aiLer the health of His Excellenoy Shai.&lt;h Salim ibn Subah .Ruler of Kuwait. ShaiiCh Ahmad ibn Jabir will then express the appreciation of the Mission of the great honour conferred on them by their receptior will offer the cordial congr^tJ.lJj,tions of his uncle Shai.di Salim, -&amp;he Ruler of Kuwait, and'of all his subjects on the victorious termination of the great war, will then as^ ror a contin_iance oi His Majest/y's Kindness and protection, and will then present the gold sword and dagger. The blade of the sword belonged to a :'ormer Sultan of Persia. Both weapons belonged to the great Shaikh Mubarak. He will explain that his personal gift of an Arab stal lion to His Majesty is now on its way to England. It is suggested that in reply the King should. aSK the |j|l rVr Mission to convey to Shaikh Salim his thanks for the pre sen ts, then thanK Shaikh Ahmad for the Arab horde and state his sincere pleasuc § in welcoming this distinguished Mission. His Majesty will say He is well aware of the long friendship between His Oovemment and Kuwait and trusts this will grow ever stronger and more intimate. It is the King's regret that the late ShaiKh Sir MubaraK al Sabah did not survive to see the final triumph of his policy. The King .JLght then thanK them for the Kind expression ox' the sentiments of the present Ruler and assure them that in any difficulties that may arise in the future they will always oe able to rely on the hearty cooperation and assistance of His Majesty's Qovernment and their officers. The King might conclude by of ering the Mission hishis hearty good will and beat wishes for a suooessful voyage to their own ocutnry. The King might then hand a aigneu and framed photograph to Shaikh Ahmad for presentation to his anole.HIS MAJE STY IHE KIH3- With profound respect and the greatest of than.cs I beg to express to Your Most Gracious Majesty, my appreciation of that great honour and favour which Year Gracious Majesty has been pleased to confer on me in inviting me to come here into Your presence.

Kuweit.Persian Oulf Some time ago an article appeared in ' Negleo'ced Arabia * entitled * The HaJJ H . The central figure in that article was the heir to the Kuweit throne, Sheiith Ahmed bin Jabr,who in the summer of 1918 showed his devotion as one of the leading oien of this side of Arabia t by visiting the Holy City of Mecoa. In Mecca,however.he not only oame into contact with the past, but also with the very recent present, in the person of Hussein, King of Hejaz, the most powerful man in Ar abia to-day, and whose son, the Emir Peisul, was a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles, besides being a fairly familiar figure in London. Hussein's knowledge of the world mist have made no little impression on our simple-ainded sta^-at-home Arab. In any case it was Ahmed's preparation for a second journey, which was to oe^-olitical and not a religious pil- grimage, for in the early summer of 1919 he received an invitation to visit King George V and to enjoy for a few wee^s % the hospitality of tne British Isles. October 1919 found Ahmed residing in London. It is a bad time of the year for an Oriental to see London for the first time. The days are short,it rains three days out of four, and those thick,pea^-soup fogs for which London is famous in the winter, are apt to descend with unwelcome frequency. The sun is scarcely ever seen and it is probable that Sheilth Ahmed and his suite were never able to see the horizon at sunset, in order to set their watches. As e exyo:!^ icnows the Arab's day begins at sunset,when it is twelve o'clocic. Ahmed thought the English houses were lovely inside, but outside * they are so blacK and glooaiy Anyone picturing a large London house on a wet,ioggy day, will agree with him. He was muoh impressed with the fact that no matter how mich it rained, the streets were never really dirty. ^ Their roads are iron * he declares. He never went out except in a oar, princijsally because he did noi&gt; enjoy Demg stared at - he probably appreciates now what the wnit ® o ^people went tixrough during the Tirat year or so that they settled in Kuweit. When asKed why he did not affeot European dress and thus avoid the c onspiouousness of his Arab 003tuiae,he replied, ' If I had worn English clothes, people would have taken j it for granted that I spo.^e ^Jnglisii, and I should have had the humiliating experience of explaining every little while that I was an Arab, and did not know English Selfridge's,that huge Anglo-Amerioan department store in a/ Oxford Street, wa8 A populstr haunt of Ahmed's, and he was majh amused by the sales-girls to whoa he refers as H Maaajis * all being demurely dressed in blaok. ,, You oant Just go in and buy a thing H he explains M for they fir^t write aown your puroh se on a slip of paper and then you nave to wait while the paper and your aoney, together with you purchase, are sent away some where or other# presently, when you have become interested in something else, back comes your purchase neauly wrapped up, and at the same time 'Ohe receipted bill and your change are handed to you. Then there was the gunsmith's. He was shown a weapon he particularly adidred, and promptly wished to buy several of the 3ame pattern, but was told that owing to the late war,there was still a great shortage of these tnings and they oould only let him have the One. This astonished him. Altogether the young Sheikh spent some seven hundred pounds shopping in London, in addition to another five hundred whioh he afterwards spent in the same way in Cairo. The onaerground railways were a source of real wonder, fy n especially the su^eri-noBed tunnels onder the Tnames. One tunnel on top of another * he tells his cidmiring audience, r'ait of the time that he was in lived at ' The Carlton and that splendid hotel was a revelation to him. He did not dine in publio, how ever, but in his own apartments. As I s-id before, he does not like to be stared at. Prom the 27th of October on. Sheikh Ahmed and his suite were under the personal oare si and guidance of Captain D.V. MoCollum, our present KUwelt polltioal Agent, and it was a happy ooinoidenje thai Capcaln MoCollum should have been on leave during Ahmed's stay in England. They were old friends and Captain uocollum spoke^~3- u iyy O 'O his language and this aade all the difference. Sheiich iihmed was of course taicen to see tae principal sights of London, including Greenwich Observatory,Westminster Abbey and The Houses of Parliament, which latter were fortunately in session, and the visitor was able to observe how the Mother of all Parliaments does its work, including the taking of a vote on some measure oefore trie house. He was also driven out to Hampton Court, that ancient palace built by Cardinal ^olsey and presentee by him to Henry VIII. Of course he went to tne Zoological Gardens, and it mus-c have ticxtled his Arao heart to see oamels on view as oariosities. Ordinary theatres he did not c^re for, but a performance at Masicelyne &amp; Cook's Theatre of Mysteries, where they claim to be able to equal if not surpass, all tne traditional marvels of Indian magic, left him profoundly and perhaps somewhat unpleasantly stirred. He admits that he has not the faintest idea now the tricks and illusions were done. But after all, who has ? Ahmed took a decided fancy to H movies * and patronised one of the picture-palaces almost every night. The great and central occasion of the visit came on October 30th when escorted by Captain MocoHum,Sheikh Ahmed and his suite were presented to the King at Buckingham palace. The audience lasted 17 minutes and Ahmed congr atulated the King on the successful termination of the most dev .stating war in history, at the same tiae thanking him for his hospit lity and presenting him with a gold mounted Arab dagger and also a very fine old gola-mounted eword, which had once oelonged to a Shah of Persia. There was also a gift of an Arab stallion, but thif for obvious reasons was not personally tendered in the audience chamber. The King, who was in undress naval uniform, welcomed Ahmed very kindly, especially as he was a grandson of the great Mubarek, assured him that he was ready to go thoroughly into any question that Ahmed might care to raise witn reference to Kuweit and ended up by giving him a photograph of himself duly autographed and framed in solid silver. On the border of the frame were the royal aonogram and crown in enamel. Captain McCollum acted tnroughout as interpreter. Before they left London, Ahmed was able to meet the Shal. of Persia, and it is delightful to hear him describe the drive tcdrive 'Do the railway station, M the roads lined with the finest troops in the world, and Lhe polioeaen in perfeot oontrol of t tihe orowds ', Tiie reception at tne railway station, where in honoor of the Shah, the floor was oarpeted and tne walls were hung with ilags, while pal-na and floral deoorations transformed we ugly L^^^aned into a veritable garden, Jiade a scene no detail of whioh was lost on the yong man from Arabia. He tells the story with extraordinay aoouraoy, considering that he was seeing everything througpa the eyes of the unlcnowing foreigner. On November 3rd the party went to Olasgow,where on the Sththey were entertained to lunoheon by the Lord Provost, Alder.nen and friends. Later they inspected the University and -I the Art Gfallerie3. The following day they saw the Forth Bridge, that marvellous cantilever structure, with its total length of 5330 and its two main spans of 1710 feet each. One of the party took notes of tne particulars of the bridge. The next wonder was a submarine. C') L ■ -y ^ It was a long motor drive from^he Forth Bridge to the submarine base and when ohey arrived,it was past sunset, our Arab friends,with one exception, had only one idea in their heads ac that time, and that was, tne sunset prayer. So no sooner had they boarded the submarine than the commanding officer was begged to find them a corner in the craiaped accom modation of the submarine, where they 4ight turn their faces Mecoawards and testify that there is no god but Allah and Mohammed is His Prophet. The one except ion however, and he w** the same gentlemen who had been ao busy at the Forth Bridge, was too keen on the matter in hand, to let the deoiandB of religion interfere. Note-boo^ in hand he went the rounds, demanding information down to the .ninutest detail, and induAoriously writing everything down. The war is over or he wo^ld have left the submarine with blank pages as far as that vessel^ particulars were concerned. Sheikh Ahmed had his own troubles examining the submarine - hejis a big .jan, and well I submarines are not ouilt for Dig men. He had to walk i sideways most of the ti^e, and so^ie of the manholes ajut had to be left unpenetrated.The day before they sailed, the party were Bhown soJie of the Qlasgow shipbuilding yards and also visited the aerodrojie at Renfrew, where they saw aeroplanes by the score. All of the party except the Sheiich himself, made a flight, but for some reason or other, Ahmed got H cold feet * am contented himself with merely putting on flying iCit, entering one of the planes, and being photographed in situ. On November 8th the party sailed from GHasgow for home. The weather was rough and as Ahmed is a poor sailor, he got little fun oat of this part of the show, in fact chere wa-3 hardly a calm day between Olasgow and Kuweit. On Nove-aber 21st Alexandria was reacaed and tne mission was duly met by represen tatives of the Government who showed the visitors what there is to see in that city. ^ Cairo was next visited and there they were received by Lord Allenby, who, liice the King,presented SheiiCh Ahmed with a signed photograph. The party lodged at the famous Shepheard's Hotel. Excursions in Cairo included the pyramids and the Sphinx, which curiously enough,did not impress the visi tors, but the museum with its collection of mummies of age-long departed Egyptians could not but make the Arab stop and think, for an Arab grave is one of the least permanent things of its Kind in the world. The mosque of Mohammed Ali and tfie Cit wael were visited and of course Bl Aznar University. There was a special audience with the Sultan of Egypt besides a reception given in Ahmed 1 s honour by the Arab Bureau. On November 27th everyone le-t for Suea yrhere the mission was to rejoin its snip. But tne s^iip was la^e and our Arab friends had one more night in an hotel. it w .s not until December 15th when the little launch,which had met Sheikh Ahmed at the Basra bar, entered Kuweit harbour, to the salute of five gans from Shtikh Salim's battery. The town was decorated as was also the launch, and the beach was crowded. There is no doubt of Ahmed•s popul -rity, his welcome after an absence of some months was a sure test. Without (iuestion his tr vels have taught him much, and it is to be hoped that what he had leaned may make him one more influence for good in this part of the world. He now knows a little English andto learn BOJie oiore, and uffioiently progressive to insist that his yoiig sons snail learn English too. perhaps the photograph of George V as it hangs in his house, its silver frame steadily tarnishing, and with the du^t settling on it4 53/28 and S6/l.\7.

Trial of ' Abdul V/ahhab bin 'Abdullai:! al-Yusuf al-'Abdur miQRANDUi.i . Reference my niemorandum No,&amp;4i/9/i.l of to-day's date, I was very much surprised at the Shaikh's action in merely sentencing 'Abdul Wahhab to five years imprisonment, as he had all along appeared most anxious that he should be condemned to death if found guilty as a warning to others, and I had told him that that was the sentence always given for murder under British law. After the hearing of the case too, 'Abdul Wahhab 1 s father wrote me. a petition, and told me verbally that he had heard that the Shaikh was sentencing his son to death on his own authority and claimed that he should be tried by the shar' . I told him that he was a British subject, and that His Llajes-ty's Government had deputed the Shaikh to try the case, and that I was satisfied that I f the trial had been a fair one, I said that in any case the Shaikh ~ I had not yet passed judgement, but that when he did, he could if he wished submit a petition of appeal^ which I would forward with the proceedings to you, although I did not think it would do any good. 'Abdul Wahhab has powerful friends in Kuwait, a sister of his for example, being married to Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, and it is ■» probable that the Shaikh has been talked round and that his action is due to his usual weakness of character. In the course of conversation last night he rather hinted that he did not like to sentence him to death for fear liiiat we would nou confiim it, and thtt woulQ lofec prestige by having, his aiudusut aeatencesentence reduced, i think, however, that this is less probable than the former explanation.

She is very little bigger than 'Palinurus' and has the additional advantage of being oil driven whidh will save him importing coal. She is economical to run and handy without being fast. I should imagine Government - would accept any reasonable figure. She cost £35,000, 9 years ago which with a 4 ^ depreciation would make her value now £21,000^ though of course to build one now would cost at least £50,000. I should think however that Government would sell her for •- 2 lakhs or say £15,000. By the way the representative of the ^ Shaikh in Bombay has been having a look all over her.

On the 14th January I925 two Kuwait subjects, named 'Abdullah bin GhunaimSn and Sa^d bin 'Alban, together with four Najdis, named Iferahim al- 1 Abdullah al-Fauzan, •Abdul ^zlz bin Najran, Jifin al-'AJmi and 1 Idan, left Kuwait for Najd, and halted for the night near Ma'danlyat, fifteen miles south of the town, A little after midnight two men, named Bajad al-Humaidani and Muhammad abu Ramyah, who had apparently followed them up from Kuwait for the purpose, made an unexpected murderous attack on them. They killed ^Vulltth bin Ghunaiman and Jifin on the spot, and wounded Sa'ud and 'Tdan (of whom the latter died after being brought to Kuwait), while the other two fled f and escaped unhurt. The murderers got away with all the pro perty belonging to the six men. The Shaikh of Kuwait, who has been trying to trace the murderers ever since, now tells me that he has learnt that they are living with Abu Shuwalribat in 'Iraq territory. He asks that the Government of 'Iraq may be requested assist him in bringing the murderers to book, and in recovering the stolen property - of which a list is attached. The Shaikh tells me that Bajad al-Humaidani is a Mutftiri whom Ibn Sa'ud expelled from Najd some time ago. He spent some time in this neighbourhood, and later with the 'Iraq tribes. He came to Kuwait town via the Khuwair about Dec ember.Muhammad abu Ramyah is also a Mutairi, and was living in Kuwait, „ , A M^Jor, ~ „ Tr ...

The steam launch in question originally belonged to Shaikh Mubarak, but in December I920 was presented by Shaikh Salim, who was then Ruler of Kuwait, to Shaikh Khaz'al, I believe his reason for doing so was that it had been allowed to get into such bad repair as to be positively unseaworthy, and it was necessary to expend a considerable sum of money on it before it could safely be used. He hoped that Shaikh Khazal would have these repairs done (as he eventually did), and that he, as donor, could borrow the boat whenever he wanted it. I believe Shaikh Khaz'al at first refused to have anything to do with it, but was eventually persuaded to accept it. Shaikh Ahmad, who succeeded Shaikh Salim a couple of months later, has frequently used the 'Mishrif' since then when visiting the Shatt al-'Arab. I am afraid, however, he can can only be said to have done so by the courtesy of Shaikh Khaz'al, and not by any legal right. B U S H I R E S.L, 'Mishrify Political Agent, Kuwait Major Copy for Information to H.B.M. Vice Consul, Ifuhamoarah.Translation of a letter, dated the 7th Shauwal 1343 (i.e 0 30th April I925) from His Excellency Shaikh Ahmad al-Jablr as-Subah, Ruler of Kuwait, to the Political A^ent, Kuwait, After compliments, I wish to point out to you that our steam launch 'Mishrif 11 , which my uncle the late Shaikh Salim presented to | the friend of all of us. His Excelilency Shaikh Khaz'al Khan, as a token of friendship and to improve the means of com*« munication between us, was to be for the use of both of us. Whenever I want it I send for it, and return it to him when I have done with it» Now, however, I have heard with the utmost regret what has happened to His Excellency at the hands of his Government, and sa I shall want the launch in a few days to go to Basrah. As His Excellency appointed no one to act for him as agent in the matter, I think it best to refer the matter to you with the request that you will kindly communicate with the proper authorities, as I fear that the Persian Government may not be aware of the true faats of the k case, or may be in need of it and seize it.

He says that normally he would always comply with a request from us for specific mani fests. Perhaps you could let Stas know this, and thus save un pleasantness of the sort in future. / .

In 1921 the Provincial Director of Customs at Bushire informed the Political Resident that, with a view to checking smugnling, he wished the Customs authorities at Bahrain and Kuwait to be asked to forward direct to him copies of the manifests Issued at those ports to sailing craft bound for the Persian littoral. He was prepared to reciprocate as regards craft leaving Persian ports. 2. A reference was accordingly made by this Besidency to the two BhaiKhs. 'he Shaikh of Kuwait refused to accede to the request on the ground chiefly that his Customs Tei^rtment did not require such manifests from Persia; but the Customs authorities at Bahrain made no difficulty and ooaplied lor a short time. hey subsequently discontinued the practice and when &gt;ir.

It the ship should carry goods oon- -signed to different ports, the fact should be mentioned 'in the declarations aforesaid, and the captain or master 'shall be required also to furnish, at each of the ports 'at which he touches, a separate declaration for the goode to be unloaded at such port.' The ersian customs authorities can therefore insist that all craft discharging at Persian ports should carry a manifest. In a matter of this sort the Hobble the Political Resident desires to see conformity throughout the Arab Coast. tie would therefore be glad to know the practice prevailing in Muscat, and whether the Muscat Customs authorities are prepared to e&gt;change duplicate copies of manifests with the Persian -us tons authorities, or to supply copies of particular mani- -fests on request* By order,' Capt., Secretary to the Political Heuidsnt in the ersian Gulf.

The English word is certain to be understood by anyone to whom the letter \ may conceivably be forwarded^ whereas the foreign word quite r\ possibly may not be. Regarding the actual word 'al'. By 'ayal' (family) I think you must mean ' 'ayal' (with an 'ain ) or more correctly '' iyal'* which is commonly used in Persian, In Arabic, however, I have only heard ' 'iyal 11 used as the plural of 11 ^ilah', the usual word for 'family' or 'women folk', I do not think 'al' can have any connection with this, as the 'ain is a very strong letter in Arabic, and one whiwh is not likely to be lost, Butrus al- i ^ ^ Bustani, the author of the 'ITuhlt al-FuhTt' (one of the best s Arabic dictionaries there is) says it is a 3ontraction for ^ and 1 think this is much more probable, ^ j 3 * Whatever its derivation is, it is absolutely certain that no etymological connection with 'al' the article.

The fact remains, however, - regrettable as it may appear to purists - that it rarely is written thus in Arabic and is never thus pronounced. In fact I think one can say that for practical purposes the word 'al' ii*KxjajgaaaK, when used in patrony- mlos &gt; has become the same in value as the article 'al', and can best be transliterated in the same way as the article, I see no~ tning terrible in this, as all languages are constantly changing, ana why should not Arabic? Three new American Missionaries have just come here, Mr. and lire. De Jong and Miss De Young. As she is of Duoch extraction, I know that the last lady^s name should be 'De Jong' too, as it is a very common name in Holland, but as she chooses to call herself 'De Young', I consider it would be grossly rude or me to use any other spelling in writing to her. Similarly as Ahmad always writes and pronounces his name 'Ahmad al-Jabir as^ Subah', as if the 'al' in each case were the article, I say that that is the correct way to write and pronounce it. I nay add that in addition to this patronymic 'al' (for '51') the article 'al' also appears in many Arab names, and that in not a few names it would take a knowledge of Arabic considerably greater than mine to say which was which.yA Copy of a memorandum, No.S/44 dated the 2nd February 19^7,from the Administrative Inspector, Basrah Liwa, Basrah, to the Political Agent, Kuwait;- There is a rumour current in the local baBaars that His MaJesty^s Government have addressed a note to Shaikh Ahmad al-Mubarak, in which he is given the choice of accepting the suzerainty of either the Government of India, the Government of ^raq or Ibn Sa'ud.

T have th^ honour to forward for the inform ation of the Government of India a copy of a n t^ on the Principality of Kuwait at the end of the yt'ar 10:i7, which I had instructed Major J. C. More, D S. O., the Political Agent, to draw up. The details o' the tribes make clear the situation with Ibn Sa^ud on the ^ Iraq frontier. The principality of Kuwait is an independent Arab state under a virtual British Protection. It has a distinctive flag' of its own: red, with the word 'Kuwait 1 ' in Ar.bic chiracters in white across it. Boundaries :—The question of the status and territory of the Shaikh of Kuwait was the sub ject of negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the Sublime Porte in 1913,* as a result of which the Anglo-Turkish Agreement of i9th July 1918,t was signed—but never rati fied. B v this agre mpnt the autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait was recognised in an a^ea, the boundary of wliich formed a fle ni-eircle with the t wn of Kuwait as centre and the Khaur az-Zubair on its radius to the north and Qurain to the south, together with the Islands of Warbah, Bubiyan, Maskan Failakah, ' Auhah, Kubbar, Qaru, Maqta' and Umm al-Maradim, and their adjacent islets. It was further recog nised that the Shaikh of Kuwait was the Tribal over-lord, and entitled to levy tribute, within a larger area, the boundary of which started from the south side of the Khaur az-Zubair at its junction with the Khaur J Abdullah and passed just to the south of Umm Qusr, Safwan and Jabal Sanam and on to the Batin ; it then turned south-west and followed the Batin to Hafar al-Hatin; it then turned south-east, and included the wells of Safah, Qi'rah, flabah and Wabrah, and the village of Anta^, and joined the sea at Jabal Mani f ah. This Angl i-Turkish Agreement, however, as stated above was never raiificd. During the rule ■ f Shaikh Salim, the ques tion of the boundary between his territory and that of Ibn Sa'ud became very acute, and resulted in the surprise and defeat of the Kuwait tribes men at Hamdh near Jar yah, J or Qirvah as it should really be pronounced, in April 1920, and the battle of Jahrah in Oct ber of the same year. The question first arose in January 1919, when Shaikh Salim wanted to build a fort at Dauhat Balbul, just north of Jabal Manifah, to which Ibn Sa'ad objected, and cl limed that it was w r ithin his territory. Nothing happened until April 192ii, when Ibu Shuqair started to build the Ikhwan village of Jaryah, but from then onwards the n-lations between Shaikh Salim and ♦ Secret External, December 1913, Nos. 1—245, t Ihid. ^Enclosure to Serial No. 2 in File £87--X of 1923. Ibn iSa'ud went from bad to worse. During the summer o 1920, both parties applied for British arbitration, and both M'ere asked to state exactly what territory they claimed. Ibn Sa ; ud* replied that he cl; im'pd the whole country up to the walls of Kuw-iit; and Shaikh Salim claimed a fr ntier similar to the &lt; uter line of the Anglo- Turkish Agreement. Tie High Commisfioner for Iraq then invited Ibn Sa'ud to Basrah with a view tos&lt;ttling the dispute, but Ibn Sa'ud replied that he was ui.ai le to come at the time. In January 1921, the Shaikh of Muhamirarah offered to send his son Shaikh Cl asib, accom panied by Shaikh Ahmad al-Jab r _of Kuwait, to Najd, to try and arrange a truce between Ibn Sa ud and Si aikh Salim. His offer was accept ed, and the mission left for Bahrain en route for Najd in February, and reached Ibn Sa^ud's camp to the north ot Kiyadh en the 2nd Mar* h. Two days later the news of Shaikh Salim's death reached them, and Ibn Sa'udf at once said that there was no longer any quarrel to settle, or any need for a boundary between his territory and that of Kuwait. Ibn Sa ud liad+ alreidy been told that His Majesty's Governm* nt recognised the territorv within the inner boundary of the Ang'o-Turkish Agreement as definitely belonging to Kuwait. Nothing more happened regarding the frontier until November 1922,§ when at a Conferem e held at ' Uqair between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Sa'ud, at which the Political Agent was also present, the question of a frontier bet ween Kuwait and Najd came up for discussion. It was recognised atonce that the power of Ibn Subah (to give the Shaikh of Kuwait his desert title) was much less in the desert than it had been wh^n the Anglo-Turkish Agreement was drawn up, and an agreement was eventually arrived at by which the frontier starts from the junction of the Wadi al-'Aujah with the Batin on the west. From this point, leaving Riqa^i to Xajd, it runs in a straight line to the junction of the 29th parallel of latitude with the red semi-circle on the map attached to the draft Anglo-Turkish Agreement, || and then follows the red semi-circle to the sea. The above forms the southern boundary of the recognized tenito y of Kuwait, but the tract f country bounded on the north by the above Ime, on the west by the Shaqq, on the east by the sea, and on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the Shaqq in the west, through 'A in al- 'Abd, to the sea north of Ras al-Mish'a^, is recognized as common to the two states of Najd and Kuwait, in which both enjoy eq al rights. In April 1928$ the Shaikh of Kuwait, was informed that His Majesty's Government recognized the other frontiers claimed by him. The frontiers of Kuwait are accordingly as shown on the attached map. ♦ Serial No. 2 in File No. 387-X—23. t Ibid, Enclosure 2 to Serial ^o. 16. + Ihid, Enclosure 1 to Serial No. 16. § Ibid, Serial No. 20 and Enclosure to Serial No. 21. || S.

It is unnecessary to consider its early history. Suffice it to say that in May 1896 Shaikh Muba rak became Ruler of Kuwait on the assassination of his brother. It was he who raised Kuwait fi'om a place of little importance to a flourishing princi pality. Under his strong rule it became a most attractive place to live in to the Arab mind, and the population of the town nearly doubled itself, it would be difficult to speak too highly in praise of his devotion to the British Government. Shaikh Mubarak died* in November 1915, and was| suc ceeded by his eldest son, Shaikh Jabir, a debonair and pleasant man, whose mildness and affability made him a popular Ruler. Shaikh Salim, another son of Shaikh Mubarak^, succeeded on his brother s deatht in February^ 17. He was a very different type of man from his easy-going brother, being a stern Muhammadau and a very obstinate man. He had spent nearly all his life in the desert before he came to the throne, and hated all modern inventions. He was almost entirely to blame for his quarrel with Ibn Sa ud and all the sorrow that it brought to Kuwait, and in short he did nearly as much harm to the State, as his father had done good. He died| suddenly on the 2Srd February 1921 to the undisguised joy of nearly all his subjects. It hal always been the custom for Shaikhs of Kuwait to rule personally and autocratically, and to avoid all delegation of authority. In the town it was their usage to give audience for an hour or two each morning in the market-place, and decide cases by direct judgement. On the death of Shaikh Salim, however, the townspeople, tired of the unnce^sarv war with Ibn Sa'ud which he had led them into against their will, det-rmined that in future they would Ivtve pome say in tne affairs of the State, and informed the members of the Subah family that they would only §accept as their Ruler one who would accept a council of advisers. Shaikh Ahmid,^ eldest son of the late Shaikh Jabir, was chosen as Ruler, and on his return from Najd an Agreement was drawn up between him and the people of Kuwait to the effect that all criminal cases would be decided in accordance with the Shar' or Religious Law; that in case of appeal the written statements of both parties and the Qadhi's judgement would be submitted to the ' Ulama, whose dec sion would be final; that if both parties in a dispute agreed beforehand for a third party to arbi'rate between them, hi- deci sion should hold; that the Ruler would seek advice in all matters—external as well as internal which affected the town ; and that if any one had anv suggestion to make for the benefit of the town or people, he would lay it before the Ruler, who would consult his people, and adopt it if thev so advised. A council of twelve members was duly elected—six from the eastern half of the * S. E., July 1916, Nos. 1 38, Serial Nos. 1 and 6. t S. E., August 1917, Nos. 44-62, Pro. Nos. 46-'17. X S. E., October 1921, Nos, 311-327, Pro. No. 311, § Ibid, Pro. 314. || Ibid, Pro. Nc. oil. town, and six from the western—under the presi dency of one of the leading merchants, H .mad bin 'Abdullah as-Saqar. Since the early days of its election, however, tiiis Council has never met, and in practice Shaikh Ahmad rules in much the same manner as his predecessors. He is a mild and pleasant man of much the same type as his father. His bluff, jovial manneis make him an eminently f-uitable person ior his position in so far as the ceremonial pa t of his duties are concerned. Unfortunately, however, he has no strength of character, and is a lamentably weak Ruler. He is a right-minded man, and wou'd normally like to do the light thing, but is easily swayed by his advisers - who are not always of the most desirable type. Like many weak men, he can at times be very obstinate. Although greatly desiring popularity, he is not very popular amongst his subjects, amongst whom he has the reputation of being mean. He is a strict Muslim, and is zealous in the enforcement of the prohibition against strong liquor, and also in the suppression of prostitution. He himself is a non- smoker. He is unquestionably well disposed towards the British, and is very fond of entertain ing in British style. He has a suite of rooms furnished like a Eur 'pean honse, and is fond of cinematog aphs, cameras, cars, and other modern inventions. He frequently drives his own car. Shaikh Hamad al-Mubarak, the Shaikh^s uncle, officiates for him whenever he leavrs Kuwait. He is nine yeirs younger than his nephew, being thirty three years of age. His mother belonged to the Ajman trib . He is a uuiet, shy man, with no great intelligence, and no strength of character. Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim was born in 1895^ He is by far the strongest in character snd most intelligent member of the Subah family. He is a well read man and can converse on many more subjects than the average man of his class. He is his cousin^s only really dangerous rival. He is certainly an ambitious man, and there is little doult that he had strong h &gt;pes of succeeding his father on bis death in 1921, notwithstanding the fact that he is Shaikh Ahmad^ junior bv ten years. AVhen Shaikh Ahmad was choeen as Ruler, Shaikh Abdull.h as-Salim started to ' assist' him, and soon got a good deal of power into his own hands, which Ahmad with his easv going nature allowed him to do. He soon started issuing orders not as the Ruler's deputy, but in his own rame, and it looked very much as if he were going to become the virtual ruler of Kuwait, and Shaikh Ahmad to remain a mere figurehead— if that. After about two months, however, he overstepped the mark, by trying to introduce a sort of ' civil listwith fixed salaries for all the members of the Subah family, including Shaikh Ahmad. According to the scale which he drafted he himself was to get almost as much a&lt;? Shaikh Ahmad, and far more than any of the others. This produced a very stormy scene between Abdullah and the rest of the family, at which Shaikh Jabir as-Subah, Mubarak's brother, who has since died, did some very plain speaking,, and Shaikh Abdullah wtnt into retirement, and did not appear in public again for some time^Shaikh Abd ,11 .h as-Sallm next came into pro minence in May IQ'ZS. Ibn Sa^ud had sent* one Saiyid Hamzah al-Crhauth to Kuwait to represent him at a Conference at which it was hoped to come t) an understanding- regarding the vexed question of the Njad Customs with a view to the re-opening of trade between Najd and Kuwait. The negotiations proved entirely abortive and Saiy d Hamzah Mt Kuwait for Riyadh on the ]9th May. He was accompanied, howevi-r, by Shaikh Abdullih as-Salim as representative of Shaikh Ahmad, who had written to Ibn Sa ; ud that he saw no hope of c 'ining to an agn ement on the terms proposed by Saiyid Hamzah, so he had decided to let him return, and send a deputi- tion of his own, headed by his cnupin. Shaikh Abdullah returned to Kuwait on '27tb June, a d it became known that he had come to a private understanding with Ibn Sa'ud, by which the latter was t» recognize him as his agent in Kuwait, with whom alone he would correspond, and was to allow trac e between Nnjd and Kuwait to be re-opened in return for the whole of the customs dues on exports from Kuwait by land (other than those for Kuwait subjects or for ^Iraq), which Shaikh Abdullah was to collect and remit to him. Shaikh Abdullah at first urged iShaikh Ahmad to settle the m tter himself without consulting his people at all, but he refused to do this, and Beveral meetings were held. Shaikh Abdullah nearly succeeded in persuading the people to take up hi-; plan, and urge Shaikh Ahmad to agree to it, but some stood out firmly against it. Shaikh Ahmad, after vacillating for several days, finally wrote to Ibn Sa ud rejecting his terms. Since thee Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim has kept quiet, and spends most of his time at his house at Sha ; b, outside the town. The only other members of the Subah worth noting are Shaikh Salman al-Hamud, who is rather a distinguished looking man of fortv-six. There is nothing in him, however, and he drinks. II is father was a younger brother of Shaik ]M ubarak. Shaikh 'Hi al-Khalifah, a grandson of Sh iikh Abdullah who was Ruler from 1866 to 1892, is a fat, cheery man of forty-four, who wears ringlets like a Bedouin and lives largely in the desert. He is the chief commander of ths Kuwait forces in war, and the recognized expert on all things military. He is noted for his enormous appetite. Outside the Subah family, the people who have the most influence over the Shaik are :— Khan Bahadur Mullah Salih, his chief secre tary, who is a foxy, intrigueing little man, with plenty of bnins. Khan Sahib Abdul Latif, his Director of Cus toms. A very pleasant man of undoubted ability, but not fastidiously scrupulous. Abdul Aziz ax-Salim, his agent in Basrah, where he normally lives. This man is a born intriguer, and it is common knowledge in Kuwait that he used to work—if he does not still do so— in Shaikh Abdullah's interests against Shaikh Ahmad. •Euclc, 1 tr Serial No. 1 in file No. 438(ii)—X. of 1923. The above three individuals are actually in the Shaikh's employ. The following are influential notables :— Saiyid Ilamid Bey an-Naqib, a son of the late Naqib of Basrah and brother of the famous Saiyid Talib Pasha. He lives pirtly in Basrah and partly in Kuwait, and owns property in both places. Unlike his brother he does not go in for politics, and, despite his high birth, he does not dispise business. To him belongs the credit of m iking the motor road from Kuwait to Zubair, and of farming the Knwait-Iraq Motor Trans port Compiny. He is also the Ford agent in Kuwait. He is a well educated man, with charming manner 1 , and I an sure that what influence he has is for good. Hilal al-Mutairi is the leading pearl merchant of Kuw.it. Born and brought up in the desert with his tribe, he was fortunate at pearl diving when a young man, settled in the town, and is now by f ir the richest man in the place. He is still a Hedouin at heart : he has a very fine house, but I do not believe there is a chair in it—his reception rooms bein? furnished with rich carpets, cushions and camel-saddles alone. At the time of the recent ' revival ' when the Mutair became Ikhwan^ he wavered for some time as to whether to join the movement himself or not, and got so far as to discard his head-rope and bind his kerchi* f w T ith a turban instead (the outward emblem of the Ikhwan). He soon made up his mind, however, and went b^ck to the head-rope. Still, he is very strict, and strongly disapproves of smoking, etc. He has never lost touch with his tribe, and no Mutairi ever &lt; omes to Kuwait with out gomg to his house. He is consequently very well informed regarding the desert. He is an elderly man and his views are somewhat old fashioned, but on the whole his influence is for good. Shamlan al-Ali is the second largest pearl merchant in Kuwait, and is closely associated with Hilal al-Muiain. Like him he has great influence. He took a very strong line in opposing Shaikh Abdullah as-Salim's Customs scheme in June 1923t—in fact, but for him it is probable that Shaikh Abdullah would have got his way, and Shaikh Ahmad been forced to agree to Ibn Sard's terms. llnmad bin Abdullah as-Saqar owns the biggest bo it-building establishment in Kuwait, and has also interests in Iraq—in fact for the last year or two he has spent much more of his time there than in Kuwait. He had a very bitter hatred against the late Shaikh Salim on account of the needless wars he had inflicted upon Kuwait, and 1 think it is quite probable that he would have brought about a revolution before long if Shaikh Salim had not died when he did— he had already sounded the Political Agent as to the possibility petitioning Government to depose him. It was Ham id as-Saqar who championed the proposal that the people would not tolerate another absolute Ruler; and he was president of the Council which was elected at the beginnig of Shaikh Ahmad's rule—but which never functioned fSub-enclo. to Enclo. to Serial iNo. 7 in file No. 438(uJ— X. of 1923.Hamad al -Khalid is a dour, bntkindly, old man of old-fashioned views. During the War he started to lead the Pro-Turk party—until Shaikh Mubarak made it clear that there was to be no Pro-Turk Party in Kuwait. There is now nothing 1 anti-British about him. Shaikh. } usuf hin 'Isa is a schoolma ter and intriguer whi» is mixed up with every underhand plot in Kuwait. There are of course many others who are in a position to influence the Shaikh but the above are the most important. Two other men, not Kuwait subjects, whose characters are wonh considering are 'Abdullah an-Nafisi and Shaikh Hafidh ah bah. Abdullah an-XaJisi is Ibn Sa'ud's Agent in Kuwait. He is a pleasant and tactful man, who is liked by everyone in the place. Though Agent to the Wahhabi King, he is one of the heaviest smokers I have eeen. Shaikh {or Mull a) Hafidh W ahhah is an Egyptian who has been in Ibn Sa'ud's service for the last few years. He has the reputation of being rabidly anti-British, and is said to have been deported from ^Iraq during the War—though I do not remember his case myself—and was deported from Bahrain in 1922* Personally I think that his reputation is largely, if not entirely, unearned; and that he was really much more anti-Daly than anti-British—he certainly did dislike Major Daly, and probably said so in Bahrain. I was naturally very suspicious of him when he came here, and watched him carefully, but have never heard of him saying or doing anything in the slightest degree anti-British. He is a well educated man but does not give the impression of being in any way brilliant. Ibn Sa ud is not well off for educated men, and, with the exception of Dr. ^Abdullah Effendi Damluji, I think Shaikh Hafidh is about the best I have met. The Town of Kuwait now measures about three miles along the shore, having extended consider ably in recent years towards the east. Its greatest depth, about one mile, is near the centre of the town, where the long suburb called Mui-qab has grown out from it towards the south-east. The streets are irregular and winding, and the town is not laid out on any general plan. Most of the houses have only a ground floor, but appear higher, owing to a parapet-v\ all enclosing the roof. There are over forty mosques, of which nine are Friday congregational mosques. None of them have any architectural merit. In the year 1920 the existing Town Wall was built by the late shaikh Salim. It is a little over four miles in length, and has three gates. In addition to the gates, which are protected by toners, there is a tower about every two hundered yards throughout the length of the wall. The Inhabitants are for the most part Arabs of the 'Utub, 'Awazim, Rashaidah, Bani Khalid, Dawasir, 'Ajman, 'Anizah and Dhafir tribes, besides Arabs from Hasa, etc. There are also a large number of Persians (mostly engaged in menial pursuits) and many negroes. The Jewish community numbers about 160 souls and the Christians only a few families. India-is have » F. No. 480-X—23. never made good' in Kuwait, and are much despised. There are only three or four in the town. The Population ie believed to be somewhere in tie neighbour of 50,000. Education. There are a great number of schools of a sort in Kuwait. The Arabs conduct at lea-t fifty two; the Persians have eleven, and the Jews and Christians one ench, making a total of at Last sixty five. Of the A.ab schools twenty seven are for boys and twenty five for girls. These schoola are not under any control by the local (Jovernment. Most of the boys' schools and all the girls' schools teach nothing Tioi read . in g of the Quran ; and up to the end of 1911 no higher form of education was available in the town. At present The American Mission School gives by far the best education in Kuwait, particularly as regards English, but it only has twenty boys which is about all it can accommod ite. Ihe Mnbarakiyah School was established in 1912, about the same time as the Mission School A sum of Rs. 85,000 was collected by public subscription, of which Ks. 40,001' was used tc build a school, with many large class-rooms and verandahs r-und a courtyard, a'&gt;d the balance kept as an endowment fund. It has a Board of Trustees in charge of its affairs. Irs income is derived from the endowment and the fees for pupils, who pay Rs. 2 a month each. There is a headmaster and six assistant masters ;.r;d about 220 boys, who are graded in classes. The curri culum includes the Quran, Traditions, canon law, ethics, Arabic reading, composition and grammar, arithmetic, geography, history an 1 English. It is thus far advanced from the 'usual mulla sch(K)l, but even so it does not pretend to give more than a primary educat on. The Ahmadiyah School wis founded in the autumn of 1921 under the auspices of tbe Muslim Bene/, lent Association, wi h the ass stance ot the present Ruler, after whom it was named. It has its own Board of Trustees. Its income is deii\cd from the fees of siudente^ supplemented by annual contributions from benevolent residents, and it is therefore not on a very secure basis It has seven masters and 165 boys, and is carnculum is the same as that of the Mubarakiyah Srh tol, but it is planned to make it into a secondary school when—or if—they can o-et qualified masters at the salaries which they can afford to pay. The Orphanage School for orphans and other poor boys is supported entirely by one family of wealthy pe^rl merchants. It has six masters and about 130 boys, and teaehes the usual Quranic branches, with history and arithmetic in addition. 1 here are c ght other schools for Arab boys whn-h teach a little arithmetic, in addition' to the reading of the Quran. I ei si in Schools which teach writing and arithmetic, in addition to the reading of the Quran, are three in number; while there are eight others which teach the last subject only. Agriculture. —In Kuwait and its environs is practically nil. There are no date plantations of any value, hardly any fields and not many kitchen gardens. The villages to the south-east ofKuwait, supply a llmiled but increasing quantity T-f vegetables and melons. The chief agiicnltural Centre in the principality is Jahrah, where wheat, barley and lucern are grown, as veil as vegetables, a -tl where there are some 2 500 «late palms. The agriculture of J hrah might be considerably increased if m re money were sunk in it. The tiext most important agricultural centre is the i'land of I'ailakali, where wheat and barley are grown with some success on the clayey patches, also vegetables, and particularly carrots, which are of quite exceptionally fine qu-ili y The Sea Fis/zerit*.- Of Kuwait are its only truly local p oduce; these are a valuable asset, i esides float-und-vv eight nets and lines, traps made of ree t hurdler are also used the Hsh enter them at the flowing tide and are left behind at the ebb. The majority of the fish caught is con sumed locally but a sm 11 ] roportion is dried and exported to 1'asrah and e'sevvhert'. The fisher men of Kuwait are mostly Arabs of the ' Awazim tribe, but there are also otht r Arabs and a few Persians. The boats used are practically all SAuais, the excepti- us being Jaliiauts. A few of the primative hv.' airiyaht, ox boats made of date branches are still used. Pearl Fuhing is the most important trade &lt;1 Kuwait. The town possesses over seven hundred pearl boats, but many of these have not been at sea for years, as owing to the increased demand for 1 bour elsewhere, it is impossible to find crews for them. The average number of boats from Kuwait which now visit the banks is not more than about 330, and this year it was very much smaller. The Kuwait Pearling Fleet consists of two pirts : the f mall boats which fish off the Neutral Zone, Sudahand Huzum; while the large boats go farther afield. The 1927 season w&lt;s better than has been for three or four y ar, and the pearl market, which Las been bad for some time is also better. Kuwait owes its mercantile imporiance to its p; ailing and carrying fleets, and to its trade with India, and with 'Iraq and Persia especially a lucrative smuggling trade. Also in normal &gt;ears with the Interior of Arabia, par ticularly Q isim, for which it is the natuial port. Since the beginning of 1922, however, this trade has been closed by Ibn Sa'ud, who has prohibited his subj cts from trading with Kuwait at all. Mis re ison for this action is that he says he is unable he collect his Customs dues on goods im ported from Kuwait in the dese t, and that he wants to establish a Najd Customs House in * UW .T , i 0wn ' a 0 arrangement which the onaikh of Kuwait has naturally never seen his way to accept. Other suggestions have been made to get over the difficulty : for example that import duty into Najd should be abolished, and that the Shaikh of Kuwait should levy export duty instead and pay Ibn Sa'ud a fixed'sum, but up to thp present it has not been possible to come to any agrepment This stoppage of trade between Najd and Kuwaitis a most serious matter for Kuwait-as also for Qasim and Mail—and the prosperity of the town has been declining ever since. The people of Kuwait are nearly all of Najd origin, and not a few of the Kuwait merchants had partners in Buraidah and IJnaizah, and even mw the affairs of Najd interest them much more than those of 'Iraq li/i Sa'ud. —The great Wahhabi Ruler Faisal bin Turki as-Sa'ud who died in 1866 left his throne to his eldest son, 'Abdullah. The latter's brother Sa ud, however, rebelled against him and occupied Riyadh. 'Abdullah fled to H^il, and invoked the assistance of Ibn Rashid, who was then the most powerful man in Arabia. Sa'ud was defeated and killed, but 'Adullah soon realized that lie had gained little, as Ibn Rashid annexed the Wahhabi country, and 'Abdullah was kept a prisoner in Hail until he died. Meanwhile the remnants of the Sa'ud, who would not submit to a foreign yoke, had gone into exile, some to ihe Hijaz, and others, including Faisal's fourth son 'Abdur Rahman, to Kuwait. Enoouraged and helped by Shaik Mubarak, another bitter enemy of Ibn Rashid, Abdur Rahman undertook the task of freeing his land from the foreigner. An attempt in 1900, failed, but in the spring of I'.Mtl 'Abdul Aziz bin 'Abdur Rahman al-Faisal as-Sa.'ud, the pretent ' Ibn Sa'ud actino- for his father, left Kuwait with a picked follow ing of two hundred m&lt; n. When he arti\ed near Riyadh, he baited his party and went on at dusk with Hfiecn men alone They m de their way unnoticed to the house of Ibn Rashid's governor, into which they fotced an entry and placed evtry-one in it under arrest in one room. They learned that the governor, as alwavs had gone to the fort to pass the night for greater security. They accordingly waited in the house till he returned in the moring sur rounded by this badyguard. As the cortege approached the dcor, the sixteen rushed out sword in hand, and, after a brief struggle 'Abdul 'Aziz f und himself master of Riyadh. The following years wire spent in recovering pro vince after province from the dominion of the foreigner. In the spring of 1913'Abdul 'Aziz, in whose favour his father had abdicated, swooped upon Hasa and turned the Turks out of the province lock, stock and barrel. Such was the state of affairs at the outbreak of the War—which affected Arabia 1-ss then most parts of the world. When Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait renounced fealty to the Turk he really changed nothing. When Ibn Rashid marched against Ibn Sa'ud at the close of 1914, although nominally he did so on behalf of the Turks, it was really only another hand in the old match between the rival principalities of Riyadh and Hail. The rival forces met at Majma ah, 120 miles north-west or Riyadh and fought an indecisive battle, in which Captain Shakespeare who was with Ibn Sa'ud was killed. It was not till the beginning of November 19*21 however, that the long struggle was finallv brought to a close by the final surrender of Hail to Ibn Sa'ud. This brought not only the Jabal Shammar, but Jauf and all the surrounding country to the borders of Syria, under his sway. Ibn Sa'ud's next campaign against the Hi'iaz started m the summer of l9?4, the result of a quarrel which had long been simmerino 1 Ev end of 1925 he had captured the Hijaz and expelled the Ilashimite dynasty. Thus in twenty- five years did this extraordinary man raise himself from an exile in Kuwait to be King of the Hiiaz and of Najd and its Dependencies. Ibn Sa'ud is now a man ol about fifty years of age. He is at least 6 feet 3 in. in height, and of very d.gnified and handsome appearance, ie possesses an extraordinary charm of ^ /v/^imanner such as I h ive rarely seen in any man of any race. 'Abdulloh bin Jdnwi. Ibn Sa'ud's cousin, is certainly the second most importai't man of the Sa^ud family. He was one of the fHithful l&gt;/ind who aocompanifd Ibn Sa^ud on the desperate venture which vectored the tbione of Riyadh to his family, and has ever since enjoyed and merited his nnboun led confidence. He was app 'inted Governor of Qa.i n on the reconquest of that province from Ibn R shid, nud in 1914 was order ed to Hasa to ceate order out of t!ie confusion left by the Turks, wliich he soo'» did. In fa&lt; t before long he had made himself '.ndisp nsil'li there - but for which fact, he would mmh prefer to lead a quiet life at home, as he is said to be absolutely un'mbitious. Several years oldei' than Ibn Sd/ud, he is said to be a man of medium height and medium build, somewhat morose in appearance. He has eirned an extraordinary reputation for justice. Ikhicdn, or ( Brethren is the name assumed by the fanatical Wahhabi converts after the recent revival. It is not quiie certain when this ' re vival ' first started, but the term ' Ikhwan ' first came into general use about the beginning of the War. It was then that Ibn Sa^ud decided to turn his attention to it as a me ms of strengthening and consolidating his power. The story g'es that Ibn Jiluwi warned him against it and said ' thev would certainlv make a useful weapon, but I fear that they may 'be like an automatic pistol which certainly fires fast, but with which there is a danger that when you put it in your belt^ it may go off and wound you '. To this Ibn Sa ud is said to have replied : ' Don't be flightened of that, when I've done with my pistol, I'll unload it and throw the cartridges on the ground He did realise however that it was vital to get the members of the new cult under cmtrol. In IVlti he issued his famous order that a l Bedouins of Najd must join the mov- ment. This led to much fighting, but by 1918 he had forced all except; the' A]man to dp so, and to recognize him as their Imam. In order to keep these tribes under his control, he induced his religious leaders to issue a fatwah that the Ikhwan should build themselves villages and till the soil, this be'ng incumbent on them from a religious point of view. The order seems to have be^n responded to with enthusiasm in most cases. The progress of the movement was m st cleverly managed, and Ibn Sa'ud showed greit genius in working out the scheme without estranging the people. He him self selected the site for each Ikhwan villags. With a tribe which was no^ of itself keen to join the movement his method seems to have been to send for the Shaikh and tell him in blunt terms that his tribe had no religion. He would then order the Shaikh to attend a course of instruction at a school of Religion. At the same time half a dozen selected instructors, attended by some genuine fanatic like Faisal ad-Dawish, would be sent off to the tribe. These woald hold daily clashes, and it rarely took them long to rouse the dormant fanaticism inherent in simple and savage people. These teachers insisted on all converts wearing a white turban over the kerchief in place of the head-rope (Ibn Sa'ud has since decreed that this is not necessary, and he himself always wears the head -rope'. The stri&lt; test puritanism is the key -note of their religion, and the use of tobacco is regarded by them as d. adly a sin as the drink ing of alcohol. They themselves a e all Brethren, but like all new converts to any religion they are very intolerant. They will m t even salute, or return the salute of, anyone outside thcr own sect, or even allow that he is a Muslim. 1 re member Sh ikh S.ilim having one Hogged f r swaggering up to a shop-keeper in Kuwait and saying as lie pointed to some of his wares ' ' Ala cham, yd ch&amp;fir ? How much is it, infidel ?). Of the tribes most closely associated with Kuwait the most important are :— The Mutatr, a large tribe, said to be of Hijaz origin, and closely akin to the Harb and the 'Utaibah. Un :il they became Ikhwan the Mutair w re one of the most typi al Bedouin tribes of Central Arabia, with a range from near Kuwait town in the north, westward to the I iatin, to Qasim and the northern part of Hasa in the south. Since their'' conversion ' however, the major ty of them have'settled, notably at Artawiyah(250 miles south, south -west of Kuwait, and 150 miles north, north west of Riyadh), which is one of the most famous Ikhwan villages in Arabia, and the seat of the most powerful Shaikh of the tribe, the fanatical Faisal ad-Dawish. Another of their villages is Jaryah (125 miles south of Kuw iit) the seat of Ibn Shuqair, the building of which in 19iO was one of the causes of the quarrel between Ibn Sa'ud and Shaikh Sal m. The original sections of the Mutair are only two, the 'Jlwah and the Buraih. But to these have been added in recent times, probably by a fission from the Buiaih, a third section, the Bani 'Abdallah. During the struggle for supranacy at the beginning of the century the Bani 'Abdallah sided with Ibn Rashid while the major ity of the tribe were partisans of Ibn Sa ud. After the defeat of Ibu Rashid they rejoined the main body of the Mutair, but the rect nciliation was only temporary, and they have separated themselves atjain, and left the tribe for thi country between Najd and Mecca. The 'Hwah consist of two sub-sections, the Muwahah, which is Faisal a l-Dawish's own sub section, and of which the other chief Shaikhs are J uf ran al-Fuqm, Haif al-Fuqm and Ibn Ghunaiman and the Jiblan, of which the chief sh ikhs are Faisal bin Shiblan and Saihud bin Lami. The Burnh are composed of three main sub sections, the Aulad Ali, the Aulad Wasil and the ^ Birzan, all of which are under the leadership of Ibn Musaiyis of the Aulad Wasil. To the Birzan be'on? the notorious family of Abu Shuwairibat, the members of which caused so much trouble to the peace of the frontier a few years ago. The Mutair have suffered heavily in the recent wars, particularly at the battle of Jahrih in October 1920, and in the fighting outside Hail in September 1921, and it is probable that the total strength ot the tribe does not now exceed 9,(i00 souls. Faisal ad-Dawish's authority as paramount Shaikh of the Mutair has Leen much consolidated by the change of religion. The tribe, as is also the case with other Ikhwan tribes, is not now w^ell armed.1 ' - 7 The 'Ajmun, usually pronounced ^Aiman—the sing-ular of which is 'Ajmi (Aimi)—are one of the most imp'Ttant tribes of EaStfrn Arabia. Their proper summer range is the Gulf lovvlandis from laff to ''Uqair ( Ujair) enveloping the Hasa oasis on the north and east. Inland their count- a'y stretches back ov^-r thp Summan, and in winter as f r «s Sudair. On the littoral they have sometimes straggled into Qatar, and fre- quentlv to, and beyond, Kuwait town. Some settled 'Ajman, detached fr 'tn the tribe, have for many years be n found in Kuwait town, and in the coastal villages to the south of it. The tribe is a strong one, althnngh their claim to be able to turn out over 10,000 fighting men, including 2,U0U horsemen, is probably exaggerated ; yet there is little doubt that they number over 30,000 souls. In politics they have always been a shift ing a: d inc-nstant factor. During the Ottoman occupation of Hasi and Qitif they were constant ly recalcitrant. Tin y welcomed Ihn Sa ud when he invaded Hasa in 1913, init, once he was establ^hed, liked him and his taxes no better than the Turks. In 1915 he organized a cam paign against them but was defeated in an abortive night attack, and his own brother, Sa'd, was ki led. Later on, with the assistance of a Knw.iit force under Shaikh Salim, he hemmed them in near the Q:it f coast. After being besieged for s'me time the 'Ajman surrendered to Shaikh Salim, who sent them to Kuwait, where Shaikh Mubarak accepted them, aginst Ibn Sa'ud's wishes, who wished to further avenge his brother's death. Soon after this Shaikh Mubarak died, and Shaikh Jabir, in ordor to placate Ibn Sa'ud, ejected the^Ajman from Kuwait territory. After making overtures first to 'Ujaimi as-Sadun and then to Ibn Rashid, thev obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle quietly at fSafwan. On the occasion of Ibn Sa'ud's visit to Kuwait and Basrah in November 1916 a truce was arranged between him and the 'Ajman. In the middle of 1917 however Ihn Sa'ud induced the Awazim to leave Kuwait terit ry and settle in Najd. Shaikh Salim, who was then Ruler, retali ated by seducing the 'Ajman, who moved en ma8*e into Kuwait territory Eventually after much corresp ndence, Ibn Sa'ud agreed to restore the Awazim if Shaikh Salim would turn out the 'Ajman and cut off his relations with the Shammar. The Awazim were returned, but the 'Ajman remained in Kuwait territ-ry. By the beginning of 1''18 the question had become such a burning one that it was decided to take the tribe under British protection, and they were settled to the north of Zubair. Here they were guilty of so much raid ing that Ibn Sa'ud way eventually told that, so far as the British were concerned, there was no objection to his taking action against them. About a year later the 'Ajman again acknowledged their allegiance to Ibn Sa'ud and returned to Najd. Since then they have become Ikhwan. The paramount chieftainship of the Ajman is in the Hithlain family of the Naji'ah sub-section of the Mai'dh section of the tribe, the present holder being Dhaidan al-Hithlain. His head quarters is at Sarar (165 miles south of Kuwait). The chief sections of the tribe are the Arjah under Saikh Maui bin' Jum'ah; the Dha'in, under Shaikh Fahad bin Sa'd; the Hadi, under Shaikh Nahar al-Mutalaqqim (recently in 'Iraq) ; the Hajraf, the Hajjan, the Hamad bin Rashid and • the Hithlain, all under Nahar al Mufalaqqim ; the Khuwaitirj the Mahfudh, under Mabkhut al- Muqrad ; the Maidh, the Miflih, the Misra, the Rushaid and the Snlaifi, under Dhaidan al- Hithla n himself; the Shamir under Sultan bin Hithalain; the Shawawilah, under Fahad bin Hithlain ; the Sifran, under Mansur bin Shafi al-Munaikh; the Sulaiman, under Muhammad bin Musf.mi; and the Suraih. The Awazim (singular Azimi) are a Bedonin tribe of the country to the south of Kuwait. About 250 non-nomadic fam li's of the tribe are settled in Kuwait town, where one of the quarters is c-dled after them ; others possess the village of Dimnah to the west of Ras al-Ardh ; and a few more live on Maskhan island, or Mascban as it is always called. The tribe ha^ no connection with another tribe of Awazim or Hawazim found in Central Arabia, especially near Jauf. These Awazim, who claim to be of Harb origin, appa rently first made their appearance in the neigh bourhood of Kawait daring the early part of the 19th Century. They are divided into two main sections, the Kuah and the Ghiyadh, of which the former takes precedence. Their paramount shaikh is Habib bin Jami of the Hadalin sub section of the Kuah. The tribe numbers aboirt 4,000 souls. They are pastoral nomads, fishermen and pearl divers. They are large breeders of camels sheep and goats, also a fair number of donkeys, but few horses. In Kuwait town the fishing trade is mostly in their hands. The Awazim are recognised as an inferior tribe and intermarry only amongst themselves and with the Rashaidah. For many years the Awazim were the loyal subjects of Kuwait, and from a military point of view formed the backbone of Ibn Subahs state. During the rule of Sha'kh Salim the ques tion of their tribute was one of the chief causes of his quarrel with Dm Sa'ud. The nomads of the tribe have now become Ikhw'an, and have natu rally oriented themselves towards Ibn Sa'ud. The Rashaid h (singular Rashidi) are an inferior tribe of Kuwait and the territory to the south of it. They number about 4,000 souls and are ssid to be of Hutaim extraction; those in Kuwait town, who are largely of th^ Hirshan seciion, are not unfrequently called Hutaim —a term which is also applied to the Saluba, those despised tinker outcasts who are found all over Arabia. A few years ago the majority of the nomadic Rashaidah beoame Ikhwan. The chief shaikhs of the tribe at present are Mutlaq al- Musailim (whom I last heard of in Laq) and Asi al-Musailim (who is with the Ikhwan). There are seventeen sections to the tribe, but no useful purpose is served by enumerating them. The Bhafir is an Iraq tribe of Bedouins whose winter habitation is the country to the south of the railway line between Zubair and Nasiriyah. In the summer they are mostly on the Urum al-Afur island, opposite Samawah. They have for some time been flirting with Ikhwanism. The Muntafik.—Ox 'Muntafiq' as the name is officially spelt in English in 'Ii^q, though I have never hear J it pronounced that way, or spelt that way in Arabic—are a very large ' Iraq tribe, of which a portion are still Bedouin. e are only concerned with them here in that, amongst other places, they are found in the western desert8 on the tight bank of the Euphrates—chiefly between Nasinyah and Samawah, The Shammar. —Who used to be of such vita^ importance in the politics of Central and Eastern Arabia, have more or less f 'ded out of the picture. Formerly the Southern Shamraar were not only a powerful nomad tribe, but also masters of the oasis of Jabal Shammar. Their paramount Shaikh, Ibn Rashid, was not only chief of his own tribe, but wa' also ruler of a settled princi pality, of wliich Hail was the capital. Since the fall of Hail in 1921, however, they have fallen from their high tstate, and have largely joined the Northern section of the tribe. Recent events in the Desert. —In 1923 a tendency began to be noticeable amongst Najd tribes to take refuge in 'Iraq fr.-m the exactions of Ibn Sa'ud. These even included some families from the most rabidly Ikhwan tribes like the 'Mutair—notably the Bivfihin, a sect of the Auldd Wasil sub-section Buraih section of that tribe. These refugees soon started raiding into Najd, at the direct instigation of King Faisal according to the popular belief in Najd, and made the state of the country more disturbed than it had been for years. The Kuwait Conference between Najd and 'Ir&amp;j and Trans-Jordania was watched with intense interest to see whether ■'Iraq would agree to Ibn Sa'uddemand that such refugees tribes should be compelled to return. Big raids into, and from, Najd continued to take place in rapid succession until May 1925 when, under orders from the 'Ir^q Government, these seceders from the Ikhwan tribes of Najd, who had taken refuge in 'Iraq and had disturbed the peace of the frontier for so long, started to move towards the Northern Jazirah. By the end of June; 1925 the country was free from them, and an immediate improvement in tbe state of the country followed. A long spell of quiet and more or less immunity from raids followed—doubtless due in part to the fact that the Ikhwan tribes were otherwise engaged, the Hijaz campa'gn being then in progress. S^on after the fall of Jiddah at the end of 1925 many of the Ikhwan leaders returned to Najd. Some were bitterly disappointed th tt the Hijaz campaign had m t offered better facilities for amassing plunder. Notable amongst these was Faisal ad-Ddwish, No sooner Lad he arrived at Artawi^ah than he summoned his followers to prepare for a big raid against 'Iraq. Before he bad time to set out, however, be received definite orders fro:n Ibn Sa'ud forbidding him to proceed, and reluctantly disbanded his men. In April he visited Sultan bin Humaid, paramount shaikh of the 'Utaibah, at Ghatghat. From there an invitation was sent to Dhaidan al-Hithlain of I he 'Ajman, who joined them shortly afterwards. They then apparently took an oath binding them- selv^s together for mutual support in the event of Ibn Sa'ud wishing to take punitive action against any of them. There continued to be much talk about the strained relations between Ibn Sa'ud and the leaders of the Ikhwan, par ticularly the three mentioned above, who were much dissatisfied with Ibn Sa'ud's idea of organiz ing a civilized government in the Hijaz, and his prohibiting them from raiding across the frontier. They argued that if as they maintained, the people of 'Iraq, Kuwait, etc., were not tine Muslims, they ought to be allowed to fiirht against them j if, on the other hand, Ibn Sa'ud prohibited this, saying that they were not enemies, he had no right to prevent them from trading with them—as he did in the case of Kuwait. In the summer of 1927 a plot to murder Ibu Sa U'l's son, Sa'ud, in Riyadh, and bis cousin Ibn Jiluwi at Hasa, at the same time, was dis covered and frustrated only just in time. In the early part of 1927, on the Persian Government refusing permission for tbe Imperial Airways to establish a service to India along the south coast of Persia, the suggestion was made that the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf might be followed instead, and Ibn Sa'ud was approached with a view to obtaining his permission for the route over his territory to be used. As was to be expected, the very idea of such a thing was anathema to the Ikhwan, and Ibn Sa'ud on the very strong advice of Ibn Jiluwi said that he could not agree. Next came the building of a Police Post at Baswah * or Busaiyah, as we usua'ly call it. The Ikhwan apparently connect it in their minds with the Air Route scheme, and think that it is destined to become an enormous petrol dump—hence their determination to destroy it. The Air Route scheme and Busai yah Post between them certainly seem to be the immediate causes, or, perhaps it would be better to say, the immediate excuses, of Faisal ad- Dawish and his Mutair getting out of hand, and going raiding in defiance of Ibn Sa'ud s orders. The real reason is that they, like all Bedouins, are parasites whi'do not earn their living in the world, and must be paid, or raid. The actual attack on Busaiyah Post, the raid on the Kuwait 'Uraibdar, or local Bedouin, et,*. are too recent to require re apitul ting. At present the situation seems to be that Faisal ad-Dawish, as stated above, is acting in open defiance of Tbn Sa'ud. The 'Ajman and other tribes are quiet at present, but are not a very reliable weapon in Ibn Sa'ud's hands. Ibn Sa'ud is C' rtainly in a very awkward position ; hp is obviously having very strong pressure brought to bear on him, ms it is hard to th'nk that a man of his acumen can really think all that he has been writing- in bis recent letters of protest. It remains to be seen whether hp will be able to bring Dawish to heel and re-establish his authority, or nnt. Personally I think he will do so through the Ulama, whom he has summoned to Riyadh. He has a very persuasive tongue, and they have great influence with the tribes, if he can make them see reason. Meanwhile, as far as Kuwait is concerned, the people are still in a state of nervous tension. The town wall has been repaired, and is manned every night. The village of Jabrah is also strongly held with a force of over three hundred men, including a body of specially engaged mercenaries, but not counting the Bedouin camped in the vicinity. Many alarmist rumours are current, and accurate news is at a discount. * File No. 476-N. 890 F&amp;PD.(13) the Neutral Zone, Sudah and Huzum; while the larger boats go further afield# The 1927 season was better than has been for three or four years, and the pearl market, which has been bad for some time is also better. | Shipping- There are at present nearly 250 boats sailing under the Kuwait flag engaged in the carrying and coasting trad®, as distinct from pearling and fishing boats. Of these sixty fcave a carrying capacity of over 100 tons, including eight of over 300 tons, and twenty of over ^&gt;0 tons* The carrying trade is chiefly confined to India, but Kuwait vessels also sometimes visit Zanzibar, Aden, Jibuti, the Red Sea ports, etc. Long voyages are only made during the winter months. During the summer, when the monsoon would render it dangerous for them to leave the Persian Calf, the large cargo vessels are laid up in ^uwalt, either in the various niq'ahS s or tidal harbours, or at Bandar ash -Shuwaikh to the west of the town. The smaller vessels are employed in the coasting trade withi^ the Persian Gulf, the smallest plying almost exclusively between Kuwait and the Shatt a 1 Arab. Forty boats are employed constantly in bringing water from there to the town. On an average four such boats arrive daily and bring 27,200 gallons of water. Kuwait is famed for Boat Building , and quite the best boats in the Gulf are built there. A considerable change has been introduced in Kuwait in the types of boats built in the last years. Formerly the largest sea-going vessels were all of the /f\jL ^ J(14) Ba^halah type, while the Bum type was confined to medium sized and small vessels. Now, however, the largest boats built in Kuwait are all without exception bums.It is claimed Bum. for the bum that it hac better car^o space than the baphalah and that, with its pointed stern^it is a better sea boat, particularly in a following sea. Two Indian built boats, sIbxk known in Arabic as the Kut tyah and the Danfiiyah^ very closely resemble tbe ba'^ialah and the bum respectively# The kdttyah , which is fairly common in Kuwait, is in all km *? respects similar to the bat-.halah , excepting that the stem- head has a peculiar device, rather Hie a bird's head with the beak pointing back, instead of the baRhalah 1 s plaii knob The dan^yah, which is not so common, is exactly like e bum except for its stem-head, which is more like that of a shu'ai . The sea-going balam from the Shatt al-'Arab also resembles a small bum , except that its stem-head is cut off short, and it usually looks badly, built and badly ri^ged^ The J^libaut and the Mashuwali are practically the same, and are so well known that they need not be described.Of other boats used the Sambuk is pre-eminently the pearling boat of Kuwait. In fact it is rarely used for other purposes, though eight are employed in the local carrying trade.Its squara stern is said to make It more suitable for the frequent turning that Is required at the pearl banks than Is a boat of the bum type, which Is hardly ever seen there t . except as a dealer^ boat* Sambulc, Very similar to the above is the Shu 1 al , except that it is usually saaller. The only real difference, however,Is in the stem-head, as can be seen below. Shu T al, The shu*ai is a very common boat in Kuwait. It is used for fishing, for pearl diving, and four or five of them are used in the local carrying trade.■ A. very peculiar type of boat, now rarely seen at Kuwait is Batfl. the 3atf1 . Actually the only one in use Is that of the 'co^lInodore ,, of the Pearling Fleet. It is said to be a very fast type of boat, and was rather popular amongst pirates I Its peculiar fiddle headed bow and high stern board carved jf with a peculiar device,which is always the same, make it jj conspicuous from amongst all other types of. craft. Somewhat | similar is the Bagarah , except that in place of the fiddlo head it has a very sharp pointed clipper bow. There is not a single b agarah in Kuwait itself, and only one in Failakah, | No other types deserve mention* Kuwait owes its mercantile importance to its peari« itb Traded ing and carrying fleets, and to its trade India, and with I A f Ir^q and Persia - especially a lucrative smuggling trade. Also in normal yfea^s with the Interior of Arabia, particu larly Qasfm, for which it is the natural port. Since the beginning of 1922, however, this trade has been closed by Ibn Sa'dd, who has prohibited his subjects from trading * with Kuwait at all. His reason for this action is that he says he is unable to collect his Oustoms dues on goods imported from Kuwait in the desert, and that he wants to establish a Najd Oustoms House in Kuwait Town,an arrang«Tien\v _ '/ / r • \ ' yf I J CONFIDENTIAL. ■ D.O, No.2Ji9-S. %-} n r\ 1 /Te&lt;, 3 Z&gt;« r //79 JLY-fZ-Af: POLITICAL ACEWCY, KUWAIT, PERSIAN GULF. g 'ONHUrj , .1 ilo i.ud. ri21at December \927, S&gt;t*K thttm u, You may remember that when you were returning Shaikh Alimad'a call on your recent visit here, the subject of drilling for water came up in conversation. I mentioned that Mr. Armstrong had told rae that very day that he had reached a certain depth, and the Shaikh was surprised at what I said, as he had been told a different depth. You will have seen from my last Diary that 'drilling operations have had to be stopped temporarily,pending the receipt of a further supply of piping from ^n^land'. 14a J or Holmes came here last Just before I went on leave, and I was surprised when I ^ot back to find that, although drilling operations had been in progress since the first fortnight in l!ay, there was nothing on my files on the subject subsequent to the Agreement signed on 1j5th April 1926, of which I sent an advance copy to the Hesi- - dency with my memorandum No.392 of 8th March 1926,although this Agreement required a slight modification in view of Clause (3). I understand, however, that this is what is supposed to be being worked on # By it the Syndicate has to sink a well - or rather two wells - to a depth of 7C0 feet, unless sweet water is found at a lesser depth, and to go beyond that depth if required^ut only on receiving an extra RsoO/- a foot for any depth over 700 feet. The Shaikh has given up all hope of water row, and certainly would not pay extra for boring beyond 700 feet. According to Mr. Armstrong, they have now drilled 'about 500 feetf I learn from another source however that he has already used up at l^ast 350 feet of piping, and probably more. I asked him how much he was expecting out from Home now, and he said about 700 feet. I asked him what he wanted so much for as he had already done ^00,and according to the Agreement only had to do 700 - There'is now no talk of a second well He replied that this was a smaller bore of piping, which he would put down inside the the existing piping right to the top, and then he hoped to pull up the e xisting piping . I pretended to believe this, but I most certainly do not. ^he Hon'ble Lieut. Colonel L. B, H. Haworth, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushira0 POLITICAL AGENCY. KUWA IT, PERSIAN GULF. Mr, Armstrong also said that the Syndicate would not haggle over digfiins an extra hundred feet or so, If they thought the chances of getting water were good, as it would only take a day or two to do so. Yet I gathered from what Jacks of the A»P»C,C# t.old me at the time the Agreement was maae, that it could not pay anyone to sink wells at the price at which the Eastern and General Syndicate has under taken to do it here.

The Geographioal Society are producing a map of Northern Arabia to show Captain LeacJhman's routes for his last journey from Damascus to xiiadh. I am assisting in the compilation and we have been working at it for some months; and I think .ve have O ot most of the aviilable information. IVe have used Hunter's Liap published in Simla which gives a good deal of information round Riadh, in Sedeir, Haaa, /Jiarj Harik and other places not contained in other maps which has no doubt been obtained by you. Palgrave would seem to have placed Harik too far to the iiast but his geographical war* was not particularly accurate. There is I believe some recent traveller, a missionary with a German name who has penetrated to Hiadh and other parts of Najd within the last few years, but we are unable to get hold of any of his maps or an account of his journey. Perhaps you have a copy of his map which you might kindly allow us to make use of. .Ye have obtained a detailed map of daum-ier ♦ s Danish Expedition of 1911 of which I can let you have a copy should you care to nave it.

He has applied for furloup-h as you know from January and is to be relieved by Colonel Grey. 1!© has for a lonp: time past been preparing himnelf for, and building up hopes of undertaking such a Journey, and it will be a sad disappointment to him, which I shall share, if, owinn: to the political situation at the moment,It cannot take shape. Of course, once he becomes disa&gt; sociated from Kuwait and from hie favourable po ition of lively inti macy with the elements likelv to help him, he loses a can rreat factor toward:: success, which he/rrobably ksbhs never regain, at any 3ii? rate for some years to come. I had honed that my meeting with Bin Gaud mitrht come off, and that a satisfactory solution of his case vis a vis the Turks as well as ourselves might result such ao would create a favourable atmosphere for his project, and make It possible for me to put it forward officially before I left with a good chance of its receivinp; the negative if not even the active approval of Kis Majesty's Government, but as things are I shall bo srne before the result of our interview or that of the Turks 1 nenrotiations with Bin i^aud is known.

Although it is sometimes unavoidable, yet it is very disappointing and disheartening to those who bear the local burden that when we rarnot ultimately prevent foreigners such as Herr Raunkeier, Herr Burkhardt, recently, and Dr Harrison of the marican Mission now, from explorinp- Central Arabia, t^a-t we should have to discourage our own officers, especially when, as in the present case, we havo ona who is exceptionally well qualified not merely for carrying out a successful joumay but also for d6ins valuable r^OFraphical and intelligence work for Grovem- ment.

Your letter of 17th October to Sir Percy Cox seems to have remained unanswered till now, I think he was consulting Shakespear (lately Political Agent at Kuwait) about routes etc in Najd, and probably before he had got the information he wanted, his leave was granted and I took his place. He is now at home in London (c/o Grindlay &amp; Coy, Parliament Street) and you will easily get into touch with him if you are not so already. I had not heard of any missionary with a German name at Riyadh, and my office have not any maps or reports by such a person. Did I write to you or not before leaving Baghdad? I know I meant to. Prom what you said at the end of your last letter to me I gather you will be rather amused at what has happened in Luristan. Lieut-Colonel F.R.

With reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 131 E.-A., dated 20th January 1911, I have the honour to forward, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the letter, noted in the No. c.—8, dated the 17th February 19U. maroriii, which has been received from the Political Agent at Kuwait, in regard to the gift to the Dutch Reformed Church Mission by Shaikh Sir Mubarak-us- Subah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., of a small additional plot of land. No. C.—8, dated the 17th February 1914, From— Lieutenant-Colonel W. G. Grey , Political Agent, Kuwait, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence terminating with your office endorsement No. 320, dated 7th February 1911, on the subject of the acquisition of land by the Dutch Reformed Church Mission in Kuwait. 2. Some days ago the Shaikh informed me that a difficulty had arisen regarding the exact limits of the site in question, and suggested going with me to the spot to test the measurements that had been made. We accordingly went on the 9th instant and after carefully testing the measurements in company with the missionaries found that they were correct according to the agreement. Sir Mubarak then made a short speech stating that it was only with the consent of the British Government that he was able to dispose of land • to foreigners, but that as they had no objection in this case he had pleasure in presenting to the Mission free of charge a further portion of land 30 Dhiras by 200 in extent. This brings the total area of the plot to 200 Dhiras square. 3. The incident is not of any particular political importance, but I report it for the information of the Government of India as it relates to the acquisi tion of Kuwait land by foreigners and to the manner in which the Shaikh regards his undertaking with Government in that connection. \ fOMign k PoHtb*!

With reference to para 25 of Kuwait News for the week ending 4th February 1914,Shaikh-Mubarak has indefi nitely postponed his visit to Muhammareh as it is stated that his intimate relations with Shaikh Khazfal of Muham- mareh have become clouded by two recent events. These are,firstly,that an altercation took place in the Shatt- al-Arab near Zein over the question of meat supply between Saiyid bin Muhammad as-Subah, Sir Mubarak's brother,and Muhammad bin Chinan,the brother-in-law of Shaikh Khazal, in the course of which the former was grossly abused,and secondly,that one of Sir Mubarak's servants at Fao has been unlawfully punished and his property forcibly taken possession of by some 40 men from Muhammareh acting under orders from Shaikh Khaz'al.A copy of a letter dated the 10th March 1914 at Camp XXYIII at Riadh, from Oaptaln W .H.I. Bhakespear, to the Political Resident Bushire. 1 '■ Please observe the address above1 I got here yesterday with my cameis nearly done out owing to want of grazing as the whole of my route was through country which had had no rain before I reached it. My trip so far has been full of interest geographically. From Kuwait to Rigai, thence along the whole course of the Batin until Ajibba (not in map/ but) on the Buraidah road. I ahall be able to tell you all about the Wadi ar-Rumakfc connection with the Batin now - then south and east to Zilfi. So far this route has not been travelled before. From Zilfi to llajma'a along an untravelled route, fron Majma'a the ordinary route through the gadair villages to Hasi thence unexplored via Baubem to Riadh, where I camped by the Shaikh's gardens to the north of the town. I am having a sort of Royal Duke's progress and if the present state of affairs continues I shall soon be able to set up as a Be ouin Chief on my own with quite a respectable flock of sheepl The Bin Sa'ud are overwhelming in their kindness, fore thought and friendliness. I had not been camped an hour befor&lt; two huge buck-niggers stationed as police to drive off inqui- sitive small boys etc; loads of firewood, green stuff for camels, sheep, rice etc for the men all xfcixx arrived in about another hour with a mare for me to ride. After a wash and change I rode in in the moonlight into the town by the big East Gate and got as warm a welcome from 'Abdul Aziz and his brothers as I could possibly have wished. This morning I was taken to call on Bin Sa'ud's father, the Inam 'Abdur Rahman whoml found a delightfully courteous and friendly old was gentleman, arther a surprise as he/supposed to be a very austere and severe type of Archbishop. It Is bad luck but I can't attempt anything further south andand shall go north again by the Dariyah Tharmidah, Shaqra, Wadl-ao-Sirr, road to Anaizah and Buraldah; most of the road through Washm is unexplored I believe. Why I can't go south is (a) my camels are so done out that days they must have 4 or 6/complete rest with high feeding and thnn only short marches until I can either change them in Qasim or strike good grazing there, (b) Bin Sa'ud has called out all his southern raiding contingents (c) Bin Sa'ud himself is leaving on the 12th March to join the whole o-' his forces in the desert east and north, somewhere in the Bahana near Judah, and (d) the desert south In Hautah and Aflaj has had no rain and is as bare as one's hand* It is bad luck but can*t be helped and I must try and malie up for it by exploring else where -as it is I have a heap of now material. Bin Sa'ud has called out his raiding parties, ostensibly for his usual Spring raids on Bedouin, but really as he told me in confidence because he does not want to be caught napping by the Turks at Qatif or'Oqair. The reason is that he has had information (a fortnight after I left Kuwait) that a Russian steamer which must have arrived in Basrah nov; was bringing out 1500 European Turkish trooos with the new Wall Suliman Nathif - that these troops may be intended for a dash on Qatif and Hasa. I pity them if they do land and are not covered by a man-of-war's guns as Bin Sa'ud has about 5000 or 6000 more or less trained men, benides clouds of Bedouins and he will probably pin them to the coast and then suddenly wipe them out. Anyway he is taking no chances. He is awaiting an answer from Government most anxiously anent the conference we had at' n Q.alr in December, and if I may venture to suggest it, it will be well worth our while to rive him some sort of reassuring hint as soon as possible. He tried to pump me as to what would be our line, 'rere he to agree to the Turkish request for the exclusion of foreigners and all direct relations with them or their Governments. I told him I was on leave and knew nothing of our probable at titudeattitude, but as a pal It oeemed to me unwise on hi' 7 part to bind himself so ir»evocably, because should he agree to this or similar conditions, presumably as an honest man, he would be bound to adhere to It; moreover the Turkish Government would probably inform us officially of it and request as to correspond with their Basrah authorities in all matters touch ing the Hasa Coast, a request with which, in the circumstances we should be compelled to conform. Supposing this situation to have been created we would be no forwarder in the matters Trevor and I discussed with him than at any e 1 ' the Turks held Hasa and he himself would probably have stifled any chance he had of freeing himself from Turkish interference. I suggested that he had no cause for hurry or impatiance at present, and certainly I could see no reason why he need bind himself until at least he was seriously threatened by the Turks. In any case, should he give the undertaking required by the Turks I failed to see how In the natural cours® O- affairs It could have any real permanence or ho It would bring hln the peace and security from Interference which he desired to much. I trust this will not be disapproved alto- ether, but If so our position Is correct enough as I t )ld hla repeatedly I had no authority even to discuss these things being on leave and out to see the world and all I said would be open to dls vowal by our Government. One suggestion which I venture to make privately owing to my own liking and opinion of Bin Sa'ud and perhaps because of my distance from the Coast1 is that, should there be any truth in the rumours of a Turkish descent on Qatif and Ojair, could we not send a man-of-war or two to Bahrain at the physicolo- gical moments, ostensibly to see that the troops did^ not use Bahrain as a base and really with the hope that it might have the sane effect as the despatch to ships to Kuwait did at the time (was it 1894?) when Ibn Rashid said to be supported r^y Turkish troops from Basrah contemplated an attack on Kuwait vizviz prevent the move. I am sending this letter by one of Bin posts to the coast and under flying seal to Trevor f as it seems advi sable he should have accurate and early information to counteract the effect of any bazaar gossip there may be in Bahrain as to Bin ba'ud^ movements or intentions. .^01 ml nConfidential . / iigj V To f /orcltitt atul JclUfal Simla, the 5 April 291 4 .

Mallet to Sir Edward Grey, No.117,dated Constantinople, the 24th February 1914. , . 1 I The Grand Vftzier gave me to understand that Aziz All Bey's arrest was due to his attitude towards the Government since his return to Constantinople, and it is clear from what I have since learned from other sources that the matter is really a political one, for there is no doubt that Aziz Ali Bey has been one of the leading spirits in a group of young Arabs, officers, and others, who are dissatisfied with the present Turkish Government. It is difficult to gauge the importance of this group, but it has come to my knowledge that some at least of them are identified with more or less definite schemes for organising a movement which would aim at releasing the whole region fromidosul to the Persian Gulf from Turkish domination. They claim to have established coinmunications ta with various Local nubilities, including the Shaikh of Koweit, whose sympathy they say they have secured, and one of their to plans would appear to be/attach the tract of country in which they are interested to the Shaikh's dominions. Thoy profess to be in a position to organise an Insurrectionary movement on such a scale as would enable them to cope with the strong repressive! r j iL iMi^i a I 4UM ' m ^ iliii ^=■3 ( ^ S@) repressive measures which theTpurkish novernrnent would, they realise, take to^press-It. ncheraedof this kind are of course not new, and I have no reason to believe that the originators of this one are powerful or competent. As, however, a definite role is attributed to the Shaikh of Koweit, and in view of the unrest which undoubtedly prevails at Basra, I think it my duty to bring it to your notice. If the plan of creating an insurrec- tlon In Mesopotamia should take shape, one of the aims of its ' promoters would be to compel British intervention# T have caused it to be known to some of the persons concerned that Ills Majesty's Government would give no countenance to any such schemes, and have no intention ol pursuing a policy of adventure, which could only compromise serious British economic interests in Mesopotamia. 5; •iConfidential.

In the course of conversations during the past year the Shaikh has occasionally referred to the question of his flying a distinctive flag, and on the evening preceding his departure for Muhammerah, that of the loth instant, remarked that an early change would be desirable, in which I concurred but did not ga- -ther that he was thinking of carrying it out forthwith. 3.

I trust that this will meet with your approval and with that' of the G-overnment of India: in my opinion the flag as introduced is entirely suitable, as the majority of the population would certainly be shy oi adopting the Union Jack and this seems to be the best alternative.A oopy of this letter is being senfe to Sir Peroy Cox direct.

Sir, In continuation of lay letter No. g .50 da^ed 25th No- -vember 1914, I have the honour to report as follows 2. During the past few days several of the principal residents of Kuwait, including Shailchs Jabir bin F'ubah and Palim bin Muba- —rai-: the brooher and son of the ruler, have displayed anxiety re— -garding the ultimate destiny of the Turkish territories which have recently been occupied by the Indian Expeditionary Force, particularly the town of Basrah and its neighbourhood. They have one and all expressed fear lest His Majesty's Government should be compelled for any reason to restore these regions to Turkey at the conclusion of the war, pointing ouo thaw the consequences Tor Kuwait and its people would be serious. That there is much to be said for this view is obvious, particularly in the light of Sir Mubarak's rejent complete renunciation of all connection with the Turkish Government and the whole hearted manner in whicl- he has placed himself and all that he has at our disposal. 3. In reply I nave merely expressed the personal opinion that it is in the highest degree imparobable that Basrah and its neigh- -bourhood will be restored to the Turks. It is difficult zo see how this could be done by His Majesty's Government in the face of: ! of the 'letter of a3e i x , 'ai»oes M whioL I delivered to His Elxoel- -lenoy the Shaikh in aooordanoe with the insTiruotions oontained in your letter No. 403 dated 1st November, but tihe assuranoej having been personal to the She.ikh I have naturally made no re- -ferenoe to them in conversations with his ^ubjeots or other interestea persons. 4 The hope is strongly expressed by all parties in Kuwait that our forces will advance and occupy the country at least as far as Baghdad. The object of Kuwaitis in desiring this is two- -fold, that more territory may ultimately form part of the Bri- -tish 'fjlmpire and O rote3 'ced rtates, and that if unfortunately any portion of country occupied has later to be renounced, such portion may lie at a distance and be quite unconnected with the Kuwait Principality. 5. The regular dissemination in Kuwait of war news continues, but it is becoming more difficult as time goes on to explain the necessity for fighting still to take place in allied rather tnan in German terriotbry and why the Q-erman, should be almost inva- -riably the attaching ^arty. I am glad to be able to report that there is little or no local discreis which can be attribu- -ted to the war, and that commerje is practically undist-uroed^ prices being normal except as regards articles usually imported from Germany and Austria. 6.
