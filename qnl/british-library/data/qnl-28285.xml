WITH reference to Mr. Butler’s semi-official letter to Mr. Rendel of the 22 nd May, I have the honour to inform you that there seems no doubt that while the Shah was in Mazanderan last month a considerable number of arrests and some executions were carried out, and that there was a conspiracy of some sort against His Imperial Majesty’s life. 2 . Reports have proved difficult to substantiate, but it now seems that there were two affairs. The first was a beginning, mainly among students and in particular among past and present members of the Technical School, until recently under a German head, to start something in the nature of a Nazi movement in Iran. This was reported by the Soviet Embassy to the Iranian authorities and arrests were made. 3. Secondly, there was a conspiracy against the Shah’s life, and four army officers from a regiment quartered in Tehran were implicated and all four executed. Another version is that two of them escaped to Russia. Russian money is believed in some quarters to have been connected with the plot, but as to this I am sceptical; nor have I been able to learn the motives and inten tions of the conspirators, except to take the Shah’s life. 4. One fact that seems certain is that these alarums have given a good deal of anxiety to the police. I have, &amp;c. H. J. SEYMOUR. [64 e—1]/V COPY.

Ayrom, the Persian Chief of Police, is again very interesting (cf. P.Z.6056/32). inter alia it mentions the use made by the Soviet of their trade agents as propaganda agents. In Persia, unlike south « » eastern Afghanistan, the Soviet have, of course, in any case ample opportunities for • • + propaganda through their consulates throughout the country. But this reference to propaganda by trade agents goes to confirm the wisdom of the Afghan Government in refusing a commercial treaty of the kind pressed upon them by the Soviet. The Afghan * # Government, as they informed us, have learnt fron/c • from Persia’s experience of her commercial treaty with the Soviet which, apart from the political dangers that it may have for Persia, is understood to have proved to be of little commercial advantage to her, while giving great advantages to Russian trade, which the Soviet exploit to the full. Mr. Baggallay, who is on short leave from Tehran, where is is Second Secretary, had a long talk with me the other day, mainly in regard to the internal situation in Persia and the effects of the Russian commercial treaty. Under this treaty the Soviet is given quotas (in some cases amounting to 100%) of the imports of various commodities into Persia, and engages to take in exchange Persian goods of equivalent value. They are able to work this arrangement (e.g. by shutting down and releasing Russian exports to Persia as it suits them) so as to get the maximum of advantage without any regard to Persia’s interests. Mr. Baggallay thought that an effect (if not an object) of Soviet trade policy in Persia is to increase economic distress and consequently political discontent. The whole of the conversation with G-en. Ayrom recorded in the present paper is interesting. He seems to have a clear insight into the dangers of Soviet economic pressure and other activities in Persia. P.&amp; J.(S) Secretary. For information. (SB.) J.C. WALTON 6.1.33 I.P.I To see.

Presumably Russia, is more dangerous to Persia commercially than politically at the piesent time, and the Ministers may perhaps be nearer the mark than the Chief of Police (passage at A on page 2 of the memo.) when they set Rials above propaganda (after all, the time for the Sovietisation of the world is not yet). Moreover, if as seems possible, the Russians make themselves thoroughly unpopular commercially, the soil will not be receptive of propaganda. (SD.) M.J.CLAUS ON. 10.1 It is clear that there are two possible ways in which the Soviet might achieve their object of obtaining political domination of the Asiatic countries 1 bordering the Soviet Union:- (1) by obtaining a predominant influence over the existing governments of those countries; (2) by stirring up internal discontent and disaffection, with a view to upsetting those governments, and replacing them by others more amenable to Soviet influence. Where the existing governments, as in Afghanistan, and also Persia and Sinkiang, distrust the U.S.S.R., the Soviet’s difficulty in obtaining their object by the first means is likely to make them have resort to the second. From this point of view, the unpopularity of the Soviet with the governing classes in Persia is not such a comfort to us as it might otherwise appear. The danger is that, through economic and political discontent (very likely fostered by the Soviet), the present/ 1212 5000 0/32present Persian regime may be upset; the first result would probably be (in present circumstances) a period of confusion, which might give the Soviet their chance of setting up a pro-Soviet administration, or might, perhaps more probably, imperil the unity of the country which has been achieved and is somewhat precariously preserved by the present Shah. Though the weakness and disunion of Persia might in some ways make matters easier for us in the Persian Gulf, this advantage - if it should accrue - would, I think, be certainly greatl] outweighed by sacrifice of a relatively strong buffer against the impingement of Soviet ideas and subversive activities on India.

Sir, With reference to my despatch No. 390 of September 10th I have the honour to transmit to you an account of a further conversation between the Acting Oriental Secretary and Greneral Ayrom, the Chief of Police, on the subject of Soviet activity in Persia. General Ayrom f s statements have every appearance of being sincere. 2* His Majesty f s Consul-leneral at Isfahan also reports that there are occasional echoes of Soviet propaganda in Isfahan and the neighbouring districts. A little while ago, for instance, the brother-in-law of a certain Yusuf Zadeh, the dragoman of the Soviet Oonsulate-G-eneral, was found to be organising committees of young men for the purpose of distributing communistic literature. The brother-in-law was arrested and Yusuf Zadeh ordered to leave the country, in spite, it was said, of strong protests by the Soviet Embassy• ihe Soviet agents are said to be mainly employees of the Perseznaft. 3. The Tabriz manifesto which forms the subject of my despatch No. 453 dated November 1st comes as a further commentary on general Ayrom T s statements. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 220). I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) R.H. HOARE. The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.O.S.I., etc., etc., etc.. Foreign Office.I called on Sartip Ayrom yesterday and he again spoke at length about Soviet propaganda in Persia. He began the conversation by saying 'How long are the European powers going to allow the soviet to carry on their propaganda so freely?' 1 asked him whether his remark implied that he had obtained further information about their activities in this country. He then stated that as a result of the discovery some weeks ago of the espionage system in Tehran and also as a result of the deportation of Soviet agents, their former organ- • • jj isation had been fairly effectively broken, but that they were busy forming another intelligence and propaganda system. He repeated that the whole soviet representation in this country, from the Ambassador to the humblest officials in their trade offices were all active propaganda agents. He was doing his best to impress this fact on the Persian Government, but they seemed extremely reluctant to believe it. He had found Peroughi part icularly difficult to persuade, but he was glad to say that he thought that the Shah was beginning to realise the real state of affairs. He had been requested on one or two occasions to attend meetings at which Teymourtache, Davar and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were present, to explain his case and produce proofs. He thought he had succeeded to a certain extent, but the Ministers were still very anxious to avoid friction with the Russians. He would give the following example of the extent to which the Soviet agents could influence the Ministers. At a meeting held a little while ago between the Soviet Ambassador, Teymourtache and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it had been decided that Soviet trade agents in this country should obtain their permis de sejour from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and not from the Police. This meant that the Police would have no control over Soviet agents in this country. A case in point had arisen at Meshed where the Soviet trade agency had applied to the Governor-General and obtained a permit for one of their staff/- 2 - staff without reference to the police. Ayrom had cancelled the permit. He had flatly refused to allow Soviet employees to obtain their permits from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. He had quoted the Law concerning the Kesidence of Foreigners in Persia and asked whether one law was to be applied to the Russians and another to all other foreigners. He had won his point, much to the annoyance of the Russians who began to say that a new influence had arisen in the councils of the Persian Government; that until recently the Governments policy had been dictated by Teymour, but that now there were two conflicting policies. I asked Ayrom whether he could give any reason for this apparent friendliness towards the soviet. He said that the Ministers were very anxious to make commercial agreements with the soviet and that in their efforts to gain some small temporary commercial victory over the Soviet Government they were quite blind to the danger of Soviet propaganda in this country. Recently Teymour had mentioned with great satisfaction a profit of seven million Rials that Persia had gained through her sugar transactions. Ayrom retorted that seven hundred million would be of no use when in a few years time the country had gone Bolshevik. Ayrom continued that some some time he had urged the Government to adopt a firmer attitude towards the Soviet. It was he who had recently persuaded the Government to send a stiff reply to a Soviet note which constituted an unwarrantable interference in Persian affairs. The arguments Ayrom used with the Persian Ministers were roughly as follows Persia was exposed to Russian attack in two ways: by military invasion, which she could not possibly hope to resist unaided; and by economic pressure. With regard to the former, he argued that in these days of the League of Nations etcetera, thethe danger of military invasion was remote. In any case Persia f s southern neighbour could surely not stand by and let Persia be overrun. Economic attack, on the other hand, was already being used, but he felt sure the boviet G-overnment would not go so far as to refuse entirely to trade with Persia. They were now looking to the East to carry out their plans and a complete break with Persia would do no good to their chances of gaining their ends in Eastern and Moslem countries; besides they needed their trade with Persia and the profit derived therefrom. He thought therefore that there was no real danger in taking a firm stand against Soviet action in this country. He thought his arguments together with his proofs of their propaganda activities were at last having some effect on the Ministers. Ayrom continued that the Soviet were especially anxious to obtain information from four of the Legations in Tehran - the British, the French, the Japanese and the Polish. He advised us to take all precautions with our post and added that he was not yet certain that the Soviet did not have some agent in our Legation. But he had no proof of this. In the French Legation they were interested in the Military Attache or rather in a lady who was his friend. Ayrom claimed to be very well informed of Soviet activities to know most of their secret agents etcetera. Because he was taking no active steps against them at present the Soviet thought he was ill-informed. But his inaction was dictated by the Persian Ministers who were still afraid to risk a quarrel with the Soviet.HO. 390. r ? British legation, Confidential. 0 u 1 h s k September loth,1932. Sir, ,7 1,^02 In mp despatch Ho. 305 of tTuly 1st and previous despatches I have had the honour to report the discovery by the Persian Government of the e xistenoe of an extensive Soviet intelligence service in this country. As an Interesting continuation of ) these despatches, I enclose an account of a conversation between General Airom, the Chief of Police, and the /cting Oriental Secretary, in which the former furnished some inter esting information regarding Soviet methods, speaking with a frankness - genuine frankness, Mr.Monypenny believes - which is astounding. 2. General Airon, to whom I referred in paragraph 7 of my despatch Ho. 128 of March 9th as a 'new broom', is still a youngish man. Ke gives the impression of being a man of intelligence and would give an impression of character also were it not that he has every appearance of being an opium addict. He has the reputation of being a crank upon the subject of Soviet spying, and it is probable that uneasiness as to his personal position has led him not only to unbosom himself to a foreign diplomat, but to magnify the size and importance of the dangers with which he is contending. it is however possible that his account of the obstruction he meets at the hands of feymourtaehe and Ferough! is to some extent based upon fact. a vigorous sweep of the broom, whloh would fhe Right Honourable Sir John Simon A ^ « T etc., no- 2 - no doubt bo technically sound and might produce some inter esting results, might also provoke reactions of an inconven ient nature* In a word, genuine fear of the Soviet union is perhaps as good a reason as any other if General irom Is right in saying that an obstructive pair of hands rests on the broom* 3* I do not attach too much importance to the soviet intelligence system, for given the natural advantages of their ) position I doubt whether all the information to be gathered by underhand means materially reinforces the Soviet Government which from economic even more than geographical causes is so placed as almost to be able to dictate to the Persian Government. It is difficult to Judge of the effects of Soviet propaganda. The propaganda is probably no more Intense than it has ever been, but the soil is undoubtedly much more fertile. The remedy for this state of affairs is in part bound up with world economics and in part lies with the Persiac Government and the shah themselves. But the Shah seems to think it well that the little finger of the pahlevi should be thicker than the loins of the Kajars. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch, with its enclosure, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, I have the honour to be with the highest respeot Sir, Tour most obedient humble Servant (Signed) R. K. Hoare.Record of conversation between General Airom and the Acting Oriental Secretary, August 28th,1922. I called on General Airom, the Chief of Police, on the morning of the 28th August and reminded him of the suggestion that he had made a few days earlier to Mr.Summerhayes that a member of this Legation should call on him as he had some inform ation to give concerning Soviet activities in this country. I added that the object of my visit was therefore to receive any information he wished to impart on the subject, and he proceeded without any further encouragement to speak roughly as follows Soviet propaganda is being carried on very actively at present in Persia. The Soviet authorities employ a large number of agents in the country and are spending money freely. Two years ago Suviet propaganda in Persia was not of qmch significance. Now it is a different story, owing to the com mercial depression and the widespread poverty and discontent. Numbers of Persians are losing their means of livelihood, and among such people Soviet money and propaganda cannot fail to have some effect. Although it is difficult to believe that Persians can ever be genuine Communists, yet the present situation is one that needed watching. At this point I expressed the opinion that even two or three years ago Communist propaganda was not by any means without effect in some parts of Persia. For instance in Bakhtiari the Khans had experienced great difficulty with the peasants in their villages in Chahar Mahal, more especially in a locality where the Soviet Government had opened a branch of their oil selling agency. General Airom stated that in other parts of Persia, as well as in Bakhtiari, Soviet propaganda had caused unrest among the peasants. He went- 2 - He went on to say that it was difficult for Persia, with her long, desert, frontiers to prevent the arrival and departure of agents. According to information he had received many Soviet agents were able to go via East Persia and Afghanistan to India* That was a frontier which required careful watching. An official formerly employed in the Soviet Consulate General at Meshed was now in Tehran. His name was 'Richert' alias 'Gird”, and he was Chief of the G.p*U. in Persia, and a very active agent. Persia had now become the centre folr Soviet propaganda in the East. The methods employed were simple. Agents were engaged and paid, at first, only to obtain infomation. The Soviet authorities had their agents in all Departments of the Persian Government. Later those agents who were found suitable were employ* ed to spread communist ideas. The^ of course, in Persia there A were the Soviet schools. The recent order against foreign primary schools in this country was issued at his own instigation. I here intervened to point out that the order had hit our schools as well. General Airom agreed but added : 'Y/hat does it matter ? The main point is to stop Communist propaganda in Soviet schools'. General Airom then continued to say that a large number of White Russians had been acting as Agents for the Commujiists. He had for sometime been occupied in checking the activities of these White Russians and had, as a result, received numerous protest from the Soviet Embassy. The Soviet authorities had even admitted that the White Russians were their most useful agents and had requested that they should not be molested. The soviet Ambassador had recently called on him. They had had a very frank discussion of the situation. He had asked the Soviet Ambassador whether he really hoped to make the Persians genuine Communists because if he did, he was merely wasting time. The Persians would ^ust take hisr /-n -3- his money and do nothing. The Ambassador stated that after all it was his business to obtain all the information he could for his GoyemmenJ. He (General Airom)agreed but protested that it was surely unnecessary to have an intelligence ser vice on such a large scale; to have agents everywhere, and to spend money so lavishly. The Ambassador had, I gathered, accused General Airom of excessive vigilance where Russians were concerned, and had spoken to him about the deportation of the Head of a Soviet School at Tehran. It appears that after the arrest and trial a fevtf weeks ago of those Persian Government employees who were suspected of betraying Government secrets, cyphers, etcetera, General Airom received a number of anonymous threatening letters. His police agents had been able to dis cover the Persians who had distributed these letters and had from them obtained the information that one Lukovski, the Head of a Soviet school in Tehran, was the author of these letters. General Airom had therefore deported Lukovski, in spite of strong protests from the Soviet Embassy. Lukovski was a member of the 'Comintern'. As a result of his actions against Communist agents General Airom has, he stated, brought upon himself the avowed hostility of the Soviet Embassy. Eis task of controlling their propaganda activities was not made any easier by the fact that both Teymourtache and Feroughi were inclined to listen to them. His position has become so difficult that in a recent interview with the shah he was compelled to explain that if he had failed to suppress Communist propa ganda in Persia, it was largely due to the fact that his hands are tied owing to the attitude of Teymourtache and Feroughi. If these two Ministers would give him a free hand he could suppress Soviet propaganda in a month. I aa kea r, V i-4- I asked Oeneral iiirom what reply the Shah had made. He said that the Shah had listened attentively hut had said nothing. General Airom then repeated that the Russians were spending a great deal of money; some of their agents were receiving thousands of tomans for their work; and that » although in normal times the effect would he hegligihle yet now, owing to the economic crisis and the widespread distress, their activities could not he ignored: and that as a result of his actions against their agents etc he had incurred their hatred; in fact it had been reported to him that the Soviet sgents had threatened that 'one day they would see him hanged in the public square in Tehran'. I do not know General Airom well and cannot therefore explain why he gave me this information, unless it is that Soviet hostility has made him really nervous, and that he feels he cannot rely on Teymourtache or Feroughi to support him if at any time the Shah should he inclined to listen to intrigues against him.

Three Indian British Bubjects have recently been actually deported or ordered to le^ve tue country. One of these men (hal Chand v^arma of Ahwas) appeared on the available evidence, wnicu was mainly that he had given English lebsons to tue bovlet Consult to be harmless and I therefore asked the Minister for Foreign Aff irs to let me know the reason for his deportation. My enquiry elicited little except that he was definitely a Loviet agent and was pi tting to damage the oil-fields of the Anglo-iereian Oil Company. Of the other uwo, one (Krishna, t motor driver of Tehran) has certainly beuaved in a suspiebue manner, whilst the last (R.A. llkinson, also of Tehran) though probably harmless politically, has been guilty of certain irregularities in nis private life. The cause of suspicion in his case also appears to be tuat he has given itoglieu lessons to various Russians, and I am taking suca unofficial ste s on his behalf as are yoesible in the circumstances. 3. Teymourtacne recently informed me. that the police had discovered the existence of a fairly extensive Soviet intelligence service. He went on to say that in a number of cases the organizers of these activities had been introduced to tiie Persian Government as the representatives of Soviet trade org nizations by the Soviet Embassy which must have known The Right honourable Sir John Simon, O.C.

Further evidence on this subject nae been furnished by hie Majesty^ Consul at Kermansaah who, in a confidential portion of his alary lor tne month of April last, supplies some interesting information regarding the activities of Soviet agents.
