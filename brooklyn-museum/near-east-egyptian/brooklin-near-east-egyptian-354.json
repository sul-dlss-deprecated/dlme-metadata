Calcite was mined in the Sinai Peninsula and in the eastern desert stretching from Cairo to Luxor. Stones such as basalt, quartz crystal, obsidian, porphyry, schist, steatite, and serpentine were reserved for luxury items. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe exotic forms of foreign stone vessels appealed to New Kingdom craftsmen. Two examples seen here&mdash;the amphora with two handles and the footed dish, or <i>tazza </i>&mdash;were inspired by Syrian models. Also, the jar with the high cylindrical neck reproduces a Cypriot pottery type known as base-ring ware. Decoration tended to rely on traditional Egyptian patterns. For example, painted or incised floral garlands appear on many stone vessels made in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties. This design alludes to the Egyptian funerary practice of draping collars of flowers around pottery vessels. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo make a vessel, a carver first chiseled a block of stone into a general shape, then slowly rotated it on a wheel while polishing the exterior with an abrasive such as sand or emery. Finally, he hollowed out the interior using a drill with a metal or hard stone bit. <br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2016-03-01", "date_added": "2016-04-04 21:01:02", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [], "collections": [{"id": 5, "name": "Egyptian, Classical, Ancient Near Eastern Art", "folder": "egyptian", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [{"id": 648, "title": "Egypt Reborn: Art for Eternity"}, {"id": 3329, "title": "Ancient Egyptian Art"}], "related_items": [{"accession_number": "16.121", "object_id": 3148}, {"accession_number": "05.324", "object_id": 3209}, {"accession_number": "08.480.19", "object_id": 3233}, {"accession_number": "09.889.82", "object_id": 3263}, {"accession_number": "09.889.92", "object_id": 3264}, {"accession_number": "37.248E", "object_id": 3990}, {"accession_number": "37.640E", "object_id": 4070}], "geographical_locations": [{"id": 7127958, "name": "Saqqara, Egypt", "type": "Possible place made"}], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "37.386E_SL1.jpg", "id": 8802, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/37.386E_SL1.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/37.386E_SL1.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 74, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 148, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 297, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 595, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1191, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/37.386E_SL1.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": " <em>Jar with Floral Collar in Relief</em>, ca. 1292-1190 B.C.E.
