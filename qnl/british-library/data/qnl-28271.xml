Sir With reference to Mr* Squire’s letter to Mr. Butler of the 30th June, (No. 28/9/4), I transmit to you herewith a copy of a Note which I have received from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from which it is satisfactory to learn that arrangements are at last being made for the payment of compensation to the lorry drivers whose lorries were commandeered at Zahidan in December, 1935. 2. Enquiries have been made with a view to discovering whether any of the lorry drivers concerned are in Tehran. Ag far as can be ascertained, the only one at present in Tehran is Beaut Singh, son of Bishan Singh, who has been told by this Legation to visit the Amnieh Department to ask for payment of his claim. 3. As the remaining lorry drivers are probably at or near Zahidan, I shall be glad if you will arrange for them to call at the local Amnieh Department so that they too may ask for payment of their claims. You will no doubt inform me of the result in due course. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department.

Monsieur le Ministre, With reference to Your Excellency’s Note No. 299 of th 24th Tir 1317 (15th July, 1938) concerning the claims of certajr Indian traders and chauffeurs, I have the honour to inform you that, according to information received from the competent quarters, as a number of these people appear to be in the Capital, instructions have been issued to the Treasury of the Army to pay their claims. Similarly, the Lashgar No. 8 of Mukran has been instructed to notify to the Capital the names of those who either themselves are in 'Jahidan or have repre sentatives in Zahidan, in order that their legitimate claims may be settled. I therefore request that Your Excellency will be so good as to cause any of these persons residing in the Capital to be instructed to refer to the Amnieh Department of the Ar»my in order that they may receive payment of their claims.

It was to be expected that the Iranian government would reject it, and in all the olroumistMoes I think it is scarcely worth i^ursuing it. On the other hand the Iranian Oovemmea’s conteition that mswipan tng lorry-driver© to drive their lorries at the direction of the Civil or Military authorities cannot be regarded as im posing on them a '•service dbligatoire, militair© ou civil' is as tonishing.

Foreign Office, 8 —14310B (4No. 36 (9/9B) British Consulate General, Meshed, 26 th June 1937. My dear Minister, Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No.140/12/37 of the 6th April 1937 on the subject of the Indian lorries commandeered at Zahidan in December 1935. 2. I have not replied earlier as I wished to get a fuller report of the case from Camphell. I have now heard from him that he is hopeful of securing a slightly more satisfactory solution than your letter would appear to indicate as possible. He reports that, in this as in other matters your representations on our behalf, for which we are extremely grateful, though apparently yielding no results at the time, are often of material assistance. The General Officer Commanding, Mukran, is said to have received a very abrupt order from the Ministry of War to settle this case without delay, and to explain why he has delayed it so long. 3. The actual situation is not quite as stated to you by Ansarie, but I enclose a statement which Campbell has drawn up under my orders showing the present state of affairs. Prom this you will see that the only claim that has been settled was that of Jaggatsingh No. 12, whose lorry broke down and who was accordingly' paid his compensation in full. One of the others was actually offered Rials 1,150 in April last, but was persuaded by Campbell not to accept this amount unless his companions* claims were also settled at the same time and on the same basis. (I should explain that the amounts of Rials 600 and 1,200 are very much less than the drivers originally claimed and include no sort of compensation for illtreatment and other losses). H. J. Seymour, Esq., C.M.G. , 4./ His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran.4. It seems probably that the Hials 2000 already paid to Jaggatsingh must be deducted from the Rials 6,000 which the Iranian Government have agreed to pay, leaving only Rials 4,000 against the outstanding claims of Rials 7,800. This is in my opinion quite inadequate and I am reluctant to press the drivers concerned to accept, more especially as Campbell, as long ago as June last, received a rather vague offer from the Governor—General to ,f pay Rials 1,200 in addition to their legal dues”. If this means that Rials 5,200 can be made available locally for the settlement of these claims it is, at any rate, a slight improvement and Campbell has suggested that he should be given another month during which time he hopes to effect a more favourable local settlement. 5. I will, of course, report progress in due course. Meanwhile a reminder to the Minister of Foreign Affairs asking if instructions could be given for the case to be settled without further delay might perhaps assist us at this end if you think that it would be proper for you to bring the matter up again. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe, No. 124 (9/9b). Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) G. F. Squire.2.0 COPY (E 4536/1437/34) No, 140/19/37 . 16th July, 1937 Many thanks for your letter No, 36 (9/9B) of the 26th June, about compensation for the lorry-drivers whose lorries were commandeered at Zahidan in December 1935, 2, In view of what you say, I agree that we should return to the charge here, and I enclose a copy of a note which I am sending to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, pressing again for payment in full, I hope it may have some effect. 3, I am sending a copy of this letter, with its enclosure, to Sir Aubrey Metcalfe and also, with a copy of your letter of the 26th June, to Baggallay at the Foreign Office, G.F. Squire Esquire, I.C.S., His Majesty’s Consul-General, for Khorassan at ZabulNo. 342 (140/18/37) 16th July, 1937. Copies to:- Sir A* Metcalfe Mr. Baggallay Mr. Squire. Monsieur le Ministre, I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s note No. 3279/285 of the 12th April (23rd Parvardin) regarding the compensation to he paid to the Indian British subjects whose lorries were requisitioned by the military authorities at Zahidan in December 1935. 2. Your Excellency will doubtless remember that in paragraphs 6 to 12 of the Aide-Memoire No. 3/21/36 which was handed to His Excellency Monsieur Soheily on the 4th April 1936 (15th parvardin 1315) , it was explained that the full hire due to the 12 drivers in question totalled Rials 9000 (nine drivers went to Khwash for which the current market rate claimed was Rials 600 for each lorry: three went to Dehak for which the rate claimed was Rials 1200). In addition reasonable compensation was claimed for the damages, losses and ill-treatment sustained by the drivers. 3. I have been informed by His Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed that one driver has so far received any payment. The driver in question is one Jaggat Singh, who went to Dehak and has received Rials 2000 and 11 tins of petrol as hire and compensation for the damage to his lorry, the differential of which was broken. If/ His Excellency Monsieur Enayatollah Samiy, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Tehran.If this sum is to he deducted from the total sum of Rials 6000 which, as Your Excellency was so good as to inform me, is available at Zahidan for payment to the drivers, it is evident that the balance of rials 4000 is quite inadequate to pay even the full hire of the remaining 11 drivers, which totals rials 7,800. The fact that rials 2000 has been paid to a single driver would seem to show that the local authorities have in fact admitted the justice of the drivers* claim to full hire and compensation. I should therefore be very grateful if Your Excellency would be so good as to cause instructions now to be issued for the payment of the full hire and compensation due to the other drivers in order finally to dispose of this long standing claim. As Your Excellency is aware, great importance is attached by His Majesty*s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India to a settlement. I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to Your Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration. (Signed) H.J.

Would you olease refer to correspondence ending v,ith my despatch to you No. 8 of the 8th February enclosing a cony of my last note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs about the claims of the Indians whose lorries were commandeered at Zahidsn in December 1935? 2. On the 31st March Ansarie, Head of the European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told Gamble that the nay office of the Mekran army authorities held at the disposal of the Indian drivers the sum of Rials 6,000. According to Ansarie, some of the drivers had drawn the amounts available for them, but the rest refuse to do so. He said that the Iranian Government considered the amounts offered to the drivers were reasonable, and suggested that we should recommend the drivers to accent them. 3. Rials 6000 presumably represents the rate of hire originally offered by the local authorities at Zahidan, namely Rials 800 each for the three lorries which went to Dehak, and Rials 400 each for the nine others which did not go beyond Khwash. Thus, after representations lasting more than a year, we have not succeeded in inducing the Iranian Government to make any advance on their original offer, or to persuade them to offer any payment as compensation for the damage to the lorries and for the beating and ill-treatment of the drivers concerned. This is very disappointing but I cannot feel there is any real hope of our ever getting more for these /drivers G. F. Squire Esq. , I. 0. 3. , His Majesty’s Consul-General,drivers than the Iranian Government are now willing to nay. In the letter enclosing the cheque for the lorry drivers involved in the 1934 commandeering, the Minister of Foreign Affairs said that the Iranian Government’s action r, was of an exceotional nature and could not he taken as a precedent for future cases'*. Butler told Soheily at the time that no Government could reasonably say f, We will nay comoensation this once only ? * hut he got the impression that the words quoted ahove meant that the matter hrd heen to the Shah, and that he had decided that the 1934 victims, who had suffered much morse, should he conoensated and the 1935 ones not. 4. In all the circumstances I douht whether anything is to he gained hy Dressing this claim further. If it is a fact tha some of the drivers have accepted the payments offered, this will not make it easier for me to return to the charge# I would suggest therefore that unless you see any strong local objection to doing so, the remaining drivers should he advised to draw their share of the sum available whilst it is still there. 5.

The object of ay present note is to invite Your Jxcelleney’s atten tion to the future position of drivers of British natlona^j. y, a question whhfe I have already briefly discussed with Your Excellency in one of our conversa tions. 2.

Since then, however, my Govern ment’s attention has been drawn to the iinportant bearing of Artieel 2 of the Irano-Soviet Treaty of August 27th, 1933 (4th Chahrivar, 1314). The first paragraph of this article reads in the French text: des parties contractantes, pendant leur © 63 our sur les territolres de 1 , Autrs,aeront en temps de gulx et de guerre exempt&amp;s d© tout service, ailitaire cm civil# Toute- fois, en cae de calamity provenant des ll&amp;aents de la nature, ils peuvent 3tre requis de travailler*# Persian Treaty of 1837 entitles British ‘’Lee ressortissants de ehacune Article 12 of the Anglo- 3ubjects, as Your Sxcellency knows, to /boatmoot favoured nation treatment* It appears therefore that British drivers are entitled to benefit under paragraph 1 of Article S of the Irano-Soviet Treaty # mid consequently to exemption from *tout service obligatoire ’ 1 except in the contigency of some calamity of nature - an earthquake for example* such as occurred at Quetta last year* 6 * Similarly the third paragraph of the same articles extends exemption to loans under compulsion* The comman deering of a lorry is evidently a loan made by its owner under compulsion« and thus in respect of vehicles also British Subjects would appear to be entitled to benefit from most favoured nation rights* 7* The new position revealed since the conclusion of the Irano-soviet Treaty ha© been under careful considera tion by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India* I am now instructed to draw the attention of the Imperial Government to it* and to ask that steps may be taken to secure exemption from commandeering both for British lox-ry drivers and for the lorries owned by British subjects* 8 * It is regretted that it should be necessary after the comparitlvely short interval since the issue of the instructions referred to at the /beginningbeginning of fchie letter f to a*k the Imperial Government to amend them, but it 1&amp; felt that the new situation will gain considerably in ©implicit?, as it will permit of a plain instruction on the part of the appropriate authorities that British lorry driver© and British lorries are exempt from commandeering, except in the single clear contingency of some calamity of nature# I take this opportunity to renew to Tour Excellency the assurance of my highest consideration# (Signed) He vile Butler#P.2. 8168/36* ENTIAL.

There are perhaps three separate events since last bag which deserve special mention. The first is that the Iranians have at long last told us that the payment of compensation for the Indian lorry drivers who were commandeered and shot up in December 1934, has been definitely sanctioned by the Shah at the full rate asked for by ue and that a cheque will shortly follow. This is indeed a great piece of news and a reward for persistence, as we have hammered away at them about this unceasingly for the past eighteen months. As soon as we get the cheque (and it is not really safe to crow till then) we are going to tackle the tricky business of trying to secure exemption for our drivers from commandeering in future on the strength of last year’s Russian Treaty and our own m.f.n. rights.4-. t'^A « («)^' A further attempt hy the iilitary abthorities At Khw«»4U to oosti&amp;axKioer lua Xndi&amp;ii-ownea. iiotor lorry was unsuco#»»ful owing to th« rwruaal of tha Indian to suliitit.

I forward these despatches in original 'because although voluminous they give details which may he of use if iurther negotiations on the subject at Tehran. 2. The disorderly manner in which these lorries were ccmmandeered ma&amp;es it exceedingly difficult to check claims for hire, damages, etc., Croups of soldiers were sent out, without responsible ofilcers, and seized any lorries they could find. This procedure was directly opposed to the instructions issued last year by the Central Military Authorities to the effect that ccxnmandeering should only be carried out through the medium of the civil police. $• Nearly all the lorries were in transit on tte Inter national road and bear Indian Registration numbers. Although there were Ifew Inania®i-owned lorries in &amp;ahidan at the time, such as ?#re available were not all used. A large number of State owned lorries based on Meshed and wording on the 2ahidan-Meshed road could no doubt have been rapidly assembled, if proper action had been taken.

No: 1488/30/55 His Britannic Majesty^s Vice Consulate, Dated Zahidan the 18th December 1935. From Captain J. Campbell, I .A ., His Britannic Majesty f s Vice Consul, Z^hidaS* To, His Britannic Majesty f s Consul General for Khorasan, Zabul . Subject:- Commandeering of British subjects lorries and drivers by the Iranian Military authorities in Zahidan on 14th December 1935^ Sir, I have tbe honour to report a case of unres trained and irresponsible commandeering of British Indian owned lorries and their British Indian drivers* The commandeering was carried out by the Military direct and not through the Zahidan police or through the Governor General of Mekran. This is contrary to the (fcecision of the Iranian Ministry of W a r a copy of which was sent to tnis office under British Legation Circular No*34 dated the 5th July 1930. The Commandeering was acocmp d •through violence and threats oi violence by soldiers and there have been many cases of beating and ill usage of British Indian subjects. I reported this commandeering to you by telegram on the same day. 2 . The Officer Commanding the troops at Zahidan (Saihang Faridoon) in reply to a complaint regarding the beating of a Sikh Motor cleaner made to him by the - Rebate Officer of this Vice Consulate on tbe 14th Decem ber 1935, stated that he had received urgent telegraphic orders, for tte immediate despatch of troops to Khwash. He added that these orders had come from the Divisional Commander then at Khwash and that he (Sarhang Paridoon), had to obtain the transport by any means possible. This was about 12.30 Noon on 14th December 1935.1 1 I received further reports of ill usage and heating of other British Indian subjects so, after verifying these reports, I visited the Governor General at 011 same day (14th Becemher 1935). I ex plained to hia the extent and gravity of the complaints I had received and he expressed great sup rise that he had not previous to this heard anything about the direct coDimandee ring of the lorries f He expressed himself very strongly @n the subject of this high handed, hasty and unnecessary action on the part of the Zahidan Military Commander of the troops. He sent for his Chief of Police and ordered him to see the Officer Commanding and to tell him that he should not have commandeered lorries or drivers except through the Civil Police. He also ordered the Chief of police to bring before the British Vice Consul ary British Indian subjects who wish ed to represent any complaints to him, and to effect the release of any British Indian subjects irregularly - arrested by the Military. I offered to take 1 lie Chief of police in my car to the Military Lines and he accept ed but asked me to halt about a hundred y^ards from the gate of the barracks. I assured him that a five minutes interview with each British Indian subject who had any complaint to make would be sufficient. In about five minutes he returned ta: in a state of considerable agita tion and promised that he would bring to the Vice Consul ate any drivers who wished to complain to me as their Vice Consul. About an hour later he came ana had tea with me in the Vioe Consulate. He was still agitated as a result of his visit to the Officer Commanding the troops and regretted that as the troops were about to set out for Khwash the lorry drivers could not be spared to speak to me. The Vice Consulate adjoins the Military lines so that a few minutes only would have been requir ed for drivers to visit me. The Civil authorities appear toto have heen completely ignored hy the Military. 4. Attached are copies of letter which have 'been sent to the Governor General No; 158, 159, 160, 161 and 162, and his reply to No; 158 and 159. 5. I interviewed the Governor General again at 7 P.Mr on 16th December 1935. He wished to minimise the whole affair and assured me that this was not a matter regarding which we need write letters and send telegrams. Ke appeared desirous of hushing the whole affair up and of blaming the Military. 6. I again suggested to him the need for early and energetic action as suggested in my letter No;162 of 16th December 1935 so that statements made by Bri tish subjects might be placed on record and either established or refuted without undue delay. I suggested that the ordinary process of law was gravely impeded in a case where the Military had temporarily assumed control and oflfered to assist him in any way to bring these British Indian subjects complaints before him at any early date so that they might not afterwards exaggerate their statements e.g. by detailing a member of the staff of this Vice Consulate with an intimate knowledge of Indians and their language to serve on any commission he might convene. He accepted the sugges tion and the commission was to consist of the Chief of police A Military representative A Vice Consulate representative. The Commission was to meet at 10 A*1 • on 17th December 1935 in the Officers* Club in Zahidan town. I detailed Sheikh Ayub and instructed him to ensure that cases of maltreatment of British Indians afe placed on record as well as their purely financial claims. 7. The Governor General assured me that he was doing all in his power to help and that he had received a telegram to the effect that the 12 British Indian lorries . •lorries taKen to Khwash ^ould “be returned on the folloti- ing day (17th Decemher 1935) as he had spoken hy tele phone to the Divisional Commander at Khwash. I thanked the Governor General Tor his assurance that all com plaints and claims would he promptly dealt with. He expressed a desire to see a happier &amp;ahidan in the lUture hy the elimination of all causes ofy^triction with the British Indians. I assured him that the Indian drivers would he only too glad to serve the Military at any time except for the fact that there had been many cases of ill treatment of drivers on previous occasions when they had Ifceen forced to serve the aimyr 6* The Commission met on the 17th December 1935 hut tte Military Officer explained that the only part that concerned him was the fixing of the rate of hire and that this should he settled with reference to the rate at which Military supplies are carried under the existing transport contract between the Military and the Khorasan Transport Company. The police recorded the statements of those Bri tish Indian subjects who appeared. An abstract of these statements is attached. When the remainder le turn from Khwash area their statements are to be recorded along with the details of the state of their vehicles. 9. I have received complaints of discrimination against Indians in the commandeering of the lorries but I have not found sufficient data to support this in Zahidan* The numbers involved were 12 British Indian and. 3 Iranian lorries. The proportion of Indians appears to be excessive but on that day (14th December 1935) it so happened that the lorries were available in that propor tion. 10. a complaint of marked discrimination against Indianbd. &lt;1 • Campbell C ap tai n Indian owned transport has come from Mtrjawa. The Military Officer in charge there on 15th December 1935 (a Lieutenant Ghulam Beza Khan) sent a message to Ram Lai a British Indian driver who was waiting on the British side of the frontier as he had heard of the commandeering of the lorries. The message was to the effect that there was no commandeering. Ram Lall therefore drove his lorry to the Mirjawa Customs house where he was promptly seized by this Military Officer and forced to unload his lorry and to drive to Khwash carrying a party of soldiers. At this time there was in Mirjawa a lorry of Kerbalai -all, an Iranian.

In continuation of my letter No.158 dated 22nd Azar 1314 (14th December 1935), I have the honour to point out that although fourteen lorries of British Indian sub jects were commandeered by tbe Military in Zahidan on 14th December 1935 (22nd Azar 1314) yet no official - receipts have been given to the owners. It is understood that the international practice is that an official re- reoeipt is given to the owner of each lorrry which has been fca^en and that such receipts should show details of the registered number of each vehicle, milemeter - reading and a list of tools, Kit and spares and note of any deifects observed at the time and its cash value at the time of oommandeering. It is requested that this may be done as soon as possible in order to eliminate the possibility of false claims being put forward by owners after the lorrries return; as Your Bxcellency has probably more experience of these transactions than I have there will ho doubt be other points which I have omitted, which will occur to you.

I have the honour to enclose a copy of an aide- memoire which I accordingly left with Monsieur Soheily on the 3rd January. 3. I am sending copies of this despatch with its enclosure to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India The Right Honourable Anthony jgden M.P., etc.,,, etc., etc., The Foreign Office.India {So. 7) and to Hia Uajeaty's Cojiaul-fJeneral for Khorasan ($o. 4). I hare honour to be with the hi^h es ^ respect f»lr t Your moat obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) H*M.Knatchbull-Hugessen ftiu«r-mtnsoir«J. In an w icii i Is Majesty’s Pinieter had tne honour to leave with ills } xoeXlency the Under- secretary of state tor oreif n Aifairs on I-ecemher XjUx (Asar 27th) particul ars were given of the recent eoamand- eerlng of a nuaber of Indian lorries with their drivers by the military authorities at iaheo&amp;n* Further Information ii&amp;a now been received with regard to this case and his ajesty's Minister now desires to as* the Imperial Government to give it their earnest consideration witn special reference to the following paints:- (a) Fourtssn drivers and lorries were commandeered, none of them were under any contract to drive for the military authorities nor were they bourn to any garage employed by to© military to transport men, supplies, etcetera, fhey were thus under no ordinary cumKcrciai contract to drive to wash on the present occasion and the case is therefore one of simple commandeer— ing. (b) The right of the Iranian aovern- ment to requisition transport in time of need is not disputed but f as a /resultresult of correspondence too* place between his ajesty’s .egation and the Imperial Ministry for foreign Affain in 1930 f the latter gave an under taking that s regular form of procedure would always tos observed* Oopies of two notes from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, in which this undertaking is contained, were attached for convenience to hie Majesty’s Legation’s aids-memoirs under reference, and a copy of a note from bir fUH* Clive to which the second of the above two notes is a reply is now enclosed in tnis aide-memoire also for convenience of reference* The ilnistry will observe from this correspondence that it was twice stated that the /inistry of ar had issued explicit instructions to all military authorities concerned that they should apply to the local police when in need of means of transport. Yet in the present case this was not done and the commandeering was effected by the military authorities themselves. This is in direct conflict with the procedure that should have been followed. (b) oreover, the drivers concerned were detained in the military barracks del ore they were despatched to / wash and iis majesty's Vice-Consul at '^ahedan was not permitted to see them, in spite of the fact that he was sent to the barracksby ills .xaellenoi the GoYernoF-a*m?ral of Uekren anu that he went there, more over, In the company of the Chief of Police* The conduct of the military in both these respects would seem to be entirely unwarranted and ills Majesty's legation must request that it fora the subject of a full and early enquiry* (d) As stated in his Majesty's Legation^ aide-memoire under reference, eight cases occurred of the beating of Indian driveri and shopkeepers by tne military authorities* These oases have all been I referred to the Covernor-General who can doubtless supply full particulars, hie Majesty’s Legation trust that the Imperial Government will spontaneously admit that such action was entirely illegal and will furthermore agr«*e to make some reparation to the persons concerned; furthermore, they must formally request that stringent orders be issued that no such treatment be henceforth meted out to British subjects (•) A* stated by his aajesty's Legation in their aide—agemoire unaer reference, their information is to the effect that such Iranian lorries as were available were not commandeered and that at least three of them were left free to ply into India as far as iok Kundi on their norma lorries were commandeered, it is clear business. If indeed only Indian-owned /tba1tft&amp;t nerioua diftcriaiQtttioa took piao® against British subjects, wbersas it would sssm only equltabl® Ui«t Ir&amp;nian~ cmmed transport siiould first nave been requisitioned ana lorries belonging to foreigners only commandeered if and when Uie transport belonging to Iranian subjects proved to be insufficient# (f) another point to which his Majesty’s legation desire to invite special attention is that all the Indian drivers vac were commandeered are holders of Iranian visas vhleh only entitle them to ply In Iran as far as gahedan; that is to say, tney were all of them persons who normally operate only on the international ^ah^dan - nok Fundi road. his Majesty’s legation would urge with ell possible smpnaais that eucu drivers should not be requisitioned at all for service in the Interior of the country when in ordinary circumstances they are not allowed to operate# In the first place the nature of their visa precludes them from obtaining freights at their destination, wherever it may be, and further, the action of the authorities in obliging them to leave their regular route impedes the flow of international communications ana moreover gives Iranian-owned lorries which have not /beenb«en roquiftitiont 4 e rirVaml monopoly for the ti»« being of ail traffic not only on the Iranian but also on the Indian section of the internetional road* For these reasons it ia the view of His Majesty's Legation that such drivers should be entirely exenpt from commandeering and that only those Indians should be liable to be ordinarily requisitioned whose visa'enables them to ply for hire in the interior of the country* (g) his majesty's negation would finally point out that when these lorries were commandeerea no rates of hix^e were fixed* The rates offered on their return to gehedan were refused by them as being inadequate* seeing that they made no allowance for the fact that they had to return empty and for the damage caused to their lorries through overloading* If the Imperial Ministry will kiMily refer to the proposals contained in the third paragraph of ths enclosed note they will observe that a regular form of procedure was suggested and reference to tne second of the two notes from the Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs* of which copies wars attached to his Majesty's Legation's aide-memoire under reference* will equally slow that the Imperial Ministry /asked»»ked the Mifliotry af i«r to give these propoeals ^speoial eoneideration.^ It la clear that ia the preaeat case no •uch procedure wae followed* 3. His Maleaty*» Legation would accordingly request that serious and sympathetic consideration should toe c*\ trfti ♦ r\ i-Hm wha man i ^uttat in eilt* 1 i instructions should toe issued that reasonatole payments should toe made to all the drivers who were eoraniandeered and that in future no such irregularities should toe permitted as were committed in the present ease*( sv.y ) British Legation 9 Oulhok' 24 tn «lune 9 1930. Monsieur la inistre, as Your higiineee is aware# the aethode employed in tm past by the Military authorities tor the commandeer ing of transport have given rise to such dissatisfaction and resentment and to reiterated complaints of injustice and ill-usage. The various grounds of complaint have been brought to tha notice of Your highness 1 Ministry on numerous occasions# and I will recapitulate them briefly as foilowe*- (1} Ho uniform system of requisitioning is in force. J (2) Ho torn of receipt is ever given by the officer responsible for the coM’Q&amp;ndeering# with the reeult that it is often difficult for the owners of transport to establish the justice of their claims. (3) hvsn when sufficient evidence is in their possession# the procrastinat ion of the Military and the delay in settlement are such as to causa very real hardship to the owners concerned. (4) Lorries are often seriously over loaded and ariven st excessive speeds over bad roads with the result that they are often seriously damaged and at times abandoned by the roadside. For such damage the Military Authorities refuse to accept responsibility and stats that it is covered by the rate paid for the hire of the lorry. /(•&gt; his highness Miraa Mohamad Ali Khan Foroughi, Minister for Foreign Affairs. Tehran.(5) m ranBport is often detained idle by tlie military for several days, and no compensation ie paid for sucn delays* (6) Xo diecrimination ie used by tbe commandeering officer, so that often all the transport of one owner is taken and none of another owner. 2* Your Highness will agree that such unrestrained and Irresponsible requisitioning gives rise to a most unsatisfactory state of affairs. In all countries the necessity of issuing some form of official receipt, whereby the owner may be assured of receiving his proper hire, is recognised* The refusal of the Military authorities to recognise their responsibility for exceptional damage caused to commandeer ed lorries la also opposed to internet* ional practice* It is evident that the forcible requisitioning of a lorry can not be compared to an ordinary hire transaction, and serious damage sustained by a lorry (whose driver la often replaced by a military chauffeur) In such circumstances cannot be regarded S ae fair wear and tear* The right of any Government to requisition transport in times of crisis is not disputed although it is, I understand, customary to Issue a public notification of the state of emergency which exists; but it ie essential that requisitioning should be carried out in / suchsuch a manner aa to cauae tiie »inimu« of lose and hardadip to transport owners* X have therefore the honoui to lay befoi Your HigXineaa certain proposals which would help to ensure that any co^mandeSi ing that may be necessary in the future will be carried out in the most equitable way. (1) a fair scale of hire should be drawn up and adhered to. (2) This scale ahould provide for the payment of hire for every day that the transport, though not actually employed on the road, ia detained by the Military Authorities. (0) The Military Authorities should agree to pay for any exceptional damage caused to lorries while they are employed for military purposes, and for damage to goods damped by the roadside. (4) On ell occasions some form of official requisition receipt or contract should be issued by the officer responsible for the command eering, so that the Ministry of war may from the outset oe put into possession of evidence which would tnable them to verify the validity of all claims submitted to them. (b) The requisitioning officer should, as far as possible, exercise discrim ination so that undue Hardship should not be inflicted on any one owner of transport. 4. I trust that Yocr highness will see fit to submit these proposals to the Ministry of War and will use your good offices to secure their most favourable consideration, so that th« heavy losses inflicted on transport owners by the present methods may be eliminated and their interests safeguarded.

A good description of the treatment to which Indian lorry drivers have been subjected by the military authorities in Persian Baluchistan during the present revolt is given in the extract from the Khorasan Diary for December last at flag ’A’. 2. The question has previously been dealt with on the file on the Anglo-Persian \ conference at Zahidan, since it was expected that the subject would be one of those discussed at that conference. It will be seen, however, from Colonel Daly’s letter of 27th February, below, that the Consul-General had already broached the question with General Jehanbani, the Persian G.O.C., and made arrangements for dealing with our claims on behalf of the lorry drivers 2730 1000 4.34by a different procedure before he learned that the Government of India intended the matter to be raised at the Conference*, and that in any case the atmosphere of the conference was so unfavourable that the British delegates unanimously decided that to raise these cases there might, in fact, prejudice our claims.' Colonel Daly discussed the claims in detail v/ith General Jehanbani, emphasising that these occurrences v/ould produce a very bad impression in India, especially if the Persian Government failed to make prompt reparation to the sufferers. General Jehanbani was impressed by this argument, and seemed sympathetic, and it was agreed that Colonel Daly should submit the claims direct to the Governor of Persian Baluchistan, v/ith whom the General promised to discuss the matter, cammuaieating, the recommendations which should be made to Tehran. 3 . A copy of Colonel Daly’s despatch to the Persian Governor, submitting claims amounting to about 58&gt;000 ria^s (about £830 at 70 ria|s to the £) in respect of physical injuries and material losses, and in respect of the two men killed by the Baluch rebels is enclosed in his letter of 27th February. It will be seen that the two men killed were not, in fact, forcibly compelled to drive in the disturbed area, but in view of the factMinute Paper. Department. that they met theirdeaths in carrying out dangerous work for the military authorities, who neglected to supply them with an adequate escort, it is suggested that a measure of responsibility rests on the military authorities to make some charitable provision for their families. Compensation is suggested on the same scale as would be paid in similar cases in India (viz. Rs. 2,000 for each life lost). 4. The Consul-General has since heard that the claims have been sent to Tehran, and that compensation (the amount of which has not been divulged) has been recommended. It appears that certain further cases of a similar kind have now come to light, but that Me | claims in respect of these have not yet been submitted to the Persian authorities (paragraphs 12 - 16 of Colonel Daly’s letter). Colonel Daly suggests that if we succeed in obtaining reasonable compensation in respect of the claims already submitted, it will then be easier to obtain satisfaction in respect of these later claims. &amp; c\ / SEEN POLITICAL CCi.i MITTESo APR 1955 2119 5000 8.33* \ 0 H CONFIDENTIAL. | r , , . - i y / *') f f /-V, L.m -\J g Letter from His Britannic MAfesTY’k ' G6 nsul- NERAL IN 'i Khorasan and Sistan, to His Britannic Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran, No. 32 (9/9), dated the 27th February 1935. // I have the honour to refer to paragraph 3 of my despatch No. 28 (1 /24), dated the 23rd February 1935, with which was forwarded a report on the proceedings at the Zahidan Conference. &gt; 2. When I proceeded to Zahidan I was unaware that it was the desire of the Government of India that the matter of compensation for Indian lorry drivers should be taken up at the Conference. Accordingly I took the opportunity of discussing the claims (before the Conference opened) with General Jehanbani. The General admitted in conversation that the lorries had been commandeered by the Military and that the drivers had been com pelled to drive inside the disturbed area. He also expressed the opinion that the small escorts provided had been inadequate, especi ally as the men were seated inside the covered lorries, on top of the load, and were thus quite unable to resist any sudden attack. 3. I then asked the ^General how he considered the matter had best be dealt with. Whether I should submit a claim for compen sation through my Legation or whether there would be a possibility of settling the matter locally. He replied that no useful purpose would be served by submitting the claims through the Legation, since the papers would, in any case, be referred to him for report and his recommendations. I gathered that the Military authorities would prefer to settle the matter within their own department and were not anxious that it should be brought up through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The General suggested that I should dis cuss the details more fully with him at a later date. 4. It was after the preliminary discussion outlined above that I received telegram No. 367 (No. 22 to Tehran) from the Government of India which indicated their desire that the claims should be dis cussed at the Conference. 5. In view of the fact that I had already determined, with General Jehanbani, the procedure to be adopted, and as it was prac tically certain that the Persian delegate at the Conference would state that he had no authority to discuss the matter, the British delegates were unanimously of the opinion that no useful purpose would be served by bringing it up at the Conference—in fact it might prejudice our claims, since the Persian delegate, even if he had been prepared to discuss them, would have fought every detail; while the General had appeared sympathetic and inclined to help in the matter. We felt, moreover, that claims amounting to a con siderable total, would so terrify the Persian delegate, who already was plainly unequal to shouldering any responsibility at all, that he would inevitably deny all responsibility on the part of his Gov ernment and once having done so, the Persian Government would be the less likely to support any recommendations from the General for payment of damages. 6. I again met General Jehanbani shortly before the close of the Conference and discussed the claims more fully. I read over to him the details of each claim and he admitted, in general, that they were reasonable. I laid particular stress on the fact that the two men who were killed had not been compelled to drive into the area of hostilities, but had gone in the ordinary course of their work as servants of the garage-owner who supplied the lorries. This being 733(C) f&amp;pd | --j INDIA FOREIGN 8 £eR£T/w'b 13al the case. I did not press for compensation a.s an undoubted right, but on the grounds that the men were employed on dangerous work for the Military authorities, and as it transpired, adequate escort had not been provided, and on grounds of charity the Persian Gov ernment could scarcely divest themselves of responsibility and that some reasonable provision should be made for the dependents of the deceased men. I mentioned that the compensation which would be paid in India would be Rupees two thousand per life lost. 7. As regards the other cases, in every one of which the men had been compelled by force, to drive their lorries in the dangerous area. I mentioned that the compensation was due as a right and was not merely a claim on the charity of the Persian Government. 8. Finally I asked the General how he suggested the claims should be submitted. He asked mp to send^them direct to General Mehdi Quli Khan, who had just been appointed Governor in Per sian Baluchistan at Zahedan, and further stated that he would discuss the matter with him and indicate the recommendations which should be made to the Ministry of War. 9. I then asked General Jehanbani whether a plain statement of the claims would be sufficient, inasmuch as we had discussed each in detail, or whether we might expect to become involved in a lengthy and profitless correspondence about every detail and the cost prices of all lorry spare parts, et cetera. I emphasised that these occurrences were becoming known in India and would create a very bad impression. That it was only a 'matter of time before those affected would, if they despaired of obtaining reparation, begin to press the Government of India inconveniently for assist ance questions might be asked in the Legislative Assembly and doubtless accounts would begin to appear in the Press, all of which would have the most undesirable effect. If therefore, the Persian Government agreed that reparation should be made, it was much m the interests of all parties that the matter should be settled with the least possible delay, and that the receipt of compensation by the sufferers, would stop any undue agitation on their part. 10. The General was undoubtedly impressed with these argu ments, and said that he would endeavour to obtain very early settle ment and that a plain statement of the claims would suffice. He would use his influence locally to minimise carrespondence in this respect. 11. Accordingly I sent to the Governor the despatch a copy of which is attached hereto. As both General Jehanbani and the Governor were absent in Kwash when the despatch was prepared, I deemed it unwise to delay its presentation, as I feared that General Jehanbani might leave Baluchistan before the despatch could be delivered should I await the return of the Governor to Zahedan. I therefore took the opportunity of sending the despatch to the Governor at Kwash by the hand of Colonel Arfa who was leaving the same day to ioin General Jehanbani. J 12. On my return to Zabul I found reports both from Meshed and Birjand of further cases in which British subjects had suffered loss due to commandeering of their vehicles. It was too late to add these to the previous claims, and moreover it seemed likely that the addition of these claims might alarm the General, who would be apprehensive that perhaps still jnore were coming, and consequently tend to make him unduly cautious in his recommendations to lehran. »13. The better plan appeared therefore, to allow matters to take their course, and if we succeeded in obtaining some reasonable compensation in respect of the claims already submitted, this tacit acknowledgment of their liability should render it easier to obtain satisfaction in respect of the later claims. 14. I therefore propose to address you in a separate despatch regarding the further claims since received from Meshed, in order, that you may be in possession of the facts should an opportunity occur at Tehran of pressing the matter. 15. I trust that the action taken by me will meet with your approval, and that General Jehanbani’s professions of sympathy may ultimately be translated into the tangible form of cash com pensation. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. Despatch from His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Khorasan, Zabul and Zahidan, Camp Zahidan, to His Excellency the Governor of Baluchistan and Sistan at Zahidan, No. Nil, dated the 19th February 1935. After Com'pliments. Your Excellency is doubtless aware that during the recent dis turbances in this area. 1. The lorries of certain British Subjects were commandeered by the military authorities for the purpose of carrying military stores to Khwash and Shoru and that in some cases loss of life, per sonal injuries, and material damage and loss of property resulted. 2. I attach hereto a list showing the' damages involved. Com pensation for injuries is based on the Government regulations which exist in India in respect of compensation payable and is based on the percentage of disability in each case as estimated by our medical officer who has had charge of the injured persons, three of whom are still in hospital at Zabul. 3. Compensation for loss of wages is based on the normal wages of the persons concerned for the period during which they cannot work owing to their injuries. 4. Compensation for damages to motor vehicles is based on actual cost of replacement of stolen or damaged parts and actual cost of repairs and does not include the loss which has resulted from the lorries being unable to ply for hire during the period they were damaged. 5. Your Excellency will note that in addition to the above, two persons were killed. This case is somewhat different from the others inasmuch as the individuals were not forcibly compelled to proceed to Shoru but did so in their capacity as servants of the garage which contracted to carry the military stores. Nevertheless, bearing in mind the fact that they proceeded, for the benefit of the Imperial Military authorities, into an area which was notoriously dangerous, and which was not in consequence open to normal traffic and that the military authorities in recognition of this state of affairs provided an escort which proved insufficient to adequately„proteet them, my Government is of opinion that the Imperial Military authorities will agree that some measure of responsibility rests upon them to make charitable provision for the families of the deceased men. The compensation which would normally be paid in India for loss of life would amount to Rupees two thousand (12 thousand Rials) for each life lost.Although I am not desirous of pressing for this^ exact sum in view of the circumstances stated above I trust Your Excellency will see fit to recommend to the responsible authorities the payment of a sum which may be regarded as reasonable charitable compensation and sufficient to make some adequate provision for the support of the dependents of the deceased. 6. The other cases of injury and losses fall under a quite differ ent heading, inasmuch as the persons concerned were compelled by the military against their wishes, to proceed to the area of danger and in their cases my Government is of opinion that their lull claims are justifiable. 7. In conclusion I would state that this matter has been fully discussed by His Excellency Amir Lashkar Amanuliah Mirza Jehanbani and myself, ana that His Excellency is fully aware or the circumstances and I would request that you will be so good as to apply to him for any further elucidation which you may desire.

Extract from Diary for the montn of December 1934 of H.B.M. Consulate General, Khorassan and Sistan. (i) Persian Baluchistan . The Persians have made little progress in their efforts to pacify the Baluchis* Robberies ana attacks on isolated posts have been continual. On the night of 2/3rd December juma Khan was attacked but repulsed the troops whose losses amounted to about 100 men. wounded were brought by night to Zahidan on December 4th. Small detachments of troops to reinforce the K-wash garrison have been arriving at intervals from Meshed, Zabul and Kerman. They are mostly conscripts recalled to the colours. The rebels are in a strong position on high hills. Aeroplanes have been unable to fly high enough to keep out of range, ana are now lying out of action at Kwa5o. The Baluchis have made several successful sorties from their stronghold, in each case surprising the Military, inflicting casua lties and capturing arms. The worst feature of the Military operations, as regards British interests, is tnat lorries owned and driven by Indians have been commandeered to take rations from Zahidan to Kwash. The driver of one lorry, so commandeered, works on a long term visa between Kundi and Zahidan ana had to furnim cash security at trie frontier for his early return from Zahidan, to prevent nis working in the interior of Persia. He informed the Military authorities of this, and that his money would be confiscated. As they refused to listen to his/ %r*ir2 his plea, he proceeded to the Vice Consulate. While he was away the Persian troops forced his cleaner to drive the lorry to the place where it was to he loaded. When loaded tney attempted to force the cleaner to leave for Kwash without the owner-driver. On his refusal, he was publicly beaten and struck with rifle butts. Meanwhile H.B.M.'s Vice Consul had made representations to the Governor, and an orderwas given for the troops to release the lorry, whereupon they again beat the cleaner, but released the lorry. On the 12th, three lorries driven by HAZKA 3H\ T GH, DAHBA2A 3INGH, and MOHAN SINGH were command eereu and taken to Kwash. On the 13th tney returned escorted only by two soldiers in each lorry. Shortly after leaving Kwash they found the camp of some road repairers deserted and looted, and a little further on a Gendarme post aesertea ana burnt. The Indians pointed out that the post was alright the previous day, ana that it would be safer to return to Kwash. me soldiers, however, compelled them to proceed. They were attacked by Baluchis. Four soldiers were killed sitting in the lorries. Only one man made any attempt to fight and he was killed. 'Three fled. i The drivers were all wounaed, three being unable to drive, owing to wounds in the hana. One, wounded in the shoulder^ succeeded in returning on foot to Kwahi. No attempt was made to bring in the others for four days, after which tney were taken to the Military Hospital at Kwadi. The man wno first reached Kwash ran away from there and reachea Zahidan from where he proceeded to zabul to report to His Majesty's Consul General. He states that the wounds of the other drivers had all become septic, ana that they would probably lose their hands, if not their lives. All the lorries were damaged and looted of tyres, spares, etc.3 Notwithstanding this occurrence and others of a less serious nature, the Persians continue to force drivers, inadequately escorted, to use tne Kwash road. A report has just now been received to the effect that two, one Sikh, and one MuhaMnadan, both British Indian suojects, have been killed. There are many lorries owned and driven by Persians at Zahidan, and trie action of the Persians of commandeering those of British subjects for sucn dangerous work is entirely unjustifiable. The military precautions taken to protect the lorries were of such a nature that tne officers responsible are manifestly unfit for any sort of command. No effort at all has been made to organise convoys, which should be guarded by at least two lorries witn soldiers and nachine guns. A report now received is to the effect that General Jehanbani has arrived at Zahiaan from Tehran with Idu Khan. It is to be hoped that he will follow tne advice of lou Khan ana secure the removal of the present General Officer Commanding in Baluchistan whose harsh treatment of the tribes has undoubtedly brought about the present conditions. There are the usual signs that the Persians are pre pared to believe tne wildest rumours to tne effect that the Baluchis are instigated or at least supported by the British. Captain Bose, while at Zahidan, made several excursions in the locality, which appear to have caused great suspicion. One trip which he maue to Kuh-i-Kwajeh (near sistan) gave rise to the rumour that he had gone there to install a wireless transmitting station. It is significant that a Sardar who befriended Captain i?ose at Daulatabad, near Kuh-i-Kwajeh, has been sent under arrest to/ ...rr, '.Jimto Tehran, and two unfortunate villagers who supplied transport and acted as guides have been ilung into prison. A police xvgent has been placed outside the Consulate Cate at Zabul, ana remains there to report all who enter or leave the Consulate. Under the circumstances H.L. *s Vice Consuls have been instructed to refrain from touring at present, arid in case of small trips for shooting etc. to inform the local authorities of their intentions before proceeding.163/U/1 Consulate-General for Khorasssan and Sistan. 2abul 20-12-34. Sir, I have the honour to report that it has been brought to my notice that the Persian Passport Officer at Quetta is refusing Visa to British-Indian subjects to enter Persia where the holder is shown to be a motor driver or cleaner. (2) Recently at ^ahidan a British Indian subject who was formerly a trader became a motor driver. H.B.M*© Vice-Consul altered the entry under ’•Profession’* in this individuals passport to 'Totor driver** and attested the alteration. 'The man applied to the Persians for a long-term Visum to work on the Kundi-Zahiden road. This was refused on the ground that he had altered his profession to ? T otor driver. He was given to understand that he would be granted a Visum if he took out another passport . In other words the hint was that the new passport should not show him as a Ho tor Driver. (3) It seems clear that instructions have been issued to refuse Visa to British subjects working as Drivers in Persia. (4) Ihis action seems to be of a purely discriminatory jk nature, designed to eliminate the compet^on of Indian Drivers with Persians, and if peristed &amp; would seem to, call for retaliatory measures. 'There seems no reason why we should grant long term Visa to Persian Drivers on special terms enabling them to work in India( as far as Kundi ) while British Indian Subjects are being deprived of this privilege.(!«»(•) (5) I am not aware whether the Persians are taking similar action against Russian Iraqi and other nationalies all of whom are represented in the ICotor Driving class in considerable numbers.

Sir, Long Term Tisa for Motor Drivers (1) I have the honour to refer to my Despatch No. 168/11/1 of 20-12-34 to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, a copy of which was forwarded to you under Endorsement No. 422 of 20/12/34; and to state that it has been represented to me by Motor Drivers that the Persian Passport Officer at Quetta has recently insisted on their depositing a considerable sum of money with him before he will give them Tisa. ( 2 ) If this be correct, the explanation which the Passport Officer would doubtless give, would be that this sum was required as a guarantee that the vehicle would not be disposed of in Persia. (3) The arrangement by which long term Tisa covering three months are issued by us to Persian Subjects was on a pirely reciprocal basis, and if it be true that British Indian Subjects are obliged to lodge a sum of money, or produce a guarantee for the same, they are placed at a disadvantage visa-a-vis their Persian competitors from whom no such demand is made by us. (4) Whereas there is actually no Customs duty on Motor Vehicles imported into Persia (although an import Licence is necessary) and therefore no real danger to Persian interests, the same does not apply toto India, and it has not infrequently occurred that Persian drivers dispose of their second-hand lorries in India at a price better than that which can be obtained in Persia, by reason of the fact that lorries imported into India by other than the njast Persian Frontier have been subject to Indian Customs duty. (5) Perhaps, if you think it desirable, enquiry might be made as to the exact terms which the Persian Passport Officer insists upon before granting Visa, as it would seem desirable that, if the Per sians persist in such demands, we should take reciprocal action at Zahidan, both to assist British Indian Subjects who are working at a disadvantage, and to protect ourselves from Persian- owned vehicles being sold in India to the detriment of Customs Revenue. (6) The policy of the Persians at the present time in East Persia is evidently to place every obstacle in the way of Transporters who are of British nationality, and to drive them off the roads. It is difficult to retaliate as regards the interior, but the Kundi road lies for the greater part in British territory, and there seems no reason why ire should not insist on atleast equal terms for British and Persian Subjects.

Up to the end of January the issue of long-period Visas to British drivers who have to cross the frontier to Kundi, had not been started at Zahidan, although the procedure has long been sanctioned by the Central authorities. Nevertheless the Central authorities saw fit to address a complaint to H*M. Legation, that we were not reciprocating as regards Persian drivers. The ostensible reason for not issuing these Visas is that the police were unaware of the Kran equivalent of 10 gold Prancs and had to refer to Meshed. It could, of course, have been ascertained from the local banks. About 10th January he was instructed to charge Krans 35/TO. This did not however satisfy the Police, who then again referred to Meshed to enquire, whether the same rule wa s to apply to Prench drivers. The actual reason for all this is that as long as the Head of the Police has the power to issue Visas for each trip, he is in a position to require each driver to smuggle to him from India some small perquisite, such as clothing, shoes, etc. whereas once Long-term Visas start he will be in a less easy position in the matter. Smuggling is rife all along the border and it may be assumed that the withdrawal of the railhead is costing the Persians a very great deal. Humour has it that the G-.O.C. in the Sarhad, and some other officials, have a vary efficient service of smugglers under their !their control and for this reason will no doubt use all their influence in Tehran to oppose the return of the railway to ’ ahidanTelegram R.No.3 aatea(ana. reod) SOth January 1932 From Minister, Tehran To • ••• •••• Foreign, New Delhi / Your telegram of the 18th instant 98-T.

The Persian chauffeurs are often refused permission for passing through (travelling), whereas necessary facilities are being extended by the competent authorities of the Imperial Government in respect of journeys of Indian chauffeurs who are travelling on the route in question. The Imperial Ministry for Foreign Affairs requests that immediate orders may be issued to the authorities concerned in order that necessary facilities may be extended by the British Consulate in Zahedan in respect of visas to passports of Persian subjects who are travelling between Zahedan and Nuk Kundi. It is also requested that this Ministry may be informed of the result of the steps which will be taken with a view to ranedying the present situation.

I have the honour to inform you that the opening of the Zahidan-Nok-Kundi road to a considerable volume of traffic, consequent on the withdrawal of railhead to the latter place, has given rise to the necessity for consider ing arrangements for the registration of vehicles &amp; issue of driving licenses for the purpose of operating in British territory. 2 # This matter was discussed on the occasion of my recent meeting with the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan &amp; I understood that the Baluchistan authori ties would be prepared to make arrangements for the regis tration &amp; issue of licenses at Hok-Kundi, to obviate the har rihhin which would result from an enforced visit to Quetta ENCLOSURE W , the purpose. INDIA FOREIGN SECRETK* -T i etter wo MA f. jBefore, however, such an arrangement be made, which Dated 3 DEC 1031 Reeeivec 21 DKG. 193 i woulddriver must proceed to Meshed* which would ents-il absence from duty for a fortnight or more &amp; considerable expense to Govern ment. This in spite of the fact that the man holds an Indian license &amp; is an ex-N*C.O. of a Military transport unit &amp; manifestly an efficient driver. 7 # I have discussed the matter since arrival here with the local Police Officer &amp; enquired what was meant t&gt;y 1 The Consul’s responsibility* referred to in para.6 above. He informed me that the issue of a license was solely to ensure that there should be no dangerous drivers on the road. If an accident took place 8c a pedestrian were killed the Court would auto matically exhonerate a driver who held a license, for he must surely be a good driver Sc the fault could not be hisV 8* The farcical nature of the regulations is apparent from a recent occurrence near Mirjawa, where an Indian, who had no license, upset his lorry through sheer carelessness &amp; injured a number of passengers including an Mnglish nurse. Probably because the injured persons were all foreigners, the man has not received any punishment. 9. I would therefore suggest that, the date from which we should grant to Persians the facility of obtaining driving licenses Sc of registering their vehicles at Hok-Kundi,should co-incide with the date from which the Persians are prepared to allow British drivers, resident far south of Meshed, to enjoy similar facilities at ^ahidan Sc that until su^.^. time a Persian driver who travels to Kundi should not be permitted to return through British territory until he proceed to Quetta to register his vehicles Sc obtain a driving license* Copies of this despatch are being forwarded to the Government of India, foreign and Political Department and to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General in Baluchistan, quetta.
