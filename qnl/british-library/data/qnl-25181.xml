I —V Sir, I have the honour to transmit herewith a Report upon Sanitary Matters in Mesopotamia, the Shiah Holy Cities and on the Turco-Persian Frontier. It will be recalled that, in the winter of 1913-1914, the Constantinople Board of Health despatched to those regions a Commission, charged with the study of the sanitary defences there. As explained in the accompanying Report - which is a summary of the Commission’s work - the Report of the Commission itself (in French) was in course of being printed when the rupture with Turkey took place. I have since had no opportunity of communicating to His Majesty’s Government the information collected in the course of the Commission’s inquiries. YThile a considerable portion of it can have but an academic interest under present circumstances much of it may perhaps claim to be of sufficient permanent value to justify the preparation of the accompanying Report. I am led to understand that the contents of the Report would prove of interest to the heads of the Army Medical Service in connection with the military operations in Mesopotamia; and I am therefore venturing to send a duplicate copy of the Report to that Department of the War Office.

CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION. T HE despatch to Mesopotamia and the Turco-Persian frontier of a mission composed of representatives of the Powers principally interested in the sanitary defences of those regions was no new idea, though*it was not realised until the winter of 1913-14. It was broached for the first time (or perhaps not even for the first time) in the International Sanitary Conference of Constantinople, in 1866, by the Persian delegate, at the 35th sitting of that Conference. The delegates of Turkey, Prance and Eussia opposed the suggestion, and, as the majority of delegates shared their view, the proposal was not insisted upon. Sixteen years later the project was again revived, on this occasion by the German delegate, who spoke of it as having been put forward by the Cabinet of Vienna. The delegates of Sweden and Norway and of Austro-Hungary supported the motion with a slight amendment (at the 29th sitting), and thus amended, the proposal was carried. No practical effect was, however, given to the decision, and 29 more years elapsed before the project was again spoken of. The last Mixed Commission for Revision of the Ottoman Sanitary Tariff (which was still in session when the rupture between Turkey and the Entente Powers took place) formulated a “ voeu ” as to the desirability of sending a mission to the regions in question; and on April 26th, 1911, the Persian delegate formally proposed to the Con stantinople^ Board of Health to send such a mission, charged with the studv of all questions relating to the reorganisation of the sanitary defences there. The Board adopted the proposal “ en principe.” Later it was decided to entrust the work to two separate Commissions, one for the northern portion of the frontier, and the other for the southern portion and the Shiah holy cities of Irak-Arabi. The former carried out its mission in July 1911, and issued a brief report dealing with the sanitary defences of the northern third of the frontier. The departure of the second Commission was twice adjourned—firstlv on account of the International Sanitary Conference in Paris in the winter of 1911-1*, and secondly on account of the Turco-Balkan war of 1912-13. Ultimately the Commission left Constantinople in November 1913. The mission was composed of the delegates of Great Britain, Eussia, Persia and Germany and of a Turkish representative. It was charged with the study not only of the southern two-thirds of the Turco-Persian frontier, but also with that of the reorganisation of the Basra lazaret and of the sanitary dangers of the Shiah pilgrimage and transport of corpse^ to Irak-Arabi and the measures needed to meet those dansrers. O The mission returned to Constantinople in April 1914. A detailed Eeport (in French) was prepared by myself, as “ rapporteur,” signed by all the members of the mission, and presented to the Board of Health in the following June. It was at once ordered to be printed. The outbreak of the European war caused serious delays at the printers (a French firm), and the printing was still far from completed when the rupture with Turkey led to the hurried eTxodus from Constantinople of subjects of the Entente Powers. While the bulk of the Eeport was saved, I greatly regret that a large quantity of notes, observations B2 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS and archives bearing on the questions dealt with were, of necessity, left behind in Constantinople and cannot for the present be recovered. The present Report is an endeavour to summarise the information obtained on the spot and incorporated in the French Report, while omitting many details (such, for example, as those of the actual condition of the Rasra and Khanikin lazarets and the plans for their reconstruction) which can now have but an academic interest, and bringing forward those points which may directly or indirectly, be of use m the present or the near future. ^ The report dealt with the following main questions: ( 1 ) the reoro-mi^ ■on of the Basra lazaret ; (2) the reorgauiaation of the Khanikin kfzaret ,• («!) the sanitary aspect of the pilgrimage and transport of corpses to the Shiah holy cities; and (4) the sam ary defences of the central and southern portions H ,lt Jr C erslan 1 ntler /i 1,1 the present re P° rt matters will be dealt n.th more or less in the same order, though, unfortunately, the 4th chapter was among the papers I was unable to save. ^ The report was illustrated by a large number of maps, plans and estimates for the new lazarets of Basra and Khanikin (drawn up by local architects from indications given by the Commission), and of tabl s, photouranhs and otlZ illustrations. Many of these are omitted here, for the reasons j ust »iven The thorough reorganisation of the two lezarets just mentioned and the carrying out of the other proposals of the Commission would, it was honed mit an end to what had become little less than a scandal in the condition of the sanitary defences of these regions. That those defences bad been so neglected and the lazarets allowed to fall into such a state of disrepair and inefficiency was due mainly to the peculiar circumstances of the financial relations between the Constantinople Board of Health and the Turkish Government. These need not be described in full here, and it will suffice to mention the follow in* fact* M hile the Constantinople Board of Health was responsible for the cost” administration of the Turkish lazarets, the cost of building and unkeen of lazarets and similar establishments was, under binding “intorn^-^i f tions, at the charge of the Turkish’ Gotu^^^Go^rnmerrad' however, for a long series of years, endeavoured to evade its obligations 'n this matter and the peculiar position ivas thus brought about that, wWle he Board of Health possessed a reserve, invested in public funds, of nearly .£100 non i was unable to spend any of this sum on the much-nodded SnifaGon of the lazarets without infringing the conventions in question unlels and lil those conventions were altered. Such altentinn i i , anci untl l by the Mixed Commission for Revision of the Ottoman Sanitary which bad been convoked on four different oecTsfons si^thrve^ ISfi/ Jhis Commission was summoned for the fifth time in iqnr, ! T T 186 , 9 - to tliat date the Board of Health despatched to all the lazaret! of f Empire a series of missions of inspection, whose reports cint^nid c i?

The Lazaret and other Sanitary Defences of Basra. The miserable collection of buildings known as the lazaret of Basra cons titutes * the sole attempt on the part of Turkey to provide a barrier against the entrance of plague and cholera to Mesopotamia and Irak-Arabi by the Shatt-ul-Arab river. It has long been a byword for inefficiency, and has tended to increase rather than to check the spread of disease. If properly organised and administered it should play an important part in the network of sanitary defences in these regions. Those defences were the subject of discussion in the International Sanitary Conferences of 1891, 1897, 1903 and 1911-12. In that of 1894, the Convention which followed provided for the creation of a large lazaret at Fao (near the mouth of the Shatt-ul-Arab), with a series of smaller stations at Basra and in the ports on both sides of the Persian Gulf. His Majesty’s Government, however, declined to accept the portion of the Convention embodying those proposals. The 1897 Convention proposed only a lazaret at Basra and another “ sentinel ” lazaret near the entrance of the Gulf—Hormuz or Kishm being suggested as suitable sites. This proposal wns repeated in the 1903 Convention and accepted by His Majesty’s Government, but under certain reservations and conditions, which need not be repeated here but which practically rendered nugatory the proposal. All these proposals were tacitly dropped in the last Conference, that of 1911-12, and the Convention which followed merely prescribed (Article 83) that the general measures against plague, cholera and yellow fever applicable under that Convention in all ports would be equally applied in the ports of the Persian Gulf by the sanitary authorities of the ports, with certain slight modifications. Meanwhile, and for some years before the last Conference, a series of sani tary stations and lazarets had been established in the Persian ports of the Gulf, and these have been administered, under the auspices of the Indian Government, by British Indian officials. Attempts have been repeatedly made to alter the status of these stations and to bring them under some form of international control, and German influence has frequently been brought to bear in this direction—but fortunately without success. The geographical position of Basra. The town of Basra is situated on a creek or canal, the Ashar creek, which opens into the Shatt-ul-Arab on its right (w^est) side. The town itself is about three kilometres (or nearly two miles) away from the river, but at the mouth of the creek there has grown up the suburb of Ashar, a townlet of some size; while along the west bank of the river, mainly to the south of Ashar, are scattered many important buildings such as the foreign consulates, the offices of the principal shipping companies, the port-captain’s office, the sanitary office and so forth. The distance from Ashar to the small port of Fao, at the entrance of the Shatt-ul-Arab is 62 miles (100 kilometres) and that from Ashar to the “bar ” is 84 miles (134 kilometres). The “bar” or sandbank off the mouth of the river is an important topographical feature in this region. At low winter only ships of light draught can cross it. Ships of deeper draught are compelled either to wait—sometimes for as much as one or even tw 7 o weeks—until a favour able combination of wind and tide deepens the water sufficiently for them to cross, or to discharge their cargoes into lighters, which are then tow^ed up the river to Basra. The consequent delays are one of the many obstacles that shipping has to contend with in these w aters. Annexed is a sketch-map of the port of Basra, indicating the position of the principal buildings. It will be seen that they are mostly on the right * Though the present tense is nsed here and throughout the Report, it should be understood that all the state ments made in this Report apply solely to the conditions found prevailing in the winter of 1913-14. b 24 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS (west) bank of the river. The only ones of importance on the left bank are the Turkish naval hospital (15 on the plan), just opposite to the Ashar creek ; a small country house on the plot of land known as Kut-el-Djou (at one time proposed as the site for the new lazaret of Basra), and the actual Basra lazaret. The Shatt-uhArab is the river formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates. 1 he village of Gourna (or Kurna)—the traditional site of the Garden of Eden—is situated in the fork formed by the.junction of the rivers Hie distance between Ashar and Gourna is 40 miles (64 kilometres). Some 22 miles (35 kilometres) south-east of Ashar is the Persian town of Mohammerah, situated on the river Karun, close to where this river flows into • ie i ^ Mt (eaS } } Side - The Sheikh of Mohammerah is (or was in 1914) Sheikh Ehazal, reputed to be of great wealth and of considerable power in this district. He owned not only a large area of land on the left bank of the river, but also many of the islands situated between Mohammerah and Basra Though nominally under the suzerainty of Persia, he is practically an Biitfsh Government ^ 1 belleTe ’ be6n treated as such ^ the nc., T t t0Wn 0 r^ aSr ? is Said to .

The principal navigation companies sending ships regularly to the Shatt-ul-Arab were the following :— The British India Company, which sent every Tveek from Bombay a ship touching at few ports and known as the “ fast mail ”, and a slow ship, touching at many ports and known as the “ slow mail The former did the journey from Bombay to Basra in 7 days and from Karachi in 5 days ; fhe “slowmail ” took 15 and 13 days respectively. The slow boats were of some 2.000 tons ; the fast were of some 500 to 700 tons, but these were, in 1914, to have been replaced by new vessels of some 2,000 tons. The local agents are Messrs. Grev Mackenzie &amp; Co. The Hussain Company of Steam Navigation and Commerce sent from four to six ships annually from Odessa to Basra; they also were of about 2,000 tons. The Hambourg-Amerika Company sent from 12 to 18 ships a year of a tonnage between 2,500 and 3,000. The Strick Company sent from 10 to 12 ships a year, of from 2,000 to 2,500 tons. The Arab Steamers Company sent 4 or 5 ships a year, of from 700 to 1,500 tons. The local agent was Abdul Jubar Haidari. The Shustri Company recently began to send pilgrim ships, irregularly, from Bombay to Basra. Their local agent was also Abdul Jubar Haidari The Bucknall Steamship Company sent some 5 or 6 laro-e car^o boats annually from London and Antwerp to Basra; thier agents were 5 Messrs. Grey Mackenzie and Company. ’ ' ’ The Bombay, Bersia Company sent some 7 or 8 ships, mostly for the pilgrim traffic; their agent was Agha Jaffar. Finally, other ships visited the Gulf ports and Basra from time to time mostly during the season of pilgrimage and at the date harvest. The movement of shipping in the port of Basra has tended to increase in recent years, and with the development of irrigation projects in Mesopotamia and the completion of the Bagdad and other railways, the importance of Basra as a shipping centre was expected to have increased still further. Table I shows the number and Table II the tonnage of the ships entering the port of Basra in the ten years 1903-1913. It will be seen that the over whelming proportion of steamers were under the British fla* • the yearly average of British ships being 167-4, out of a total average of 185-3 or over 90 per cent. The number of British steamers rose from 136 in the first year of the Table to 211 in the last, while their tonnage rose from 162,560 to 298,498. Both tables show that German shipping was unknown in the port before the year 1906-07. In that year 8 German steamers arrived in Basra, and this number increased to 13 or 14 in the last years of the tables while the tonnage increased from 12,566 in 1906-07 to 38,337 in 1911-12 and 33,832 in 1912-13. ,, A table (omitted here) of the unitary dues on shipping at Basra shows that British shipping contributed an average of P. 73,729 a year, out of a total average of P. 89,850, or 82-6 per cent. The actual lazaret of Basra and the question of its transfer ELSEWHERE. It would serve but little purpose to describe here the lazaret of Basra as it existed in 1913-14 and as it was fully described in the report of the mission • or to reproduce the detailed proposals made in that Report for its complete reconstruction and enlargement on the present site and on a plot of land adjoining. It consisted of a few brick building in a bad state of repair and several sm/bfo or matting huts. There was a small disinfecting pavilion with but a single steam stove of the firm of Geneste, Herscher of Paris * The separation of different groups of passengers in quarantine was ludicrouslyIIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 7 imperfect. Th^re was no hospital, no proper water supply or latrine accom modation ; and, briefly the whole institution was so inadequate in size and installation and in repair that its entire reconstruction had become an absolute necessity. The question of the removal of this lazaret to another site Las been raised on innumerable occasions in the Constantinople Board of Health and in the international Sanitary Conferences, and as this point is of considerable general interest, as it throws light on some of the local conditions, and as it may come to be a question of practical importance in the future (whatever may be the ultimate political fate of these regions), it may be briefly dealt with here. A large number of different sites have been suggested during the last three or four decades, but no better site than the actual one has ever been found. To go no further back than the last dozen years, the following are the principal sites that have been proposed :—Fao; Mibrak and other places, such as Abou’l Hassib, Lokta, Fayalaraba, on the west bank of the river and south of Ashar ; Kut-el-Djou; and the island of Shemshumieh. Each of these has been strenuously advocated, but each presents serious disadvantages. Fao is a small telegraph station on the west bank of the river, near its mouth. The representatives of His Majesty’s Government have invariablv, both in the International Conferences and in the Constantinople Board of Health, firmly opposed the removal of the lazaret to this point; while Turkey has frequently desired it, for what were undoubtedly mainly political reason. The objections to the site are many, of which may be mentioned the following. At Fao and for many miles further up the river only one bank of the stream belong to Turkey, the other bank being Persian; it is too far from Basra (84 kilometres), so that were ships compelled to do quarantine here, the difficulties and delays to shipping and to passengers would be immensely increased; the district is exceedingly malarious; and the provisioning of a lazaret at this distant and isolated spot would be a matter of great difficulty. filihrak, Abou'l-FIassib and the other points on the west bank south of Ashar have the great disadvantage of being on the mainland instead of on an island, so that isolation would be difficult, and as these sites are all covered with date plantations, the cost of expropriation would be excessive. Kut-el-Djou (see sketch map II) is situated on the eastern bank of the river, north* of the present lazaret site, from which it is separated by the canal of Salihieh. It is therefore actually nearer to Basra than the existing lazaret (the proximity of which to the town has been the sole reason for proposing a change of site). It is also not far from the naval hospital; the land is low and marshy and would need to be artificially raised at great cost; and, finally this site offers no advantages of any kind over the existing site. Shemshumieh Island had been very strongly recommended as a suitable position for the new lazaret. Between Ashar and Mohammerah the four principal islands along the left bank of the river are those of Salihieh or Ajeravieh, Taweila, Shemshumieh and Dabba or Umm-el-Khassassif. Each of these may be briefly considered, leaving the first, Ajeravieh, upon which the actual lazaret is built, to the last. Taweila is SJ kilometres long, and from 300 to 400 metres wide. On its east side is a small village of 50 huts, called Shiradji, inhabited by Arabs of the Mashid tribe. It is mainly covered with date plantations. Shemshumieh is about two kilometres long and 400 metres wide. Several huts are found on the island, inhabited by Arabs of the tribe of Sheikh Hassan. In considering Shemshumieh as a possible site for the lazaret, a point of primary importance to notice is that the frontier line between Turkey and Persia as recently delimitated, descends to the river—or rather to the canals parallel with the river—well to the north* of the island. At the same time that the sanitary commission was examining these regions (1913-14), the Frontier Delimitation Commission was establishing tbe exact line between the two countries. The exact course of this portion of the frontier is shown by the red line in the * For tbe poke of convenience tbe Sbatt-nl Arab ia regarded as running from north to douth, though as a matter of fact its course is mainly from north-west to south-east, and is often more from west to east than from north to south.O REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS annexed sketeh-map (No. Ill) It will there be seen that the frontier line descends towards the south to a point situated between the Nahr-i-Diaidii and he Iiahr Abu-1-Arabid, that it then follows the medium fil um „ qua e of the Kha^vm Canal to a point where this rejoins the Skatt-ul-Arab at the mouth of «ie Aahr J,azaileh ; it then passes along the river about midway between the Persian coast and the island of Umm-ul-Khassassif, ultimately turning to the mainland again at Tuwaijat, a short distance south of the Karun river The port of Mohammerah is thus left on the Persian side of the frontier. ' 11 It is evident from the above that one main objection to Shemshumieh as the site ot the lazaret is the same as in the case of Pao, mentioned above— ^ °“ e ba^ of the river here is Turkish. Moreover evasion of the lazaret by persons wishing to do so would be even easier than at present since they could land m Persia pass by the lazaret without leavin' PersTan te ntory, and cross the river well to the north of it in order to reach Basra Other objections to Shemshumieh are-that the island is a very low one and t0 be raised at ' reat before a lazaret could be tntVjf lt; ’ ( hat t !f P rov ' ls i Iomn g Of a lazaret hero would be difficult, owin&lt;- to the distance from Basra, while were it provisioned from Mohammerah which is much nearer, the cost would be much greater, owing to the existence of Pinlfl CU 'fT S !° n a ?'

Steps were being taken by the Commission to arrange for the acquisition of the land for the Constantinople Boam of Health under the Turkish law of expropriation, when 0 the owner suddenly died, and the land became the property of his heirs All further steps were brought to an end by the outbreak of the war. . 1 ^ 0 U P tlie preceding paragraphs, it may be said that no site in the neighbourhood of Basra so favourable as the existing site at Salihieh could be found for the lazaret or sanitary station which will always be required in this port, to whatever Power these regions may belong after the war. Salihieh is not a wholly ideal site, but it would seem to be the best available. The land is somewhat low, and a good deal of “ remblayage ” or artificial raising of the and would be required. But on the existimr site much of this has already been done, the general level having been raised by about one metre. Embank ments, of about PoO metre in height have also been raised on the river and canal fronts, to prevent inundations. These embankments were renewed every year by the proprietor; they are made of the river mud, and as they were always added to on the river side, they have gradually become wider and wider and thus more and more land has been gradually reclaimed from the T* 1 XTO Y* rV/a/’l As the result of the fullest inquiry, it was established that the site is never inundated by overflow of the river across the embankments; at most, durino- the months of March to June, the site becomes damp and in places muddy 5 from percolation of the water through the soil. ^ Measures applied or to be applied to ships \t Basra. In the past ships from European ports were subjected to no special measures at Basra, if they had not called at a contaminated or suspected port. On the other hand, ships from India and the Ear East, which constituted more than half the whole, have been subjected at different times to varying but generally unnecessarily vexatious measures by decision of the Constant^ nople Board of Health. In the future, whatever mav be the political fate of 1 off 1 r o”T' 1S ;. ] ‘, hc P r ?. visio , ns of the International Sanitary Convention of ou . both here and at Mohammerah. A much-needed uniformity will thus be introduced and long and unnecessary quarantines will be done away with. Another advantage will be that evasions of the sanitary authorities, so frequent m the past, will no longer occur or will at least become less frequent. In the past large numbers of persons landed at Mohammerah where the measures were more reasonable, took a small boat there or at some point above, and proceeded across to Basra at nigbt, thus escaping all sanitary control by the Turkish authorities. The obvious remedy w r as to make the measures at Basra of the same reasonable character as those at Mohammerah but it was impossible to induce the Turkish authorities to accept this con- Of recent years ordinary ships (i.e., not pilgrim ships) from India and the Ear East with clean bills of health were admitted to pratique after favourable medical visit in the first Turkish port where there was a health office and doctor Those with “ foul ’* bill of health, if in good sanitary condition (i.e. without cases of plague or cholera on board), if less than five days from the last Indian port, were subjected to as many days of quarantine as required to complete the five days, to disinfection and application of the Circular con cerning rat destruction (decision of February 6th, 1912). This was a great improvement on the onerous measures previously in force. 5 Ships with Shiah pilgrims on board from Indian ports were, for some years after the appearance of plague in India in 1896, absolutely’ prohibited from coming to Basra. Later (by decision of March 26th, 1901) they were allowed to bring up to 5 of such pilgrims per 100 tons of nett register, but were e ,X® n ^ ien Ejected to ten full days’ quarantine in the Basra lazaret and still later (on September iOth, 1912) these measures were still further relaxed. It was then decided that ships could carry up to 10 Shiah pilgrims from Indian c10 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS ports per 100 tons register, and that this could he increased to 20 per cent, if the ship was provided with a disinfecting stove, a doctor and a pharmacy. Such ships were subject only to the measures above summarised prescribed by the decision of February 6th, 1912, for ordinary ships. Ships with more than 10 or 20 per cent, of pilgrims respectively were under no circumstances to be admitted to the port of Basra and were to be (and in some instances were) repulsed if they arrived there. Such repulsions or attempts at repulsion naturally caused much trouble and led to some unfortunate incidents. Such difficulties would at once cease were the clauses of the International Convention applied here. To apply them some form of lazaret or sanitary station will be a necessity. The future lazaret of Basra. To whatever Power it may fall to provide for the sanitary defences of Basra, some lazaret will, as just stated, be required. Infected ships do arrive here from time to time and in such cases, even under the Convention the sick have to be removed to hospital and the passengers to he landed and subjected to “observation” or “surveillance” for a certain period. “Suspect” and even “ indemnes ” ships have to be subjected to disinfection processes. 'Ihe reorganised lazaret must therefore be provided with disinfecting apparatus, with hospitals for infectious and other diseases, and with means for isolating infected groups of persons. The plans^ proposed by the Commission for the new lazaret may be very briefly summarised here. A brick wall of 2m. 50 in height, was to be built round the whole site. Seven “ cordons ”—a probably unnecessarily high number—would have ’ been provided ; in each cordon were to be two houses, each containing four rooms, 8 metres long and 5 metres wide. Wide verandahs all round each house are a necessity in such a climate, and an outside staircase leading to the roof is equally desirable, since in the hot season all persons in these regions sleep by preference on the roofs of their houses. Landing-piers, a disinfecting pavilion, houses for better class passengers, hospitals, a proper water supply and system of excreta disposal, houses for the director and for the staff, a laboratory, depots and other subsidiary buildings were all provided for in the Commission’s plans. According to estimates prepared by a local architect, the cost of carrving out these proposals would have amounted to some £T.21,000 (about £19,000 sterling), and tlrs was the credit asked for by the Commission, to be taken from the sum of £T.280,000 which, as stated in the preceding chapter, had been voted for the reorganisation of all the Turkish lazarets. All details of these new constructions are omitted here, and the plans and drawings prepared by the local architect were unfortunately left in Constantinople. But a few w r ords may he said respecting the questions of water supply and of excreta disposal, since special precautions on these points will always he necessary, in view of the local conditions, and the Commission’s observations in regard to them may be of practical use in the future. Water-supply. Everywhere in the neighbourhood of Basra (and indeed all along the valleys of the Tigris and Shatt-ul-Arab) the inhabitants are accustomed to drink—apparently with impunity—the river water, unboiled and frequently unfiltered. Many of them, however, do filter the water, through porous earthenware vessels, known as “ hubs.”* The Tvater contains a large quantity of suspended matter, a considerable proportion of which would appear to be of -mineral rather than of organic origin. The water is always cloudy, and sometimes almost entirely opaque and even in ordinary times it is not a water to be given, without some previous purification, to persons interned in a lazaret. In times of cholera the need l or purification becomes infinitely greater, and indeed a sine and non. That the danger of drinking the unpurified river water in time of cholera is no theoretical one is shown by the history of the disease in this lazaret. Burino* cholera epidemics in Basra and Ashar, the water of the Shatt-ul-Arab, broad and deep though it be, has more than once become seriously contaminatedIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 11 with the comma bacillus, and has actually been the means of causing a virulent epidemic of the disease among health, people in quarantine at Salihieh. The following are, in briefest summary, the details of three such disastrous incidents occurring in recent years The S S. Kapurthala arrived at Basra from India on May 27th, 1904, with 147 passengers, all healthy ; during their stay in the lazaret 27 of them contracted cholera and 18 died. The S.S. Kola arrived in Basra on October 27th, 1910, with 214 passengers, all healthy; 24 of these contracted cholera in the lazaret and all, without exception, died. The S.S. Dwarica arrived at Basra on October 4th, 1910, with 99 passengers, all healthy ; 9 of these contracted cholera in the lazaret, and 8 died. The Commission examined minutely all the circumstances of these outbreaks, and found that they admitted of but one conclusion—that in each case the disease had been contracted through drinking unpurified water from the Shatt-ul-Arab river at a time when cholera was epidemic in Basra and Ashar. Thus 60 persons, interned in a most deplorably bad lazaret, with the sole object of preventing a possible introduction of disease by them to Basra, themselves fell victims to that very disease from the town of Basra itself. It should be added that since 1911 precautions have been taken at the lazaret and the water has always been boiled, in two large tanks provided for the purpose, before distribution to those in quarantine, and that since then no such lamentable incident as those just described has occurred. The Commission’s proposals with regard to the water-supply in the new lazaret were as follows. The water would be taken, not directly from the river as at present, but from a well dug at some little distance from the river bank, thus allowing of a first filtration of the water by the soil. It would then be pumped to a 20-ton concrete reservoir, built in the ground. Close by was to^ be constructed a water tower, 7 metres in height, supporting two reservoirs of 8 tons each. A petroleum pump, similar to those frequently used for irrigation works on the Tigris and Euphrates and capable of raising ten tons an hour would suffice for the purpose. It was proposed that the water should remain for 12 or even 24 hours in the large 20-ton reservoir, where it would deposit a great part of its gross impurities. It would then be pumped to the two smaller tanks, where it would deposit still more. A mag netic iron or other form of filter could be established in or by these tanks. One of the tanks would serve to supply water to the disinfecting pavilion, the closet flushes, etc., and the other to the cordons for drinking and ablution purposes. When cholera is epidemic in Basra or the neighbourhood, the water should be invariably boiled, as at present, before its distribution to persons in quarantine. Since, under the Convention, it would be only in the case of an actually infected ship that persons would be detained for any length of time, it was thought that the size of the tanks and pumps suggested above would be sufficient for all likely contingencies. Disposal of excreta.~^\\Q Commission proposed to have, in each cordon, a group of 6 closets, on the trough system, with automatic flushing tank to each group. This system which was introduced at mv instance in the Board’s large pilgrim lazaret of Camaran in 1907, has been an unqualified success there. At that lazaret the excreta and flushing water are conducted to large “ fosses a fond perdu,” constructed in the sandy soil of a coral island; but such a system would be inapplicable in the soil of Salihieh, where the conditions are wffiolly different. It wtis therefore proposed to adopt the system of septic tanks. A series of such tanks w r ere to be constructed, of masonry or concrete, in which the excreta and flushing W'ater would be left for a sufficient time, and the effluent water w r ould he admitted to flow into the river only wiien the tide turned and the current began to be a descending instead of an ascending one. It is to be noted that at this point of the river, the water has an ascending current only for three or four hours, and a descending current (i&gt;e., towards the Gulf) during 8 or 9 hours.12 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS 41 In considering the possible danger that such a system would offer to the public health, it has to be recalled that persons will only be interned here for any time in the case of an infected ship. It is unlikely that more than a few hundred persons will ever be interned here at a time. In the pMst, on the rare occasions when cholera has been imported by ships arriving at Basra, the cases have been very few in number; and in such cases it goes without saying that the infected persons (i.e., the actually sick) would be carefully isolated and special precautions taken either to disinfect their excreta before they reached the septic tanks, or to dispose of them by burial after thorough disinfection. 'When cholera has been seriously epidemic in this lazaret in the past, it has been solely when it has been contracted, by “ clean ” persons doing quarantine, from the infected town of Basra or Ashar, and that danger has already been dealt with above. In the case of plague, no such danger of course exists. It has been well established that the germs of cholera are rapidly killed out by other germs in “septic” tanks. Should such germs, in spite of all precautions, escape from the tanks into the river, they would enter the river on its left bank, far from Ashar and well below it; they would enter it when the tide was flowing downwards, and they would at once be diluted by the enormous quantity of water contained in the river at or just after high tide. It is worthy of notice that no instance could be traced in the past, where the infection of cholera, when that disease had been imported by persons arriving in the lazaret, had escaped from the lazaret and caused a spread of the disease in the neighbourhood. If this was so in the past, with the grosslv inadequate arrangements of the present lazaret, it should be still more improba ble in the future, if the precautions recommended are properly carried out Basra as a channel of importation of cholera and plague. Both cholera and plague have been repeatedly introduced to Basra bv sen but when introduced they have most usually been confined to Irak- Vrabi* Mesopotamia and adjoining parts of Persia; and this route offers incomparablv less danger than that by the lied Sea and certain overland routes for the 1 spread of such diseases to Europe from the East. Each disease mav be hvipflu- considered separately. ^ Cholera.—In. the first pandemic, 1820-1822, cholera was imported from places on the Persian Gulf to Basra, and thence spread up the Tigris Euphrates. The great pandemic of 1828-1832 did not follow this route I* 1845-1^46 cholera was epidemic in Persia, and in the latter year spread smifK wards through Mesopotamia from Bagdad to Basra. In 1851 the dison appeared in Basra, and thence spread to Bagdad, reaching Persia in 1852 nd from that year until 1861 it was practically endemic in the latter countrv 1865 cholera was imported to Irak-Arabi and Mesopotamia by two different streams of pilgrims returning from Mecca-the one via Aleppo and fk! Euphrates, and the other via Basra. Prom 1866 to 1870 the disease was widdv present in many countries, including Persia and Mesopotamia In great epidemic, that of 1881-1887, these countries seem to have escaped Lf ? 1889 the infection was again imported to Basra and spread up the Tigris and Euphrates and later to Persia. In the great pandemic of 1892 and sub sea, Z years these regions largely escaped ; but in May 1893 cholera appealed Amara on the Tigris and nine days later was in Basra, later appearing in Kut-el-Amara and Bagdad. In 1899 it was freshly imported to Bushire^nd Basra, and was largely spread by the date-gatherers along the Shatt-ul Aral !n the next great pandemic, that of 1903 and subsequent years cZwn appeared m Mesopotamia (m 1903), but it was not imported bv sea- if, overland from Syria down the Euphrates and caused a high nmrtalitw Ivouela, Ivejef and elsewhere. It remained in these regions and in Th.'l-'V Armenia unti 1905. It was very severe at Mohammerah in 1904 and * * to have spread up the Karun river into Persia. Cholera again appeared £ P f. rS igns valley in 1910, apparently coming from Persia and sprea(hnn- southward iom Bagdad to Basra. It followed a similar course in 1911, in which ve-ir if also spread up the Karun river. I can trace no subsequent instance of cboK t being imported by sea to Basra. 1 ace or choleraII IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 13 From the above brief summary it will be seen that cholera has been as often imported to Basra from the north as by sea; but the fact that it has been repeatedly imported by sea, and the frequent and increasing communication between this port and Indian ports, show that there will always be need of serious sanitary defences at Basra. Plague .—This disease w r as for many centuries endemic and sometimes epidemic in certain parts of Irak-Arabi (especially along the Euphrates valley), in parts of Turkey near the Persian frontier, and in Persia itself. These were among the principal centres of the disease during the latter half of the 19th century. But it showed no tendency to spread from these centres. After the revival of plague in China and India in the last decade of the ]9th century, plague was first imported to Basra (without spreading) in 1899, and some cases occurred in the tow r n again in 1900 and 1901. In May 1901 it appeared in Bagdad, but the source of infection was not known. In 1905, 1907, 1909 and 1911 plague caused serious epidemics in the Bahrein Islands, in the Persian Gulf and spread to some otheT of the Gulf ports. In 1907 there w r ere a few cases in Basra; in 1908 and 1909 it w r as prevalent in Bagdad ; and in 1910 and 1911 it was present in Basra. In 1912 cases of plague w ere imported to the Basra lazaret by at least five steamers, coming from Bombay or infected ports on the Persian Gulf, but the infection does not seem to have spread to the towm. In 1913 and again in 1914 a few cases of the disease were seen in Basra; and in 1915 the disease was present in Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah and Basra and caused a rather serious epidenr’c in Bagdad and Kiazimein. The history of plague, no less than that of cholera, show 7 s the necessity of sanitary measures, in a properly organised sanitary station at Basra.u REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS CHAPTER III. The Khanikin Lazaret and other Defences on the Turco-Persian Frontier. The Khanikin Lazaret. Tlio Turkish, town of Khanikin is situated within a few miles of the Persian frontier, on the great route of trade and pilgrimage which passes from Kermanshah in Persia, via Kasr-i-Shirin, Khanikin, Kizil-Robat, Shahraban and Dakuba to Bagdad. This road is incomparably the most important line of communication between Persia and Turkey by land. The large majority— almost the whole of the Persian pilgrims going to the Shiah holy cities of Irak-Arabi follow this route, and along it there is a considerable movement of ordinary passengers, and of commerce, in both directions. Up to the present pilgrims and passengers travel on foot, on horse—or donkey-back, on camels, or rarely in carriages. But, should the projected railway from Bagdad to Kermanshah—the corollary of the much talked-of Bagdad Railway—ever be constructed, it is certain that the movement of both goods and passengers along this route will immensely increase, and the lazaret of Khanikin—the sole establishment of the kind along the whole line of the Turco-Persian frontier will come to be of considerably greater importance than it is at present. It will be of interest to describe briefly the route which this projected railway is destined to follow. I was informed by Meissner Pasha, the con structor of the Bagdad Railway (formerly Chief Engineer to the Hedjaz Railway, and who was resident in Bagdad in 1913-14), that the line will start froin the main Bagdad Railway, not at Bagdad itself, but at Sumeikha, some 60 kilometres to the north. It will cross the Tigris at a point 13 i kilometres from Sumeikha, will pass by Sadieh and Doltaoua, will cross the low hills of Jebel Hamrin and Jebel Zennabieh, will then pass over the river Diala by a bridge at a point near the encampment of Taweila, whence it will run to Kizil-Robat and so to Khanikin, Kasr-i-Shirin and Kermanshah. The route the railway will follow is therefore not identical with the present road from Bagdad to Khanikin, except beyond Kizil-Robat. Meissner Pasha further informed me that the railway will pass quite near to within 300 m. of the present lazaret of Khanikin, which may well there fore continue to occupy the exceedingly convenient and suitable site it now occupies. . ^kjle °n the subject of railways, mention may also be made of another projected line, to run from Kermanshah, through Hamadan and Tabriz, to Julia, the present terminus of the Russian Tiflis-Julfa Railway. .•n C( ? m P/ e ^ 011 this network of railways, should it ever be realised, vuli undoubtedly attract a largely increased number of merchants, pilgrims and other travellers from the Caucasus, from Transcaspia and the other Asiatic provinces of Russia, and from all parts of Persia. It is possible also that not f/r i gGr 1 ? 1 um .* ,ers Shiah pilgrims going to Kerbela and Nedjef, but also ot Moslem pilgrims going to Mecca and Medina will make use of these railways tor it would then be possible for them to travel the w r hole distance by train from their places of origin to Mecca—firstly, by the Russian and Persian lines, lien by the Khanikm-Bagdad Railway, the main Bagdad Railway to Aleppo lence by the Aleppo-Damascus Railway (via Homs and Hama) to Damascus* and trom there by the Hedjaz Railway to Medina and (w r hen completed) to P p0r ^°w 7 lat has . 3 * ust been saicl » it; would be easy to quote many ces m which the opening up of railways has led to an immense increase in tt 0t to various religious centres. The completion of the fV ^ Railway from Damascus to Medina has already led to a marked growth in the number of pilgrims proceeding to that city. In India railway facilities have greatly increased the number of pilgrims to Hardwar and other places ofIt) IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 15 pilgrimage; and in Russia, the opening of the Trans-Siberian Railway led to similar results ; notices were printed in the various native dialects and hung in the principal stations, offering greatly reduced fares to pilgrims, and this was followed by an immense rise in the number of Shiah pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Riza in Meshed (close to the Russo-Persian frontier). The greater speed of travel consequent on the opening of railways, together with the increase in the number of travellers, will also tend to augment the risk of the spread of diseases, such as cholera and plague, from one country to the other, and so still further add to the importance of the Khanikin lazaret and health office. All persons entering Turkey from Persia have been hitherto subject to a sanitary tax of P. 10 (about Is. 8d.), and all dead bodies to a sanitary tax of P. 50 (about 8s. 4c?.), collected by the employes of the Constantinople Board of Health in the health office of Khanikin or at other points along the * frontier. The numbers of persons passing through Khanikin from Persia in the five years 1909-14 were as follows (only the totals are here given, the detailed Table in the Commission’s Report being omitted):— TABLE III.

Up to the present the kenlth office and the lazaret of Khanikin have been too separate establishments, at some distance from each other.

Vi hen there was no plague or cholera in Persia the eimrtvard whereUie W anImals &gt; flwks a»d corpses, were admitted to’this couityaid, where the bodies were examined and the regulation taxes paid. It s i u d be stated that no dead body was admitted to Turkey that had not been buned for at least three years and reduced to a skeleton ( “ en etat d’ossements ”) A tempts at various forms of “ sanitary contraband ” (to be di^W fo the following chapter) were frequent, but all bodies believed to be less than three years old were seized at this office and promptly buried in a cemeterv situated some 200 metres to the south-east of the lazaret. Bodies “ en etat d’ossements ” seized in contraband were kept in a depot until some one came to claim them and paid the regulation dues. When plnguo or cholera was present in Persia, all passengers and corpses were directed to the lazaret instead of to the office, and (he necessary mSres were applied here The office was leased by the Turkish Governnient for the Board ot Health, at an annual rental of P. 20,000 (£166). The Commission proposed to abandon the office altogether, and to concentrate the entire sanitary service in the (reorganised) lazaret, -where the taxes would be fo Pett. meaSU1 ' eSaPplied Whether disease was or was not epidemic ICO Th f actu ?i Iazaret of Khanikin occupies a plot of land 530 metres long bv 160 metres wide-or an area of 84,000 square metres. The site is admirably suited for a lazaret of sufficient size for all reasonable requirements. On this w° , bU1 i d o One, built by that able statesman Midhat Pasha, when he was 1 ah of Bagdad, consists of a large entrance porch and two wings containing a series of rooms. Though in a bad state of repair, this edifice was so solidly constructed that the Commission proposed to put it into thorough repair, to add to it and to incorporate it into the general scheme oi the reorganised lazaret. the .iisinfecting pavilion, put up as recently as 1907. It was built on a bad plan, and of such defective workmanship that it was already partly m ruins, and the Commission saw no other course open but to propose its demolition and the construction of a new and better pavilion on another part of the site. . 1 A , Asm the case of the Basra lazaret, so in the ease of this lazaret, the details oi the Commission s proposals for its reorganisation are omitted here. Briefly, it was proposed to build practically a new lazaret on the same site. A brick wall, 2m. 50 m height was to surround the whole area. The existino- great porch would have given access to a courtyard, 100m. by 75m., in which the revision of corpses and the collection of taxes would be carried out f lien no plague or cholera existed in Persia, the passengers would go no fuither than this courtyard. When such diseases were present in Persia the passengers would pass from the courtyard to the disinfecting pavilion, to he built close by; there they would undergo the regulation disinfection ; any cases of cholera oi plague among them would be removed to the hospital, and the members of such an actually infected group would be kept in the lazaret for the period required by the Conventions. The plan provided for the construc tion of 8 cordons for such infected groups (a probably unnecessarily high number), tvo hospitals, houses for better class travellers and for the staff of the lazaret, and all other necessary accessories to a properly organised lazaret Tor some of these the same plans as those prepared for the Basra lazaret were to be used at Kbanikm. Certain special conditions obtaining at this land frontier required certain special and unusual arrangements at this lazaret and may be briefly mentioned Thus, practically all groups of passengers and pilgrims arriving here are accompanied by a considerable-often a large-number of animals, such as donkeys, horses, camels and others. It would he quite impossible to separate18 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS them from tlioir animals, on account of the impossibility of providing a staff to feed and water the latter, if they were away from their owners, and of the disastrous confusion and quarrels about ownership of the animals which would result. Consequently the Commission proposed to have in each cordon a long “ hangar,” 10 ft. wdde, and other special arrangements for the accommodation of these animals. Such an arrangement is, of coarse, not an ideal one, hut any attempt to separate these people from their animals would inevitably lead to something like a revolt, and the possibility of applying any sanitary measure would probably come to an end. Land quarantines have long been condemned by the International Sanitary Conferences, and this lazaret should only serve, as stated above, for the detention for any lengthened period of groups of travellers among whom piague or cholera had actually appeared. The system of latrines proposed was that which has worked so well at the lazaret of Camaran, in the Red Sea, i.e., a series of trough closets, with automatic flushes and drains leading to “ fosses a fond perdu.” The sandy and gravelly nature of the soil here would, it was believed, lend itself to this system. The “ fosses ” would be dug well outside the lazaret enclosure, and on the side (east) away from the stream from which the water-supply would be taken. The water-supply would be derived, as at present, from the stream called the Hajji Kara Sou, which runs along the west side of the lazaret site, at a distance from it w hich varies from 30 to 90 metres. This stream rises in the El-Wend river (a branch of tbe Diala) upon which the town of Khanikin is built, at a point about six kilometres from the lazaret and w r ell above stream from the town. Arrangements for the purification and distribution of the water similar to those proposed for the Basra lazaret were provided for in the plans for the Khanikin lazaret. The general plan for the new lazaret was prepared by the Commission, •and the plans and drawings for the buildings were made by a local architect, JVL Chavanis, of Bagdad, on indications furnished by the Commission. The estimated cost of the buildings which it was proposed to put up at once was £T. 17,000, while certain supplementary buildings which were to be left until the Railway had been constructed and the need for further accommodation had shown itself felt w~ould have cost £T.2,000, making a total of £T.19,000 (£17,100). This sum w r ould, as in the case of the Basra laz.'iret, have been taken from the £T.280,000 which, as explained in the introductory chapter, had been voted for the reorganisation of all the Turkish lazarets. Other Sanitary Defences on the Turco-Persian Frontier. As stated in Chapter I, the defences of the northern portion of the frontier were dealt with by a separate Commission. Actually they consist (or consisted in 1914) solely of a dilapidated lazaret, scarcely w'orth the name and apparently of little if any practical value, at Kizil-Dize,' and of sanitary offices at Erzerum, Van and Bayazid. Along the southern two-thirds of the frontier, there is no lazaret other than that of Khanikin. Sanitary offices exist at Rayet, Suleimanieh and Mendeli the staff of which consist only of sanitary clerks and guards, mounted or on foot. The chapter of the Commission’s Report dealing with this frontier was unfortunately left in the printer’s hands at Constantinople. In it a careful study was made of the various routes of communication between Persia and Turkey, of the Kurdish tribes inhabiting areas adjacent to the frontier line, of their migratory movements, and of the epidemiology of these regions. I regret that the materials for reconstructing this chapter (consisting of notes and observations made during the Commission’s travels or collected, for many years past, from the archives of the Board of Health) are for the present not available.IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 19 !t y as establis-lied that, apart from the main Kermanshah-KLanikin- Bagdad route, (here is hut iittle important through traffic by other routes, save by certain roads crossing the frontier towards its southern end and converging at Mendelt. Along tlie Kurdistan portion of tl e frontier, north of Khanikin the principal movement is that of the ncmedic Kurdish tribes, several of whom migrate from one country to the other according to the season of the year Any attempt to subject these unruly tribes or the relatively small number of through travellers passing this portion of the frontier to serious sanitary control was held to offer such practical difficulties that it was not recommended more particularly as the danger to public health which they offer does not appear to be great. Apart from minor proposals respecting the personnel of some of the offices the only innovation proposed by the Commission was (if I remember rightly) the creation of a disinfecting station at Mendeli, where, as just stated, there is an appreciable through movement of pilgrims and other travellers. The Frontier as a channel of importation of cholera AND PLAGUE. The following is a brief summary of the occasions on which each disease has been carried across the frontier, in either direction. Cholera—In the first great pandemic of cholera, that of 1819-22, the disease invaded the Tigris valley, and in the autumn of 1821 was carried into Persia, as a result of a wur between Turkey and Persia. In 1851 cholera travelled from Bagdad to Suleimanieh and Hevandouz, on the frontier and in the following year was epidemic on both sides of the frontier. In 185f&gt; the disease was epidemic in Persia and spread from Kermanshah dow r n to Khanikin ; the pilgrims there and on the road to Bagdad suffered terribly, and carried the infection to Bagdad, Kerbela and the Fuphrates valley. The disease followed a simiiar route in 1860. In 1861 it was imported from Persia to Mendeli and Bakuba, and thence to Bagdad, Kerbela and Nejef. In 1865 it appears to have crossed the frontier from Turkey to Persia, near Suleimanieh. In 1867-69 cholera was epidemic in Persia, and is said to have crossed the frontier into Turkey from Kermanshah. In 1893 cholera appeared in Mendeli and also in Khanikin, and as it was already epidemic in Persia, it was probably imported from there. In 1901 the epidemic, the course of which from Syria into Mesopotamia in 1903 has already been traced in Chapter II, was apparently introduced into Persia from Turkey, and caused a violent epidemic there. In subsequent years the disease was frequently epidemic in Bussia and spread from time to time into Persia and Turkey in Asia ; and in 1910 it once more passed down from Kermanshah, through Khanikin to Bagdad. As the above summary shows, cholera has been as often imported into Persia from Turkey as into Turkey from Persia across this frontier; and the Khanikin route has been that by which the infection has most frequently been carried, by pilgrims going to or returning from the Shiah cities. The existence of endemic centres of plague on both sides of the frontier in the latter half of the 19th century was referred to in Chapter II. It is unnecessary to mention here * the names of all the places attacked. On the Turkish side, the principal outbreaks occurred in the Hindieh marshes, along the lower Euphrates, about Djaara and Shenafieh, in Nejef, in Bagdad itself, at Bedra, Zorhatia and Mendeli near the southern end of the frontier, 0 and among the Muntefik tribes. On the Persian side, there were outbreaks of the disease at M aku, on the table-land to the south-east of Lake Urumiah, in and near Hamadan, at Saouj- Bulak, Jivanrao, Merivan, Uzunder6, Mahideskte, and other places near the frontier line. * Fuller details of these centres, as also of the great cholera epidemics, may be found in the author’s bo “The Geography of Disease” (Cambridge University Press, 1933).20 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS In some of these outbreaks the disease was occasionally carried across the frontier from one countfy to the other; but the result was always confined to a local manifestation of the disease, and these centres offered no real danger to Europe or the rest of the world. Since the revival of plague throughout the world at the end of last century, the only clear instance of its being carried across this frontier appears to have occurred in 1903, when plague was imported from Huveiza in Persia to Zobeir, a Turkish village near to Amara on the Tigris, where it gave rise to a small localised epidemic. To sum up the preceding—this frontier offers comparatively little danger for the spread of plague.IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 21 CHAPTER IV. The Shiah Pilgrimage and transport of bodies to the Shiah Holy Cities. The Shiah Pilgrimage. The Shiah pilgrimage and the movement of dead bodies to the burying grounds of Kerbela and Nejef have received far less attention than the Haj, or well-known pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. Yet the Shiah pilgrimage constitutes a world movement of real importance, and it is surprising that so comparatively little has been heard of it hitherto. In the present chapter an attempt will be made to fill up some of the gaps in our knowledge with regard to it. A few preliminary words must be said as to the nature of the Shiah religion. The Moslem w T orld is composed of two great divisions, the Sunnis and the Shias, and of many sub-sects. The Sunnis represent the vast mass of orthodox Musulmans; the Shiahs regarded as sectarians by the others, are far less numerous, but form none the less a very large body. Both regard it as a duty, if circumstances permit, to perform the Haj, or pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, once in their life time, and this is frequently combined w T ith visits to Damascus and Jerusalem. But the Shiahs have yet other Holy Cities of their own, of which the most important are Kerbela, Nejef, Kiazimein and Samara, in Turkish Irak-Arabi and Mesopotamia and Meshed, in Northern Persia. The Shiah religion, tenets, customs and prejudices, not only in life but after death, merit more detailed study than they hare yet received. No attempt will be made here to treat of such a complex subject, and this chapter will be limited to a brief discussion of some of the external features of the Shiah pilgrimage and transport of corpses, wdth more special reference to the danger to the public health that these movements present and the measures taken or required to meet those dangers. But while confined to the external aspect of Shiah movements, the following observations may claim to be based upon information gained at first hand, under rather exceptional circumstances. The local Turkish officials, the Kilitdar of the great mosque of Ali at Nejef, the “haffar-bashi ” or head grave-digger in the vast cemetery there, the chiefs of some leading Kurdish tribes, and others were interviewed, and spoke more freely than might have been expected upon matters relating to the objects of the Commission. A friendly Moslem procured for me the plan, here reproduced, of the mosque over the tomb of Ali at Nejef. Such plan has not, I believe, been published before; it is of more than passing interest, since the interior of these great Shiah shrines has never been seen by infidel eyes. No giaour may enter even the outer courtyard of the mosques, and he would probably be instantly assassinated should he venture to do so. It is impossible to understand aright even the superficial aspects of Shiah movements without some slight knowledge of the origin of this branch of Islam and of its main tenets. Shiism dates from the tragic death of Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet, in the neighbourhood of Kerbela, in the year 61 of the Hijra (A. D. 680). The Shiahs reject the Caliphates of Abu-Bekr, Omar and Othman, the successors of Mohammed, and regard Ali, the Prophet’s cousin and son-in- law, as the first true and legitimate Caliph. In the course of tw r elve centuries many sub-sects have arisen among the Shiah, as among the Sunni, Moslems. As many as 70 or 80 of these have been enumerated by Musalman writers but most of them have lasted but for brief periods and then ceased or almost ceased to exist. Pive principal groups or sub-sects are recognised by modern authorities on the subject.* These are The Spirit of Islam ” by Ameer AH, Syed, M.A., C.T.E., Calcutta, 1902. This book is a store-house of information on the Moslem religion and its many branches. There would seem still, however, to be room for an authoritative work in English on Shiism in all its aspects.22 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS the Zaidins, the Ismailias, the Bahamas’, the Ghallias, and the Asna- Aasharias. , The Zaidias, who are themselves divided into four suh-sections, h v ai most completely disappeared, but a few are still found an Asm and in A! noa (Morocco). They differ from true Shias in some of their tenets, and they (to not, it is said, make the pilgrimage to Kerbela and Nejef. The Ismailias or Saliun, hare been divided into two groups, the Eastern and the Western. Of the latter but few representatives remain-in the Yemen in E^ypt and in Barbary. They can scarcely be distinguished, it is said, from tlm Sunni Moslems among whom they live, and they also do not go on pilgrimage to Kerbela and Nejef. But the Eastern IsmaiUas are now renresented by an important body, tbe Khojas of India, of vbom the majority are found in Bombay, and others in the mountains of Gilgit and Hanza. Their chief is the Agha Khan of Bombay, and they aie devout pilgrims to the shrines of Irak Arabi. ^ The Kaisanias have completely disappeared, and the Ghallias have become very few in number; they are found in the mountains of Kurdistan. The Asna-Aasharias constitute at the present day the great majority of Shiahs—so much so that the Moslem writer just referred to states that, apart from the Eastern Ismailias, Asna-Aashariaism has become synonymous with. Shiism. As their title indicates, they recognise twelve spiritual leaders, or Imams, whose names and dates are as follow : 1. Ali, elected Caliph A. D. 656 (A. H. 34), assassinated at Kufa A. D. 661 (A. II. 40); buried at Nejef. • 2 Hassan, son of Ali, died and was buried at Medina, A. D. 670 (A. H. 49). 3. Hussein, brother of Hassan, killed near to Kerbela, on the 10th Muharrem, A. D. 680 (A. H. 61); buried at Kerbela. 4. Zain-ul-Abadin, or Ali II, son of Hussein, died and was buried at Medina, A. H. 694 (A. H. 75). 5. Muhammad-Bakir, son of Zain-ul-Abadin, died and was buried at Medina in A. H. 731 (A. H. 114). 6 Jafer-es-Sadik, son of Muhammad-Bakir, died and was buried at Medina, A. D. 765 (A. It. 148). 7. Musa Kiazim, son of Jafer-es-Sadik, died at Bagdad, A. D. 799 (A. H. 183) ; buried at Kiazimein. * 8. Ali-bin-Musa, or Ali III, son of Musa Kiazim, died near to Meshed A. D. 818 (A. H. 203); buried at Meshed. 9. Abu Jafer Muhammad, surnamed A1 Jewad or A1 Taki, died at Bagdad, A. D. 835 (A. H. 220) ; buried at Kiazimein. 10. Ali-en-Naki or Ali IV, son of Muhammad al Jewad, died at Samara, A. D. 867 (A. H. 254). 11. Hassan-el-Askari, son of Ali-en-Naki, died and buried at Samara, A. D. 873 (A. H. 260). 12. Muhammad-bin-Hassan-el Mahdi, son of Hassan-el-Askari, dis appeared at Samara, A. D. 878 (A. H. 265). The twelfth Imam, or el Mahdi, disappeared mysteriously in a grotto at Samara, where he is still believed to be, and he is expected to reappear shortly before the end of the world. The burial places of the Imams have become places of pilgrimage for the followers of Shiism. Thus not only Medina, where lie the bodies ot the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th Imams and of the Prophet himself, hut also Nejef (burial place of the 1st Imam), Kerbela (of the 3rd Imam and his brother Abbas), Kiazimein (of the 7th and 9th Imams), Meshed (of the 8th Imam), and Samara (burial place of the 10th and 11 th Imams and place of disappearance of the 12th) attract a large and ever growing number of pilgrims. But Kerbela and N ejef are easily the first in importance, whether for the pilgrimage in life or for what may be termed the pilgrimage after death. Every strict ShiahIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 23 desires that his body may be carried to and interred in the cemeteries surround ing the mosques of Kerbela and Nejef, and the nearer his remains lie to the shrine of one of the great Imams—Ali or Hussein—the greater the sanctity that such entembment acquires. Interments, it is true, are not wholly rare round the shrines of the other cities, hut they are incomparably fewer and less sought after than at Kerbela and Nejef. It is not easy to determine when these pilgrimages first began. The fete of Yevm-Aash &lt;ra was instituted in A. D. 963 (A. II. 252), by Muiz-ud- Howlah, first ruler of the Buyides at Bagdad, during the Caliphate of Al-Muti ; and in A. D. 977 (A. II. 367) a magnificent mausoleum was built at Kerbela over the tomb of Hussein. It is probable therefore that the Shiah pilgrimage dates more or less from that epoch. THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SHIAHS. The Shiah pilgrims come from many countries, and thier numbers vary much from year to year. The majority of the Moslem inhabitants of Persia are Shiahs of the Asna- Aasharia group. The populatioi; of Persia is estimated at some 10,000,000, and of these about 8,000,000 are Shiahs. The Persians constitute the largest contingent of pilgrims coming to Irak-Arabi, and the conditions in that country—a good or bad harvest, the political state of rest or unrest, the move ments of predatory Kurdish tribes on the routes the pilgrims follow—have a marked effect on their numbers. The Asiatic provinces of Bussia also furnish large numbers of Shiah pilgrims. Their number is probably greater than the available statistics would seem to show, and their representatives at Kerbela and Nejef assert that in some years it rises to as many as 10,000 or 12,000 pilgrims. The pilgrimage from India has, in recent times, varied remarkably in size ; but th's has been almost entirely due to the greater or less severity of the quarantine and other measures applied to them on their arrival at Basra—a matter dealt with in the second chapter of this Report. In the pilgrim season following the last relaxation of those measures (decision of September 10th, 1912), the number of Indian Shiah pilgrims rose from insignificant figures to between 5,000 and 6,000, and a further reduction in the stringency of those measures would unquestionably lead to a further considerable rise in this figure. The Indian pilgrims come from all parts of the peninsula. The total population of India was estimated in 1911 at 315,156,396, of whom 66,647,299 were Moslems. The majority of these, however, are Sunnis. The number of Indian Shiahs has been estimated by different observers at 1.500,000, 2,000,000 and even 5,000,000. It is probable that the exact figure, were it known, would not exceed two million. The Indian census does not distinguish between Sunni and Shiah Moslems, an omission which it would be desirable—did cii cumstances permit—to remedy in any future census. Shiahs are found mainly in the northern part of India. They are very numerous in Lucknow, and other important centres are the towns of Laizabad, Bombay and Hyderabad (Deccan). In Bombay are found the Khojas, already mentioned, and the community of Borahs—of considerable size—are also Shiahs. The Nawabs of Rampur, Khairpur, Cambay, Junagadh and Murshi- dabad, and the Raja of Mahmudabad belong to this sect, but the population of these States are mixed, and in some the majority are Sunnis, although the reigning prince is a Shiah. The Kizil-bashis of Afghanistan, numbering some 50,000, and found mainly in Kabul, are Shiahs; they are snid to be Persianised Turks, who immi grated to Afghanistan under Nadir Shah in 1737. The Baluchs and Brahuis of Baluchistan, though professed Sunnis, are said to be much influenced by Shiah doctrines. Other Moslem countries outside Turkey send but few pilgrims to the Shiah holy cities. Small groups arrive occasionally from Africa, and from Mongolia ; but the great Musulman communities of the Dutch Indies, the Malay Penin sula, Morocco, Algeria, and other parts of Asia and Africa, which furnish such24 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS large contingents to the Haj or pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, send scarcely any pilgrims to Kerbela and Nejef. It remains to mention the movement of pilgrims from other parts of Turkey to the shrines of Irak-Arahi—the Arabs of Mesopotamia and Irak- Arabi itself, the inhabitants of Bagdad and other towns in these regions, and a small number of pilgrims from the Lebanon. Broadly speaking, no pilgrims come from Asia Minor (save the few, just mentioned, from the Lebanon), nor from the Turkish vilayets situated north of that of Mosul. Cuinet, * whose authority on these regions is generally recognised, does not give the number of Shiahs in the valayet of Mosul, but he estimated (in 1894) the Shiahs of the Bagdad vilayet at 480,500, out of a total population of 850,000, and those of the Basra vilayet (including the sanjak of Nejd or Hasa) at 663,150, out of a total population of 950,000. The number of Shiahs here tends to increase, however, and their numbers in these two Turkish vilayets may perhaps he estimated at about 1,200,000 to 1,500,000. TOTAL NUMBER OP PILGRIMS. It is not easy to obtain an even approximately accurate figure for the o/* pilgrims who annually visit the Shiah cities. From the registers of the Turkish health offices on the Persian frontier and at Basra, it would appear that, in the ten years 1903-13, from 34,000 to 73,000 came each year from abroad on their way to Kerbela and Nejef. To their numbers must be added those of the pilgrims of Turkish origin. Many of these perform the pilgrimage repeatedly in their life time ; while at Kiazimein (a half-hour’s tramcar ride from Bagdad) the Shiah inhabitants *of Bagdad flock weekly to the great mosque of Imam Musa-—Saturday being a specially favourite day for such visits. At Kerbela as many as 80,000 or 100,000 have, it is said, been gathered together for one of the great Shiah festivals or days of mourning. THE SEASON OF PILGRIMAGE. The Shiah pilgrimage differs essentially from the Haj in that it may take place at any part of the Moslem year. The Haj, on the other hand, is always timed so that the pilgrims may be present at the various ceremonies at Arafat and Muzdalifeh, near Mecca, which take place each year on the 8-10th of Zilhidje +, or what are known as the days of Kurban Bairam. As the Moslem year, of 12 lunar months, is 11 days shorter than the solar year, this Moslem festival falls 11 days earlier each year, and may consequently occur in any season of the solar year. The Shiahs, on the other hand, are freer to chose the most favourable season for their journeys to Irak-Arabi, and they generally select the autumn, after the great heats of summer are over and the harvest in, and before the colds of winter begin. But it is important to note that, although the date of the Shiah pilgrimage is mainly determined by the season of the year, there are certain specially sacred days in the Moslem year for which Shiahs prefer, if possible, to time their pilgrimage. The two months of Muharrem and Sefer, in which they mourn the deaths of Ali and Hussein have a particular sanctity, and there are certain special red-letter days for each of the towns of Kerbela and Nejef. At Kerbela these days are the following:— The 10th Muharrem, date of the death of Hussein. The 20th Sefer, 40 days after the 10th Muharrem, date on which the heads of the martyrs of Kerbela, after having been sent to Damascus, were returned to Kerbela and rejoined to the bodies. This day is also known as the Arbain or Tchehlum. The 1st and 15th Rejeb, dates when certain of the Imams visited Kerbela. The loth Shaban, birthday of the 12th Imam—the Mahdi. # “ La Turquie d’Asie ”, par Vital Cuinet. Volnme 3. Paris, 1894. t The twelve Moslem months are as follows : Muharrem, Sefer, Rebi’l Evvel, Rebi’l Akhir, Jumadi’l Evvel Jwmadi'l Akhir, Hejeb, Shaban, Ramazan, Sheval, Zilkade and Zilhidje. The present Moslem year (A. H. 13341 began on November 9tl&gt;, 1915, and will end on October 27tb, 1916.IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 25 2f) ? b t The 19th and 21st Ramazan, dates respectively of the woundin^ of Ali and of his death. ° The 26th Ramazan, or the Night of Power, xhe 9th and 10th Zilhidje, or Kurban Bairam. At Nejef the special days are The 17th Rebi’l Evvel, birthday of the Prophet. The Nau Ruz, or New Year’s Day of the Persians, and the day when Ah was elected Caliph. Hie 27th Rejeb, date when the Prophet announced his divine mission. 'J he 18th Zilhidj4, date when the Prophet named Ali as his successor (according to Shiah belief). Also known as the Ghadir. The 28th Zilhidje. Of these days, those which attract the largest number of pilgrims are the 10th Muharrem, the 20th Sefer, the 15th Shaban, the 10th Zilhidje, and the Nau Ruz. Routes followed by the pilgrims. 2\ ie ™ a j orit y pilgrims whatever their place of origin, pass through Bagdad. The loute by the river Tigris, from Pasra to Bagdad by steamer and thence by road to the holy places, is followed by the majority of those who arrive in Irak-Arabi by sea, though a few may take sailing boats up the Euphrates and its branches. Pilgrims and bodies from Persia, or from Russian territory by way of Persia, follow mainly the Kermanshah-Khanikin- Bagdad^ route described in the preceding chapter. They come down from Khanikin, through hizil Robat, Shahraban and Bakuba, either direct to Bagdad, or they branch off at Bakuba, and passing to the north of Bagdad, proceed direct to Kiazimein, crossing the bridge between Muaddham and Kiazimein. Ihe town of Bagdad is too well known to require any description Kiazimein, a town of 20,000 to 25,000 inhabitants, is situated on the west side of the Tigris, 7 kilometres from Bagdad. It is connected with Bagdad by a primitive tramway, constructed by Midhat Pasha in 1871. It is also connected by the bridge just mentioned, with the suburb of Muaddham, and it is on this bridge that the pilgrims’ papers are examined by the sanitary employes of Kiazimein, and their taxes collected if they have not already been paid at the frontier. Kiazimein possesses one of the richest and most striking of all the Shiah mosques; it contains the tombs of Imam Musa and Imam Jewad. Practically every Shiah pilgrim visits these shrines either on his outward or his homeward journey. Samara (not visited by the Commission) is also situated on the Tigris, 105 kilometres north of Bagdad. Here also is a magnificent mosque, over °the tomb of the 11th Imam, and the grotto in which the 12th Imam disappeared. From Bagdad or Kiazimein the pilgrims proceed to Kerbela. A regular service of carriages exists between these towns, as also between Kerbela and Nejef. The journey from Bagdad usually takes two days, and from Kerbela to Nejef another two days. The fare from Bagdad to Kerbela varies, accordin'* to the season, the number of persons travelling, and the state of the roads’ between P. 15 (2s. 6cZ.) and P. 80 (13s. 4&lt;f.). The distance from Bagdad to Kerbala is 80 kilometres (or 50 miles). The route crosses the Euphrates at Musseyib, by a floating bridge of the usual primitive type found in these regions. Musseyib is a town of about 6,000 inhabitants, the centre of a Nahie. The journey from Bagdad to Musseyib (55 kilometres) takes some 8 hours in a carriage, and that from Musseyib to Kerbela 4 or 5. The route from Bagdad passes through Khan Mahmudieh (3 hours), Iskenderieh (3 hours) and Musseyib (2 hours). Musseyib is situated a short distance above the point where the great barrage over the Euphrates has recently been constructed, by the firm of Sir John Jackson, for the Turkish Government. Kerbela is a town of considerable size, and the centre of a mutessariflik of the same name. The permanent population is estimated at about 50,000, to which must be added a floating population of pilgrims, varying from a few £REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS 26 thousands to 30,000, 40,000 and some say up to 100,000 or over. There are two strikingly beautiful mosques here, over the tombs of Imam Hussein and ns brother Abbas. The old town of Kerbela is surrounded by a brick wall, in a bad state of repair. Outside the wall has grown up a populous quarter, named Abbasieh, built mainly in the time of Midhat Pasha ; the streets are wide, straight and at right angles to each other, while m the old town, as at Nejef, Kiazimein and Bagdad, they are but a labyrinth of narrow, crooked and muddy lanes. From Kerbela to Nejef the distance is 75 kilometres. The route passes through Khan Hamad (4 hours), and Khan Messala (2| hours) to Nejef (2 hours). Kejefis built on a low hill of sandstone rock, rising slightly above the general level of the plain of Irak-Arabi. In the centre of the town is the fine mosque of Imam Ali. The town is completely surrounded by a wall of sun-burnt bricks, in a very bad state of repair, and outside the wall, on the north and east sides of the town, is the great cemetery, to be referred to later, ihe present population of the town is estimated at about 30 000. Five kilometres to the north-east of Nejef is the town of Kufa, situated on the Shatt-el-Kufa, a branch of the Euphrates famous as the scene of the assassination of Ali and as the place of origin of the Kufic character. A mosque has been built over the spot where the assassination is believed to have taken place. A tramway unites the two towns and does the journey in 30 to 40 minutes. Besides the principal routes just briefly described, there are others which are more or less followed by the pilgrims. Thus pilgrims coming from Persia by routes which unite at Mendeli, north-east of Bagdad, pass to Bakuba and thence to Bagdad or Kiazimein. Others who cross the frontier and come to Bedra or Zorbatia either go thence to Mendeli-Bakuba-Bagdad, or descend to Kut-el-Amara on the Tigris, and pass by way of Bugb.eila to Hilleh and Nejef, joining the main route at Khan Hamad. Pilgrims from Turkish territory north of the Bagdad villayet come by routes which need not be described in detail; and finally the Shiah inhabitants of Mesopotamia and the regions east of the Tigris and Shatt-ul-Arab such as the tribes of Beni-Lam, Muntifik, Elbou-Muhammad, etc.—follow one or other of the routes already described—that is, they either go to Bagdad, or they ascend in sailing boats the Euphrates and its branches and canals, landing at Kufa, Djaara or Shenafieh. Pilgrims “ in contraband”, trying to evade the sanitary offices where they would be subject to measures and to the payment of sanitary dues, follow many devious routes across the desert and by the net work of rivers and canals which characterise these regions. &lt;- The religious leaders and officials in the Shiah cities. The principal religious official is the Kilitdar (literally, “ key-keeper”) of the great mosque in each city. The Kilitdar of Nejef is Snyid Jewad, belonging to an old Arab family, said to be the descendents of Ali, in which the office is hereditary. The appointment is on each occasion made by the Sultan, but always from this family. Sayid Jewad is reputed to be of enormous wealth, and owns much land in and around Nejef. It is asserted that he pays the govermnent some £T. 9,500 a year in taxes on his property, and as the tax is a ten per cent, one it is clear that his property is of great value. As “ key-keeper ” of the mosque, he has access to the shrine of Ali; the shrine is surrounded by an ornamental railing, through which the faithful thrust valuable gifts in money and in kind. Sometimes these gifts are, it is said, of immense value, and, if report be true, the Kilitdar retains many of them for his own use or sells them for his own profit. Other gifts, not made in this anonymous manner, are received by the mudir of the Evkaf (Ministry of religious foundations), and handed to the Kilitdar, who registers them and takes charges of them, and should account for them to the central authorities in Constantinople, The JMujtahidS) or learned exponents of Shiah doctrine, number some fifty or more in Nejef; in Kerbela they are much fewer, only some 5 of 6. Many of them wield considerable power both locally and among the faithful in otherIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 27 £ 2 countries.

There were said to be from 8,000 to 10,000 of them in Nejef alone, and some hundreds in Kerbela. The grave-diggers number some 250 or 300 in Nejef, and about 20 in Kerbela. They tom a kind of closed corporation, and the work is hereditary in then families. They are not appointed, nor apparently paid by the Govern ment, nor _ are they reg 1S tered in any way. The actual fee charged for divine- a grave varies from only 10 to 20 piastres, but they are among the worst offenders in the matter of sanitary contraband, and many of them are said to have amassed considerable wealth from this source. When the pilgrims arrive in Kerbela or Nejef, they are mostly lodged in the house of KhaJtms, or pilgrim guides. The khadim conducts the pilgrim round the shrines, instructs him in the formalities to be observed, recites 3 the prayer formulae which the pilgrim repeats after him, takes him to Kufa—and generally acts as a kind of religious Cook’s guid to pilgrims. The khadims are said to make no fixed charge for lodging the pilgrims but expect a handsome present on parting. Sometimes a group of a score of pilgrims will stay for a considerable time and leave without giving any present • but this is compensated for by the large sums which are sometimes ^iven by very rich pngrims, who have been known to give as much as 20,00 ) or 30 000 rupees after a short stay in the town. Some years ago the Mir of Khairpur made the pilgrimage to Kerbela and is said to have spent nearly three lakhs of rupees in that town, most of which went into the pockets of the khadim who acted as his guide. He had built a large house for his reception, thou 0 *!! his stay in the town only lasted a week. ° The khadims attached to the great mosques are entitled to burial without the payment of fees. The number of khadims is very great, but only a few are officially recognised by the Government. Some Shiah communities, as, for example, the Borahs of India, have constructed large rest-houses, where their pilgrims may stay for an indefinite period. The Indian pilgrims make a much longer stay in ‘'Kerbela than in Nejef. From 500 to 4,000 or more Indian pilgrims come here each year. They are mostly of the well-to-do class, but some are poor and in need of * out side assistance. Formerly the funds of the well known “ Oudh Bequest ” were employed to help these poorer pilgrims on their return journey, but as this only encouraged others to go on pilgrimage when they could not afford it the practice was brought to an end. At Nejef the “ Oudh Bequest ” maintains a munshi (Muhammad Biza) and two pilgrim guides for the benefit of Indian pilgrims ; the principal guide in 1913-14 was Sayid Abdul Hassan. Mention may here be made of the fact that the British Government maintained a Vice-Consulate in Kerbela; the last occupant of the post was Muhammad Hussein Mohsin, a Shiah Indian and a very efficient representative of British interests. In Nejef, on the other hand, there was no British Vice- Consul, the^ sole British representatives being the Munshi and two pilgrim guides mentioned above ; while Bussia maintained at Nejef a Consular A^ent —Abul Kassim—wdio was very active in upholding Russian interests and prestige, and had recently obtained the privilege of hoisting the Bussian flag over his residence—the only foreign flag displayed in the principal holy city ofthe Shiahs. Nejef, it may be mentioned, possesses as many as 48 Medressehs or religious schools, as well as many other secular schools. The sanitary conditions in the Shiah cities. The sanitary state of these towns leaves much to be desired. The labyrinths of narrow and tortuous streets are ill-kept and often deep in mud of a‘ most offensive kind. Many of the houses are imperfectly lit and ventilated and much overcrowded. All the larger ones possess one or more deep underground chambers28 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS or serdabs, in which the inhabitants pass the day during the excessive heats of summer. Many of these serdabs are 40 or 60 feet below the ground level, and a few are said to descend as many as 80, 100 or even 120 feet underground. Such cellars are, if report be true, the scenes of unspeakable vices of various kinds. The water-supply of Nejef is of three kinds. Firstly, many houses have wells, the water of which is very impure, hard and brackish ; it is only used for external purposes. Water is found at a depth of from 25 to 35 metres. Secondly, there is what is known as the birkje water, which is brought from the neigh bourhood of Abu Skheir, on the Shatt-ul-Kufa, a branch of the Euphrates, by means of a canal. This canal formerly communicated with the Bahr-i-Nejef, to be mentioned later. The canal now ends in a small sheet of water, much used by buffaloes and by the inhabitants for washing purposes. It is note worthy that most houses in Nejef possess a small tank or cistern, in which this water is stored. The waiter is used for washing linen, utensils, meat before cooking and every other kind of object. It appears to be regarded as possessing some special sanctity, and if a drinking vessel belonging to a Shiah is used by an infidel, it is washed three times in this cistern before it is regarded as pure for Shiah use. No water, it is said, is taken out of the tank, the objects to be washed being dipped into it. At very long intervals—from one to eight months —“the water is changed, and its condition at the end of that time is unspeak ably foul. A trustworthy observer (the then Health Officer in Nejef, to wffiom I was indebted for much of the above information) informed me that, after one of these tanks had been emptied into the street the usual fate of all foul water and other refuse in these towns—it was impossible to pass by the pool thus formed for some 15 days, so offensive had the w^ater become. The third source of w r ater is the Shatt-ul-Kufa itself, at Kufa. The water is brought to Nejef either in large cisterns on the tramway from Kufa already mentioned, or on donkey back. It is only used by a few of the more wealthy inhabitants. There are no drains in Kerbela or Nejef, where the cesspool system of excreta disposal is universal. It is not surprising that many diseases are highly prevalent at Nejef, and they would be still more so but for the relatively high position of the town. Malaria is rife at Kufa and along the Euphrates and its branches generally, but it is not now very prevalent at Nejef. Formerly it was very much more so, owing to the marshes surrounding the Bahr-i-Nejef, or ‘ c Sea of Nejef”, mentioned above. This was formerly a large lake, some 55 kilometres (35 miles) long, and is still marked as such on most maps, but only a part of it—a much smaller sheet of water—now remains ; this is known as the Bahr-i-Shenafieh. This change was brought about, probably unintentionally, by the ex-Sultan of Turkey, Abdul Hamid, who some thirty years ago caused the connection of the larger lake with the Euphrates, from which it derived its water, to be cut, and diverted some of the water to his own property elsewhere. The drying up of the marshes around has proved an undoubted blessing to the town of Nejef. Enteric fever is excessively prevalent in Nejef and the cause of a high mortality. Typhus, on the other hand, is not seen here. Tubercular disease— whether pulmonary or localised in the bones, joints and other structures—is rife in both Nejef and Kerbela, as also dysentery, syphilis in all its forms and many other diseases. The “ Bagdad boil ” or “ button ” is known but not common here, and leprosy appears to be rare both in Kerbela and Nejef. The TRANSPORT OF CORPSES TO THE SfllAH HOLY CITIES. Every Shiah desires to be buried, if circumstances permit, in one of the four holy cities of Nejef, Kerbela, Kiazimein and Samara. ^ The carriage of dead bodies to these places which results is one of the most striking features of the Shiah religion and deserves study in some detail. Of these four cities, Nejef is considered the most sacred and it is here that the largest number of interments takes place. At Kerbela the number of burials is fewer, though considerable. At Kiazimein it is still smaller, thoughIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 29 2 many bodies are temporarily interred here and later transferred, to Kerbela or Nejef. This form of temporary burial is of frequent occurrence, both openly, and secretly by those who wish to smuggle bodies to the holy places without any formalities or payment of dues. In Bagdad itself there is a'Shiah cemetery— that of Sheikh Halawi where the bodies of children are mainly buried; and between Bagdad and Kiazimein is the cemetery of Mantigah, where many corpses are temporarily buried, to be later smuggled to Kerbela or Nejef. At Samara the number of interments is almost negligible. It is at Nejef therefore that a study of this rather gruesome subject can best be made, and the following observations apply to that city; they are probably, however, equally applicable, mutatis mutandis, to the other towns. The majority of bodies come by land, either from Persia or from Turkish territory. A certain number arrive by sea at Basra, coming from Moham- merah, Bushire or other Persian ports, while still fewer come from India. After the appearance of plague in India in 1896, and down to the year 1909, the importation of corpses to the holy places from Basra (whether of foreign origin or of the inhabitants of Basra itself) was interdicted. But this interdiction was relaxed by decisions of the Constantinople Board of Health, taken respectively on September 21st, 1909, and March 1st, 1910. The result of these decisions is seen in the following Table, which shows that the number of bodies arriving at Basra rose from 0 in 1908-09 and preceding years to 13 in 1909, and to 730 ; 899 ; and 1,552 in the three following years. This table shows the numbers of corpses for which sanitary dues were paid at all the principal health offices of these regions in the ten years 1903-13. TABLE VII.

The total number of registered bodies varied between a minimum of 146 and a maximum of 7,558. The minimum fell in the year 1904-05, consequent upon a decision of the Persian government to prohibit the pilgrimage and carriage of corpses from that country, where cholera was severely epidemic at the time. The routes followed by the corpses are much the same as those followed by pilgrims and described above. Bodies are classified as “fresh7 and “ dry” [secs). As already explained, no bodies are supposed to be carried to the Shiah cemeteries if death has occurred less than three years before, but exception is made in the case of persons dying within a twelve hours ’ journey of Kerbela or Nejef, whose bodies are admitted in a “ fresh ” state.30 REPORT ON SANITARY MATTERS Presli bodies arrive at Nejef either in light wood coffin or in simple shrouds, or in bundles of reeds tied with cords. “ Dry ” bodies (“ en etat d’osse- ments, ” or reduced to a skeleton) are carried in sacks of canvas or leather, or in boxes. Very few mummified bodies arrive in coffins. Finally, it is not wholly rare to see bodies reduced to the skeleton state—and this is more particularly the case in bodies coming from Baku on the Caspian—packed with extreme care, every bone being separately wrapped in cotton wool. The bearers of such precious packets will not allow them out of their sight for a single instant; they sleep with them by their side at night, and may be seen caressing them as a mother would her child. The bodies are carried on horse or donkey back, rarely on camels, and frequently on the roof of the primitive carriages already described as doing the service between Bagdad and Nejef. . The charge for carrying a coffin from Bagdad to Kerbela is anything from 10 piastres upwards, and it is about the same from Kerbela to Nejef. On the tramway line between Nejef and Kufa special trollies for the carriage of bodies are often attached to the ordinary cars. Generally the bodies arrive in small groups, of from one or two up to 15 or 20; but occasionally a large caravan of 150 or 200 corpses may be met. They are usually convoyed with but little ceremony, but one large caravan was seen—and it was said to be by no means exceptional—composed of many camels, with rich draperies, carrying on their backs a structure representing apparently the tomb of Hussein, covered with facetted pieces of mirror, which glittered from far away in the sun (no doubt the equivalent of the tazias carried in the well-known Muharrem processions in India and elsewhere). There is no constant relation between the number of bodies and that of the persons accompanying them. Sometimes a large group of pilgrims will arrive, with but one or two bodies ; at others a single individual will bring as many as 100 or 200 packets of bones. The carriage of bodies is so remunerative that there are many persons who make a special trade of it. They either go them selves or send others to Persia and other Shiah countries, where they often make a long stay, gradually collecting large numbers of bodies, which they then carry en masse to Nejef. This matter will be referred to later, in the section on contraband. On arrival in the outskirts of Nejef, bodies are first deposited in a small enclosure, or morgue, built in the desert near the town, about 20 metres long and 10 m. wide, surrounded by a stone wall some 2m. 50 high. In one corner of the enclosure is a depot, in another a small house, containing a cistern and well, which serves as a gusl'khane, or place for the ceremonial washing of fresh bodies. The house is divided into two rooms, one for male and the other for female corpses. The various taxes on bodies are called the def nieh taxes. A charge of one piastre (two-pence) a day is made for the detention of bodies in the morgue ; but the days are counted from the time the bodies left Kerbela or Kufa to come to Nejef. In the morgue the bodies, whether fresh or dry, are removed from their wrappings or coffins, by the sanitary guards, and placed in large coffins belong ing to the defnieh department. The other coffins and wrappings are burnt, in the desert, near to the morgue, under the supervision of the sanitary doctor (in the health service under the Constantinople Board of Health). Formerly this incineration was carried out only once a week, but recently it has been effected daily. The same method is followed at Kerbela, where as many as 800 coffins were burnt in this way in 1913. At Nejef the number must be much greater. A question submitted to the Commission was that of the necessity or otherwise of continuing this system of incineration. The labads or shibna, i.e., the shrouds around the coffins, are sometimes of some value, and the wood of the coffins would be precious in this region, where trees are unknown and all wood has to be imported. The local authorities resent the destruction of so much good material, and were eager for permission to arrange for the prelimi nary disinfection of the wood of the coffins, which they then proposed to sell; the revenue thus obtained would, they claimed, enable the local Municipal— ''' 1 111 IN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. * 33 Commission was as to the necessity of more exact registration of bodies arriving in the Shiah cities and intered respectively in the mosques and in the cemeteries.

Xo separate figures were available for burials in the mosque and cemetery respectively at Kejef, hut, as the number of interments in the mosque precinc ts at Kerbela is (as shown in the next Table) over 400 each year, it is certain that a very much larger number of bodies than this are yearly deposited in those of Nejef.

It is true that a human body, even if buried freshly, becomes, in the course of several years, reduced to a relatively small volume —a handful of dust and fragments of bones. But it js equally true that it requires an enormously long period for a body, and particularly for the bones, to disappear altogether. If it be supposed that there are at Nejef 1,000 serdabs, each capable of receiving an average of 10 to 12 bodies or a total of 10,000 to 12,000 bodies in all, and if it be further supposed that only 400 interments take place each year (at Nejef the number is certainly much greater), it is clear that all the serdabs would be filled in from 25 to 30 years. If, finally, this period be tripled or quadrupled, the conclusion is inevitable that at least once in a hundred years, all the serdabs must be completely filled. And, as this process has been going on for about ten centuries, it is certain that from time to time the dust and fragments of bones to which the bodies are reduced must have been removed and disposed of elsewhere. It has been asserted that these remains are removed from time to time and burnt in the stoves which heat the hammams or Turkish baths of Kerbela and Nejef. Inquiry on this matter (which could only be made indirectly) seemed to show that this is not a regular practice, though it is perhaps occasionally done. Eor it seems to be a fact that when, some years a° , o, the foundations were being dug for certain houses on the square called the Khaimagah at Kerbela—the traditional spot where Hussein lost his life—a large quantity of bones were disinterred, and were actually burnt in the bath furnaces. It is also stated that the mosque serdabs at Kerbela are emptied2^ REPORT on sanitary matters from time to time, and their contents deposited fcr a certain period in a depot bv the mosque, to be later thrown out into the desert outside the town. y It is unquestionable that the depositing of these thousand^ of bod, ^ {rpsk and dry in the mosque serdabs has caused the land of t • that it is impossible to remain there for more than a few minutes at a time The conditions are still worse at Kerbela than at W ^ ^ela “ S t l e ^X serdab' of a certain depth are inundated, and the bodies deposited in them may be seen floating in water. The Turkish Sanitary Service and the Shiah Pilgrimage. The defence of the country against the danger of the spread of disease by pilgrims andTcorpses was carried out under the Constantinople ^ W frontier! have already ‘f SmtaX and Irah-Arabi the organisa- tion ^ ^ncipli* health office was at Bagdad, where the medical officer bore the title of Inspector, and had nominal control of all the other health offices a lLarets in C regions. Health offices existed at Kiazime.n, Kerbela and Neiof at liu'dieila Amara, Ali-el-Gharbi and Gourna on the Tigris, and a Musseyib, Kufa, Shenafieh and Samawa on the Euphrates or its branches At all these offices there were one or more sanitary clerks and guards , one o y, that of Neief possessed a medical officer ; and at some there were one or more mounted sanitary guards. The main use of these offices was to report to Cons- tantinople the 'occurrence of cases of plague evamine the papers of pilgrims or corpses, to collect the sanitary dues, . that the regulations for the transport of bodies were complied with, and to prevent “ sanitary contraband ”. For the last object the mounted guards were especially employed. The Commission proposed certain modifications in the personnel of Hiese offices, which need not now b ® .^P eat ® d ® her e creation of a new office, with mounted guard, at Kifil on the Euphrates, where contraband was particularly common. Regulations tor the transport op dead bodies. While disease has been repeatedly introduced and spread by the movements of Shiah pilgrims, it is noteworthy that it has apparently rarely or never been so by the movements of Shiah corpses. No instance could be tiaced either plague or cholera—the two diseases mam ly dealt ^^h^nder the I te - national Conventions—had been imported or diffused ^ by these dead ) - How far this is to be ascribed to the sanitary measures m force is uncertain. Possibly such bodies do not in any case constitute a great danger, but i is certain that all measures tending to diminish the number of bodies and to lessen the offensiveness of this Sbiah custom are desirable, it not an aoso u e necessity. . . Reqillations for “fresh” bodies .—As already stated, no fresh ho y is, m principle, admitted for burial at Kerbela or Nejef, unless death has occurrec a a place not more than 12 hours’ journey from those towns. Consequently (sa\ e m the case of contraband), no such bodies come from other countries, ex cep m cases where, by special request of the relatives, a body dead for loss than ice years has been admitted to the country, by special decision of the Constanti nople Board of Health. Such requests had been common in recent years, and on each occasion the Board granted permission, provided certain conditions were fulfilled in regard to the carriage of the body. These conditions were laidIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 35 down in the “Regulations respecting Exhumations at Constantinople ”, dated December 27th, 1862. The Commission proposed to generalise such decisions, and to decide that bodies less than three years dead could always be imported if the regulations in question—which are very strict—were complied with. Each body would be required to be accompanied by a medical certiticate to the effect that death had not been due to infectious disease ; and it was further required that the body be placed in a lead coffin, of at least 3 millimetres thickness, completely filled in with sawdust soaked in a disinfectant solution (sulphate of zinc or of iron) ; this coffin was to be placed in a wooden case or outer coffin, at least 3 centimetres thick, closed with screws and bound with three iron bands. The medical certificate was required to be visa’ed by the Sanitary Authority and countersigned by the Turkish Consul in the port of departure. It was also proposed to admit “ fresh ” bodies {i.e., less than three years dead) from Turkish territory, if the above conditions were fulfilled. This would have done away with the “ 12-hour zone ”, but on the other hand it would have made the transport of such bodies so troublesome and costly that the effect would have been to diminish greatly their numbers. No regulation existed hitherto determining the nature of the coffin or wrappings round the bodies coming from the 12-hour zone, and the primitive way in which they are carried has already been mentioned. The only formality required was a certi ficate, issued by the Imam or Mukhtar of the town or village from which the deceased came, showing the date and place of death, and the name of the person bringing the body. In addition to the bodies coming to Kerbela or Nejef from elsewhere, there are naturally many burials of the inhabitants of these towns. The population of Kerbela is estimated at 50,000 and that of Nejef at 30,000. With a mortality of only 25 per 1,000 (it is probably much higher), there would be 1,250 inter ments a year in Kerbela and 750 in Nejef. But to the permanent population has to be added the pilgrims staying in the towns, and particularly the mujavirs —Shiahs who spend months and even years here, among vrhom are many old, infirm and even moribund who come to these cities solely wfith the object of dying there. Many of the inhabitants of both towns possess family tombs, in the court yards of their houses or elsewhere, scattered through the town ; others possess serdabs in the mosque enclosures. The repulsive conditions resulting from burial of fresh bodies in the mosque precincts have already been referred to. The Commission proposed to prohibit all such interments, except in certain exceptional instances. These precincts are situated in the very centre of the town, closely surrounded by a network of bazars and narrow streets, where the people are densely crowded in very insanitary houses. These precincts are constantly visited by hundreds and even thousands of persons, who remain in them for hours or days together. In all countries the burial of bodies in churches or mosques in the interior of a town has in recent times been prohibited, save in exceptional cases, and such interments are actually forbidden by the “ Regulations concerning inhumations in Constantinople and its suburbs on the Bosphorus,” in force since 1868. Under this code exception is made only for members of families who possess turbehs, or masonry-lined tombs hermetically sealed, “ of ancient date ”, and for certain “ hauts personnages”. The Commission proposed, to apply this code strictly in the Shiah cities. The interdiction to bury bodies round the mosques would be surrounded by conditions such that no religious sentiment w r ould be touched, and it would apply solely to fresh bodies. Dry or mummified bodies were still to be per mitted to be buried here. The inhabitants of the cities w r ould have had no cause for complaint, since it would be easy for them to inter their bodies in the cemetery outside the towm, and transfer the remains three years later to the mosque precincts. It was further proposed to permit those of the inhabitants v r ho could prove that they possessed family tombs or serdabs to bury their dead in these, even in a fresh state, but only under certain clear and onerous conditions. Thus posi tive proof would be required that the family really owned the tomb in question, and accurate registration of such tombs (wffiich does not exist at present) would F 23(3 REPORT ON SANITIARY MATTERS be necessary. SecondJy, the privilege of burying fresh bodies would be granted only on payment of a much heavier defnieh tax than at present; the Com mission proposed to multiply the existing tax by ten. Since the actual tax varies from £T. 1 to £T. 60, according to the position of the tomb, the future tax would vary between £T. 10 (£0) and £T. 600 (£540). The Commission made it quite clear in its Report that the Board of Health could not of itself modify the taxes, hut it proposed that the Board should make strong representations to the Evkaf — the department primarily concerned — to the effect that the privilege of burying fresh bodies in the mosque precincts, which constitutes a real danger to the public health, should involve a much higher (ten times higher being suggested) charge than at present. It was also proposed to make exceptions in the case of burial of the “hauts personnages ,” religious and civil, who are specially mentioned in the Constanti nople regulations above referred to. Regulations for “ dry ” bodies .—Bodies less than three years dead were first prohibited from entering Turkey from Persia in 1871. On January 8th of that year, when the then Shah of Persia was returning from a pilgrimage to the Shiah cities, his representative entered into a convention, to that effect, with Midhat Pasha, then Vali of Bagdad. Later the prohibition was extended in principle to bodies from Turkish territory. Bodies from other countries arrive either by way of Basra or across the Turko-Persian frontier. At Basra very few bodies are imported from India. The transport of such bodies is regulated by a Circular of the Board of Health, dated September 22nd, 1909, which requires that the body must be three years dead and must be coffined in the elaborate manner already mentioned as required for fresh bodies. The Commission, considering that “ dry ” bodies offer no real danger to the public health, proposed that such bodies, both at Basra and on the Persian frontier, should be admitted if accompanied by a certificate showing that death had occurred at least three years before; such certificate would be delivered by the municipal authority of the place where the corpse had been exhumed, and could be visa’ed by the Sanitary authority and Turkish Consul in the port of departure. In the case of dry bodies coming from Persia or Russia across the Persian frontier, the only condition actually required is that death shall have occurred at least three years before. The large majority of these bodies come by way of Kermanshah and Khanikin. At Kermanshah, they undergo a first inspection, by a doctor in the service of the Constantinople Board of Health, who delivers to the bearers a certificate, without charge. This certificate has to be stamped by the Turkish Consul in Kermanshah, rvbo makes a charge of P. 50 (8s. 4f/.). On arrival at Khanikin, the bodies are inspected a second time ; the Kerman shah certificates are collected and sent to Bagdad, the sanitary tax of P. 50 is collected, and a tezkere, or numbered receipt, is delivered, showing the name of the bearer, and the date and place of decease. These tezktres are examined at each town where there is a health office—more particularly at Kiazimein and Musseyid— and are finally delivered up to the health office at Nejef, or Kerbela in exchange for a “ burial permit ”. Dry bodies from Turkish territory should also be accompanied by certi ficates, delivered by the health offices, at a cost of P. 20 (3s. 4c/.). Bodies arriving at Kerbela cr Nejef without such certificate are regarded as having come from Persia, and are charged the frontier tax of P. 50. “ Sanitary Contraband ” in dead bodies. Contraband in “ fresh ” bodies .—It is evidently far more difficult to smuggle a fresh body than a sack or box of bones. Consequently such attempts when they are made at Khanikin, are generally discovered and frustrated. But a certain number of such bodies do evade the authorities and crossing the frontier at some other point, follow devious routes over the desert and ultimately reach the Shiah cites. Still more numerous are the bodies coming from places in Turkish territory beyond the 12-hour zone. It is to be noted that it hasIN MESOPOTAMIA, ETC. 37 nerer been made clear whether a “12-hours’ journey “means a iournev on horse-hack, by camel, in a carriage or on foot. Actually many fresh bodies arrive with certificates from places at least 24 or even 48 houra away from Kerbela or Nejef by the quickest mode of travelling. In other cases, persoS bringing bodies from outside the zone or even from Persia, get the oridnal certificate exchanged for another in some village or town within the 12 -hour Zfcrth JJotTCm rarC a PP ar ®^^y ^ or corpses to be brought secretly, at night ,vprr n !f r! )y bodies of Arabs or Kurds, numbering several score^ or even hundreds, who bury the corpses in the cemetery outside the town w^hout any formahty.

CALCUTTA: PRINTED BY SUPDT. GOVT. PRINTING, INDIA, 8, HASTINGS STREET. But there is also another form of contraband, which consists in attempting fco smuggle through goods with dead bodies. The bodies are placed in a coffin or box, and surrounded with valuable merchandise, such as saffron, camphor and even fruit, in the hope that the coffin or box will not be opened and that the goods will thus escape the heavy customs dues to which they are liable. Actually the only means of dealing with such forms of contraband lies in the vigilance of the sanitary officials. When detected, a dry body in contra band is seized and kept until claimed and the sanitary dues are paid j no punishment is inflicted; the bearer is however handed over to the local authorities, but as there exists no law or regulations permitting these to inflict a penalty, the offender is immediately released. The Commission proposed, as in the case of contraband in fresh bodies, to institute a system of fines, the amount to be fixed by the authority already referred to. Such fines would, as in the case of fresh bodies, be divided between the Board’s Pensions Fund and the persons detecting the offence and arresting the offender. It may be mentioned that in 1907 the Board of Health did introduce and for a time applied a fine of £T. 1 on persons detected in acts of sanitary contraband, subject to the approval of the Turkish government. But the Board had acted ultra vires in taking this decision; the consent of the Turkish government was not forthcoming, and the fines were dropped. But, if the Commission’s proposals had been adopted, the whole question would have^ been dealt with by the only competent body—the Mixed Commission for Itevision of the Ottoman Sanitary Tariff; a regulation, embodying a system of graduated fines, would have been drawn up, and there was reason to hope that it would have received the consent and sanction of the Porte and the Powers. It is certain that unless and until some such system of penalties is adopted and strictly applied, acts of sanitary contraband will continue to be as frequent as in the past. Finally, it may be stated that any attempt to put a stop to the practice of carrying bodies from near or far to the Shiah cities for burial would be foredoomed to failure. The custom is too deeply rooted and too essential a feature of the Shiah religion for any such attempt to succeed. It has occasion ally been suspepded by certain governments under exceptional circumstances —as by the Persian government when cholera was raging in Persia in 1904, or by the Indian government after the appearance of plague in India in 1S96 but it was clearly understood that such suspension would only be temporary, and the number of bodies greatly increased the moment such interdiction was relaxed, showing that the carriage of many bodies to Irak-Arabi had been merely postponed to a more favourable period.CALCUTTA: FEINTED BY SUPDT.

It will be of interest to describe briefly the route which this projested railway is destined to follow. I was imoraed by Meissner Pasha, the constructor of the Bagdad Railway (formerly chief engineer to the Hedjaz Railway, and who was resident in Bagdad in 1915-14), that the line will start from the main Bagdad Railway, not at Bagdad itself, but at Sumeikha, some 60 hilometres to the north. It will cross the Tigris at a point 154- kilometres from oumeikha., will pass by Sadieh and Delteeua, will cross the low hills of Jebel Hamrin and Jebel Zennabieh, will then pass over the river Diala by a bridge at a point near the encampment of Taweila, whence it will run to Kizil-Robat and so on to Khanikin, Kasr-i-Shirin and Kermanshah. The route the railway will follow is therefore not identical / j with the present road from Bagdad to Khanikin, except beyond Kizil-Robat. Meissner Pasha further informed me that the railway will pass quite near to - within 300 m. of - the present lazaret of Khanikin, which may well therefore continue to occupy the exceedingly convenient and suitable site it now occupies. While on the subject of railways, mention may also be made of another projected line, to run from Kermanshah, through Ramadan and Tabriz, to Julfa, the present terminus of the Russian Tiflis-Julfa Railway. The completion of this network of railways, should it ever be realised, will undoubtedly attract a largely increased number of merchants, pilgrims and other travellers from the Caucasus, from Transcaspia and the@ other Asiatic provinces of Russia, and from all parts of Persia. It is possible also that not only larger numbers of Shiah pilgrims going to Kerbela and Nedjef, but also of Moslem pilgrims going to Mecca and Medina will make use of these railways. For it would then be possible for them to travel the whole distance by train from their places of origin to Mecca - firstly, by the Russian and Persian lines, then by the Khanikin-Bagdad railway, the main Bagdad Railway to Aleppo, thence by the Aleppo-Damascus Railway (vi&amp; Homs and Hama) to Damascus, and from thence by the Hedjaz Railway to Medina and (when completed) to Mecca. In support of what has just been said, it would be easy to quote many instances in which the opening of railways has led to an immense increase in the number of pilgrims to various religious centres. The completion of the Hedjaz Railway from Damascus to Medina has already led to a marked growth in the number of pilgrims proceeding to that city. In India railway facilities have greatly increased the number of pilgrims to Hardwar and other places of pilgrimage; and in Russia, the opening oi the Trans-Siberian Railway led to similar results; notices were printed in the various native dialects and hung in the principal stations, offering greatly reduced fares to pilgrims, and this was followed by an immense rise in the number of Shiali pilgrims to the shrine of Imam Riza in Meshed, (close to the Russo-Persian frontier).[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty * i EASTERN SANITARY REFORMS. f7\ CONFIDENTIAL.

Although this decision was in accordance with the wishes of the board, the form °u ? r 111 wbl , lfc was couch ed gave offence, and at tbe general meeting held on the loth instant a heated discussion arose as to the right of the Grand Vizier to order the revision of any decision of the board concerning the disposal of moneys entrusted to its care. .

A motion to this effect was carried. I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note verbale from the Porte and of a despatch from Dr. McClean reporting the meeting.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 60, Commercial, of the 9th instant, I have the honour to forward herewith, a despatch from the Rritisli delegate on the Board of Health relative to the 50 per cent, additional salary granted to the Turkish member of the sanitary mission to Basra and the Turco-Persian frontier. TV ITH reference to my despatch No. 116 of the 22nd ultimo, I have the honour to report that a special meeting of the Board of Health was held on Saturday in connection with the approaching departure of the sanitary mission to Basra and the Turco-Persian frontier. Dr. Djenab Bey, who had returned from Paris the day before, was present, and made a hard light for wdiat he considered his legal rights in the matter of the sum to be granted for travelling expenses. TJltimatelv, however, he consented to accept the £ T. 500 already decided on by the board, but insisted on receiving his 50 per cent, additional salary during his absence from Constantinople. M ith the exception of myself, all the members of the board present at the meeting, who seemed anxious to accept any compromise, yielded to Dr. Djenab Bey’s demand! and it was decided to allow him the 50 per cent, added salary as well as the £ T. 500 voted to the other members of the mission. I entered a strong reserve, inasmuch as the two conditions under which His Majesty’s Government had agreed to the vote of £ T. 2,500 -namely, that all members of the mission should be paid alike, and that tbe total of £ T. 2,500 should not be exceeded, unless proof were furnished that more had actually been spent— weie thus violated, and I must consequently seek fresh instructions. In view of the facts that the above decision was unanimous (with one exception), that a literal application ot the regulations in force is in favour of Dr. Djenab Bev’s claim, and that any further attempt to annul the decision w r ould not onlv have no chance of success, but would increase the friction and difficulties resulting from his inclusion (now inevitable) in the mission, it would not, I think, be desirable to take any further action in that sense in connection with the present mission. I would venture to suggest, however, that I or my substitute on the board might be instructed to repeat the protest made at Saturday’s meeting, and to declare that His Majesty s Government will not consent to future missions unless it is understood from the first that all members of the mission receive the same allowance. To meet a possiole suggestion that that condition might be complied with by granting to the foreign members of the mission the equivalent of the Turkish member’s 50 per cent additional salary it might perhaps be added that it is of course understood that the allowance must be not more than to cover, on a fair and even generous scale, the exnenses aetnnllv innnvrArl I have, &amp;c.

The decision as to the sum to he voted to the members of the mission to cover their expenses was adjourned until yesterday In the interval the members of the mission—with the exception of Hr. Hjenab Shehabeddin Bey, who had unfortunately left for Paris, to attend the meetings of the International Health Bureau, on which he is the Ottoman delegate met and unanimously agreed to propose to the Board, firstly, that the sum allotted should be the same lor all members of the mission, whether Ottoman or foreign, and, secondly, to fix the sum at £ T. 500 each, made up of £ T. ICO for “ frais d’equipement ” (as in the case of the mission in 1911 to the northern part of the frontier), and £T 400 for “ frais de route.” I he necessity of the first proposal was made clear by the fact that in some previous missions of the kind the Turkish member had claimed and received over and above the sum allotted by the Board an additional 50 per cent, of his ordinary pay during t ie whole time the mission was absent. The second proposal, to fix the sum at £ 1. 500, was based on a detailed examination of the probable real cost of the journey and allowed a considerable margin for “ faux frais.” As I had occasion to point out in my despatch No. 96 of the 4th September, 1912, there exists no rule to guide the Board in determining the sum to be voted to such missions. On some occasions the members have received a sum calculated according to the Turkish Government “ Beglement sur les Erais de Itoute”; on others (as in ie ease of the Camaran Mission in 1906, and the Hedjaz Bailway Mission in 1908) the Board has voted a fixed sum, based, as in the jmesent instance, on the more or less probable cost of the journey. The Turkish Government “ rAglement ” is an antiquated document; the “ frais de route” are there calculated at so much per hour, the sum varymg with the monthly pay of the official. The “ hour ” is reckoned as the i ^ ^ miles ? ea ancl 5 kilom - Jan h. Officials whose pay exceeds L000 piastres a-month receive ^ per cent, of their pay per hour. The distances from Constantinople to all the principal towns of the Empire are indicated in a table specially prepared for this purpose. ' -rm n V' Cas ° m ^ s ^ ons the Board of Health, such as the one now in question, it 1S Ct i • 1 ° SOt i ^° W ^ lls £&lt; r ^gl em ent ” can be held to apply. The foreign members are 10 i^hish officials and should not be treated as such. Moreover, it is a matter of [1-923 JF 11 B GEtVEn^Nw ^ 14N0V1913 , ‘ T'W Copy to India 14 NOV 19132 mere cliance whether the Turkish member of the mission happens to he a highly paid one, such as the vice-president or inspector-general with 8,000 piastres a-month, or an ordinary member with 5,000 piastres a-month. The former would be entitled to travelling expenses at the rate of 40 piastres an hour, the latter at the rate of only^A 25 piastres an hour. Yet the real expenditure incurred by members of the mission, whether Turkish or foreign, would be just the same in one case as in the other. It has further to be noted that the “ r5glement” is strictly applicable only, or mainly, to officials joining their post, and not to the members (not even to the Turkish member) of a mission such as the one now under consideration. Article 18 of the “ r5glement” may, however, be held to apply, and this article is as follows :— “ Les fonctionnaires speciaux qui sont nommes a un poste provisoirement et en qualite d’ambulant sans appointements fixes, recevront a forfait des frais de route selon leur grade et leur situation et selon I’importance de la mission qui leur sera eon flee, pour faire face a toutes leurs depenses. 1 ’ This article would seem fully to justify the action of the Board in fixing a definite sum for the present mission’s travelling expenses. In the case of some previous missions—notably in that of the then vice-president (Dr. Djenab Shehabeddin) and the Trench delegate to Tebuk in 1911, referred to in my despatch No. 66 of the 8th June, 1912, the British member received his travelling expenses calculated as above on his pay of 8,000 piastres, while the foreign member received his only at the rate of an ordinary Turkish member with 5,000 piastres pay. The utter inadmissibility of such an arrangement is too obvious to need comment. It is therefore satisfactory to be able to report that the Board yesterday decided \ that, in the case of all such missions in the future, the members, whether Ottoman or \ foreign, shall receive the same amount for travelling expenses. It was further decided ) that the Finance Committee shall study the question, and make definite proposals for ! fixing a basis on which in future such expenses shall be calculated. In the case of the mission to the northern part of the Turco-Persian frontier in 1911 the members received £ T. 100 as c&lt; frais d’equipement ” and “frais de route reglementaires,” based on the pay of the Turkish member, which in that instance was 5,000 piastres a-month. Dr. Djenab Shehabeddin, the Turkish member in the present instance, receives 8,000 piastres a-month, and he has claimed to be paid his travelling expenses on this basis, together with £ T. 100 as “frais d’equipement” and 50 per cent, additional pay during the whole of his absence. It is estimated that, on this basis, he would receive some £ T. 1,200. If all the members received the same sum—and, as stated above, any distinction is inadmissible—the cost of the mission would be not less than £ T. 6,000. The disproportion between this large figure and the practical results that may be expected from the mission is too obvious to need dwelling on. It is perhaps a third or a half of any sum that is likely to be spent on lazaret constructions or repairs in the regions visited. Even as it is, the mission will cost £ T. 2,500, and it was not without dilficulty that the German and Persian delegates \ were induced to agree to this figure. It now appears that on Thursday last, before leaving for Paris, Dr. Djenab Shehabeddin drew not only the £ T. 100 for “ frais d’equipement,” but also his “ frais de route reglementaires ” as far as Basra—not far short of £ T. 200—or nearly £ T. 300 in all, and this in spite of the fact that the Board on the preceding Tuesday had definitely adjourned for a week all decision as to the travelling expenses of this mission. The irregularity of such a procedure—to use no stronger word—was unanimously condemned at yesterday’s meeting, by the Turkish members no less than by the foreign delegates, and the Finance Committee has, in consequence, been charged to make proposals for rendering impossible such irregularities in future. It now remains to be seen what action Dr. Djenab Bey will take in this matter. It is thought unlikely that he will accept the £4.500 decided upon; in which event it may be hoped that the Board will maintain a firm attitude, and declare that lie must either accept its decision or yield place to some other Turkish member who will accept it. There are at least three other members who would willingly do so, and whose co-operation would be of more value to the mission than that of the present inspector-general. I have already in a previous despatch (No. 94 of the 17th September) drawn attention to the unfitness of that official to take part in such a mission. I must further state that, in my opinion, there is grave risk of the mission proving a complete fiasco should he be the Turkish representative on it. One of the most important and- mi im ll flfill !■ I'M -- - pasn^Hj delicate tasks of the mission will be in connection with the expropriation of land for the enlargement or transfer to another site of the Basra lazaret. As will be seen 1907 a^ruioVwhen’B 5 enCe T thlS SUb ' ieCt i (my ° Wn and Mr ' Crow ’ s despatches) in ri 9 fo J question was to the fore, the proprietors of the various ter tile ami 110 jt ls Relieved, of the local authorities, asked fantastic sums or the land, ran up buildings on sites where none existed before in order to claim still 'T ceedcd in settin = their '‘igh prices adopted l,v the official this kind of nhnsi y rr C Ti * 11 !, , afc Dr ' 1 &gt; -i enab Be y woul(1 willingly lend himself to teterests ofthe Board IlS Jl ' ^ m Y anabl y been one of b *tility to the financial interests ot the Board, which he regards as a semi-foreign institution; and on all occasions notably in connection with Ids opposition to the proposals of the Mixed Com mission—he has endeavoured to secure, at the Board’s expense, supposed advantages 0 ns Goieminent or to other furkish administrations. It is obvious that if the present mission is to succeed in its endeavours to settle fairly the question of land expropriation at Basra, its Turkish member must work heart and soul in the interests “ ' ! heavv and mnTt par - tlc , uIar '. u lts fi “ anc ial interests ; otherwise either a deadlock 1 a eavy and most unjust dram on the Board’s funds will be inevitable. But, as just shown, such single-minded co-operation is the last thing to be expected from , r V. J . e 5 j iey ’ a | K . 1 tbe more 80 ln that in these negotiations an unscrupulous Juikish member will have ample opportunity of making illicit gains for himself. I am, moreover, informed that Dr. Djenab Bey has stated in conversation that tZn^lTr'trir 1 16 pe r, 0na] '. y Tisit any portion of the lan(I other But T -m, ffi mte J ■ l ) - y l 1 ! 0 , utlilt y . ot an y of us going further is open to question. &lt; n hi mly of opinion that, once m those regions, it is essential that we should once and for all, visit some of the principal places along the frontier-such as Alehin,’ u timamch, Rowanduz, and Rayet—if we can possibly do so. I sav this advisedly since our failure to go beyond Khanikin will certainly lead not onlV to attacks and recriminations from o her members of the Board but to a proposal at some future date to send an equally costly and (let us say) an equally useless mission to the portions of the frontier not visited. More than one member of the Board has already indicated his intention to act in this manner. It is therefore essential that the lurkish member of the present mission shall go prepared to visit with the other members whatever portion of the frontier the mission finds it desirable and—in view ot local dangers and difficulties—possible to visit. I have entered at some length into the above considerations in view of their intrinsic importance, and in compliance with the request of the Foreign Office for information as to the route the mission proposes to follow, and as to the probable outlay involved. 1 \\ ith reference to the question of expense, an important point to be borne in mind is that m any case, this expenditure is quite extra-budgetary; there is no heading in the budget under which it can properly fall; and consequently—as in all such classes ol expenditure—the sum required cannot, strictly speaking, be voted without the I unanimous consent of all the Governments represented on the Board. x&gt;rr l n ° W t0 re( l uest the con sent of His Majesty’s Government to the vote of rj .7 7 500 to cover fhe cost of the present mission, and I would venture to urge that n that consent be given, it be accompanied by a declaration that His Majesty’s Govern ment will not agree to the mission’s goingat all if it is to involve a still heavier outlay. I should be grateful if a telegraphic reply could be asked for to this request, as the probable date ol tbe mission’s leaving is rapidly approaching. I have, &amp;c. F. G. CLEMOW.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith a despatch from the British delegate on the Board of Health, reporting on Sanitary Mission to Basra and Turco-Persian frontier. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES M. MARLING. Enclosure in No. 1. Hr. Clemow to Mr. Marlinq. (No, 94.) Sir ^ Constantinople, September 17, 1913. IN my despatch No. 12 of the 22nd January last I had the honour to report that the Board of Health had then decided to adjourn from last winter to that of 1913-14 the despatch of the Commission of Inspection which, it will be recalled, it had intended to send to Basra and the southern portion of the Turco-Persian frontier, and left the exact date of departure and other details to be definitely determined at the first meeting of the Board held in the present month of September. Until yesterday, however, no mention of the subject was made in the Board, though the members of the Commission had met several times and discussed the many aspects of the question. Yesterday the Inspector-General, Dr. Djenab Shehabeddin Bey, a member of the Commission, stated to the Board that the latter thought of starting about the middle of October by a Russian steamer which goes direct from here to Basra. The German delegate added that the Commission would present to tbe Board, before starting, a “ programme ” of its intended movements. The Vice-President, Dr. Cassini Izzeddin, demanded an adjournment of all discussion until next Tuesday’s meeting. I consequently reserved my observations until that occasion. In the meetings of the Commission itself, I had expressed some doubt as to the desirability of so many members of the Board (the Commission is composed of five) absenting themselves at the present time, when the Board is about to undertake the task of spending on the lazarets £ T. 280,000 put at its disposal by the Mixed Commission. I also stated that I should have to obtain your permission to go with the mission if it leaves now; and I added that I was in any case doubtful if I could possibly get away as early as the middle of October, owing to the fact that Dr. McClean and Mr. Weakley are both away, and that the former will probably not return until the end of October or beginning of November. Should the mission start at the time mentioned, I venture to suggest that perhaps Mr. Ryan, with his consent, could act for me on the Board between that date and the date of Dr. McClean’s return. I have therefore to ask your approval of my taking part in the mission at the present time and, should that approval be granted, permission to start at the date mentioned, if the question of my substitute can be satisfactorily arranged in the meantime. I should add that there is a distinct current of feeling among some of the Turkish members of the Board against the opportunity of sending the mission at this moment, and particularly against the present Inspector-General, Dr. Djenab Shehabeddin Bey, taking part in it. It is certaiidy almost, if not quite, without precedent for an Inspector-General to be absent from his post for so long a period; and it is also very undesirable that he should be so at a time when cholera is widely prevalent, when infected troops, prisoners, and emigrants are arriving in the Turkish lazarets in increasing numbers, and when the Moslem Haj is approaching its height. The Turkish members referred to aver that the Grand Vizier will not permit Dr. Djenab Bey to take Copy to India [1887 aa —1] # * i a n 'T'part in the mission, but, on the other hand, that official states that he has already obtained his chiefs authorisation. His elimination from the Commission, if the latter is to o-o, would be of real advantage, for, as the sole Turkish member, he would be the natural go-between between the Commission and the local authorities, and his untrust worthiness (already referred to in some of my previous despatches), his tendency to create or increase rather than to smooth away obstacles, and his somewhat Anglophob^ ' sentiments would but add to the difficulties with which the mission will have to I would beg that your instructions may reach me before Tuesday next, when the final decision will almost certainly be taken.

I stated that I was instructed to ask that the despatch of the mission be adjourned for another year. I dwelt upon the fact that the hoard is now called upon to undertake the complete reorganisation and reconstruction of all its lazarets, with the £ T. 280,000 put at its disposal by the Mixed Commission, and that it did not seem desirable that five of the principal members should be absent from the board at such a time, more particularly as cholera was spreading widely in Turkey and adjoining countries. The German delegate asked that the decision should be adjourned for a week, and to this I agreed. I can count on the support of three or four Turkish members and as many foreign delegates, but it would be very desirable that pressure be brought to bear upon the Grand Vizier, in order to ensure a majority for the proposed adjournment.

(Signed)CONSTANTINOPLE. January 22nd, 1915. Sir:- I have the honour to report that the Board of Health, at yesterday’s meeting, decided to adjourn the sending of a mission to the southern part of Turco -Persian frontier until next winter. It will he recalled that (as reported in ly despatch No. 96, of September 4th last) this mission was to have started in December. Owing to the war it was decided, at the meeting of November 5tn, go adjourn the start of the mission until t»he iiiiddle of January ”if circumstances permit”. I c/., of Gi-e existing situation, of the possibility of one war beginning again, and of the fact that, •• ^ war begins again or not, the state of affairs i^cie must continue to be critical for some time go come, it was generally agreed that it was not desix for five of the principal members of the Board to visit His Excellency The Right Honourable Sir G.

It was fm ther decided tnat the Board will, in the first meeting in the month of September next, decide definitely the date at which the mission will start. i.'ijne can, I fear, be little doubt that the results of one war - tne actual loss of territory and the possible still further loss if an unsuccess ful war be further prolonged - must seriously affect the Board of Health, not only on its financial side but possibly from many other points of view also. cO'iuinued vigilance will oe required to reduce to a minimum tne harm done or that may yet be done both, to the status of the Board and to its finances. I trust therefore that your Excellency will approve of the Board's decision, though it is regrettable uiis.o tjie reforms on uiie Turco-Persian frontier and at Basra met once again be delayed. In this respect, however, it is to be feared that these reforms will only- IS onlj/’ Biiare in the general delay which now seems Inevitable in carrying out the projected reforms in all other parts of the Empire.

SU P 4rieur de Sa 'te is to send to the southern half of the l urco-Persian frontier in the course of next winter. M. de Gieis said that the sanitary mission which had visited the northern part of the frontier had been led, unavoidably, to express opinions as to what the actual frontier was • this was undesirable and he would like, if possible, in order to avoid repetition of such results, to put off the proposed mission lo the south for a year, by which time the pending boundary questions should be settled. His Excellency wentbn to say that he understood that the German Ambassador was very anxious that the German delegate should take pan in the mission, on the grounds that German interests were involve.? by the approaching construction of the railway to Bagdad and the branch to Khanikin He thought this pretext would not bear examination ; at all events Russian interests on account of the very large numbers of Central Asian pilgrims that annually enter Turkey by the Khan.k.n route, were much more considerable, and he wished therefore to see Russia and not Germany represented in the mission. It had been decided that the mission should be composed of three members, two of whom would naturally be the Turkish a,nd the Persian, while the British delegate was practically certain of election for the third place. Would it be possible for Dr. Clemow to decline election in favour of ns Russian colleague, an arrangement which he thought would make it impossible for th ■ German delegate to insist on his own participation. There was the alternative of course, of having a commission of four members, but it was by no means sure that the German delegate would not be elected instead of the Russian, and in any case he, M. de Giers desired to avoid an incident with the new German Ambassador • . 1 :°.l Gf v?, , P tllat &gt; much as 1 sil0uld 1; ke to meet his wishes, I could not instruct the British delegate to propose, or support a proposal, for the postponement of the mission. It had already been delayed for twelve months, and for us who had for a ong time past been constantly urging the imperative necessity of the construction of a new lazaret at Bussorah, where so overwhelming a proportion of the travellers entering lurkey were British-Indian subjects, would be absurdly inconsistent As for suggesting that Dr. Clemow should resign his place—which I believed was practically assured him—that was equally impossible in view of the magnitude of our interests and t ij r £ e Bntlsh and Indian colonies at BussoVah, Bagdad and Kerbela and Nejef. 1 would, however, speak with Dr. Clemow and see if something could not be done, at all events to exclude the German delegate in a manner that could not give offence to the b-erman Embassy, and include the Russian delegate. Two days later I saw M. de Giers again, and informed him that all that Dr. Clemow could suggest was that he might endeavour to secure a commission of four members and even this would be doing violence to his conviction that the smaller party would be the better, on the grounds both of economy and efficiency, and procure the election of the Russian delegate, but this would involve an undesirable trial of strength between German and Russian influence on the board, the issue of which Dr. Clemow thought would be very doubtful ; Dr. Clemow would be ready, however, to canvass his colleagues betore the meeting of the board on the 3rd. M. de Giers, however, did not press m°e to instruct Dr. Clemow to do so, nor so far as I can learn did he take any steps outside the board with that purpose. I'he result was, as foreseen by Dr. Clemow and reported in his despatch enclosed in , my Commercial despatch above referred to, that the mission will consist of five members, ^ Vl z., lurkish, Persian, British, Russian, and German.

The Russian proposal uwt with practically no support, and the Board then proceeded to fix the number of Members composing the mission.

In my opinion, exclude all Idea of sending a mission of more than three. Unfortu nately, owing to the determined efforts of the Gercan and Russian delegates to be Included In the mission, I was unable to carry my proposal. The Vice-President made 4 counter-pro posal to fix the number at five, and the result of a vote was that the latter peeposal was carried by 14 votes to three.

It was further decided that the mission should start In December, the exact date to be determined later* I cannot pretend to regard the result as satisfactory, a commission of five members, by no means wholly compatibleV’ L* in their characters and views will only too probably prove to be an unwieldy and unworkable body, while the choice of the Turkish manlier is distinctly unfortunate* The proper composition of the mission would have been that proposed by the Lazarets Committee last spping:; - namely, the Persian^ ^irl tish delegates and a Turkish member* These are almost the only Powers interested directly in the sanitary defences at basra and on the frontier* Russian interests are but ns all, and German can scarcely be said to exist* hut both the Russian and Genian Ambassadors appear to have attached much importance to the inclusion of their delegates; and I gather that the majority of the Board were loth to include the one and not the other* But it must be held to be very doubtful whether such considerations suffice to justify the immensely increased expenditure that an increase from three to five members involves• \ In my Annual Report for 1911 I drew attention to the tendency to abuses in connection with these recurring missions of the Board* In the last seven years the Board has spent considerable bver £T*8 f 000 in such missions* The •frais de route* are always fixed at a rate that far more than covers the outlay; and it is as certaincsrtain as anything can ha - *11 saute aux yeux* - that, in the case of some members of the Board (I am not referring nos to the German or Russian delegate), their eagerness to take part In such missions mould disappear If the allowance sere only such as to cove* the actual outlay. This was the principle I laid dosn shen. In 1908, the first of the missions (that to Oaaarsn, Xeddah and the Syrian ports) was proposed. Unfortunately It has proved &lt;*iite impossible to adhere to it. Th e Turkish mmsbsr usually claims to be paid acceding to the TUrkk^j government Regiement for the travelling expenses o. officials, and claims half his pay in addition during the time taken by the Journey, and this has generally (trough not always) determined the amount allotted to the foreign members. But this method has not always boon follosed, sometimes a lump has been fixed, more or less by guesswork? sometimes the government 'frais de route' have been granted, plua £100 for Initial outlay (equipment). Briefly there is no definite rule, and It Is highly desirable that acme rule were laid down (by the Mixed Commission, for example), and that the rule were based on the principle that the members pf such missions should ba so remunerated that they would neitherS7 gain nor loss by taking part in thw. would hava the additional advantage of escoluding aenbere idio - to apeak &lt;pUte frankly - add less than nothing to the ^ffioianoy of the nisaion aid take part in it alaoet exclusively with the objeot of gaining money* The 11 ffaie de route* 1 of the present usbsslon have not yet bean determined* It ell} probably cost anything lroa *2,000 to £T•3,000. ’Ihie ie not a mere gueaaeork figure; the oorreeponding mission mhioh went last year to the northern part of tho Persian frontier was composed of three members only; it was absent sorie four weeks; it covered a relatively short extent of ground; and the Turkish member of it was the Ineppctour Adjoint too so pey is P .6,000 a month* The mission now decided on will contain five members; It must be absent at least three or four months; it will cover from two to three times the . . ^ extent of ground of toe other; and toe Turk! to member is the vioe~president of the *&gt;o*rci, whose pay is P*8,000 a month* in view of these facts (to which it should be added that the Turkish government rules fix travelling ■ IcIua ^ expenses in proportion to toe pay of the official), the Cigar* above mentioned must be regarded ee an exceedingly conservativePut fltVfr A A'l V In any farther communica tion on this subject, please quote No. ' and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

So far as I can ascertain, from the maps at my disposal (and 1 have copies of most of the best known maps of these regions - both English and Russian), all the places in question are distinctly on the Turkish side of the frontier as that frontier is shown on these maps. H is Excellency Right Honourable S:ir G. A. Lowther, G.C.M.G., C.B., ^ c, » &amp;c.maps. However, to avoid all risks, my Russian colleague and myself agreed, with Your Excellency's approval, to make a joint declaration to the Board to the following effect:- that the adoption of the Report of the mission could not be held as prejudicing in any way the conclu sions to which the frontier delimitation Commission now sitting might come, that our acceptance of the Report was conditional only, and that the actual carrying out of the mission's proposals should, in our opinion, be adjourned until the line of frontier had been definitely determined by the Delimitation Commission. This declara tion was made by the Russian delegate, in our joint names, at Tuesday’s meeting of the Board. ihe French and Persian delegates pointed out that this question had been referred to in their Report, on pages 16 and .17 of which they v/rite as follows 'II importe de specifier que le trajet de cette 'ligne n'est pas definitivement arrete; une commission 'devant, parait-il, se rendre prochainement sur les 'lieux, il se pourrait que quelques modifications 'fussent apportees et que tels villages qui meritent bien aujourd hui le nom de villages-frontieres 'cessassent de le me'riter dans quelques mois.

Sir, Constantinople, February 24, 1912 AS 3 oui Excellency will recall, a mission of inspection was sent last summer to the northern portion of the Turco-Persian frontier by the Board of Health, with the object of surveying that frontier and reporting on the measures of reform and reorganisation required in the sanitary defences there existing. I have the honour now to transmit printed copies of that mission’s report.* The report is divided into four chapters, as follows : ( 1 ) historical summary, (2) the actual sanitary organisation, (3) the principal geographical, political, economic, and hygienic conditions found on the frontier (northern part), and ( 4 ) the reforms that are possible and necessary. The report, which has been written by Dr. Delamare, the recently-appointed 1- rench delegate, throws useful light on many of the above conditions. It shows very \ clearly how rudimentary are the present arrangements for the sanitary defence of the i frontier line ; but it at the same time, and quite rightly, dwells on the impossibility of 1 having an ideal and complete series of barriers against the invasion of disease along a line of such length and of such a character as this portion of the frontier presents. The final chapter, therefore, which contains the practical proposals of the mission, limits itself to certain suggestions, simple and few, which are not only “ necessary ” but also “possible,” and it is satisfactory (and rather unusual) to note that in the heading to this chapter the word “ possible ” takes precedence of the word “ necessarv.” This is all the more satisfactory in that one of the members of the mission was the Persian delegate, who, both in the board and in the Mixed Commission, had made demands, vague ana shadowy it is true, involving a vast multiplication of sanitary offices and lazarets, the necessity (and even the utility) of which would have been more than doubtful, while he appeared to attach little importance to the practical possibility of bringing them into existence. At present the sanitary defence of the northern part of the frontier is supposed to be under the direction of the sanitary offices of Erzeroum and Van. Both are declared to be situated too far from the actual frontier to ensure an effective control, dt is proposed therefore to leave to the Erzeroum inspector, solely, the control of the 1 urco-Russian frontier; to suppress the post of medical officer at \ an ; and to have two medical officers, one in the neighbourhood of Kizil-Dize, the other at Hanassour, further south. The Kizil-Dize doctor would control the frontier from Mount Ararat to Hanik ; the Hanassour doctor from Deir to Neri. The former would have under his orders The principal measures of reform proposed are the following: cr • 1. Personnel. [2406 d—1] * Not printed.three mounted sanitary guards, one at Kizil-Dize, one at Gurjibulak, and the third at Serai or Itazi, according to the season and circumstances. The latter would also have three mounted guards, one at Hanassour, one at Dize or Bazirge, and the third at Neri 0 r Halona, also according to the season and circumstances. 2. Constructions. It is proposed to have two sanitary stations, one at Injessou or Kharabe-Cordon (both in the Kizil-Dize neighbourhood), the other at Deir or Hanassour. The former would consist of four pavilions: one for disinfection, two for the isolation of sick or suspects, and one for the staff, together with a small laboratory. The station further south would be smaller, consisting of a pavilion for disinfection, one for the staff and one for the sick, and a laboratory. The situation of all the above-mentioned places is shown on the map which accompanies the report. The impression left on my mind by the report is that the proposals have been carefully considered, that they are of a reasonable and moderate character, and that there is consequently no reason to raise any objection to their being carried into practice.

W ITH leference to my despatch No. 9 of the 20th ultimo respecting the projected mission of the Board of Health to Bussorah and the Turco-Persian frontier I have the honour to report further as follows :— For many reasons^ it seems probable now that this mission will be unable to start this winter, and that it will have to be postponed until next winter. The Turkish member, Dr. Akil Bey, who was to have taken part in the mission, is unable to go just now, and there is no other Turkish member who is both suited to take part in the mission and able to go on the journey at this time. It would, moreover, be rather late m the year now for the mission to start—not, that is to say, if it could start in the next week or two ; but the board has not yet definitely elected the members of the mission, and once it has done so some time will be required for preliminary preparations. A start before the beginning of March would probably be impossible now. It would take a full month to reach Bussorah ; perhaps another month would be required for the work to be done at Bussorah, the journey thence to Bagdad, and the preliminaries there for the expedition to the frontier. It would therefore be the beginning of May by that time, and the great heats would have already set in. For these and other reasons it seems almost certain that an adjournment until (say) January next will be decided on. The adjournment is not, from my point of view, a wholly regrettable matter, though it is unfortunate that it will involve an adjournment of the reforms so urgently required at the Bussorah lazaret. But, on the other hand, there are many ’very important questions (particularly those connected with the proposals of the mixed commission) which require dealing with here, and which would be only too likely to remain in suspense were this mission to leave now. M ith regard to the question of a possible visit to the ports of the Persian Gulf, I note that, in Sir George Barclay’s despatch No. 27, Commercial, of the 29th November ast (which appears in the last Confidential print received), stress is laid on the tioublesome action of Dr. Feistmantel, the Austrian delegate on the Tehran Sanitary oard, and for a time acting Turkish delegate. Dr. Feistmantel, it appears, read a ormal proposal to that board on the 28th August last “ to invite the commission of he Constantinople Board, shortly about to study the sanitary defence of the Turco- , ersian frontier, to visit the Gulf and to study the sanitary situation there. Indeed,” he despatch continues, “he had already announced^in the early part of the meeting la b as acting Turkish delegate, he had already made a proposal in this sense to the Ocird. I have consequently examined Dr. Feistmantel’s reports to the administration [2372 t — 1] 5MAR191&lt;y2 here, and I find that, in a report dated the 31st August last, No. 55, after giving a resume of his controversy with Dr. McConaghy, he wrote as follows :— “ Je suis d’avis que toutes ces questions devraient etre etudiees sur place par une commission speciale aussitot qu’une occasion favorable se presente. Puisque une commission d’etudes, deleguee de la part du Conseil superieur de Sante de Con*^ stantinople, se rendra cet hiver a la frontiere turco-persane, et puisque le Conse^ sanitaire de Constantinople est fortement interesse en tout ce qui concerne la defense sanitaire du Golfe, je proposals ” (he., at the meeting of the Tehran Board on the 28th August) “ que le Conseil sanitaire de Teheran fasse inviter cette commission de venir a Bouchir, au cours de son voyage, pour examiner les questions susdites avec les delegues du service sanitaire persan.” This report was received in Constantinople on the 18th September. It is minuted “ a la Commission des Lazarets.” It has never been presented to that commission nor to the board, and has since been relegated to the archives of the administration. No such invitation as the absurd one proposed by Dr. Feistmantel has been received by the board here. Presumably the Tehran Board itself realised the absurdity of the proposal and refused to act upon it. Were such invitation proffered, I can practically guarantee that (so long as I have any power on the board) it would be declined at once. I may add that it would not be a wholly regrettable matter if such an invitation were received, as its obviously inadmissible character would furnish a very sound excuse for refusing to allow the other members of the mission from here to visit the sanitary stations in the Gulf. I should add that, so far as I can ascertain from an examination of all , Dr. Feistmantel’s reports and telegrams to Constantinople, he has never himself made a direct proposal to the board here that its mission to Bussorah should visit the Gulf ports, though he appears to have stated that he had done so.

I now enclose herewith a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s Minister in Tehran on the same subject.* Your Excellency will observe from this correspondence that the attitude of the Austrian delegate as regards these matters is one of continual hostility towards British interests.

In doing so, you might, if you think it necessary, bring more particularly to his Excellency’s notice the instances of Dr. Eeistmantel’s action at the meetings of the council of the 30th April, 1910, 1st May, 1911, and 28th August, 1911, on which Sir G.

IN answer to }our telegram No. 4, Commercial, of the 11th instant, I have the honour to submit to you the following particulars of the proposal to establish an international sanitary council at Bushire made by the Austrian delegate to the oamtary Council, and of other grounds of complaint against him: — t \'i 0n , t 1 ie lst 0cto1)e B 190/, Sir C. Spring-Bice telegraphed to the Foreign Office that the delegate after consultation with the German Minister was sending the proposal m question to his Government (Tehran telegram No. 2S3). 2. At a meeting of the Sanitary Council held on the 2nd December, 1907, the delegate showed some dissatisfaction with the improvements in the Persian Gulf sanitary service which, it was announced, His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India were prepared to make and then formally proposed to establish a local sanitary council at Bushire. The president pointed out the objections to this step, but Dr. Feistmantel persisted. He was supported by the Ottoman delegate (Tehran despatch to the Foreign Office No. 265 of the 5th December, 1907) 1 larly m the following year the German charge d’affaires told Dr. Neligan that Ins legation would strongly support Dr. Feistmantel’s proposal should it come up again (Tehran despatch to the Foreign Office No. 8 of 1908). Still later the German consul at Bushire “ approached his Itussian colleague with a suggestion that he should move Dr. Bussibre to revive the proposal originally put forward by the Austro- Hungarian delegate on the Sanitary Council at Tehran for the establishment of a somewhat similar body at Bushire” (Tehran despatch to Foreign Office No. 16, Commercial, of the 4th May). This resume of the papers in question shows I think, Sir, that during t’se period w hich they cover the Austrian delegate allowed himself to be used by the German Legation to further its plan for the establishment of an international sanitary council at Bushire, and so to obtain a strong footing in the Gulf. The proposal has not been again brought forward, but Dr. Feistmantel has not failed to attack the quarantine administration to the Persian Government both in and out of season, and to seek for opportunities of interfering in Gulf questions. The following instances may be cited :— 1. At the meeting of the Sanitary Council, held on the 30th April, 1910, he read an attack on the chief quarantine officer in reference to the epidemic of plague which had just broken out at Bushire. Dr. Feistmantel tried to show that the officer } in question had been lacking in his duty in not ordering the inspection and disinfection of people leaving Bahrein, whereas, at the time there was no plague in ihe islands. When it was pointed out to him that Bahrein was outside the sphere of the quarantine service, Dr. Feistmantel suggested that the chief quarantine officer was ignorant of the epidemiology of the Gulf (Tehran despatch to Foreign Office, No. 14, Commercial, of the 16th May, 1910). 2. The Austrian delegate has more than once in conversation expressed the opinion that shipping in the Gulf should pay quarantine dues. In June 1910 he j showed Dr. Neligan a complete scheme of taxation—the proceeds of which were to form the nucleus of a budget for the Sanitary Council—which would therefore be able to interfere more directly in Gulf sanitary matters. This scheme had been drawn up in co-operation with the German Legation and the Turkish delegate. It has not been brought forward so far, for Dr. Feistmantel agreed after his conversation with Dr. Neligan not to do so for the time being. Such a scheme drawn up by a ^ foreign delegate to a Persian board of health showed a wish to meddle unwarrantably in matters which concerned only the Persian Government primarily and ourselves secondarily as the owners of by far the greatest amount of shipping in the Gulf (Tehran despatch to Foreign Office, No. 25, Commercial, of the 30th June, 1910J. [2295 5-2] B 19 JAN 1912 (stCRETARY’S N2 32 3. At the meeting of the Sanitary Council held on the 1st May, 1911, Dr. Peistmantei read a note on the recent epidemics of plague in the Gulf, which raised the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf. He added that he, as acting Turkish delegate, would draw the attention of the Constantinople Board of Health to the question and asked that the chief quarantine officer should be instructed to take special precautions (Tehran despatch to the Poreign Office, No. 9, Commercial, of the 10th May, 1911). it later was shown that the “note” in question consisted of inexact quotations (unadorned with inverted commas) from an inaccurate index written by Dr. kussiere to the report by Dr. Paul Paivre on the “Defense sanitaire du Golfe Persique, Purther, with regard to the origin of the epidemic of plague at Bushire in 1910, Dr. Peistmantel stated that it was due to the importation of old bedding from Bahrein, and thus succeeded in suggesting that the quarantine arrangements were not efficient. As a matter of fact Dr. Peistmantel knew from the report on the epidemic, which the chief quarantine officer has sent to the Sanitary Council, that such an origin was out of the question. He preferred, however, to base his statement on a report of the German consul at Bushire, who was the first to advance the above- mentioned theory. These matters, as well as others raised by “ Dr. Peistmantel’s ” note, were satisfactorily dealt with by the Sanitary Council (see Tehran despatch to the Poreign Office, No. 17, Commercial, of the 15th August, 1911, and Bushire despatch, No. 51, of the 18th June, 1911, copy of which I have the honour to enclose). 4. Dr. Feistmantel, however, returned to the charge at the following meeting of the council held on the 28th August, when he read a second note designed to recover some of the “ face ” which he had lost at the previous sitting. _ The material for this effusion was supplied by the German consul at Bushire, and it consisted largely of truisms and of a series of questions to which no exception could be taken. Dr. Peistmantel, however, at the end of the note read a formal proposal to invite the commission of the Constantinople hoard, shortly about to study the sanitary defence of the Turco-Persian frontier, to visit the Gulf and to study the sanitary situation there. Indeed, he had already announced in the early part of the meeting that, as acting Turkish delegate, he had already made a proposal in this sense to the board. The visit of such a commission is quite unnecessary and would he highly objectionable, likely to reopen as it would be the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf, sentinel stations under international control included. This final proposal of the Austrian delegate constitutes a most unwarrantable and unnecessary piece of interference, but enough has been said to show that he loses no opportunity to interfere in quarantine matters affecting the Persian Gulf and to attempt to cast discredit on the quarantine administration. He is, in fact, a tool of the German Legation. In view of the above tacts, I have ventured to propose that his Government should be invited to request him to he less aggressive in the future (despatch No. 20, Commercial, of the 6th October). «*As a supplement to this despatch I beg to enclose a memorandum prepared by Dr. Neligan on this question in September last, at the time at which it appeared advisable to draw attention to the Austrian delegate's attitude in the Sanitary Council. I have, &amp;c. G. BAECLAT. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Dr. Neligan to Sir G. Barclay. gj r Tehran, September 3, 1911. IN view of the references, frequently deprecatory, made respecting the Gulf sanitary service by Dr. Peistmantel, the Austro-Hungarian delegate to the Sanitary Council, you have asked me to state the grounds for and against taking steps to diminish his interest in that particular direction. Two outstanding facts should form the preliminaries to the discussion of Dr. Peistmantel’s attitude :— 1. That he is primarily a sanitary delegate, and devotes nearly the whole of his time to sanitary matters. He has shown himself almost as much interest in the3 msa sanitary defence of the northern and western frontiers of Persia as in that of the Gulf. He lias a great dear of time on his hands, and spends it in drawing up reports and schemes for the protection of Europe from a Persia, which he believes to he a constant ^ menace (in the sanitary sense). By activity in these matters he no doubt gets kudos *in \ ienna, lor everything that he writes finds its way there. -• Hiat 1'r. Pcistmantel is the real German delegate on the council. The German doctors who have been here during the past five years have none of them been able to speak Prench fluentl}', and the Austrian delegate has therefore always been the mouthpiece of the German Legation. Of this he has made no secret in his conversations with me, for he has quoted to me Count Quadt and Hr. Listeman, the German consul at Bushire, who, as you know, has several times attacked the Gulf quarantine service, and is constantly intriguing against it. I might add that Hr. Peistmantel is always very friendly with the Turkish delegates. r ihe position adopted by the Turkish (fovernment towards our quarantine administration may or may not be judged by the action of its consul at Bushire in 1910 and again recently (vide iroces-rerbaux of Sanitary Council Nos. 77 and 9-1). The question therefore to be decided would appear to be whether Hr. Peistmantel is simply an enthusiast in the matter of sanitary questions, and, as far as the Gulf is concerned, a busybody, or whether he is a simple intriguer against our regime there. But it is not necessary to discuss either supposition, for he so obviously fulfils the conditions of the first, and the fact that he is the real German agent in the council is a sufficient answer to the second. His references to matters affecting the Gulf quarantine service will be found dealt with in my reports of the meetings of the council during the past five years. In May last he raised the whole question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf in a note read at the ninetieth meeting of the council. This note was full of erroneous statements drawn from the writings of Hr. Bussi&amp;re (a former spy on our administration) and from a report of Hr. Listeman’s. These statements have since been corrected (vide proces-verbal of the ninety-third meeting), and Ur. Feistmantel has accepted the corrections. He has, however, in return, proposed that a commission, which has been sent by the Constantiuople Board of Health to study the sanitary defence of the Turco-Persian frontier, be invited to visit and report on the same question on the Gulf. Indeed, he has gone so far as to suggest on his own responsibility (he is acting Turkish delegate) to Constantinople that this should be done. Ur. Peistmantel still shows a determination to father reports from Hr. Listeman, and to deliver Count Quadt of them in the Sanitary Council. This is of course annoying, for neither Dr. Peistmantel nor Hr. Listeman (whose doctorate is not a medical one by the way) know everything about the plague to take the subject which is at present occupying their attention, while the men we send to the Gulf have all had experience of it, and of dealing with native populations. That there are weak spots in the quarantine service cannot be denied, for instance, in the accommodation for passengers at certain ports. We cannot object to criticism as long as it is fair, and that of Hr. Peistmantel has not always been so. It is true that objections raised at Vienna will not lessen German animosity towards the quarantine service, and that though they may put out of action its most capable exponent in the Sanitary Council, it will simply be diverted into another ’channel. I would therefore be inclined to advise against taking steps at present, were it not for his proposal with regard to the commission, referred to above. The visit to the Gulf of such a commis sion would be highly distasteful to us, and would not, in my opinion, be of any use at all. The only thing to be said in its favour is that it is composed of the British, Prench, and Persian delegates on the Constantinople Board. We do not, however, want that body at any cost to meddle in the affairs of the Gulf. Hr. Peistmantel is going on leave almost at once. Therefore, as far as the Sanitary Council here is concerned, no action will be taken in the matter, unless the Turkish delegate takes it up on his return from leave. I have, &amp;c. A. It. NELIGAN. P.S. September 18.—Hr. Peistmantel has been acting for Turkish delegate, who is on leave. When the former left, he handed over the papers, &amp;c., to me, and asked me to act until Hr. Amadeo arrives. It is quite evident from his reports to Constan tinople that Hr. Peistmantel has gone out of his way to induce the Board of Health to raise the question of the sanitary defence of the Gulf.

I HAVE the honour to forward herewith for your Excellency’s information, copy oi a letter which I have addressed to the Government of India, dated the 18th June, 1911, in connection with the proceedings of the ninetieth seance of the Sanitarv Council at lehran.

THE proceedings of the Tehran Sanitary Council, dated^th^ bf“llay! befng of special interest I have the honour to address the following observations to the (jovernment of India in connection therewith. ,, 2 - P( * ra 9raph 3 (a) of the Proceedings.—One of the delegates draws attention to the fact that the outbreaks of plague in the Gulf ports during the last few years have always occurred in the spring, and suggests for the origin of them an explanation £ ur ^? rtll ?f to . b( l j: 1 , 1 ® 0W B» but really only the resuscitation of a theorv advanced by Hr. Bussiere m 1904. I shall return to this later. * As a layman, I have always connected the outbreaks with the annual arrival at this season from Bombay and Calcutta of the special steamers which bring large cargoes of nee to the Gulf ports, the presumption being in my mind that plague- mtected rats find their way ashore with the rice ba^s. It is true that outbreaks have occurred with such chronological regularity of a e ye&amp;rs one cannot but suspect that the disease must have become endemic in some o the Gulf ports, but that is a question which I must leave to responsible and expert professional opinion. But what I am primarily concerned to communicate to Government now is the suspicion generated in my mind by a consideration of the identity of the delegate above referred to, and of the possible motive of his present Gulf °f Dr * Buss ^ re s fanciful theory as to the probable origin of plague in the The f unctionary in question, Hr. Eeistmantel, is Austro-Hungarian and Turkish representative on the Sanitary Council, and from the first has been pointedly hostile to the Gulf quarantine service under British management (vide, for example, legation despatch No. 14, Commercial, dated the 16th May, 1910, to His Majesty’s Eoreign Jfhce). this fact makes it difficult to disassociate from his proceedings the suspicion that they emanate from an ulterior motive connected with Tureo-German policy. . J ^ rl oonnee tion with the proceedings of Dr. Bnssiesre, the use made of him by the German consul at Bushire, and the attitude of the Austro-Hungarian delegate on the Sanitary Council, I would invite reference to despatch from Tehran to Foreign Office, i\o. 16, Commercial, dated the 4th May, 190S. The views expressed by i. ussieic, on which Hr. Feistmantel now levies unacknovdedged contribution, were Hr. Buspere himself is sufficiently sketchy in his geography when he speaks of T L e «j^ Biad), sur la cote arabe d’El Hasa, au voisinage de Bahrein but r. leistmantel goes further, and exaggerates the convenient inaccuracy by leaving out all mention ot El Hasa. Both doctors ignore the fact that the country' between Nejd and the coast, nearly 300 miles distant, is practically desert and the tribes nomadic Hr. laivre himself, when referring to the question of communication between the interior and the coast on the Arab side, wrote :—“ Toutes ces routes presentent, au point de vue dela dissemination du cliolera et de la peste, un interet en rapport avec leur importance; la plupart ne traversent au voisinagc du Golfe, surtout sur la c6te arabique, que des regions desertes peu favorables ti la propagation des epidemics. La grande voie fluviale du Chat-el-Arabe, ffeste la plus dangereuse, et c’est elle qu’il importe surtout de surveiller et de proteger. ,, Dr. Theodore Thomson, also, in his later report of 1906 (July) (Foreign Depart ment endorsement No. 4149-E.R, dated the 23rd October, 1906), referring to the Arabian side of the Gulf below Koweit, wrote :— “ The extension thence of cholera or of plague by land is not to be seriously apprehended, because of the tracts of desert that lie along and beyond the shores of the Gulfs of Oman and Persia on the Arabian side, in consequence of which there is little or no communication by land with the countries from which these diseases might conceivably spread in the direction of Europe.” 4. When Dr. Bussiere wrote the report in question he had only recently arrived in the Gulf, and could have no first-hand knowledge of conditions ruling there in respect of such subjects as the pearl fisheries, and his remarks in the latter regard appear to me to be altogether inaccurate. Firstly, the sorting and packing of pearl shells certainly does not take place in the spring, i.e., before the pearling season begins. It is during the pearling season— say, June to October—that the boats coming in from the pearl banks for supplies bring with them their last batch of shells and sell them ashore, and any sorting or packing goes on then until just after the pearling season. Again, Lingah has quite enough to do with her connection with the pearl banks on the Persian side, and it is by Persian and not Arab dhows that she is frequented. The latter use their own ports of origin on the Arab coast for their supplies. Again I would emphasise the fact that in 1904, when Dr. Bussiere wrote this report, he was being specifically used by the Russian consulate-general and M. Naus, to assist in the task of ousting us from the control of the Persian Gulf quarantine, and his report must be regarded as coloured by the policy for the furtherance of which he had been brought to Bushire. Dr. Feistmantel is apparently animated by similar sentiments of hostility to our regime, and it is not surprising that he should have bethought himself of Dr. Bussiere’s theory to further his aims. 5. As Dr. Thomson’s report had apparently acted as an antidote to Dr. Faivre’s, Dr. Bussiere’s note was not taken very seriously at the time, but it seems possible that Dr. Feistmantel may contrive to get his views aired at the Paris Conference; it may therefore be well to have full rebutting information ready to hand, and I am taking steps to get it. 6. From the political point of view it is easy to understand how convenient and welcome to the Sublime Porte would be the existence of an accepted theory that Central Arabia and the hinterland of the Arab coast were foyers of plague, and that the pearl-diving fraternity formed the medium for the spread of infection in the Gulf. Such a theory would furnish Turkey with means of consolidating her position ’ in Nejd, and strengthening her shaky footing at points on the coast or in the hinter land, through the 'instrumentality of quarantine measures dictated by the Board of Health at Constantinople, and necessarily having the countenance of the European Powers. She might even succeed in directing international attention to the question of the rights of control and jurisdiction over the floating population on the pearl banks during times of epidemic. My apprehensions may perhaps be considered at present to have no very lively foundation, but I submit' that Dr. Feistmantel’s remarks at least point to the expediency of our maintaining a vigilant look-out for any further signs of a disposition to push the policy of which his revival of this theory may be a harbinger. 7. On its merits the suggested explanation would appear to be purely conjectural. There is not the slightest reason to suppose, as tar as I know, that there is any endemic plague in Nejd, and as Drs. Faivre and Ihomson have admitted, it is on the face of it unlikely that plague would get any footing there owing to the nomadic character of the sparse population, the absence of settled villages near the coast, and the slowness of communication between the coast and the interior. I here would appear to be in fact as little fear of the spread of infection to or from that centre as there is in the case of Mekran either inwards or outwards and for the same reasons.. 8- Paragraph 5 of the Proceedings .—The friendly tribute of Dr. Georges, the retiring president to the Gulf sanitary service generally, and to the residency surgeon, Captain McConaghy, personally is satisfactory, as is also the fact that in Dr. Georges, as the representative of Persia at the Sanitary Conference at Paris, we shall have a functionary who has shown himself personally, and officially, friendly to our quarantine' regime. * I attach a copy of a telegram sent by the residency surgeon to the Sanitary Council in connection with the subject of this letter.

The details are misleading and exaggerated, and have no authority as compared to the official reports furnished by the chief quarantine officer which showed that durin.o&gt; the period of epidemic, the 27th April to the 3rd August, 286 deaths occurred from all febrile disease including plague of which fifty-six cases were admitted to be plague. As regards outbreak of 1910, please note that assertion regarding importation from old bedding is unfounded, and that I definitely stated in my report of the 22nd August to the president that there was not the slightest ground for the suspicion that the infection had been brought from Bahrein. I respectfully protest at inaccurate information from extraneous and irresponsible sources being resorted to while authoritative official reports of chief quarantine officer to president are studiously ignored.In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Ixmdon. 10J«N!S!2; The Uitder-Secretary of State for Foreign siffairs presents</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00007c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/231</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00007c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/231</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 842/1912 'Sanitary Mission to Turco-Persian Frontier'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1916</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-03-24T18:51:49</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (174 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the volume.The subject 842 (Sanitary Mission to Turco-Persian Frontier) consists of 1 volume, IOR/L/PS/10/231.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 174; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
