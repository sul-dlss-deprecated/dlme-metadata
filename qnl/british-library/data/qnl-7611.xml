The series of reconnaissances the detailed reports of which are given in these two volumes were carried out under the orders of General Chapman, c.b., a.d.c., Quarter Master General in India, under the direction of Colonel M. S. Bell, v.c., a.d.c., Deputy Quarter Master General, Intelligence Branch. The object was to explore various tracts of little known country through which roads lead north from the head of the Persian Gulf to the Wallat of Van and North-West Persia near Urmia. To accomplish this, two routes through Luristan from the Tigris valley were travelled. In Southern Kurdistan the roads from Kifri to Sulaimaniah, from there to Bawanduz, and Baw- anduz to Amadiyeh, were gone over in Turkey, and Suj-Bulak to Karmanshah through Sakiz and Sihna in Persia. The country south of lake Van to Mosul was traversed in the routes Amadiyeh to Mosul, Mosul to Jazirah, Jazirah to Bashkala, Bashkala to Urmia, and Urmia to Suj Bulak through Ushnu. The report has been compiled in two volumes—the first containing the Narrative Report, description of large towns and routes leading to and from them, the various tribes, religions, &amp;c. Volume II gives a detailed description of the routes trav elled between the principal points, and is intended chiefly as a supplement to Volume I. The barometer heights have been worked out, and inserted in the detail of Volume II. &gt; They were taken with an aneroid, and the heights are rela tively correct. They are measured in feet above sea level at the Persian Gulf.I vi A map has been compiled by me of the country passed through showing the detail of the routes, heights of principal points, dis tricts occupied by the different tribes, telegraph lines, &amp;c. . The routes were d rawn orginally to a scale of 1 mile to 1 inch, and reduced by photography to 8 miles to an inch, on which scale they were copied on the map sheets. Simla, 1889 . F. U.

Bundar Abbas .—Bandar Abbas is an open roadstead partially sheltered by the east end of Kishm island and Ormuz and Larak islands to the south-east and south-west respectively. The anchorage is 2 miles from the shore in 3 to 4 fathoms. A low sandy beach extends for some distance on either side of the town, and landing is generally easy, except with a south wind, which gets up a considerable surf, the beach being open in- that direction. There is a small pier 100 yards long and 40 yards broad, with 6 feet of water at high tide, but the beach round it is uncovered at low tide.- VOL. I. B2 Cargo has to be landed in lighters, and carried from them to the beach on men's backs. The boats vary a good deal in size. The smaller size would carry about 7 tons, and the larger 20 tons. I/inga. Linga is also an open roadstead, vessels having to lie about U miles from the shore in 5 fathoms of water, their position being entirely open to the snemal ov north-west wind. Landing is easy as a rule. There are a considerable number of bug galas and lighters, and some were building on the beach. There is a small harbour of stonework about 100 yards square, dry at low tide, with an opening on the north side for boats to enter. Bahrain. Bahrain is an island on the Arabian coast. The anchorage is 4 miles off the town in 6 fathoms of water. Landing is difficult, the water being very shallow for some distance from the shore. The channel is buoyed by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the outer buoy being IS mi es from the town. The navigation of the channel approaching the town is Bushahr. Bushahr is the principal seaport of Persia, but the harbour is by no means a good one. The anchorage, called the “ Outer Roads,' is 6 miles from the town in 4 fathoms, and that of the “ Inner Roads ' is miles from the shore. Vessels drawing 13 feet can enter the “ Inner Roads.' • in 1 th6 P i? r ™ o C1 ™ izer Per * e P olis , manned by German officers, was in the harbour. H.M.S.

P ed up Stream lo ' 1 ^ before the tide was atPao Port. The Turks have recently built a fort on the extreme end of the low spit of land ■called the Ras-el-Bisheh, forming the south-west side of the entrance of the river. It was begun in May 1886, and has been built under the superintendence of Kamil Bey, who lived in Busra. Work has gone on with some intermissions since 1886, and the construc tion seems now nearly complete and ready to receive its armament. Its cost when completed was estimated at £107,000 to £150,000. Any approach to it is most jealously guarded by the Turkish officials and soldiers quartered near it. A good view can, however, be obtained from passing vessels. The fort is nearly rectangular, and is of the shape known as a blunted Construction. redan. The south-east or front face of the work is designed to command the only navigable deep water channel, and the approach, of ships from the bar. The left face, that parallel to the river bank, looks out north-east across the river. The right face looks out south-west over the mud flats of the Khor Abdallah. The gorge abuts closely on the line of date plantations which fringe the bank in rear of the work. The south-east face consists of two flanking bastions joined by a curtain of masonry. In the curtain are two emplacements, in which it would seem two heavy guus are to be mounted in open casemates fronted by iron shields. There is a central traverse between the gun emplacements. No shields have as yet been brought into position, and the embrasures are loosely bricked up ; but from the trace it is certain that some such method of mounting will be employed. The two guns to be mounted on this face will probably be not less than 25 to St) tons each. This is the face which immediately commands the main channel, and would naturally be expected to be the heaviest armed. Two heavy guns would be quite sufficient to defend this long narrow channel, which is the only one by which ships can approach. There are no signs of circular emplacements for barbette mountings in the corner bastions ; and these are intended as traverses for the right and left faces, or to be filled with casemated barracks, or ammunition stores, judging from the ventilator tops that can be seen appearing above them. The escarp wall shows above the glacis crest some 15 feet, and is of strong masonry, faced with white sandstone brought from Kouait. This makes the fort easily visible from the seaward against the dark background of date plantations. The left or river face is not as strong as that just described. The con- Left face. struction is similar, namely, two bastions connected by a curtain. The command of the escarp wall is about 4 feet lower than that of the main face. By this means the south east bastion acts as a traverse, and defilades it from fire from the sea side. In the curtain are three openings, meant for embrasures, but still unfinished, and used as openings to carry building material into the interior of the work. It may be intended to close up these openings, and have the gun firing from disappearing carriages. The north-east bastion is casemated over, containing either quarters, or shell and cartridge stores for the guns close by it.4 The right or south-west face is similar to that just described. The con- Right face. structiou is the same, and it also has three embra sures. The armament of these faces would be of lighter calibre than the sea face—probably guns of about 5 tons weight, capa ble of being easily and quickly worked. Thus the total armament of the work would therefore be two 25 or 30 ton guns and six of 5 tons each (three on each face). The gorge or rear face is a simple stone curtain with a gateway protected Gorge. ty a caponier in the centre. The curtain contains casemated quarters, and would be unarmed except by machine guns. There is a shallow wet ditch some 30 yards wide round the fort. In Wet ditch and glacis. £ront is ^ small glacis, the interior slope of which is faced with brick. This bank is built principally to protect the foundations of the escarp against high tides. In January 1887, a very high tide, caused by a strong south-east wind, washed away a good deal of this bank in front of the main face. It was then under construction, and has been since faced with brick. It is 4 feet high and of varying thickness from feet upwards. It would protect the foot of the escarp from fire also. There is a small group of mud huts outside the gate of the fort; also a small creek and quay on the river face to facilitate discharging material from the native craft. H.M.S. Turquoise, our largest vessel at present in the Gulf, and whose heaviest gun is a 64-pr. R.M.L., might get over the bar at spring tide, but rarely risks doing so. To the south-west of the fort lie extensive shallows and mud flats, extend ing in old charts to about 6 miles, and which have probably of late years lar^'e- ly increased. ° In front of the sea and river faces are deep, soft mud flats, uncovered at low water, but with 2 feet of water at high spring tides. At ordinary tides there is a belt of mud exposed, forming a very efficient protection against boat attack. Any one endeavouring to land would sink to his waist atonce or be entirely engulfed. In front of the gorge and the south-west face are small patches of reclaim ed land and date plantation banked out from high tides, but capable of inun dation. i might be attacked from the desert, which extends to within halt a mile of the entrance immediately beyond the date plantations. This would avoid the mud flats which render the other faces inaccessible. The end of the low spit on the east side of the river mouth does not lie directly opposite the fort. Kusbah, a Persian fishing village of some 100 reed huts, is situated on this, and is 2,000 yards to the north-north-east of The bank there is hard sand and easy for landing. The shortest ranges batte r ies could open on the north-east face of the fort would thus be 2,000 yards. I he entrance to the channel from the sea is marked out by two buoys, the proper y o tie British India Steam Navigation Company, who put them own an move t rem when necessary to follow the changes of the channel, lire buoys are 4 miles apart, and the course between them for a vessel inward bound would be JV. 31° N. Between the buoys lies the bar on which at high- tkles'^”ffe^ ^ lere * S ^ °f water. The rise and fall of springIn April we crossed the bar in a vessel drawing 14 feet, but with only 12 feet of water in the channel on a rising tide ; the ship forcing her way through 2 feet of the soft alluvial mud without injury. Deep laden vessels have constantly to do this. After the annual freshets the pilots have to make boat surveys on their own account to he able to note the alterations of the channel. From the inner buoy the course to the fort is W. 48° N. for 31 miles. The channel is never more than half a mile wide, and is now the only navigable one either for ocean steamers or native craft. The course from the inner buoy is shaped directly towards the south-east face of the foil*. Consequently the fort commands the only navigable channel, and a ship must advance from extreme range under its direct fire. If the buoys were removed, the navigation would be very difficult. The deep water channel opposite the north-east face lies nearest the Turkish bank, and can be commanded by it; the greatest distance a vessel could pass from the fort being 1,000 yards. The object of the fort is more to keep vessels under a heavy fire as they ascend the channel commanded by its main face lathei than battei them foi the few minutes they would be passing along the river face. The arrival of any of the iron work or racers for the mounting of the guns would be brought to the notice of the Consul, as they would come with the armament from Constantinople. At the very least estimate it would take six months, when the armament is permitted to arrive, to get the racers, mountings, &amp;c., placed, and the guns and carnages put togetiici and ready for action. Fao Telegraph Station. The telegraph station at Fao consists of a large two-storied wooden build- ino 1 on the right bank containing the transmitting office of the Persian Gulf line (under control of the Indian Government) to the Turkish Government line to Busra and Baghdad. Steamers stop here to land mails, and there is a quarantine station. . . . The station is surrounded by thick date plantations irrigated by small canals, and there is a small cluster of huts among the trees known as Fao 'Vllls (~y* 0 On the opposite bank is a fishing village of about 200 reed huts called Mush ad. At ebb tide the river water here is fit for drinking, and a little further up it is so at all times. Several herds of cattle, flocks of sheep, and buffaloes were seen on the banks. Date plantations on the left bank do not commence until nearly 5 miles above the telegraph station. The plantations extend about 1 mile inland, and form a fringe parallel to the banks, and beyond is an endless stretch of bare sandy desert. There are a few plantations along the Bahr- 1-Mishir channel also. Ihe telegiaph, two wires on iron poles, runs parallel to the river, 2 miles from the right bank. At 19 miles above the telegraph station we passed a low island called Fedagh covered with scrub and bushes. The navigable channel lies round the west side, and a cluster of 100 reed huts stands on the left bank. Beyond stretched a sandy plain covered with short grass for about % mite on which the cattle grazed. On the right bank were thick date groves extending 2 to 3 mites inland. Several small villages were visible among the plantations, built of low reed huts. Mahallah is tor/.—Thirty-three miles above Fao telegraph station is a large island called Mahallah.6 The ship channel makes a bend round the west side of it. The east*™ channel cuts off a considerable bend, but is only navigable for small boats and liver steamers.

A prohibition against the exportation of Arab horses from Turkey has been in force many years ; but this does not practically affect the trade. The horses bred by nomad and settled Arabs in the interior are smuggled across the frontier, and shipped from the Persian port of Muhammerah. The yield of wheat last year was insufficient to render its exportation profitable ; in fact, wheat to the value of £lo,000 was imported, but this year there may be some margin available, as harvests up-country are fair. The imports are chiefly Manchester and Indian cloths and cottons, su^ar, spices, coffee, indigo, and kerosine oil. The wood of the date tree, the only indigenous tree, is used extensively for rafters for houses, landing piers, and piles to bank out the stream; but for the bettermost houses in Busra and Baghdad planks and rafters have to be imported from India. Coal for the river steamers was imported last year from England to the amount of 5,000 tons; and of the 90 steamers entering the port 88 were British. This alone is sufficient to show the importance of British trade interests here. The date season is the busiest time of year, commencing in the middle of August, and continuing through September and October. The grain export season is in May and June. The following lines of ocean steamers run to Busra: The British India Steam Navigation Company running weekly with Gulf mails from Karachi. The Bombay and Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company every fortnight from Bombay. There is also a direct line to London owned by a Jewish firm in Baghdad. In the date season numerous steamers are chartered, and it is usual then to see seven or eight steamers loading at once. The various European firms in Busra are— Messrs. Lynch Brothers (principal local office being in Baghdad). Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Agents, British India Steam Navigation Company. Messrs. Darby, Andrews &amp; Co., Agents, Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company. Messrs. Muir, Tweedie &amp; Co. (principal local office in Bushahr). Messrs. Hotz &amp; Son, a Dutch firm, with London offices. Messrs. Asfar et Cie., Agents for Mennier &amp; Cie., a French firm. The two first firms do by far the largest portion of the trade. The town is on the right bank of the river, and is distant from it 2 miles. Situation Ot the town. U st ™ d / in a Ia ^? 3rea “closed by a mud wall with round towers at intervals ; a good deal of which is now thrown down or out of repair. To reach the town from the river it is necessary to ascend a narrow winding creek. The wall encloses an irregular-shaped rectangle and measuring 4,300 by 2,200 yards wide, and was built as a protection against attacks from 5 the desert Arabs. . The is i n the south-west corner, and the remainder of the enclosure is filled with date gardens. There are fi ve gates : on the north-west face near the town is the Bab Robat and on the south-west the Bab Bakria; at the south-east corner of the rectangle is the Bab Zobair; and along the south-east face are the Bab Seraji and the Bab Minawi, the latter opening along the river bank.8 The British Residency, English merchants'’ houses, Turkish custom-house, and the Commodore’s residence are situated close to the water’s edge. On the left bank, nearly opposite the Residency, is the new Turkish hospi tal, a tine two-storied building recently built, with a small landing pier in front of it. Near it is Gardilan, a small cluster of mud huts; and beyond, through a thin fringe of date palms, is a boundless stretch of open desert. There are ruins of an old Turkish fort and barracks near Gardilan. Three hundred soldiers are quartered, in the town, and the barracks are on the creek at the north-east corner of the place. The Wall’s residence is half-way up the main creek, and the custom-house and a small Turkish dockyard factory stand at the mouth of it. The factory is used for repairing the Turkish river steamers, besides which a good deal of building and repairing native craft is done up the creek. The two Turkish gunboats anchored in the river are very poor craft, and could not be trusted far from their anchorage. Ocean steamers have to anchor in midstream, where they have suffi cient room to swing with the tide. All cargo is discharged into lighters, a species of clumsy wooden craft similar to those found at other Gulf ports. They can carry from 15 to 20 tons of cargo. The water-supply in Busra is bad. The river water is heavy and unwhole some from the marshes higher up stream. The townspeople seem content to obtain their water from a creek close by the town. Better water is obtainable from wells. In former times Busra was an emporium for the commerce between Europe, Western Asia, and the Far East. The low mounds of brick ruins and foundations of walls inside the old circle of the fortifications mark the site of a large city. It declined after the divergence of trade route between west and east round the Cape instead of by the Gulf and Mesopotamia. The opening of the Suez Canal and a direct route thereby to England is gradually reviving its commerce; also the discovery of markets in England and elsewhere for dates, its staple produce. Were it not for the shortsightedness and jealousy of foreigners of the Turks, the position of Busra upon a great estuary formed by the united waters of two navigable rivers, flowing through the richest and most fertile provinces of Asiatic Turkey, marks it as being especially favourable to commerce. In spite of drawbacks, there is no doubt the trade and importance of Busra is gradually on the increase. The present Wali, Nafiz Pasha, was formerly Commander-in-Chief of the 'VTth or Baghdad Army Corps. He is a Mushir (Field Marshal) and a personal friend of the Sultan, and is a well-mannered old gentleman, belonging to the old fanatical party, distinguished for its hatred of English influence. Zobair. Zobair is an Arab town of 6,000 to 8,000 inhabitants, 10 miles west of Busra. In spring, when the Euphrates is in flood, the country between it and Busra is under water, being part of the marsh which extends from the Euphrates above Korna to the sea, parallel to the Shatt-’l-Arab. Magil. Magil is a small village, 4 miles up stream from Busra, on the right bank. The old house of the British Residency still stands on the right bank. In the■courtyard is a tablet to the memory of the members of Colonel Chesney’s ■expedition in 1836 drowned in the wreck of the Euphrates. Coal is stored here for the Turkish river steamers, and there is a small repairing shed dock, the latter being of a deep excavation in the mud with a dam at one end. Strewn about in the mud are pieces of a large dredger or digger bought by the Turks on the completion of the Suez Canal. It is said to have cost £12(J,000, was never even put together, and is now lying useless from rust and decay. It was meant for digging and opening up some of the old canals between the Euphrates and the Tigris. The river is encroaching on the right bank, and threatens to sweep away the old liesidency in a few years. Routes from Busra. To Najd .—The caravan road to Najd, and through Arabia to Mecca, starts from Busra. It traverses sandy desert most of the way with few wells. It is called 10 days to Najd on camels, 10 or 12 hours per diem, and 20 days to Mecca. Kouait is S5 miles distant across a sandy desert with few wells. Camels take two days, and caravans can reach there in three days. lo Shustar and Dlzful .—There is a route through Hawaizah to Shustar and Dizful. It (S two days (68 miles) to Hawaizah, the stage being Jnfair, about half-way, where is a small well, but no village. Water is scarce and bad in the hot weather. The country is a bare sandy desert, parched and dry in summer, but liable to floods from November to May. At 31 miles some ruins called Kushk Busra are passed, and at 37 miles are more ruins called Kushk Hawaizah. From Hawaizah to Dizful (80 miles) is over a fiat alluvial plain, fertile, but uninhabited, except by nomad Arab and Lur tribes. It is watered by several canals from the Karun and Kerkhah. River Steamers on the Tigris. There are three English and five Turkish steamers employed in the Tigris navigation. The former belong to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany (Messrs. Lynch Brothers). According to the original firman granted to this Company, only two of these ■steamers are permitted to be employed at the same time. Ihe steamers are the Khalifa, Medjidieh, and the Blosse Lynch. They are all similar in shape and construction, and have been recently built of steel, with powerful engines (100 H. P.) and side paddle wheels. The dimensions of the Khalifa are 230 feet in length and 31 feet beam. The construction is like that of American river steamers, with wide Construction. sponsons and a double passenger deck, one over the other. There are two steam capstans, one in the bow end another in the stern, used for hauling the vessel off when it gets aground in the low season. The rudder is exceptionally long, and powerful steam steering gear is used so as to be able to turn rapidly a vessel of such a shape, the draught being small compared with the length. Steering can be done also by the paddles, as each is worked by a separate set of engines. The sponsons, 6 feet wide, extend all round the vessel, and increase the deck space considerably.10 When carrying 1 a full cargo in a high river, they draw 4 feet of water, and c&lt;r o can carry 400 tons. In the low season they are loaded according to the state of the river at the time, and generally draw 3' 6' / to 3' 8'. The average passage down stream from Baghdad to Basra is 44- hours, and 76 hours from Busra to Baghdad. The length of time taken varies a good deal in the low season according to the state of the river, and the steamers have then to lie up for the night, as some reaches cannot be navigated in the dark. In the flood season they travel day and night. Six hundred to seven hundred native passengers can be carried besides the cargo, and they would accommodate a regiment at each trip. Lighters would be available then to be towed astern. There are six first class cabins and a small saloon. They can steam 10 knots an hour, but the average speed against a knot &lt;5 stream is 6 knots. 1 ' The crews of these vessels are exclusively Chaldean Christians from Talkaif near Mosul. The Medjidieh is 4 feet broader than the Khalifa, but draws the same amount of water, so that she has the greatest carrying capacity of the three. Ihe Blosse Lynch has not quite as good cargo capacity, and draws slightly more water than the others, but she is the best passenger vessel. There is, however, very little comparison to be drawn between any of them. They were brought to Busra in pieces from England, and put together in the dock there. * &gt; r &amp; Besides steamers, there are three large iron lighters, belonging to the Lighters same Company, kept moored off the Residency at ° ‘ Basra. They were originally intended to be towed to Baghdad with cargo by the steamers, but the Company were prohibited from doing this by the Turkish authorities. fhey are now used as coal hulks or depots for cargo requirin 0 * transhipment from the ocean to the river steamers. I hey have a capacity of about 130 tons each, and draw the same depth of water when loaded as the steamers. They are fitted with steering gear and a long rudder suitable for navigat ing up the stream. Since the opening of the Karun river to general navigation, Messrs. Lynch have employed the Blosse Lynch there. Shaikh Mizal’s Steamer.—Shaikh Mizal Khan, Governor of Muhammerah, has also a steamer, which he uses now for navigating the Karun as far as Ahwaz. She is not used for purposes of trade, but rather as a private yacht for him to move about in. She is loopholed for musketry defence, and two bronze guns are placed on board when he proposes to chastise any unruly subjects up the river. She was built in England at a cost of £4,500 in 1873. She is 112 feet long and 25 feet beam, designed when carryino* her full complement of cargo to draw 4 feet of water, but in her present condition draw- ln g.~ icet 6 inches to 3 feet only. She can carry 200 tons of cargo. Ihe bulwarks are 3 feet 6 inches high, and contain 30 circular loopholes on each side. Ihere are two bow gun ports.

She experiences no difficulty m ascending the Karun at any season of the year.The Shatt-’l-Arab and the Tigris from Busra to Baghdad. The Euphrates and Tigris form one tidal channel from Korna to the sea called the Shatt-’l-Arab. Above Busra the banks are low and fringed with date plantations, with some intervals through which bare stretches of sandy desert can be seen. A few villages, clusters of mud huts, are scattered among the trees, and large herds of cattle, sheep, and water-buffaloes graze along the banks. Large stretches of rice is grown between Busra and Korna. The Shatt-T-Arab has an average width of 600 yards and a depth of 21 feet, with a current of knots during the flowing and 3 knots an hour during the ebb tide. Sea-going gunboats can ascend as far as Korna. Korna. Korna is 4 hours by steamer (40 miles) above Busra, and is a place of some 700 houses on the right bank of the Tigris on the spit of land at its junction with the Euphrates. There are some two-storied brick houses on the bank, surrounded by gardens and date plantations. A kaimmakam and a few zaptiyahs are quartered here, and a Turkish custom-house. There is a telegraph office, at which a junction is made between the two lines from Baghdad, the first or original line following the Euphrates, and the second or new line the Tigris. From Busra to Korna there are two wires car ried on iron standards. Several native river craft were building and repairing along the bank. The date plantations extend some 4 miles above Korna, and then entirely cease. North of this nothing but a few solitary clumps of trees are to be seen on either bank until Baghdad is reached. The Tigris Marshes .—Soon after Korna, we entered the great marshes of the Tigris and Euphrates which extend across the whole of the land between the rivers to the west and as far as Hawaizah to the east. In spring, when the river is in flood, the country is under water with nothing visible but tall reeds and sedges. The country in the triangle be tween Korna, Amara, and the Euphrates end of the El-Hai canal is one large sheet of water then. Another sheet of water extends parallel to the Shatt-T-Arab from the Euphrates at Suk-es-Shyukh, and enters the sea by an outlet to the north of Bubian island, and making Busra into a sort of island in the flood season. The marshes on the left bank from Korna to Amara and eastward to Hawaizah are formed by the overflow of the Kerkhah, the Tib, and Duwarij rivers from the Pusht-i-Kuh, which lose themselves in these marshes. One outlet of these marshes, called the El Hud Canal, runs into the Tigris just above Amai’a. Another, called theSwaib river, which may be taken as the main outlet of the Kerkhah, flows into the Shatt-T-Arab, 6 miles below Korna. The marshes are navigable for native craft as far as Hawaizah, but the Beni Lam and other Arab tribes make the route unsafe, and it is little used. A great masonry dam or bund once existed near Hawaizah, and controlled the course of the lower Kerkhah, irrigating a very large tract of country; this has long been carried away, and this large marsh has since formed. The ruins of cities can be distinguished through the water. The marshes are almost dry in the hot weather. c 212 In September, for a considerable way above Korna, the Arabs had gathered large crops of wheat, and the maize was nearly ripe, extending in a frino-e about a mile wide along the banks. Ezra’s Tomb .—At 80 miles, 12 hours by steamer above Busra and 8 hours above Korna, is the tomb of the prophet Ezra (called Uzair by the Arabs) It is a large group of buildings on the right bank, with a handsome dome covered with blue and gold glazed tiles, with a cluster of date palms round it. It is a place of pilgrimage, and is held in much veneration by the Bao-h- dad Jews. Some Jewish families live there to keep it in order. The force of tide reaches to this point, but not beyond. T/ic Narrows.—khw passing Ezra's tomb, the river is 100 to 150 yards wide, and the portion for hours above it is known as “The Narrows.' IVTost of the water of the river overflows in the marshes here. ; Although the channel narrows, the navigation here in the low season is not difficult. n ^i V6r w, ^ s , a &amp; reat deal here, and alters its course from year to year, bolonel Uiesney s chart of the river, done by his expedition in 1836, is not or much use now. Maize and millet are grown on the banks here in September, when the hoods have receded. Those crops were just ripening, and the barley and wheat had been harvested some time, and were piled in large round stacks. devil s Elbow .—miles above Ezra's tomb is a narrow winding called the Devil s Elbow (Mahaber by the Arabs). It is the, worst spot in the navigation of the hv'arrows. The river, running with a very strong current turns at a right angle, the width being barely 50 yards, so that to turn a steamer ~30 feet Eng in such a space requires careful navigation. With one paddle going ahead and the other astern, and letting the bow slide over the mud, we got through easily. • In the low season it is usual to try and get through the Narrows in day- hght, but when the river is high, it can be navigated at any time. taking emLankments t0 kee P out the floods would be a large under- The Shaikh of the Muntafik made an embankment for some distance a few years ago, the result being high floods lower down, which nearly swept away Busra.

On the right bank was a fringe of dry ground uncovered by the floods^ varying in width from 2()0 yards to | mile. This affords grazing for large herds of cattle, and for growing patches of wheat and barley. On the left bank are tall reeds and sedges, and the marshes unite with the water of the river. The telegraph from Fao to Baghdad follows the general direction of the river, about 1 mile distant on the right bank. Two small reed villages were passed, each with a small fort like that at Rasr Saidi. These are intended for defence against Arab raiding parties. These villages are on the right hank, where the ground as a rule is firmer and not so liable to floods. At 3 hours above Ezra's tomb is a large square fort on the right hank more substantial than that at Kasr Saidi. Walls are of sundried bricks, Iff feet thick at the bottom and 3 feet thick at the top, with an upper coping along the top of the parapet of burnt bricks. The fort is about ffff yards side, with a gateway of brick opening on the river. In April large encampments of reed huts line the bank, each with herds of cattle, sheep, and water buffaloes grazing on the short grass. Channels from &amp; to 10 feet wide are cut to drain portions of the marsh. Most cultivation is on the right bank, the left hank being swampy. In September this water was gone, and the Arabs had moved furtheir inland. Kala Saleh. Twenty-four miles above Ezra’s tomb w r e passed Kala Saleh, on the left bank, a place of 500 houses stretching about f mile. There were some- good two-storied brick houses on the river front. Steamers do not stop hare. It is a kaimmakamlik of the Busra Waliat. There is a telegraph office,, and the line is carried across the river here on poles of sufficient height to carry the line over the funnels of steamers. The houses in Kala Saleh are surrounded with gardens of fruit and date trees, each enclosed by a high mud wall. The population consists chiefly of people from Nazarieh on the Euphrates. They are of the Sabean sect, the principal religious observance of which is baptism, which they say was instituted at the Creation, and restored by their prophet John the Baptist. Their religion contains several Christian rites and ceremonies, and is interest ing mainly as the instance of the survival of the Christian tradition in Arabia. They do not acknowledge Muhammad at all. Several of this sect are to be found in Amara. Their total numbers are said not to exceed 4,000 families. The river gradually widens above Kala Saleh. A large belt of wheat and rice cultivation extends on either bank, and the banks are thickly dotted with reed hut encampments of the Marsh Arabs, and also the black blanket tents of the desert nomads now seen for the first time. A large quantity of rice is grown round Kala Saleh. At 12 miles above Kala Saleh the marsh ends, and both banks get slightly higher. Barley, wheat, maize, millet, sesame, and rice are the chief products of this district.14 Three miles farther on the wheat and barley crops, 3 to 4 miles wide, commence again on either bank. There are also large tracts of grass land. At 31 miles up stream we passed Abu Saijan, a small grove of trees on the right bank, with a ziarat. Amara. Amara is on the left bank, and is about 135 miles from Busra by the wind ings of the river (19 hours by steamer), and contains 1,500 houses with a small well-supplied bazaar. The population are chiefly settled Arabs, with some Persians driven from over the frontier, and Sabeaus from Nazarieh on the Euphrates. The houses are of sundried bricks and mud, with a few good two-storied ones of burnt brick. It is comparatively a modern town, begun 16 years ago round a coaling station for Lynch’s steamers.- The Hut canal, the northern branch of the Kerkhah river, flows in immediately above the town. At the junction of the two rivers is the serai, the quarters of the Muta- sarif and some 200 regulars. There is a custom-house and telegraph office. It is a regular stopping place for steamers; there is no pier, and they have to come alongside the mud bank as best they can. A small supply of coal is kept here. There is a bridge-of-boats consisting of twenty-three pontoons built with Boat Bridtve light wood scantling, covered with bitumen. Each pontoon is 25 feet long and 10 broad, with a gunwale of 6 feet when there is no weight on the bridge. The clear span between each pontoon is 15 feet, and a large iron chain keeps the whole in position. There is a 20-feet roadway, with wooden transoms and crosspieces, on the top of which are brushwood fascines covered with a stratum of hard clay. It is swung back to allow the steamers to pass. Amara is a thriving place, and large quantities of wheat are grown along Trade in the Amara Dis- the river above and below it. Up the Hut canal is tnct ' alluvial soil, on which grows fine wheat and barley. Wheat from the surrounding districts and wool from the Arab tribes are the chief exports. Between Amara and Dizful in Persia there is an important trade in spite of the efforts of the Turks to prevent it. One hundred and fifty muleteers and four hundred mules make two trips monthly between Amara and Dizful, and it forms an outlet for the wheat-growino- country about Dizful and Shustar. It was the more direct line previous to the opening of the Karun river navigation, but probably trade will be diverted by the steamers on that route. Along the left bank is a line of young date plantations and gardens, extending 200 to 300 yards from the bank. The gardens grow several kinds of fruit and vegetables—almonds, dates, pears, grapes, figs, pomegranates, melons, beans, onions, bamias, badinjans, &amp;c. The Sultan has made large purchases of land in this district. The land purchased was said to be paying taxes to the amount of £36,000 annually, but the Sultan purchased the whole outright for £5,000. J At 15 miles above Amara cultivation ceased and'the marshes ao-ain super- deserted Wlth the eXCepti ° n ° f a stra y reed llut ; country was perfectly In April on the right bank, for 10 miles inland, was an immense sheet of water. The river at Amara is 250 yards wide, and as we ascend it becomes wider, ana less water loses itself in the marches.Ali ShergliL N Eight hours hy steamer (55 miles) above Amara is Imam Ali Sherghi, a small shrine to which numerous sick are brought. It is on the left bank in a small grove of trees. Fijla .—Two hours higher up, on the left bank, is Fifla, a place of 50 Arab mud huts, surrounded by gardens and a few date trees. Extensive mounds, the site of an ancient city, could be seen a short way inland. Imam Ali Gherbi. Imam Ali Gherbi is a place of 300 mud houses on the right bank, 105 miles above Amara. It is a place that has sprung up within the last 15 years, and contains some well-built brick houses of otficials and merchants. There is a small post of zaptiyahs and a telegraph office. Close by is a small shrine, a favourite place of pilgrimage. A large tract of country round is under wheat and barley crop. Steamers only stop here when there is any cargo or passengers. The river here is 300 to 350 yards wide, and the banks slightly increase in height as we ascend. An hour above Ali Gherbi is a difficult reach in the low season. The river is broad, but the channel narrow and makes a sharp curve nearly at right angles, between two stakes which mark out the course. The steam capstans in the bow and stern of the steamers are very useful for getting over such places. Several buggalas were seen here in the low season unloading their cargoes preparatory to crossing. In the beginning of September the channel, which changes from year to year, has not yet formed. The bad reaches are always difficult to navigate, the shoal parts merely shifting from one part to another. Good reaches remain as a rule easy to navigate, and do not silt up. The pilot can know by the almost imperceptible ripple on the surface what depth of water there is, and when it is becoming shoal. It is easier steering going up than coming down stream, as the vessel answers her helm quicker. Two hours above AH Gherbi is another difficult reach, where in September we got aground and took two hours warping off. From constant passage of steamers the navigation is improving every year. At Ali Gherbi the river has made a wide eastern bend, and approaches to within 30 miles of the Pusht-i-Kuh range. In April there is a fringe of firm ground, 2 to 3 miles wide, from the hank, uncovered except by an occasional high freshet. Beyond this were large sheets of water, which had dried up in September. “Suss^ or liquorice plant grows wild along the banks, and is exported from Busra. The tree jungle and brushwood, which existed 20 years ago along the banks, and from which the steamers obtained fuel, has now entirely disappeared, and nothing remains but occasional patches of low brushwood. Even this was being rooted up and carried into Baghdad for firewood. Wild pigs are numerous, and occasionally a lion is met; they wander from the Karun river, where they are still in considerable numbers. Old Dujaila Canal .—Fifteen miles by river below Kut-T-Amara, on the right bank, could be traced the line of the old Dujaila canal. It consists of two parallel ridges about 30 feet high and 300 yards apart, extending inland some 4 miles. The bed of the old canal is now entirely filled up by drifting sand.16 These ridges, rising out of a perfectly flat plain, would form a good posi tion for throwing up earthworks to bar the navigation of the river. New Dujai/a Canal .—Some t miles in a direct line W. S. W. below Kut, and 10 miles by the windings of the river, the Turks in 1886 constructed what is ^called the new Dujaila canal. It has been made with the entrance placed at a sharp bend of the stream, so that the full force of the current is directed down it, and in flood there is danger of the river being diverted and leaving the channel in an unnavigable condition for steamers. . Ih^ugh urgent representations made, its construction was stopped before this actually happened. A trench was dug ‘20 feet broad at the top and 9 feet at the base for about 2,200 yards, but was not connected with the river. 1 his trench was meant to connect the river with the old Dujaila canal, and its total length was to be 10,000 yards. The river is now prevented by not more than 20 feet of light soil from entering the trench, and this the current is gradually eating away; and it appears certain that, unless measures are taken to increase this barrier, the natural action of the river will soon connect them. 1 he same result may follow from accident during-the spring flood or from rab views of local interest; also while the trench remains open within a tew yards of the Tigris, the Turks can very quickly, should they think it expedient, cut the communication between Baghdad and Basra by renderino- the river unnavigable. ° nut-i-Amara- Kut-T-Amara (the fort of the Amara) is 285 miles from Busra by the windings of the river and 220 miles from Baghdad. It is 41 hours by steamer up stream from Basra, and is on the left bank, containing 1,200 bouses built of sandned bucks and mud, with a row of better built brick houses, belonc. ing to merchants along the river front. The barracks and residence of the , ludir, known as tne serai, are in a square brick building at the west end There is a telegraph office, connected by a short branch line (two wires) with the main line, which crosses a loop of the river some 6 miles to the eastward There ar. some 200 soldiers quartered here, used chiefly for overaw“ Pusht^uh' ab The' ’VlT T P ' 1Ia ” e T™’ the C0Untrj ' betwpen tMs “&lt;lthe Jrusht- 1 -A.uh.

A merchant in Mosul informed me that he did a large trade in sheep and cattle that started from the districts round Dizful and Shustar in the winter; and were driven along the left bank of the Tigris, grazing as they went, and finally sent through Mosul to Aleppo to Sakanderun. Immediately above Kut is a difficult piece of navigation in the low season full of sandbanks. Steamers stopping at Kut go alongside a steep bank, and there is no pier, which in the flood season makes landing difficult. The northern entrance of the El-Hai canal is just opposite Kut. The whole distance between Kut and Baghdad in the low season is the most difficult to navigate on account of the shoals. The river at Kut is 400 yards wide, and from here to Baghdad the banks are higher, and inundated land disappears. The Turks have of late years been making some efforts to settle and utilize this fertile country. Defensive posts have been established to protect the settled Arabs from Bedouin raiders. An increase in the population along the Tigris is also due to migration from Hillah and the districts on the Euphrates adjoining it, where the gradual wearing away of an embankment has allowed the river to leave its proper channel and destroy large tracts of country which used to he irrigated by it. These settlements on the Tigris are Maghesil, Jumisa, Azaziah, and Ctesiphon, standing in the order named above Knt, each having a small mud fort with a few zaptiyahs to protect them. They are all in a fairly thriv ing condition. Between them are enormous tracts of fertile country on either bank, treeless and uninhabited, except by a few wandering nomads. Baghdndia .—At 124 miles above Kut-T-Amara we entered a wide loop of the river in which are the ruins of a mud fort called Baghdadia. It stands on some low sandy mounds, rising 50 to 100 feet, which fill up the loop. These would in such a flat country form an excellent defensive position, easily strengthened by earthworks thrown up in the sand. The mounds are visible for a considerable distance, and the steamer takes nearly an hour to go round, keeping the fort in sight all the way. J umisa. On the right bank, near the north end of the Baghdadia loop, is Jumisa, one of the new Government settlements. The surrounding district has recently been bought upas the private property of the Sultan. This is a place of 800 houses of sun-dried bricks and mud, generally built inside enclosures of high mud walls, used as kraals to shelter and protect cattle. There are a few young date trees and gardens behind the village and a small mud fort at the north end of the place 100 yards square, with loop-holed walls 20 feet high, and circular flanking towers at the corners. One hundred men are usually quartered here. The principal faces of the fort look out on the desert, and the north face looks up the reach of the river. It is not intended to bar the passage of the river, but rather as a protection against the Arabs. Most of the villages we passed on the banks have mud enclosures, with loopholed walls or towers, into which the inhabitants can retire or place their cattle in case of Arab raids. VOL. i. D18 Ctesiphon. At 152 miles above Kut-'l-Amara a long bend of the river near Ctesiplmn is reached. The steamer takes three hours to get round it, while I walked across the narrowest part of the chord in an hour. The well known arch of Ctesiphon, the Tak-i-Kesra or “ Throne of Chros* roes, stands in the chord of the bend, overlooking the mounds and crumbled ruins of Seleucia on the right bank and Ctesiphon on the left. The arch, said to be the largest masonry one still in existence, is the last relic of the palace of the Sassanian kings. It is a good landmark visible three hours off. i here were two facades, supporting the arch, but the eastern one fell down in 18S6, and the bricks are being removed to Baghdad for building purposes. 1 he othei facade is considerably out of the perpendicular, being undermined from the base. Looking at the bare treeless plain extending in every direction one could scarcely imagine that here stood the capital of the Persian Empire. There is a large ziarat and place of pilgrimage, the Imam-i-Salami Pak, near the arch on the east side. d.here is no permanent settlement of Ctesiphon, except a few ruined huts, the lemams of a former attempt at colonization. Some tents were here, mostly refugees driven from the districts round Hillah, who will probably settle here. The loop of the river and a large portion of the surrounding distuct grew line crops of barley and wheat, the former just coming into earin April. &amp; The fields were irrigated by water-lifts called “ churds.” They are similar to the Indian well with sloping bullock lift, and were worked by ponies, these are numerous along the banks from here to Baghdad, and the prin cipal taxation of this district is levied on the number in use. The banks become much higher now, being from 10 to 12 feet high in the low season. ^ Seleucia Abr/'.—There is a small mud fort on the right bank standing on one of the mounds of the ruins of Seleucia, in which 50 zaptiyahs are quartered, there is a small gunpowder factory in the fort, saltpetre being plentiful in the vicinity. Opposite the fort is the widest reach of the river, about 1,000 yards. ’ Diala River. we ab r e ^u Ut ^- Amara and 19 miles ^y river below Baghdad we passed the mouth of the_ Diala river which enters on the left bank. the . of rivers the date plantations and the either Lnl m ^ h .

It is 190 miles by river from Kut-d-Amara and 505 from Busra. Our journey up stream in April took 70 hours, not including stoppages. The Tigris above Baghdad. The upper waters of the Tigris are divided into two branches—the eastern and western. The western branch, retaining the original name, has its source in lake Guldjik, 68 miles N.N.W. of Diarbekr. The watershed between the lake and the eastern branch of the Euphrates is only a slight ridge, 18 miles from Arghana Maden. ^ The general direction of the course of the stream is S.S.E. to Diarbekr, during which it receives numerous tributaries from the ranges to the east. At Diarbekr, the river has accumulated a considerable body of water, and is 150 to 200 yards wide in November; while in the flood season it uses 8 feet, and is about 4*00 yards wide. Below Diarbekr the river contains several islands, and runs in a wide bed through a fertile valley about 1 mile wide. Soon after passing through this level tract it becomes narrower and deeper, enclosed between steep banks, and near the Mardin Gate is only about 100 yards wide and is crossed by a fine bridge of ten arches. From Diarbekr the course is nearly due east, and it receives several large tributaries on the left bank from the ranges to the north. The principal of these is the Hazru-Su, which comes from the Siluan and Tirgil districts. The Chaklatis-Su, a large tributary from the direction of Miafarakin. The Batman-Su, sometimes called the eastern branch of the Tigris, rising in the mountains 30 miles south-west of Mush, and having a course nearly due south from there. Only a few tributaries enter from on the right bank. , Ea'tern Branch —The eastern branch is made up of numerous streams, the principal of which is the Bohtan-Su, which rises in the Arabi Dagh, S.W. of Bashkala, a lofty range which divides it from the Zab valley. Its course is nearly due west through Nurduz and Shattak and through the mountainous district to the south of lake Van to Sairdt, and on its way receives some laige tributaries from the direction of Meuks and the snowy ranges in the vicinity. A shoit distance below Sairdt it is joined by the Bitlis-Su, a large stream rising north of Bitlis, and on the right bank by numerous tributaries from the Khandosh Dagh and the Modikan district; the Bohtan-Su, after passing through a deep rocky valley, joins the Tigris near Til. The Tigris to Jazirah-ibn-Omar flows in a norrow bed, about 400 yards in width, bordered by steep rugged hills. The width of the actual channel in January is 200 yards wide, but it covers the whole bed in floods, when the rise is 5 to 6 feet. From Til to Jazirah the course is nearly south-east. On the right bank are only a few small tributaries, but on the left are several large streams, rising in the snow-covered ranges to the east. Ihe principal of these is the Rohsur-Su, rising in the Halakur Dagh, 30 miles N.N.E. of Shernakh and flowing into the Tigris throifgh a gorcre at the western end of the Derguleh valley. After passing Jazirah the river finally leaves its rocky course and emero-es into the plain, spreading over a broad gravelly bed. At Jazirah is a bridge-of-boats, and the width of the stream was 140 yards wide and 10 to 15 feet deep in July. The total width filled at the flood season n 220 is from 400 to 600 yards; it rises then 8 feet above its July level. The current is from 4 to 5 miles an hour. Below Jazirah to its junction with the Euphrates, the Tigris receives no tributaries of any size from the desert country on the right bank. Khabur River .—About 23 miles by river south-east of Jazirah, the Tigris receives the Khabur, a large tributary rising in the southern slope of the Aka- rak Dagh, a snowy range 20 miles west of Julamerk. It Hows through a very wild mountainous country in the Berwari district, and emerges from the mountains 25 miles east of Zakho. Below Zakho the Khabur ceases to be a mountain torrent, and is navigable in high water for rafts from there to the Tigris. Eight miles west of Zakho it receives on the right bank the Hazil, a large mountain stream coming from the Judi Dagh. Below its junction with the Khabur the Tigris is 150 to 200 yards wide flowing in a deep channel over a gravelly bed. The current about 3 miles an hour. There was a ferry at Eeishkhabur, but it has been removed by the Government. From Feishkhabur to Mosul the course is nearly south-east, the river making a wide bend round the Batma Dagh, a low desert ridge about 20 miles above Mosul. At Mosul a bridge-of-boats spans the deep channel, and a masonry bridge that portion of the bed which is covered in the flood season. In June the channel at Mosul at the bridge is 170 yards wide. The total width covered in flood was 650 yards. There is 10 to 15 feet of water at the bridge at Mosul, with a current from 4 to 5 miles an hour. Zih'-ul-Awaz Bund .—Below Mosul the river runs in a deep channel over a wide gravelly bed, with a current not more than 3 miles an hour in floods; and in summer scarcely 1 mile an hour. At about 28 miles by river, and 20 miles in a direct line S.S.E. of Mosul, is the celebrated masonry bund called the Zikr-ul-Awaz Bund. It is drawn across from bank to bank, and is about 18 inches high. The banks are the usual fl it sandy plains, and not more than 5 or 6 feet high at the lowest season, so that there would be no difficulty in making a canal to turn the obstacle or blowing up a passage in it with dynamite. Zikr-Imail Bund .—Seven miles lower down is the remains of another similar dam, now almost obliterated by the force of the current, called the Zikr Ismail. Numerous sulphurous and naptha springs at various points along the banks. I he sulphur baths of Hammam Ali are a few miles inland on the right bank near the bund. Great Zab River. About 12| miles below the Zikr-ul-Awaz bund, the Great Zab joins the Tigris on the left bank. This is one of the largest tributaries, and rises in the low hill} ranges of the frontier district of Albak, and flows south-south west through the Bash Kala plain. At Karmi iUs joined by a large branch, the Nihaila Gavvari, which rises in Nutcha, flows through the plain of Gavvar, and north-west along the foot of the lofty snow-covered ranges of Tura Bemarghil andTura Daouil. Below Karmi the Zab enters the group of snow-covered mountains inhabited by the Nestoiian Cluistians, flowing in a deep narrow valley, along a tortuous rocky course. The river here is a wild mountain torrent, rushing betweensteep gorges and over enormous rocky ledges, and quite unnavigable. Thirty miles south-west of Julamerk it receives on the right bank the Berdazawi from the south-eastern slope of the Arabi Dagh; the Khabur and Bohtan-Su, all rising in the same group of lofty mountains. Numerous small tributaries flow in from the districts of Ashitha, Baz, Tkoma, and Salabacca. South of Amadiyeh the Zab makes a sharp turn south-east, emerging into a, small valley near Latka, where it receives the Ghara stream from the Amadiyeh direction ; and farther on, the Ashkufa river, a large mountain stream rising in the south-west slopes of Tura Bermarghil. The general course south-east of Amadiyeh is through a very narrow valley with steep sides, in places only about 40 yards broad. It opens out in the Bila Keupri valley, but soon after reenters a series of impassable rocky gorges. On the left bank it is joined by the Rawanduz river, a large mountain stream formed of several others meeting near Rawanduz, and rising in the Kandil Dagh and Shaikh Iva Dagh on the Persian frontier. About 10 miles west of the junction it emerges from the Berdm gorge, and after that until it joins the Tigris is a broad stream over a wide gravelly bed, containing a large body of water. It is proverbial among caravans for its deep and treacherous nature and difficulty of crossing it. About 12 miles below Kandil it receives the Akra, a tributary from the north-west, and on the opposite bank the Bastorah Chai from the Heur district to the south-east. Below Kalak it receives a large tributary, the Ghazar-Su, from the Bahdinan district. From the Berdin gorge, the course of the Zab is nearly south-west, and it enters the Tigris by two branches—one dry in the low season. The Tigris below the confluence of the (Treat Zab .—About 12 miles below the confluence of the Great Zab and 32 below Mosul there is a ford, opposite the Ziarat, Sultan Abdullah. Camels can ford here in October. 'Hie river now is broad with a very gentle current, with low flat hanks, and the desert extends on either side as far as the eye can reach. The thick forest mentioned by Chesney has now entirely disappeared, and nothing remains but a few low oaks and acacia shrubs. Several hot springs and bitu minous fountains are on the right bank. Some large streams enter the river on the right bank in the rainy season, but are dry during the greater part of the year. At 38 miles below Mosul is Muishar, with some rapids. At 61 miles is a great confusion of islands and passages. Between 75 and 79 miles are several eddies and rapids. Some 30 miles below Kala Shergat and 80 below Mosul the river passes through the low Hamrin ridge, that rises about 150 feet above the plain. The navigation is difficult, the current being rapid in places, and rocks, scarcely seen above the water, have to be avoided. Lesser Zab River. On the left bank, 90 miles below Mosul, is a tributary called the Lesser Zab. It rises in the Lahijan district, in north-west Persia, on the eastern slopes of the Kandil Dagh, and flows at first S.S.E. in Persian soil, until in latitude 36° it makes a sharp bend nearly north-west, passing through the frontier ridges by a series of gorges, and flows into Turkish soil at the valley of Pishder. From there it flows through Marga plain, where on the right bank it receives a considerable affluent, the Khudran river, from the22 Balak district; and on the left bank the Karachoran^from the Kurkur Daodr and Azmir Dagh (Koute Vli). “ ^ W , F w m e M ^f i T/ PaSSeS th 1 V0U ^ h several narrow valleys, taking a course W.b W. to Altun Keupri, where it receives a tributary from the direction of Jvoi oancljak, and thence across the desert to the Tigris.

From Diarbekr to Mosul the descent can be made in 44 days in the flood season, the total distance of 270 miles being accomplished in 90 travelling hours—that is, at the rate of 3 miles an hour. From Jazirah to Mosul is 36 hours by raft in June, when the water is get ting low. There are no rapids or any obstruction, and navigation is easy, the river flowing in a deep channel over shingle and gravel banks, which do not alter their position as easily as the sand and mud banks lower down. From Mosul to Baghdad takes from 3 to 4 days in the flood season and 12 to 14 in the low season, when they are only able to navigate by day, and have to lie up for the night. The chief difficulties of this section are the passage of the bund of Zikr- ul-Awaz below Nimrudand the shallow rapids in passing through the Hamrin ridge. From Tikrit to Baghdad the navigation is easy. Bafts at present manage to slide over the bund, a drop of about 1 8 inches, with a good deal of twisting and breaking of the skins. The Euphrates steamer, belonging to Colonel Chesney's expedition, ascended as far as the bund, 20 miles from Mosul, but did not cross it. Messrs. Lyn ch say they could easily run their steamers to Mosul were the bund removed, and having reached Mosul, there is no difficulty in reaching Jazirah. The Turks talk about forming a company to navigate the Tigris as far as Mosul, and the Euphrates as far as Maskeneh ; but very little seems to come of it. About the 36th of October, sooner or later according to the season, the Rise and fall of the rains cause the first rise in the river, and the navigation r ’ ver - improves. In January the frost and snow in the mountains checks the rise; and the permanent rise does not begin till March, when the high floods commence. In the middle of July the low season commences, and lasts for four months. The current in the low season is very slight, and in flood the swiftest is about 4 miles an hour. Sudden freshets are occasionally met while the river is rising, coming down with great violence, but not continuing long. Below Baghdad the constant passage of the steamers has improved the navigation a good deal. In April the river rose 3 feet in a single night at Baghdad. As regards the tributaries of the Tigris, the Bohtan-Su, the principal Navigation of tributa- eastern branch, is not navigable at all. ries of the Tigris. The Khabur is navigable for large rafts from Zakho to its junction with the Tigris from November to about the 15th of June, a distance of some 25 miles. In the hills to the north of Zakho are coal mines, from which the lurks supplied the fuel for their Tigris steamers, and which was brought from Zakho to Baghdad by raft. This has now been discontinued through some mismanag^pent, as the mines are still perfectly workable. The Greater Zab would be navigable from the Berdin to its junction with the Tigris, a distance of about 60 miles. It is a deep sluggish river at this portion of its course, and probably, if explored, could be navigated by steamers. The Lesser Zab is navigated by timber rafts from the Marga plain to the Tigris ; but it is doubtful whether steamers could ascend it, except perhaps in the flood season. The Diala is navigated by the Tigris sailing craft as far as Bakuba, about24 50 miles above its junction with the Tigris ; and there is no doubt steamers could also ascend to this point. Above this the river is shallow, running over a wide gravelly bed, and unnavigable. The ShaU-el-Uai is a canal or branch of the river leaving the Tigris at Kut-T-Amara, and flowing south until it joins the Euphrates near Suk-es- Shyukh. It is navigable from February to June, and is used then by native craft to export the corn grown in the rich district through which it passes. These boats average 80 tons burthen, and draw 5 feet of water. At other seasons of the year it is unnavigable, and from July to November its bed is in many places dry. The Mosul, a large Turkish steamer, took troops up the Shatt-el-Hai in 1886-87 about half way to the Euphrates, but did not proceed further, not because of the shallowness of the water, but because of the narrowness of the river, in which it was impossible to turn the vessel. The only other means of inter-communication between the Euphrates and Tigris by water is the marsh which covers about 60 miles of the southern end of Mesopotamia between the rivers. The ancient canals connecting the two rivers, of which there were several, are now partially or entirely filled up with drifting sand. The large marshes on the left bank of the Tigris formed by the lower waters of the Kerkhah river are navigable in the flood season as far as Hawaizah; but the route is unsafe because of Arab raids, and seldom used. The Saklawiyeh or Isa canal, which joins the Euphrates and Tigris near Baghdad, is navigable in the flood season for steamers. Midhat Pasha’s steamer went through this canal and up the Euphrates as far as Maskeneh in 1873 .—{See “ Report on Voyage, Saklawiyeh to Maskeneh ”: Foreign Office, 1878.) The Euphrates is quite navigable in the flood season, but in low water the stream is much obstructed by rocks and the remains of masonry bunds, which would take some trouble to remove. Messrs. Lynch do not think this river navigable in its present state for their vessels, but that it would be feasible to improve it. The craft on the Tigris below Baghdad are sailing vessels of 30 tons burthen, drawing about 5 feet when fully loaded. In the low season they have to carry less. They have one large lateen sail and a clumsy rudder of great length with a high poop, and in adverse winds they pole themselves along the banks. They would be very useful in the construction of a boat bridge. In the low season, in the shallow reaches, they unload their cargo, haul the vessel over the obsrruction, and load up again. Were suitable emoankments made and the river prevented from wandering at will over the marshes at the flood season, the navigation would be greatly improved. Even one foot more depth would make a great difference, and the riverbed would be gradually raised, so that it could be used for irrigation. A huff ah or gooff a is the circular used on the middle Tigris, made of pome granate branches woven together with rope, and plastered on^he outside with bitumen. The construction is very simple, and they are of various sizes, hold ing as many as twenty men. Horses, sheep, and cattle are often crossed in them, or moved from place to place down stream, and all the country horses aie accustomed to enter them. One or two paddles are used to propel them along. Kuffahs are found principally on the river from Baghdad to Amara, and on the Diala at Bakuba. . ^ ra ^ ars k Arabs use a long narrow boat called a “ belum, ” propelled by a paddle and one long oar.v steam* low ) rim^ ’ tt 16 Tigris ji n ear ^ [ en by Wit, b passes, f water, It November i Shatt 4 Ht further, mt 3 narrowtg uphrates aal southern enj og the t« JJed up wil y the lowe i as far a dam used d Tigris jcji Euphrates a; 1 Masltml' 1 : ow water t! bunds, wit sent state fe touskrth have to easy great lei^i ug the baab, &gt;.

The population of Baghdad, in round numbers, may be taken as 100,000 of which nine-tenths are Musalmans of both the Sunni and Shia sects. There are 2,000 Jewish families and 800 families of Christians of various sects, as follows :—500 Papal Chaldean families, 200 families of Jacobite Chris tians, and 50 to 100 families of Armenians. The town is built on both banks of the river. The largest portion, containing the principal buildings, bazars, &amp;c., being on the left bank. The bazars are arched over with brick to keep off the sun, and each trade has a separate section set off for itself. The shops well supplied with all kinds of articles—Manchester cotton goods and English stores. The bazars and sights of Baghdad city have been frequently described. Messrs. Lynch Bros, and Messrs. Darby, Andrews &amp; Co. are the largest merchants of the place. Members of these firms travel to Mosul or Busi’a, but never into Kurdistan or Luristan. All their trade with Sulaimaniah and such places is done by native agents. There is a tramway to the Shrine of Kathimein on the left bank of the river, running about four miles along the bank. A plan of the town was made by Captain Jones in 1853, and since then the old fortifications have been thrown down. Some portions, however, still remain. At the south-west corner on the river bank, the Tabiyeh, Dabogiyeh, and the wall up to the Bab-i-Shekki still remains intact, and are used as a Zaptiyah Barrack. The Tabiyeh, A1 Joueh, A1 Zowiyh, and Makam-es-Shaikh have been completely removed, and the bricks even to the foundations carried away. The ditch still remains, and is dry for the most part, with a few stagnant pools. The covered way and glacis are a line of mounds of earth, giving a command of 10 to 15 feet over the level of the desert to their front. With a few alterations this could be made into an earth rampart and entrenchment. The Tabiyeh A1 Halweh is in a semi-ruined condition, but the mound near it gives a considerable command. The tower at the Bab-el-Telism still remains standing, the gateway is closed up, and converted into a magazine, on which is a small guard of Zapti- yahs. The Tabiyeh-el-Titeran is thrown down. The Bab-el-Wastani has its tower still remaining, and the road runs through the old gate, although the walls on either side have been entirely demolished. There is a customs post here. The Tabiyeh A1 Fetha and Tabiyeh A1 Chaoukhave been removed, and the rampart levelled. There is a small magazine 300 yards behind the Tabiyeh A1 Chaouk. The Tabiyeh-es-Sabunchiyeh is thrown down. The Bab-el-Mondhem and the citadel are still standing, but the walls are much out of repair, and are falling into decay. North of the citadel, on the river bank, is the Nejibiyeh Palace, a fine-looking house, the residence of the Wali. On the glacis are several brick fields, and the clay is suitable for making good bricks and tiles. The portion of the town on the right bank is mostly inhabited by settled Arabs and Shiahs. There are two telegraph lines from Baghdad to Fao. One, the original line, Tele ra h tw ° wires &gt; running to Hillah and Diwaniyeh on the egiap . Euphrates, and from Diwaniyeh a single wire through Samawa, Shaikh-ash-Shayukh to Korna. The newer line, a single wire, runs also to Korna, but follows the left bank of the Tigris, through Azaziah, VOL. i. E26 Kut-’l-Amara and Amara. From Korna they both run through Busra to Fao, where they join the Persian Gulf line. From Baghdad to Mosul the line follows the post road through Kifri, Kirkuk and Altun Keupri,and is a line of two wires on iron poles. From Mosul to Diarbekr is a line of two wires on wood poles following the bank of the Tigris to Jazirah-ibn-Omar, and across the Tor Abdin range to Diarbekr. From Diarbekr to Constantinople there are three wires on wooden poles. From Baghdad to Kermanshah and Tehran is the Persian line following the main trade route through Bakuba, Khanikin, Tak-i-Girra Pass and Karind. There are two wires on wood poles. The office in Baghdad occupies a tumble down building, and it is in a very bad state ; the instruments are badly kept, and of inferior workmanship. The bridge-of-boats consists of 27 pontoons, made of light wooden plank ing, thickly coated with bitumen on the outside. They Bndge-of- Boats. are jq £ ee £ ] 3roac j anc [ g5 feet long, with a 6 feet gun wale, to allow Kuffahs and small boats to pass underneath. The pontoons are secured to a strong iron chain passed across the river. In high floods, it has to be swung back; the approaches to the bridge on either bank are through very narrow intricate streets. The current at the bridge in April was about four miles an hour; the breadth of the stream being 320 yards, and in flood time 30 to 36 feet deep in the centre. The barracks for the regular troops are a little above the boat bridge on the left bank, and consist of a line of very substantial two-storied brick buildings, built on three sides of a square looking out over the river. Recruits were at work learning their drill with the Martini Peabody rifles. The men in the barrack rooms were packed close together, their beds touching; and were very crowded. Muhammad Ahsuf Pasha is the present Wali of Baghdad ; he is a modem Turk educated in Paris. All questions of government are now referred to Constantinople, and almost all the independent power of the old Walls is gone. The embankment at Hillah on the Euphrates has gradually been falling into disrepair; a French engineer now estimates the cost of repairing it at £500,000, if indeed it is practicable at all. The river seems now to be taking the Hindiyeh channel, and last year the channel opposite Hillah was almost dry, and water was looked for in wells. The Tigris annually floods the plain above Baghdad. Wheat, barley, wood, dates, are the staple produce of the Mesopotamian plain, and the soil is extraordinarily fertile. In spring, the so-called desert is covered with nutri tious natural grasses in endless variety, and at all seasons a few showers will turn its brown surface green. The river banks both of the Tigris and Euphrates present gi’eat facilities to cultivators, and between September and March crop after crop of wheat, barley, maize and beans are raised by means of irrigation along the banks of those and the other rivers. If the Government made banks to keep out the spring floods and constructed or reopened some of the ancient canals, the yield of cereals and the increase of trade and population would be enormous. The plain round Baghdad is by no means a sandy desert, but is all rich alluvial clay, requiring irrigation to convert it into splendid corn-producing country. A good deal of water lodges in the hollows in the rains, and crops grow without irrigation. From October to May the climate of Baghdad is cool and invigorating. Climate. ^ ie greatest heat is from July to the middle of August.'The principal houses have “ serdabs ” or underground cellars, where people retire in the day time in the hottest months. The nights are cool in the hot months, and the climate not nearly so debilitating as the Indian hot weather. In Appendix I will be found a weather report taken on the river steamer Khalifa from January to September 1886. An ample supply for working steamers by petroleum is available in the sur rounding districts, the chief sources of supply being Petroleum supply. wellg at Kifri and Kirkuk. Petroleum was burnt for a short time on board Lynch's steamers, but the Turks prevented the company obtaining it any longer. It was brought in skins from Mendali and Kirkuk to the river bank. At Hit on the Euphrates, and at various points on the banks of the Tigris between Mosul and Tikrit, are bitumen deposits. Messrs. Lynch's chief engineer states that for equal weights the heating power to be gained from petroleum is three times that of coal—also it would give a much larger stowage room for cargo. At present the steamers carry all the coal necessary for the voyage from Basra to Baghdad : although there is a stock kept at Amara and Kut-'l-Amara, it isr seldom used. This native petroleum was also introduced for lighting the city of Baghdad, but no trouble being taken to refine it, it had to give way to imported Russian and American oils. ♦ Routes from Baghdad. Route to KarmanshaJi .—The main route into West Persia lies through. Karind and the Tak-i-Girra pass [see Route HI). To Karmanshah is a dis tance of 216^ miles, and from there 103 miles to Hamadan and 290 on to Tihran, making the total distance Baghdad to Tihran to be 500 miles [see Routes in Persia, 197, 384).

Judging from the ruined bridges, serais, &amp;c., at various points, it was once used as a trade route. Route to Mosul .—The post route to Mosul lies to the east of the Tigris, and runs through Kifri, Altun Keupri and Arbil. (Total distance 298 miles*)28 The stages are— 1. Jadaida 2. Zedaida 3.

Another route to Mosul follows the right bank of the Tigris, and presents no difficulties, except that between Tikrit and Mosul there are no villages, and only Arab camps from which to obtain supplies. Raiding parties of the Shammar Arabs render this route unsafe. For description of this route, 'see Mosul. Route to Sulaimaniah .—The direct route follows the Mosul post road as far as Kifri, and from there over the Kara Daghby the Sagirma Pass to Sulaiman iah. For description of the portion from Kifri to Sulaimaniah, see Route VI. The total distance is 206 miles. The Sagirma Pass and parts of the road would require improving to be passable for artillery. From Kifri to Sulaimaniah this is scarcely ever used by travellers or caravans, owing to its passing through the country of the Hamavvand and Jaf Kurds, who are noted robbers. There is another route along which a military road has been partially made, which goes to Sulaimaniah through Kirkuk. This makes a detour to the north-west, and is less direct than the former, but is more frequented. Routes across the Desert .—The straightest route across the Syrian Desert for camel riders to reach the Mediterranean is that followed by the late Consular dromedary post.

The principal divisions of the Bedouin Arab tribes who wander about the country of the Lower Tigris and Euphrates may be classed as follows : Kab or Chub Arabs .—These tribes inhabit the southern portion of the Khuzistan plain extending along both banks of the Karun from Muhammerah and also along the Bamishir to the Persian Gulf. They are a large collection of tribes partly settled and partly nomadic. They extend from Wais on the Karun to Khalfabad on the Jarahi, eastward to the Hindiyan stream, and southward to the sea; so that the country held by the Shaikh of this tribe is of considerable importance; including the mouth of the river Karun, and the important port of Muhammerah. The Chab territory is tributary to Persia.30 Shaikh Mizal Khan of Muhammerah, a man of considerable influence, is the principal shaikh of the Chab Arabs. Muntifik Arabs .—These are by far the most powerful tribe of lower Me sopotamia. They inhabit the country enclosed between the lower Tigris and Euphrates, and on the rig-ht bank of the Euphrates south of Suk-ush-Shiukb as far as the desert east of Busra. A portion of them, the original Bedouin stock, are still nomad, but a large portion of them are Eallahin, and cultivate the fertile land along the Euphrates and Tigris near their junction. Suk-ush-Shiukh is their principal settle ment. These Fallahin are sometimes known as Marsh Arabs. Large numbers of villages of reed huts, with cultivated strips of land, have been banked out from the inundations and extend a long way above Kurna. In the Hawizah district are many of the Muntifik tribes, migrated from the right bank of the Tigris, between Amara and Korna, to escape the exac tions of their Shaikhs. When the Mulaof Hawizah is strong, they pay him tribute; when he is weak, thej^ decline to do so. The Muntifik contain some 20 subdivisions, subject to constant change, as regards numbers and strength. The Beni Sa^ad are a large division occupying the loop between the rivers near Kurna. Some divisions of the Muntifik are also to be found to the north west of Baghdad. Albu Muhammad .—These Arabs live along the left bank of the Tigris from Amara to Kurna. They live in reed huts, and cultivate what land they can reclaim from the great marshes. They are occasionally to be found in the Muntifik country on the right bank. Uubia .—These inhabit the districts on the right bank of the Tigris south of Kut-h-Amara and Ali Gherbi. They are also known as the Rubbah. They are now cultivators or Eallahin for the most part, but at one time occupied the whole of the present Muntifik country. The Amara are a large subtribe of the Rubia. Bani Lam .—Along the left bank of the Tigris, between it and the lower slopes of the Pusht-i-Kuh range, are the Bani Lam Arabs. They occasionally roam as far north as Mandali and the junction of the Diala and Tigris ; but remain round Bedrai and Torbatiyeh, and extend as far south as the Tib and Kerkhah rivers. They are a turbulent lot, always at feud with the Lur tribes over the Persian frontier. Zobuid. On the right bank of the Tigris, occupying the intervening country between it and the Euphrates to the south-west of Baghdad, are the Zobaid Arabs. Shamar Toga .—To the north-east and east of Baghdad are the Shamar Toga, the Battah and several other small Fallahin tribes. Shamar. Along the right bank of the Tigris, between Baghdad and Jazirah, extending over the large extent of country known as A1 Jazirah, are the Shamar Arabs, a very large tribe with many subdivisions. They are an offshoot of the great Najd tribe, who are distinguished as Jabal Shamar. Routes in Luristan. . In an y route which leads from the Mesopotamian plains into Persia, the chief difficulty lies in the ascent of the great plateau, which extends all over Central Persia, and varies in level from 4,000 to 5,000 feet.In Azerbaijan and North-West Persia this plateau ascends to the westward till it merges in the still higher mass of rolling hills round Lake Van. In Ardelan the plateau is bounded on the west by the several lofty ranges of Turkish Kurdistan. In Luristan the plateau falls away towards the Tigris plain in a succes sion of parallel ranges, known generally as the Pusht-i-Kuh. Overlooking Khuzistan the plains of Shustar and the Karun river are the Bakhtiari Mountains, forming the edge of the plateau in that direction, and in Farsistan and the Mekran coast the ridges forming the southern boundary of the plateau reach down to the sea coast. Luristan is roughly divided into two portions by the River Diz, the country to the north-west being known as Lur-i-Kuchuk, and that to the south-east as Lur-i-Buzurg. This river also separates the two great divisions of Lur tribes; the Faili who inhabit Lur-i-Kuchuk, and the Bakhtiari, Lur-i- Buzurg. Lur-i-Kuchuk is further divided in Pish Kuh and Pusht-i-Kuh. Pish Kuh includes the districts more immediately under the control of Burujird and Khorramabad, extending to Hulilan on the Kerkhah. Pusht-i-Kuh is the more mountainous country to the westward of Hulilan as far as the Tigris plain. The tribes of the Pusht-i-Kuh are under the direct control of Hassau Ghuli Khan, the chief of the Faili, and practically independent of the Persian Government. The district is far more inaccessible than the Pish Kuh, contains no large towns, and is less under the control of the central Government. Hassan Ghuli Khan still retains the title of Wali of Luristan. The Pish Kuh tribes are without a supreme chief of the various tribes, each having its own particular head, or “ Tushmal. ' 3 In the Pusht-i-Kuh and the more mountainous portion of the Pish Kuh, the authority of Hassan Ghuli Khan is supreme ; who is a powerful and vigorous ruler, independent in the impregnable position he has taken up among the mountains. In Pish Kuh the tribes are mostly sedentary, while in the Pusht-i-Kuh they are entirely nomad. Layard in 184-6 says several subdivisions left the Pusht-i-Kuh owing to acts of oppression of the 'Wali and settled in the plain country round Dizful. Similar acts of oppression on the part of Hassan Ghuli Khan have also driven large numbers to settle along the Tigris in Turkish territory; and consequently the district is now almost depopulated, and numerous divisions and tribes ^iven by Layard are non-existent, or nearly so. The people in Pusht-i-Kuh, where we came across them, were quiet and peaceable, and did not seem to deserve the bad name given them by Layard and Rawlinson. The Sagwand Lurs to the south-east have a bad reputation. Travellers should always procure letters to the principal chiefs. Besides the large encampment at Hassan Ghuli Khan’s place at Dehbala only one or two small camps were seen through the whole of the Pusht-i-Kuh during a four days’ journey. Luristan Mountains .—In describing the mountains of the Pusht-i-Kuh, the chief feature to be noticed is the parallel character of the ridges forming the main chain, which run in a general direction north-west and south-east. The ridges are steep, lofty masses of limestone, the strata being in some places vertical with huge cliffs and precipices, and steep impassable summits like a Spanish sierra. Between these ridges are enclosed numerous small plains and narrow valleys generally of the richest soil, well watered with numerous springs,32 and growing 1 splendid grass and fodder of all kinds in the spring time. The soil on the mountains, though stony, is fertile, and the slopes are thickly wooded with low oaks and shrubs of all kinds. Trees suffer from the most wanton destruction by the nomad tribes, and consequently the best are found in the most inaccessible places. Dwarf oak bearing gall nuts, pistachio, hawthorn and ilex are the common est trees. Another peculiar feature in these hills are the “ tangs ” by which the rivers and streams force their way through the mountain ranges. Streams frequently force their way directly at right angles through enormous masses and ridges of rock. These chasms or canons are not situated at the lowest or narrowest portion of the range, but most frequently divide it at its highest point and expose a perpendicular section of 1,000 feet and upwards. The width of the “tang” varies considerably, sometimes being exceedingly narrow and at other times a mile or more across. As often as not they are perfectly impassable, or only the merest footpath leads through them, and the only passable route leads up and down over the neighbouring ridge. The main ranges of the Pusht-i-Kuh commence to the south of Karind in the Bend-i-Nua (the ancient Zagros), a lofty conical peak 8,250 feet high. To the south-west of this is a long ridge, commencing near Kasr-i-Shirin and running south-east, called in succession the Sunbulah Kuh, the Kaladja Kuh and Yardalan Kuh, all the same range, and forming the backbone of the mountains. It is steep and impassable for the greater part of its length, and at its south-east extremity merges in the mountainous country of Pish Kuh at the head-waters of the Kashgan River. South of the Kaladja Kuh is another lofty range ending towards the north-west in Manisht Kuh (9,500'), and continued to the south-east in the Gatcha Kuh. This is covered with snow for the greater part of the year. North-west of Manisht Kuh are several smaller ranges getting lower until the plain of the Alwand, near Khanikin, is reached. Next to the Gatcha Kuh and parallel to it to the south-west is the Kebir Kuh, the highest range in the Pusht-i-Kuh, along the eastern slope of which flows the Kerkhah. The most westerly ridge overlooking the Tigris plain near Ali Gherbi and Amara is the Annoran Kuh, almost the same elevation as the Kebir Kuh. Extending the whole way along the western slope of the Pusht-i-Kuh from the Diala Valley to the Kerkhah near Hawaizah is a fringe of low hills of conglomerate and gypsum soil, which causes the water passing through to become bitter and brackish. The first ridge of hills bordering the desert is called by the Arabs Jabal Hamrin, and applies to any of the low ridges from Khanikin to Hawaizah. “ Hamrin ” is a shrub or grass on which they feed their camels, which grows abundantly on these hills, and they apply the name to any part of the outlying ridges in consequence. This makes the names in some maps very confusing. The routes into South-West Persia from the Tigris valley and Shustar are as follows: I*—The main route from Baghdad to Karmanshah through Khanikin, Kasr-i-Shirin and ascending to Karind by the Tak-i-Girra Pass. This route is well-known (see Route III). II.—From Baghdad to Karmanshah by Mendali Zarna and Harunabad (see Route I). This was an old trade route, but is now very little used owing to the insecurity of the country.33 ' tifoe. flu J are% °® the uoii es t are {omj 1 which 1 ?s - Stream! h enormou ated at livide it a i •0 feet aii itimes beia» often aj ids throiigt eighbouring Kan’nd in 8 , 2 o 0 feet isr-i-Shirin he Kaladja :bone oftha ength, and l Pish Knt h is another ,500'), and with snoi? lower until Gatcha Roll &gt;st range ii rkhah, The . and Anm Pusht-i-Rih binge of lot dng throfl g the desert ie low ridges a which tkj heyapplj* s makes the and Shastar rh Khanihi 11 !

This is a rough and difficult route, and not used as a trade route. IY.—Shustar to Hamadan by the Kerkbah Valley, the Jaidar Pass to Khorramabad and Burujird. Between the Kerkhah Valley and Khorramabad is the most difficult portion of this route. This is one of the natural commercial arteries from Khuzistan in Central Persia, hut is partially closed owing to the lawlessness and insecurity of the mountain districts. Route I is the easiest and best route geographically speaking for goods to reach West Persia from the Gulf, the Tigris steamers being used as far as Baghdad. Trade on thf 1 other hand passes through Turkish Custom Houses, and is always liable to be checked by imposts, arbitrary or otherwise, or restric tive quarantine regulations. By Route IY goods can reach Shustar by the Karun Navigation from Muhammerah, and pass exclusively through Persian territory. Kerkhah Hirer .—The Kerkhah is the principal river of Lur-i-Kuchuk and the Pusht-i-Kuh. It rises in three branches ; the first and most incon siderable has its commencement about £5 miles west of Hamadan. The second rises in three springs on Mount Elvand, 6 to 8 miles south of that place, and runs south-westward till it meets the former in the plain of Maran, about 10 mil«s south-west of Kangawar. The third, or south-east branch, called the Ab-i-Kulan, is the largest, and rises in the hills 15 miles north of Burujird, within a few miles of the springs of the river Dizful, and flows north-west through Daulutabad and the country east of Nihawand. The three united streams go by the name of the Gamasiah, which flows west to near Bisitun, where it receives the Ab-i-Dinawar from the mountains to the north of Sangarand Dinawar. From here it turns south-west, and a few miles from Harsin receives the Kara Su, which rises, one branch in the Guran mountains west of Karmanshah, and another in the Kamiran plain to the north-west, and flows through the valley 4 miles north of that town. Prom its junction with the Kara Su the Kerkhah flows nearly due south through a very rough mountainous country, passing through several “tangs,” to Hulilan. From there it makes a westerly bend flowing through the Tang-i- Bai into the lower end of the Chardawar valley. Here it receives a large tribu tary called the Ab-i-Chenara on the right bank. Its course from Bisitun is little known, as no road follows its bank and the country is very inaccessible. The Ab-i-Cbenara rises near Karind, flows south-east through the Karind plain (Ab-i-Karind) past Harunabad, and down a wide fertile valley into the Harassan plant, where it is called the Ab-i-Chenara (see Route II). In a course due south from Harassan it forces its way through the lofty ridges of the Vardalan Kuh by an enormous rift some miles long, called the Tang-i-Salim, emerges into the Chardowar valley, and from there turns south-east. In Chardowar it receives tributaries from Zangawan and from the head of the valley, and lower down joins the Kerkhah which breaks through the Vardalan Kange by a rift called the Tang-i-Bai. The Kerkhah receives numerous small tributaries on its right hank from the Kebir Kuh. It flows through the plains of Fort and Seimarrah to the Pul-i-Gamashan, below which it receives a large stream, the Kashgan, which drains the mountainous region towards Khorramabad ; with others, the Ab-i-Garni and Ab-i-Zal, also from the same mountains on the left hank. VOL. i. i F34 It- leaves the mountains 10 miles west of Dizful, arul is there a rnpid stream. It takes a southerly course rounding the end of the Pusht-i-Kuh, and passes through a rich plain into the extensive marshes round Hawizah. In some places it is only a few miles of the Diz river. Several Canals in old times used to connect the two streams. The principal outlet from the Hawizah marshes into the Shatt-T-Arah is 5 miles below Korna, there called the Swaib, and another at A mar called El Hud. the northern outlet into the Tigris. The Tib, a large river in spring time, rises on the west slopes of the KTbir Kuh, and flows into the Hawizah marshes. It issues from the mountains by a narrow and precipitous gorge, and runs through a belt of low hills of conglomerate, on which are several ruins which the Lurs Call Kalanta. The bed of the river is wide, and during summer and autumn is almost dry. It is confined on both sides by lofty cliffs. Kalanta is three days'journey N. ()0°W. of Dizful. During the early part of its course, the water is sweet, but immediately after quitting the mountains becomes brackish. This is the same with almost all the streams flowing westward from the Pushfc-i- K u b.—( Lai/a rd.) Leaving the low hills, it enters the plain of Dehluran, and forcing its way through a small range of sandstone hills, enters the plains. Its course is S. 30° K. until within 20 miles of the Tigris, when, turning suddenly, it loses itself in the marshes. Duwarij River .—To the east and north-east of the Tib is a perfect desert . South is another large river, the Duwarij, flowing into the marshes. It is formed of two streams, the Chickab (the most easterly) and the Telezi rising in the hills at the extremity of the Kebir Kuh, occupied by the Lur tribe of Sagwand. The two streams unite in the lower part of the small plain of Patak, situat ed about due north of Dizful. The main stream then forces its way through the sandstone hills, and after winding for a few miles in the plains, in which it is joined by a small stream called the Bogreb, loses itself in the marshes. The whole country between the Tigris and the bills from a line drawn some miles above Amara to the Kerkhah is one great marsh and uninhabit able.— [Lat/ard.) North of the Tib is the Gunjianchun 'River. It rises in the northern extremity of the Kebir Kuh, and after a very tortuous course through the mountains emerges through the last ridge by a rift called the Tang-i-Dakhursa. From there it flows through the plain of Bahnrawan, through the Tang-i- Gunjianchun, and debouches on the Tigris plain near Zorbatiyeh. A little above this it receives a large tributary on the left bank, called the Gawi, which also rises in the Kebir Kuh. The united stream flows in a wide gravelly bed past Bedrai and Jessan, much of the water bedng led away into canals. The river is almost dry in . 'immer. It loses itself in the marshes in summer and autumn, and water only reaches the Tigris in the flood season. The water is brackish from the Bahnrawan plain westward {see Route IT). North of the Gunjiarichun is the Gurigir River, which rises in the north west slopes of Manisht Kuh, flows through the mountains by a narrow tortuous course [see Route I) emerging near Mendali through the Tang-i-Sunmar. It turns south below Mendali, and finally loses itself in the Suwekjeh marshes north-west of Jessan. Much water is consumed by the irrigation of the large date gardens of Mendali. Below Mendali it receives the Nuffat, a salt stream which rises north-east of that place, and flows through the desert.In summer and autumn the Gungir is absorbed in the marshes and no water then reaches the Tigris. Between Hadrai and Mendaliare three small streams—the Ab-Kazat, Ab- Tu rsakh, and the Talk-Ab, all of them salt. They flow into the Suwekjeh marshes also. The following is a precis of Rawlinson's Route from Zohab to Shustar. It should be read in connection with Routes I and II, both of which cross it at right angles. lut Stage, 14th February 1836. —Left Sir-i-pul-i-Zohab {see Route III), and marched 10 miles to Deira in a general direction due south. The road winds round the foot of a range of hills called Danawish into a little valley watered by the Deira River, which joins the Alwand near Mula Yakub half way between Sir-i-pul and Kasr-i-Shirin. The road follows the right hank into Sahra Deira (the plain of Deira), a valley some 4 miles long and 2 broad 2*4 Stage, loth February. —The river was a rushing torrent at this season and im passable here; so we ascended the right bank to the head of the plain, and there crossed. From Deira we crossed the Sumbulah Kuh, a lofty abrupt range bounding (iilan plain to the north-east by a difficult pass called the Surkhah Mil (red pass). This is a remark able ridge exceeding in height all the other ranges, and exhibiting a line of naked and precipitous crags. The high road from Zohab to (Idan conducts over these hills by a more open pass called the Tang-i-Shishrah about a farsakh north of the Surkhah Mil, but even this was not practicable for artillery, consequently the ancient route must have rounded the Sumbulah Kuh to the north. On the summit of the Sumbulah Kuh is a tableland bounded on either side by a barrier of rocky precipices. Descending from this the road conducts for 10 miles in a south-east direction along the plain of Gilan to a ruined village of that name situated at the southern extremity of tlie plain. Much rice is cultivated here, and the Kalhur Kurds pass the winter here. In ancient times the route across Mount Zagros by Gilan does not appear to have been generally followed. The passes between Gilan and Harunabad {see Route I) are very difficult, and the intervening country very sparingly furnished with supplies, so that Alexander’s march would have certainly followed the high road by the gates of Zagros (Tak-i-Girra) rather than this difficult and barren track. 3rd Stage, 16th February. —Left Gilan and made a long march of 8 farsakhs to Zarna. The direct road from Gilan to the Luristan frontier passes over some high tableland called Chillah {see Kaladja Kuh, Route I), but this line was reported blocked with snow, so the more circuitous route by Zarna and I wan was taken. This road led through a narrow valley between the mountains called Miandar, which we followed for 20 miles into the plain of Iwan. This glen was thickly wooded with “ balud,” or dwarf oak, and the trees here were of a larger size than any others seen in Persia. Herbage was rich and plentiful, this being a favourite winter residence for the Kalhur Iliats. The direction of the road through the valley was south. On emerging into the plain, the road struck across a barren track for 10 miles in a direction S. 20° E. towards Zarna. Iwan is distant 6 farsakhs S. 10° W. of Zarna at the extreme point of the plain, the intervening country being rich and fertile, well watered and cultivated. The route now being described was a great line of communication in ancient times. It is mentioned as the line of march of Alexander from Susa (Shustar) to Ecbatana (Hamadan), the reason for this circuitous route being that chariots and heavy carriages were unable to take the direct line to Kermanshah up the Kerkhah valley or to K horramabad along the course of the Kashgan. although such routes might be now feasible for modern artillery. Thus there would have been no alternative but to take them up to the plain of Karind by the Tak-i-Girra Pass. 4th Stage, 17th February. —A long march of 11 farsakhs from Zarna to Chardowar. We crossed a range upon which the snow lay one foot deep intervening between the plains of Iwan and Asmanabad going in a direction due east, and on the descent rejoined the high road from Gilan, whicli had traversed the elevated tableland of Chillah, in a direction south-east from that place. The Asmanabad plain is 10 miles long and 4 broad. From it to Chardowar are two roads—the one following the course of a petty stream which waters both these plains ; the other through a richly wooded glade in the hills : the former, the high road, is the nearest and best. The plains of Asmanahad and Chardowar form the frontier districts of Kurdistan and Luristan. Chardowar was reached at dusk ; and the territory of the Pusht-i-Kuh was here entered. Chardowar is a plain 12 miles long and 5 wide. 5ih Stage, 19th February. — Marched 4 farsakhs to Zangawan. The road led for 12 miles down the plain of Chardowar through an open and wellcultivated country to the Charmin Kuh.36 At the foot of the hills we crossed the stream which waters the plains of Asmatmbad and Chardowar, and at a short distance to our left we saw it unite with a deep and rapid river which here debouches from Zagros by a tremendous gorge called the Tang-i-Baba Giriya. This was the river of Karind, which flows from that place to the plain of Harunabad, and there, entering among the mountains, receives several small streams, until swollen to a river of seme size, it bursts in a succession of terrific cataracts through the Vardalan Range, and emerges into the low country at the foot of the range. The ascent of the Charmin Kuh was most abrupt, at the summit was some extent of tableland, and the descent on the other side into the plain of Zangawan was eqnally precipitous. A short distance to the right was an easier route crossing into the Karazan plain, and following a small stream to Zangawan. At Zangawan a small stream forces its way through a chasm in he Charmin Kuh, which falls into the river already described, here called the Ab-i-Sirwan (Ab-i-Chenara). 6th Slaqe, 20th February. —Rode a considerable distance to the right of the route which the party took towards the ruins of Sirwan, situated near a plain of limited extent shut in by low hills. A narrow valley runs out west from Sirwan plain piercing the Kalarag Kuh, an outlier of the great chain of Milagawan. Encamped 4 farsakhs from Sirwan on the banks of the broad deep stream of the Ab-i-Sirwan at the head of the Rudbar District which extends along the river valley, a distance of 6 farsakhs to the point of its confluence wuth the Kerkhah. Staqe, 21st February —Prom Rudbar w r e marched 22 miles to the Sahrai Lort. The road, risintr from the bed of the Sirwan, traversed a range of hills thickly wooded, which divided the plain of Sirwan from that of Badrai. We passed two valleys, Badrai and Kakagawan, divided by a narrow range, each watered by a petty stream flowing into the Sirwan, descending from the oak-wooded hills. Another little chain is crossed beyond the stream of Kakagawan, and the road from thence descends into the plain of Lort. This country, between Sirwan and Lort, is the most difficult of transit in the entire line between Zagros and Khuzistan, and still is perfectly practicable for wheeled carriages. 8th Stage, 22nd February. —Moved 20 miles in a S.E. i S. direction along the Sahrai Lort, gradually descending to Seimarrah on the banks of the Kerkhah. The plain of Seimarrah stretches north-west and south-east about 40 miles, and varying from 5 to 10 miles in breadth between the Kebir Kub and the Kerkhah. 9th Stage, 23rd February .— Marched 3£ farsakhs to the Pul-i-Gamashan. The river here is much contracted, and a single arch is thrown across the bed of the stream, about 80 feet in width. An arch of almost equal span is necessary to connect this on the right bank; on the other side are a long line of smaller arches making a total length of 105 paces. 10th Stage, 24ih February. — Marched 4 farsakhs to Jaidar; the direct road to Dizful from the bridge follows the Kerkhah to Ab-i-Garm, 0 farsakhs distant. From Jaidar to Shustar and Diz ful, the remainder of this route is already known. In all schemes for constructing - an Indo-European railway which still shall T start from the Mediterranean shore and o-o to Quetta, Railway construction. a-a* • .i &lt;• iV , • J one rhmeuity is the ascent from the Mesopotamian plain near Baghdad to the Persian plateau near Karmanshah. Some poin^ near the Tak-i-Girra Pass following - the line of the present trade route is generally assumed to be the point where the ascent will be made. Taking first the pass itself, the gradient for a cart road at the lower part is very steep, and would be almost impracticable for a railway. There is sadden drop of 1,050 feet in 2^ miles at the lower part, and a total difference of 2,250 feet in 14 miles from Sar Mil to Pai Tak. On the north lies the great mountain range of the Kuh-i-Delahu, and to the south the Nua Kuh and high rocky spurs jutting from it, so that it is impossible, except at very great expense, to get a workable gradient up the pass itself or turn its flanks. The general direction of the mountain ranges here is north-west and south east, so that to find an easy gradient it must run in the same direction in the valleys between the ridges. There is a line. I would suggest meeting this requirement and giving a good ascending gradient. The railway is supposed to come through Mosul, Erbil, Kir Kuk, Kifri, Kasr-i-Shirin, Harunabad, Karmanshah, and soon there being a branch line from Kifri or Kasr-i-Shirin to Baghdad. Between Kasr-i- Shirin and Ilarunabad is the section on which the ascent would have to be made.From Kasr-i-Sliirin (1,41 O') the ascent would run along the bank of the Alwand, pass Sir-i-Pul on the left, and go south-east up the Kalashakin plain to Kifraour valley. From Kifraour the bed of a large stream would be followed into Tirao valley (5,385'). A beaten track, used by nomads in their annual migrations, follows this stream {see Route I). North-east of Tirao is a rounded ridge called the Chalabakka Kuh (5,780 ), over which it would be easy to carry a railway into the Harunabad plain. From Kasr-i-Shirin to the summit ol the Chalabakka is 4,370 feet in about 55 miles j this might be reduced con siderably by a short tunnel at the summit of the ridge. From the Chalabakka Kuh to Harunabad is a descent of 900 feet in about 1 5 miles. r lhis route should certainly be further explored, as, whether useful for rail way construction or not, it is an additional line of communication to the Tak-i- Girra Pass.

It is two stages of nine hours each from Sifri to Mendali, and this route could only be used in spring when grass and rain water are plentiful. There isno water in the summer, and the more northern route by Bahriz and Belad Ruz is then taken. We left Baghdad at 8-30 a.m. by the Bab-l-Wastani, and struck across the plain following the line of the telegraph poles. Numerous caravans, some of camels from the Mosul direction, and others of mules, donkeys, and strings of pilgrims from Persia. The road is a well38 defined clay track, with nothing to break the flat landscape except the lines of some old canals. We passed several irrigated crops of barley and wheat, the water being brought in small surface canals from the digris or the Diala. Khanbir .—At 10 miles the ruined serai of Khan Bir was passed and a few clusters of Arab encampments seen. Khan Beni Said .—At 3 p.m. (17 miles) we halted at the Khan in the small village of Beni Said. Weather today cloudy and overcast, with a few passing showers, but pleasant for marching. The temperature at 3 p.m. was 09°, and at starting 65° with a fresh north-west wind. A heavy hailstorm last night had killed the locusts in immense numbers. Mushirea—Six miles to the west are a few date groves and the village of Mushirea on the Mouradiyeh canal from the Diala. There was plenty of short grass on the plain now, on which large herds of cattle and sheep were grazing. Round the Khan are a few enclosed gardens with some young date trees. Water-supply is good at this time of year ; wells and a large pond near the khan. In summer it is brackish. The canal and irrigation system have much improved of late years, and more land has been taken into cultivation. 21st April.—General direction, E.N.E. Left Khan Beni Said at 7 a.m., and kept along the main track by the telegraph poles ; along a road which winds in a very needless manner. The soil is alluvial clay, and becomes very muddy in rainy weather; we crossed the line of several old canals coming from the Bakuba direction. At 6 miles left the main route and struck in a direction 32° across the plain towards a clump of date trees which represented Bahriz in the distance. Mirage made it appear hung up in the sky. Great numbers of locusts were seen, and crops were being cut green to save them. At 10 miles we came on a bend of the Diala River, and soon after crossed in a ferry boat which took the whole party and six animals over in 12 minutes. The river runs in banks 25' to £0' high and was now in a thick muddy flood. The river is navigable for large native craft to Bakuba. Bahriz.—O n the opposite bank we reached Bahriz and put up in a khan. Along the left bank as far as Bakuba are date groves, fruit gardens, and cultivation watered by theNahr Khurasan canal, which leaves toe Diala near Shahraban. It flows through here and south as far as the shriue of Abu Khumis, 6 miles off, where it loses itself in the desert. The date gardens reach this far, but below are only a few irrigated fields. Ground is allowed to lie fallow for two years before being sown again. A great variety of fruit was seen in the gardens, dates, pears, figs, almonds, pomegranates, grapes, plums, and melons of various sorts, and of vegetables, beans, bania, badijan, and onions. The soil is very rich, but there is no regular control over the canal water, and much runs waste. The weather was pleasant with occasional showers; temperature 55° at starting and 70° at noon. The fruit and date gardens are surrounded by mud walls 8 to 10 feet high loopholed in places to keep off marauders. There is a small bazar here, and supplies are abundant. 22nd April.—General direction, E. Left at 6-15 a.m. The road lies over a flat alluvial plain, and for the first five miles crossed numbers ofshallow irrigation cuts, muddy but easy g’oing: the larger canals are narrow and deep ; impassable for l)aggage animals. At 9 miles from Bahriz entered a series of low mounds strewn with broken bricks and pieces of glazed blue and green pottery, among which we could trace the lines of several ancient canals. These mounds are called Shahr Habib, and extend for d miles along the road, and mark the site of some extensive city. The soil is a rich alluvial clay, and the reopening of these canals would restore fertility to this district. The road is well defined but not much used, and we saw nobody all day except two small Arab encampments with their flocks. At this time of year* abundance of rain water is to be found in the hollows between the mounds. At 15 miles a large marsh about 1 mile square was passed, called Shahr Habib, with drinkable water and good grazing round the edges. The grass, except, in the hollows, was getting burnt up nowj In summer water has to be carried in skins on this route. Bahul B nz .—At 23 miles wheat and barley crops again appeared, and we crossed numerous small canals, offshoots from a large one at Balad Buz. We halted in the gardens of the place at 2-15 p.m. The heat of the sun was beginning to make itself felt at midday, hut the weather otherwise was pleasant, with cool north-west breezes. Temperature 6 1° at starting and 78° at 2 p.m. Flies and mosquitoes very troublesome in the date gardens. The grass is very line; red and white clover, yellow trefoils, rve grass and other English varieties were noticed. The mules carried no barley and were fed entirely on grass as is the usual custom at this time of year. A large canal called the Nahr Balad Buz comes through here from the Diala near Shahruban, and is crossed by a small brick bridge in the village; There is a strong flaw of muddy water in it now. The date and fruit gardens are enclosed by high mud walls ; a few fields of cotton are also grown. There are 10 zaptivahs posted here, and it scorns a peaceable neighbour hood. The inhabitants are settled Arabs. The town is very dirty with green stagnant pools among the gardens, and it is not surprising that, it is very unhealthy, and that the plague broke out here in 1884. A Greek proprietor, M. baie, has a nice house here and farms the neighbouring district. The Balad Buz canal runs south for some 8 miles and then loses itself in the desert ; ’there is no system of directing the irrigation, and the water forms large reedy marshes extending for a considerable way to the north-east, and great quantities of water go waste. “ Houbara/’ snipe, quail and partridge were to be found here. Supplies here were abundant from a small bazar. The village is sur rounded by a high mud wall, and the road enters and leaves it through a gateway with loopholed wall on either side. A track leads north along the west bank of the canal to Shahraban which can be reached in eight hours. Now a large marsh has to he waded through, and probably floods from the canal have blocked the road altogether. 23rd April.—General direction, E. Left Bahriz at 5 a.M. The Pusht- i-Kuh hills ire now plainly visible in front. The Jabal Daimuri, a conical prominent peak, forms a good landmark for steering towards Mendali. For the first two miles our path led through irrigated crops, and then suddenly entered on an overflow from the canal and we had to wade for two miles through a muddy marsh 18' to 2' deep; the track was easily visible through the reeds; hut the baggage got wet owing to the mules stumbling in some deep cuts.40 By making a detom* of some eight miles to the south this swamp might he partially avoided. This is the regular caravan route, and the path is dry, or nearly so, in summer. From Ruz to Mendali the bearing across the desert is almost due east. There was good grass on the plain for the first two miles after leaving the marsh, but it got more burnt up and disappeared as we went on : earlier in the spring there was plenty. Mendali was visible five hours before we arrived as a mirage. At 21 miles we forded the Nuffut River, a stream of brackish water which flows east of Mendali and joins the Gunjir to the south. It rises between the Jabal Luti Baghcha and Jabal Daimuri. The banks were lined with sedges, and the sh*eam flowed in a narrow bed with steep banks 20 feet high. We met a caravan of 30 camels with dates from Mendali on their way to Baghdad. From the ford we crossed a bare plain covered with saline incrustation, through which several small brackish streams flowed towards the Gunjir. lor the last two miles before reaching Mendali some wheat crops and grass were passed, and at 2-45 we reached the date gardens which surround the town. Mendali.— This is a place of 1.500 houses built of mud and sun-dried bricks, in the middle of extensive date and fruit gardens, which form an oblong round it some 3 miles long and broad ; the houses are scattered on some low mounds in the centre. The gardens are watered by numerous canals from the Gunjir River, which emerges from a gap in the hills some 5 miles to the north-east. Oranges, pomegranates, lemons, almonds, figs, and dates are the chief fruits. Ihe only trade of the place is in dates and dried fruits with Baghdad. The dates are said to be especially good here. Saddles and horse furniture, numdahs, and felt coats were made in the bazar. . d ; * te gardens are enclosed by a mud wall round the outer edge, some 20 feet high with loopholed towers at intervals ; each garden also is partitioned off with high walls. The district is a quiet one, as the Arabs do not raid here now, and the Kurds from over the border only at rare intervals. There is a Persian Consul here : he told us the route we intended to take was absolutely impracticable without an escort of 100 men ! There is a kaimmakam and a few zaptiyahs quartered. The• inhabitants are a mixture of Kurds, Persians, Arabs and Turks; principally the first named. Most of the inhabitants are Sunni Musalmans, but there is one mahaila of 200 houses exclusively Shiah. ABearing 185°, and 4| miles distant is Kazania, a village of 500 houses on the bank of the Gunjir surrounded by a large patch of date gardens, the inhabitants of which are ail Shiahs. &amp; . Ghaib. Bearing 250°, and 5 miles distant is Ghaib, a village of 300 houses in a smaller patch of date trees. Both these plantations are surrounded by mud walls. Good grass grew on the plain to the south, and a few flocks of sneep were seen. The climate in summer is very unhealthy, and stagnant pools in the gardens and general want of sanitation must make it more so. It was severely visited by the plague in 1884. The sun was powerful at noon, temperature 80°, with a cool north-west wind, whieli made marchmg pleasant. On the 24th it rained heavily in the after-Routes from Mend all .—From Mendali to Kbanikin is two stages of nine hours each, the intermediate stage being Kala Nuft, a small frontier post. Water is all brackish on the way. To Bedrai is a caravan route of two stages of eight hours each, Ab-i-Tursak being the intermediate one. No supplies available : water also brackish. Some petroleum wells exist in the hills about 12 miles to the south-east Petroleum a k ^ le a P rom i uen t peak called Jabal Gueb- rian. A few years ago petroleum from here was taken to Baghdad in skins on camels, but as no attempt was made to refine it for lighting purposes, it has been superseded by the imported article from America or Baku. 25th April.—General direction, N.E. Left Mendali and threaded along a narrow track through the gardens for about a mile, emerging on an open grassy plain crossed by several irrigation cuts, after which we headed towards the line of hills to the N.E. After 44 miles we reached the Tang-i-Sunmar, the gap in the low hills through which the Gunjir River issues. It flows in a gravelly bed 400 to 500 yards wide in several straggling channels. The outer line of the hills runs 332° and 145°. Balad Ruz from here bears 258°. Persian Frontier .—Passed the Persian frontier at the entrance of the Tang-i-Sunmar ; marked by a heap of loose stones by the roadside. A short way beyond forded the river, here a rapid stream 2 feet deep, and then followed the right side of the river valley, 11 miles wide, bordered by low bare hills, which increase in height as we ascend. At Ilf miles pass a tumulus and small shrine on the opposite bank called Imam-i-Sunmar (1,000'). The riverbed is here i mile wide, and strewn with branches and debris brought down by the spring floods. People from Mendali were gathering this for firewood. Soil improves as we go on, and more grass is seen. Kala Dubruleh .—At 17if miles pass Kala Dubruleh (1,270'), the ruins of a fort built on a spur to defend the passage of the valley, beyond which we entered the Vargatch valley | mile wide, having a steep rugged range of the same name immediately to the south-east. A salt stream flows in here on the left bank. Above this point the river water is quite sweet. Pul-i-burrufsha .—At 21j miles pass Pul-i-Surrufsha, the ruins of a small bridge. The river bed is now 60 yards wide and is bordered by low cliffs. The old bridges, ruined forts, &amp;c., passed on this route show it was once an important road. Forded the river again above the bridge 2' 6 V deep with a rapid stream. There is plenty of rich grass, mostly clover, on the hill slopes and in the valley. A few stray patches of Indian corn were passed just sprout ing which the nomads sow in the early spring and then leave to take care of themselves until they arrive in the summer. r i he valley has now narrowed to 300 to 400 yards wide and the path is easy going along the river bank. Muarenna Camp Ground.—At 25£ miles ford to left bank again and halt m an open grassy basin among the hills called Muarenna Camp (1,615'). Immediately to the north-west rises the Jabal Daimuri, a long narrow ridge topped by a cliff 300 to 500 feet high. This forms a good landmark, seen across the desert from Balad Ruz. No one was met at this stage and the country is quite deserted ; only the remains of some of last year's camps were noticed. Good clover and grass grew on the slopes now.42 Weather today cloudy, with a fresh north-west breeze, and towards evening a heavy thunderstorm. Temperature 68° at noon. There is room for a large camp of troops among the low hills bordering the valley. 26th April —General direction, E.N.E. At 5 a.m. left camp. The track at first keeps along the left bank, which cuts its way down the centre of the valley in a deep narrow bed bordered by cliffs of rocky conglomerate 50' to 80' high. Cross several small ravines from the hills to the right. Another road follows the right bank, but is rougher than this, and the hills on that side come close to the water’s edge. Dizgarran Valley .—At 3 miles we passed round the end of a spur which juts out here and entered a long grassy valley 200 to 300 yards wide, bordered by rugged spurs from the high ranges on either side and known as Dizgarran valley (1,8 lb'). On either side of the river bed are flat terraces extending to the foot of the border hills. The track is an easy one along the left bank over a close sward of good grass dotted with brilliant flowers. To the south is the Tulwar-i-Khuda Range, a series of impassable rocky ridges, which run 163°, and parallel to one another. The culminating ridge of this range is a sharp razor-edge summit of limestone cliffs, and about 4,000' above sea level. No one was met during this stage, but the remains of several of last year’s encampments were seen, and the nomad Kalhur Kurds will be here in about a fortnight’s time. Pul-i-Dukhtar-i-Kurd .—At 3| miles we passed by the ruins of an old bridge, called the Pul-i-Dukhtar-i-Kurd, over the narrow riverbed. If this were repaired, we could cross here, and avoid some narrow bits higher up. A track leads north from here to Sir-i-Pul-i-Zohab. It is said to be rough and difficult, only used by the Kurd Iliats migrating. The hills on both sides of the valley get more rugged, and are topped with cliffs of grey limestone. Zarrat Villey .—At 6 miles we crossed a low undulation and emerged into the Zarrat valley (1,875'), 5 miles long and i to f miles wide, bordered by rounded hills covered with fine grass. Several small streams come in on either bank. I he river keeps on the north side of the valley and flows in a deep bed bordered by cliffs 60 to 80 feet high. A few shrubs and low fig trees make their appearance on the hillsides now for the first time, and the stream banks are lined with oleanders. The head of the valley is closed by a spur from the end of one of the ridges of the Tulwar-i-Khuda. A steep cliff abuts into the stream, and our track leads^ steeply over the spur rejoining the river valley on the other side. ffhe soil is soft clay and shale, and a cutting could easily be made to avoid the steep portion. At the bend of the river, on the opposite bank, is the head of a broad valley running 345° and down which a large stream flows. Tang-i-Sh u tar gar dan .—At 9§ miles, the head of the valley is closed ry a ridge through which the river forces its wav by a narrow winding gorge ^ ie 1 ang-i-Shutargardau. The road winds along the edge of the clrff overlooking the water. g‘ or g' e is I mile long and from 30 to 40 yards wide, bordered by chffs loO feet high. The remains of an old bridge exist here, and also of a custom house. I his shows that this was once a trade route fallen into disuse owing to the lawless and unsettled state of the country. From the gorge we pass the river valley diagonally and ford the stream in the centre of it. Fine glass grew in the valley and on hillsides all along this stage.43 ' 0Wat(1 8eveti t &gt; ^ Weti,, ^ntreofi Wratea^ 1 ! a s pw rtii 0 yards fli, in( d bom | tliefootoffe dose swari:: 'ulwar-i-Kb parallel to «k r-edge sun®; 1 of last jeat’ lere in akt ns of an I bed.

The Gunjir valley continues on a bearing of 128°, the ridges bordering it close in, and are covered with low shrubs and trees. The river rises in Iwan plain at the foot of Manisht Kuh, and reaches the Tam Sambak valley through a succession of narrow gorges known as • the Tang-i-Iwan. A footpath is said to lead to Iwan and Zarna up the valley, but no practicable path for mules. We halted and pitched our camp in the centre of the Chemisuruk valley alongside a small stream (2,225'). No Iliats had yet arrived^ and not a human being was seen anywhere. This valley slopes south, and is 8 miles long and &lt;3 to 4 broad, joined by several side valleys. The camp was 2,225' above sea level. Most of the soil is a fertile clay, with here and there large patches of grey shale in rounded hillocks. These grew no vegetation whatever but contained numerous small nodules, which lay scattered on the surface and proved to be iron pyrites. Gilan Kuh .— From 346° to 10° extends the Gilan Kuh, a steep rugged im passable ridge about 5,000' above sea level, which separates this plain from that of Gilan. It runs generally N.W. and S.E, A rough track used by nomads crosses through a rocky gorge and affords access to the Gilan valley', and from thence to Sir-i-Pul. To the east of the valley are several wooded ranges running parallel to the Gunjir in the direction of Zarna. The ridge immediately to the east of the valley is called the Bagh Kuh from the number of wild fig trees dotted about its slopes. The rock is a soft white limestone with horizontal strata, and the action of the weather has formed the hillsides into a series of a rocky terraces like stairs. To the west are several long valleys growing abundance of good grass. To the south-east of the Gilan Kuh is a continuation, called the Zarna Kuh, of about the same elevation. The ridges to the north-west seem to fall away and get more rounded and undulating, and the country seems easy in the direction of Khanikin. 27tli April—General direction, N.E. and S.E. Left camp, and gradually ascended towards the north-east corner of the plain, wbere we crossed the rido-e by the Tang-i-Kushk, is a gap \ mile wide at the junction of the Zarna Kuh and the Bagh Kuh ; bordered a series of scarped cliffs terraced one above the other. The top of the pass is 4,100', or 1,875' above Chemisuruk. The track is rough and stony, but could be improved in a short time into a good road, as the gradients are easy. The steepest portion is a stony clay slope at the summit of the col. From the top the road winds diagonally down the hill slope to the north west. It is a rough path among low trees and scattered boulders, and over looks a deep narrow valley to the right flowing towards the Gunjir. On reaching the foot of th6 slope, we had to pass a narrow rift in the hills also known as the Tang-i-Kushk (3,550'). The gorge is 300 yards long, and for a short distance is 30 yards wide borderd by steep cliffs. The road wunds between large boulders, strewn with loose stones, but with some clearing could be made into a good cart road. The bed of a dry torrent leads through the pass. At the northern mouth of the pass the track bifurcates, one running to Gilan valley to the north-west distant 12 miles or one short stage. Our track turns south-east up the Miandar valley 1 mile wide growing good grass, and dotted with fine trees like an English park. To the north . g 244 lies a sterp rugged ridge covered with scrub and a few trees. Gilan had a few houses until lately, but is now entirely in ruins, and the valley is used as a pasturage by Kalhur Kurds. Zarna Valley .—At 10-30 a.m., 20J miles (4,025'), after a long gradual ascent, we reached a slight rising ground, the watershed between the Gilan and Zarna valleys, and opened out a splendid view of. the Zarna and Iwan valleys, culminating in the distance in Manisht Kuh. The bearing down the centre of the valley to Manisht was 133°, and the top of it and some of the ridges of the Kebir Kuh beyond it were streaked with snow. To the north-east is a steep impracticable ridge composed entirely of sheets of rock, scored in all directions by deep rocky ravines. To the south-east are a succession of rugged parallel ridges extending to the Gunjir, all thickly wooded. Zarna. —The portion of the valley just below us is called Zarna, and that next Manisht Kuh is Iwan. Long grassy descent led towards Zarna, and we passed by the way ruins of foundations of old villages. After miles we came upon a small Kurdish encampment which had arrived here two days pre viously. These were the first people we had met since leaving Mendali. They were very hospitable, and received us in their tents bringing bowls of curdled milk or “yaurt,” the staple drink found in every Kurdish tent. But little flour or rice could be obtained, as their supplies are limited and have to be brought from more inhabited districts at Karind or Karmanshah. A sheep was killed before the tent door, and cheese and milk brought in any quantity. These Kurds wear a round felt cap with a band of coloured cotton wound round it, a large coat with very long sleeves, also of felt; the arms were not put through the sleeves but w r ere wrapped round the body in cold weather ; wide blue pantaloons and shoes of cotton rope completed their dress. The women dressed in gay colours—red and blue. They were a merry, lighthearted people. The valley of Zarna and Iwan is exceptionally fertile, and is well wooded, and would make a fine encampment in summer for troops: water is abundant from numerous springs and small streams. It varies from 3,500' to 8,800' above sea level. At present there is not a single inhabitant except two small clusters of tents, although later the nomads bring large herds of cattle and sheep. In the centre of the valley is the ruins of the old town of Zarna, and the remains of a modern village on an old tumulus, also in ruins. On the rounded ridge to the south-east of the valley is the tableland of Asmanabad, on a long wooded slope extending towards the summit of Manisht Kuh. The Kurds who come to these districts are Kalhurs, a large tribe partly settled and partly nomadic; the nomad portion pass the winter in the plains near Zohab and Kasr-i-Shirin. In winter the valley is deserted. Towards the end of October it commences to rain, the rainy weather Climate. lasting for about a month; when the snow sets in and remains on the ground from to 3 months, according to the severity of the season. The weather was no w very pleasant. Tempera ture 42° at o a.m. and 70° at midday. A few showers fell, the days were cloudy, but otherwise the climate was bracing. # The Gunjir River rises at some large springs near Zarna and the Manisht Kuh, and flows through the Tang-i-Iwan on the south-west side of the valley. A rough track leads up the mountain from Iwan side to join the road to Dehbala, at the summit of the Dalowa Pass [see Route II). * *Tlifise pastures belong to Reza Ghuli Khan, the Kalhur chief, who lives in Harunabad. The influence of Hussain Ghuli Khan, chief of the Faili Lurs, does not extend beyond Manisht Kuh. 28th. April —General direction, S. E. and E. Left camp at 5-15 A.M. and proceeded south-east down the plain. The border ridges are thickly covered with trees and brushwood. AtZarna is the richest soil of the valley, watered by a series of fine springs from which a stream issues, called the Chashm-i-Zarna (3,580'). From Zarna we turned north-east through the Gurma-i-Zarna Pass. The narrowest part is 30 to 40 yards wide with steep shelving sides topped with cliffs. By clearing the stones a good cart road could be made. From the mouth of the pass emerged into the small grassy valley of Bankur (SjOlS'), and turned east across it. To the south lies the wooded plateau of Asmanabad on which is the site of an ancient city of large size. We passed a stony wooded ridge by % rough track, crossed a broad neck, forming the watershed between some fine valleys stretching north-west and south east- And followed a path through a thick forest of fine oaks nowin first leaf. At 13j miles encamped in a small basin shut in by hills called Char- milia (4,590') close by a small cluster of Kurd tents. Kalaja Knh. —In the afternoon I climbed to the top of the Kalaja Kuh, a range lying east of the camp from which a fine view could be obtained. The hillside is composed of sheets of grey limestone rock cut up by deep ravines and almost bare of trees. The summit of the ridge is from 7,2-00' to 7,500'above sea level. Kaichal Knh .—The general direction of the Kalaja ridge is 134° to the south and 305 :&gt; towards the north, where it joins a lofty rounded summit called the Katchal Kuh. The peak of the Katchal Kuh is 7,500'. In a direction 134® runs a grassy valley 3 to 4 miles wide and about 25 miles long, after which the border hills close in. A road leads down this to Harun abad crossing the Kalaja Kuh some miles farther to the south-east. No villages were visible in this direction, only a few Kurdish tents. The pass is said to be more difficult than this. We met a caravan today which took this route. It is four stages to Karmanshah— 1. Gavvar (south-east end of the valley). 3. Mahidasht. 2. Harunabad. 4. Karmanshah. * This joins the main road at Harunabad. Gavvar is a very small village j few supplies are obtainable, and those from Kurdish nomads. Manisht Kuh. —Manisht Kuh bears 157° from here. The summit is flat- topped and about 9,500' above sea level. Beyond it lay the craggy ridge of the Gatcha Kuh. Both were thickly covered with snow. Sloping from Manisht Kuh towards us was the Asmanabad plateau wooded and crossed by several small ravines. To the south-east dividing I wan from Dehbala valley were some very steep ridges. The sharp ridge of the Tulwar-i-Khuda was visible on the horizon. Bounding the Bankur valley to the north was the Gumir Kuh rising to about 6,500', the north side of which was a slope of about 25° and thickly wooded.46 Chillav Valley .—Between the Gumir and the Kalaja Kuh is the Chillav valley up which a road from Gilan runs. The south-east slope of the Kalaja was a steep scarped slope looking impassable. The Chillav valley is about 20 miles long and 4 to 5 broad containing fine pasture ground. The centre of the valley bears 605° from here. 29th April—General direction, E. N. E. Left camp at 7-15 a.m. and commenced the ascent of the Kalaja Pass, a rough track winding among boulders and skirting some cragg}' ravines. By carrying the road to the left an easier gradient could be found and, if cleared of stones, could be made into a fair cartroad. X . At the fop of the ridge the hawthorn was in bud, while at the bottom it was in full leaf. At 9 a.m. the summit was reached (6,325'). The rounded summit of the ridge rose 1,000' still higher to the south-east (7,300'). From the summit—■ 247° was the bearing of Jabal Daimuri over Muarenna camp. 315° to the Kachal Kuh. Ercm 10° to 1 5° was a lofty range, the Avroman Dagh, and mountains near Sihna, both thickly covered with snow. From 40° to 60 ° was another snow-covered range, the Baluch Kuh and Parao Kuh north of Karmanshah. We began a rough winding descent down a steep slope thickly wooded with oaks and hawthorn. It was much steeper than the ascent, and at the foot (5,360') we emerged into the broad grassy valley of Gouar Gavvar. There are several springs along the foot of the ridge, and a small stream runs south-east down the centre of the valley towards the Ab-i-Chenara. One cluster of tents was the only sign of life in the whole valley. Gouar valley runs 130° for some 20 miles, and the ridges then close in. The village of Gouar lies in that direction at the head of the valley. A little stream flows south-east to join the Ab-i-Chenara at the Tang-i-Salim [see Route In a direction 305° the valley closed in at about 6 miles from here. A broad track used by nomads leads up towards Gilan. Kalalca. I wo miles up the valley was the ruins of a large brick serai called Kalaka which existed when this was a more frequented route. Several large tumuli on the stream bank point to this having been a popu lous distiict in ancient times. It might be so now except for the lawlessness of the tubes and want of any settled government. The northern face of the Kalaja Kuh for a mile on either side of the foot of the pass is an almost vertical sheet of rock. Gouar valley is 3 miles broad and contains a rich gravelly soil with 'ood grass at this season. . Crossing the valley at 8 i miles we entered the Tano--i~ Juimark (5,360'), a gap in the range 100 to 200 yards broad. There are the remains of an old masonry wall drawn across the pass, a defensive post at some former time. . -^ lrol:n the mouth of the pass the road bifurcates ; one a very rou°'h track going straight over the spurs of the Bend-i-Nua Range to Karind, and another which we took more to the eastward towards Harunabad. Two men toot were met here, who said they had left Harunabad five hours before.Crossed another small valley on leaving the Tang and ascended a low wooded ridge (5,715'). Tirao Valley .—From the summit a short steep series of zigzags led into the grassy valley of Tirao where three large Kurdish camps w'ere found, with whom we halted. A direct road to Harunabad runs down the Tirao valley crossing the Cha- labaca Ridge. The Kurds here talk of Harunabad as Hernawr. Tirao valley is 12 miles long and 4 broad (5,385'), the general direction being 309° up and 118° down the valley. All these valleys run in much the same direction, and are parallel to each other. A small stream flowing north-west runs along the north side of it. This joins in the upper waters of the Alwand in the Bishewa plain. 30th April—General direction, east and north-west. Left camp and commenced ascent of the Chalabaca ridge (5,780') on the north side of the valley, and crossed a broad plateau at the summit dotted with a few low trees. From there we commenced a gradual descent following the line of a small ravine. The soil is a rich loam, without cultivation or villages ; the ruins of some stone buildings were passed in the valley. Several lliats of nomad Kurds were passed with their flocks and herds making their way towards Karmanshah. They were Kalhurs moving up from their garmsir at Zohab. • Tang-i-Simaleo .—The ravine which we follow is narrow in places, but easy going ; at the lower end is a narrow rift called Tang-i-Simaleo, through which flowed the Ab-i-Karind. This was again met on Route II in the Harassan valley and there called the Ab-i-Chenara and is one of the teibutaries of the Kerkhah. Khorassabad .—Forded the river, and at 10 miles turned north through a small ravine and we found ourselves on the main road from Baghdad to Karmanshah near the small village of Khorassabad (4,800'). From here to Karmanshah is three stages through Harunabad ; and the road is well known to travellers. To tlarunabad it is 10 miles, and to Kar manshah 50 miles. We turned north-west in the direction of Karind. After 2 miles from Khorassabad we left the narrow gorge in which the road ran and emerged into the wide valley of Karind. Round Khorassabad were the first houses and corn fields seen since leaving Mendali six days previously. The country to Mendali is entirely depopulated, except by nomad tribes. With a settled government the country could be repopulated, and old trade routes reopened. The road through the Karind valley is stony, but fit for cai'ts. Culverts over the several little streams are badly needed, as the mud in this soft soil is deep and clinging. A few small villages were seen on the plain to the south, and ploughing ■was now going on. The road follows the line of the telegraph, consisting of one wire on wooden poles in a wretched state of repair. The country was quite bare of trees, a contrast to the wooded valleys through which we had lately passed. At 10 miles reached Karind (5,410'), where we halted.48 Route No. II.—From Karmanshah to Kut-’l-Amara via Dehbala and the Pusht-i-Kuh. 20th to 30th August. Stages. Hours marching 1 .

Left Hassan A glia’s house in Karmanshah (4,760 ). Drove as far as Dilkusha; his summer residence situated among orchards and gardens in the deep valley, which runs south of the town. We left the town by the north side, making a wide detour to avoid the narrow streets. The valley extends 5 miles south of the town, and is about a mile wide bordered by^ rounded hills. Down it flows a stream from a large sprino', which supplies the gardens, and eventually the town being led through the streets of the town by several small channels. Mulberry, walnut, apple, pear, quince, plums, apricots, figs, pomegranates, grapes and melons were the various fruits grown. The road led between high mud walls which separate each orchard. On passing the spring at the head of the valley, the road ascends gradually a low range, the Safed Kuh, through a succession of rounded hills (summit of ridge 5,865 ). The hillsides are withered up, but the soil is rich, and in spring grass is abundant. _ Some patches of maize and wheat stubble passed. The descent from the ridge is steeper than the ascent, and stony and rou«di in places. Hassan Agha sometimes drives by this road to Zeilan. Sod is a light clay. A loose shaley limestone rock crops up here and there. At the foot of the range entered the upper end of the Mahidasht plain. . ZeiL( \ n -—^ 15 miles halt at Zeilan, a village with a large orchard and vineyard on a stream, called the Murad Su, which flows down the centre of the plain, W.N.W. towards Mahidasht. On passing Mahidasht this stream makes a bend to the north and forms the head waters of the Kara Su At this season the villagers desert their houses, and live in booths of branches and ned leaves set up on the plain close by. Corn has just been harvested, and stacks were waiting to be threshed. The plain is 6 to 8 miles broad, and can be seen extending N.W towards Mahidasht for some 30 miles and S.E. for about 8 miles where the hills close in.49 lar a via 411 3'l n 3'33 - 3'3I 3'J4 m 3'45 1 3'55 j s house is r resicbfj ins south of 3 detour to i mile wilt urge spric®, trough tit megrauate, lard, ds gradualli (summit of cd in spring assed, IT* d rough is re and fa kt plain' irchard ail he centre of this stream ra Su. i* ranches at! rested, aol ad, and c® ,d SJ.^ The soil is very fertile, and grows good wheat crops. The plain is quite treeless, as is also the range south of Karmanshah. The Kuh-i-Lanawan, bounding the plain to the south-east, is covered with low trees and shrubs. Most of the firewood for Karmanshah is brought from it and the Vardalan Range further south. These ridges were probably well wooded once, but a process of reckless denudation has been going on for years, and consequently the steepest and most inaccessible portions of the ridges are the best wooded. Large herds of cattle and sheep were grazing on what they could pick up. Crops of maize, melons, and vegetables are grown in the irrigated land along the stream banks. Weather clear and bright. Temperature 55° at 4 a.m. and 87 ° at noon in the orchard. A considerable difference of temperature is noticeable in these districts, the nights being much cooler than the days. Marching was pleasant, except for the glare on the plain at midday. 21 st August — General direction S.S.W. Left at 4 a.m. Cross the Murad-Su and some deep irrigation cuts on either hunk, which had only foot bridges. Road is a broad track heading towards the rounded ridge, bounding the plain to the south. This is the Kuh-i-Lanawan, and 10 miles along it to the north-west is a high rounded summit known as the Khurkhur Kuh. Khurlchur Pass .—The Khurkhur pass, by which we ascend the ridge, is an eas y gradient, cut up in places by small ravines eaten into the soft shaley soil. Ibis is a well frequented route. Several mule and donkey caravans were met, carrying firewood or charcoal into the town from the Yardalan Kuh; and the finer kind of lime (getch) used for the decoration of Persian houses. Several springs in the hillside and a little water in the ravines. At 81 miles reach the head of the pass (8,50(b), and a small spring is passed. Kilandasht Valley .—Descend into head of the small valley of Kilandashfc, and pass a little village of that name hidden away in a rocky ravine, 4 mile to the north. It is said to be a nest of robbers. Descend sharply to a lower terrace of the valley near Angiruk (5,230'), a cluster of huts near a shallow pool with water bubbling up through the gravelly soil. The track is a series of narrow zigzags, descending for 330 feet over white limestone much cut up by the action of the weather. Several paths bifurcate from the Tang-i-Khurkhur, one going direct over a stony ridge to Harassan, a village passed later on. It is a shorter, but rougher, route than that we take. Tang-i-Shani .—The road follows a narrow cultivated valley until at 15 miles a defile in the ridge to the south is reached, called the Tang-i-Shani (4,900 ). The track is rough and narrow between shelving rocky sides, partly in a small stream bed between boulders and large stones. It is level, and the bad portions might easily be improved. There is a spring at the southern end of the defile, from which runs a large stream which turns two water-mills. Two miles after leaving the pass, Shani village can be seen to the east at the foot of a tumulus, with the ruins of a square mud fort. Shani Valley .—The road is now a broad level track, skirting the east side of the Shani valley 2 to 3 miles wide. Several villages were seen, and the district is a fertile one, producing wheat, barley, maize, hemp and various fruits in the orchards. This district is part of Hassan Agha’s property, and his vakil with us was sufficient to50 $ i ensure supplies' being readily brought. The people are Kalhur Kurds. Water supply is from several large springs at the foot of the ridges. Rock is a grey limestone with nearly vertical strata. The ridges gradually become more rocky and of a less rounded appearance than near Karmanshah. Pelangir .—At 24- miles halted in Pelangir (4-,725'), a village of 50 huts with a small orchard, at the end of a low stony spur running up 110 °. This is a good mule-breeding district. The headman of the village owned a drove of 40 fine mules. At the opposite side of the valley lies another village called Maidassar, at the termination of a long rocky ridge. To the west lies a fine valley, 4 to 5 miles broad, running up north-north-west for some 30 miles. It is bounded by steep rocky ridges, and joins the Pelangir valley, lower down. A large stream, the Ab-i-Karind from Harunabad, flows down it known here as the Ab-i-Chenara. Numerous herds of sheep and cattle were grazing on the withered grass on the hillsides. Weather sultry and oppressive, with strong westerly wind. Mornings cool. Temperature 55° at 4 a.m., and 98° at noon. 22 nd August.—On leaving Pelangir, the road crosses two low spurs from the stony range to the east, and at 6 miles enters the valley of Harassan (4,600'), in which is a large village of that name. Crops of Indian- corn, wheat, melons, and fruits in a large orchard surround the village, watered from a large spring close by. There is a square fort with mud walls in a bad state of repair in the village. This marks the limit of Hassan Agha’s pro perty, and also of the settled section of Kalhur Kurds. In the hilly region to the south-east are the Akhur Lurs. The distinction between Kurds and Lurs is not well marked. They are both a different type from the Kurd farther north and are much darker with more Jewish features. They wear the Persian dress, the Kula-i-numdah and long coat, and have no distinctive dress like the true Kurds. In religion they are nominally Shias but really have a religion much resembling the Ali Allahi sect or Kizilbashs. The tribes of Kurdistan proper are Sunnis. At 3-30 a.m., the temperature was 69°, and on reaching the top of a small spur an hour later, a sudden chill brought it down to 56°. After the Harassan valley, a low rounded ridge was crossed. The Ab-i- Chenara lies 1 mile to the west, coming from the direction of Karind and Harunabad, passing through a rich district in its course. It receives numerous small tributary streams, and the country is well watered. Ramazada Ziarat .—At 7 ^ miles the river passes through a fine gorge with steep perpendicular sides. On these cliffs is the Hamazada Ziarat, a group of three conical-shaped tombs—one on the crest and two in the valley—sur rounded by a thick grove of oaks. The branches of these trees are never cut or lopped; and consequently they were the only trees in the landscape. Th^ branches are hung with coloured rags and bits of clothing, which each travel ler on passing by hangs up. Vardalan Range .—These ridges form the commencement of the Vardalan Range, a series of high parallel ranges running north-west and south-east. The rock is hard grey limestone; the strata are well marked, and occasionally stand out perfectly vertical. Although stony, the soil is rich, with some fine trees, 30' to 50' high and 8 to 4 diameter, usually in the most inaccessible places. Most have been used for firewood. The principal trees are balud oaks, pistachio, hawthorn, and numerous shrubs and undergrowth.51 At this time of year the grass is withered, hut in spring is very rich and abundant [see Route I). Green maize, stalks and barley are used for fodder now. The passage of the Vardalan Range is difficult at any point, and near Chardowar, the southern slope, it is an almost perpendicular sheet of rock extending for a considerable distance. The ridges are very steep with “ razor-edge ” summits, and the road might aptly be compared to the track of an ant crawling along the teeth of a large saw. Tang-i-Salim .—The Chenara forces its way through the range by a huge chasm called the Tang-i-Salim, each successive ridge being divided by a rift extending from the top to the bottom of the mountain, bordered by stupendous cliffs. A path leads by the river bank, but is said to be unfit for mules. Momunai .—At 9 miles the small village of Momunai was reached, situated at the foot of the first outlier of the range (^SSO 7 ); and from here we commenced to cross two steep jagged ridges thickly covered with oaks and low scrub; extreme ly steep gradients, and the track very rough. The summit of the first is SjdbO'. At miles the second (6,010') is reached, and the head of a valley, 2 miles wide (5,495') traversed, in which are two large springs. From here we followed diagonally along the ridge (6,000') heading west. The track is rough and stony until the southern edge is reached when the descent becomes very steep and toilsome leading first down a narrow ravine, among huge boulders, through low shrubs and undergrowth, then a steeper slope, of a jumbled mass of broken sheets of rock and boulders, sometimes over the smooth bare surface of the underlying strata. I took one hour to get down on foot, and the animals 1^ hours. The total descent was 1,340 feet. There was no definite track, numerous small ones leading in every direction among the stones; the mules found their own way, and the horses had to be led carefully. On either side of the pass the ridge is a smooth hard sheet of rock, of vertical limestone strata, and it would be impossible to make zigzags to improve the path into a cart road, or make it passable for artillery. The ascent would be very trying, and would take at least three hours. Chardowar Valley .—At the foot of the pass lies Chardowar valley (3,150'). We followed a track across some low undulating spurs to the village where a halt was made by the bank of the Chenara river which had emerged from the Tang-i-Salim, and flowed east along the southern side of the valley. The village consists of a few mud huts near an orchard, during the summer the people had gone into booths by the river. The headman came to offer the diwankhana of his booth for my use. The interior is like that of the ordinary blanket tent. The outer walls are formed of several upright trunks, interwoven with boughs and the roof of thickly woven branches ; reed mats are placed round the walls inside the boughs, and the interior is partitioned off into smaller rooms, viz., one for women’s quarters, another for the kitchen, another for the young calves, &amp;c., leav ing a central portion to move about in, and a pillar on which to hang the inevitable Martini Peabody rifle, saddle, and accoutrements. One end of the roof projected and formed a small verandah, divided from the rest by a reed partition. This is the diwankhana for receiving visi tors and is usually carpeted. The reed matting is woven with various patterns of coloured worsted, and stands about 4' high. The headman’s house was by far the largest, being 50' long by 20' wide. h 252 The poorer tents are very much smaller and meaner. The people were engaged in cultivating the small patches of maize and rice along the river bank or tending their flocks, and seemed peaceable. Letters or a guide from Hassan Agha in Karmanshah are necessary. Routes through the Char do war Valley. The Chavdowar valley lies immediately south of the Vardalan Range, and is 5 to 6 miles broad, crossed by numerous low undulating spurs. A rounded ridge, the Charmin Kuh, separates it from the Zangawan valley immediately to the south. The Ab-i-Chenara skirts the south side and a stream from Zangawan, flowing through a deep gorge in the Charmin Kuh, joins it below Chardowar. To the south of Zangawan lies the Sirwan valley, separated from it by a low wooded ridge {see sketch from summit of Vardalan Pass). Beyond this rises the Gatcha Kuh, a lofty range, the lower slopes of which are well wooded, terminating to the north-west in Manisht Kuh, and extending south-east some 25 to 30 miles formed of parallel ridges which run north-west and south-east. The two low ridges bounding the Sirwan valley are outliers from the Gatcha Kuh. Situated just over Sirwan is a huge gap or dip in the Gatcha Kuh, bordered by precipices, and looking most inaccessible called the Mil-a-Gawan, a name sometimes given to the whole range. The Lurish word “ mil ” means a neck or pass. No road or track led through it. Zangawan valley is about 6 miles broad, down the centre of which flows a small river, the Ab-i-Zangawan, through the Taug-i-Zangawan to join the Ab-i-Chenara. A green fringe of irrigated maize and rice crops, varying from 4 mile to | mile wide, follows the stream bank. The ridges are well wooded. A “tree limit,” above which no trees grew, could be traced along the Gatcha Kuh and at the Dalowa pass was found approximately 7,120'. The southern entrance of the Tang-i-Salim, through which the Ab-i-Chenara emerges, lies due north of Chardowar. While crossing the Vardalan Range, occasional glimpses were caught of the river below in a narrow gorge, bordered by enormous clilfs. Five miles to the south-east is another break in the range, the Tang-i-Bai, through which a difficult road leads, said to be unfit for mules? Just before reaching Chardowar, a horseman of Hassan Ghuli Khan's people passed through ; having left Hullilan before sunrise, came through the Tang-i-Bai, and expected to reach Dehbala that evening. Hublan was said to be 10 farsakhs distant ; but this seems excessive— probably 7 or 8 . In a south-east direction the Chardowar valley seems to extend some 20 miles, at which point the ridges close in. Beyond this lay a hilly, rough country cut up with deep ravines. lo the north-west an easy route, over some rounded clay spurs, led to the Asmanabad plateau and Charmilia, and from there to Zarua and Iwan {see Route I). One way of avoiding the steep Vardalan Pass is to ascend the valley thus to Charmilia, and then cross the Kaladja Pass, and reach Kai mans hah through Gouaraj and Harunabad. The Kaladja is a continua tion of the Vardalan Range, and the pass there is easier. The Ab-i-Chenara flows along the foot of the north-west slope of the Charmin Kuh and joins the Kerkhah which comes through the Tang-i-Bai at the south-east end of the Rudbar plain. 23rd August.— General direction, W. Left Chardowar at 3 a. at. by moonlight, and forded the river immediately afterwards.•:-r^ 53 The deep narrow irrigation channels along the hanks were difficult to cross. The river now is 60 yards wide and 2 feet deep, and would in flood time be a formidable obstacle. There are no bridges anywhere. The road follows the right bank and is cut up by leakage from the irri gation channels. After a short distance we left the river and ascended a stony track over the Charmin Kuh. The lower spurs are easy clay ravines, but it gets more rocky near the summit. From the top (4,625'), 4 miles from Chardowar, a good view is obtainable of the Zangawan valley to the south, to which a steep rough track leads. Our road trends diagonally down the hill, striking across the head of the Zangawan valley, and directly towards Manisht Kuh. The Charmin Kuh is well wooded with oaks, some of large size, and a few pistachio and hawthorn trees. There is a curious habit here, resulting in the destruction of the best trees. Camp fires are lit against the trunk, and in time the tree gets hollowed out in the centre, until eventually the whole is burnt and nothing but a shell remains ; the whole tree then withers, falls down, and is used for fire wood. There is comparatively little sound wood from this cause. At lO^ miles the Ab-i-Zangawan was crossed (4,105'). Most of the water is led away into irrigation channels. Maize and rice were chiefly grown; also “ mash,” a kind of vetch. There is no snow now on Manisht Kuh, but at the end of April it was thickly covered. Easy tracks lead north-west to the Asmanabad plateau and Zarna (see Route I) from here. We followed the direction of a wide valley gradually ascending. The soil is rich and water abundant. The district is very thinly populated, and the people very poor, cultivating nothing but the bare necessities of life. Unjust exactions, lawlessness, and want of any settled government are the cause of this. The sites of large cities, now in ruins, at Sirwan, Zarna, and Asmanabad tes tify to the prosperity of the place in ancient times. Although enough supplies for our small party were readity procured, no large quantities would be available for troops except sheep and cattle. Corn is all brought from Karmanshah. Tang-i-Duarnan .—At loi miles we reached the foot of the long ascent of the Dalowa Pass (4,700') and entered the Tang-i-Duarnan, a narrow rift in one of the lower ridges of the Gatcha Kuh. Limestone cliffs, honeycombed with numerous small caves, rise on either side, and the road narrows to 20 ' in places following a stream bed among boulders. This narrow portion is 200 yards long. Several small mule caravans were met, and the road is well frequented. They were carrying wheat, rice, and dried fruits into Chardowar. This trade is local, and no through traffic exists between Karmanshah and the Tigris valley. Numerous donkey caravans were also met, the animals being the small black breed common to West Persia, always poor and wretched look ing, but capable of carrying enormous loads for their size. The ridge we now ascend is a long spur from the Gatcha Kuh connecting it with Manisht Kuh. It is a long gradient, steep in places, and the track is rough and stony between trees and shrub undergrowth. Close overhead to the north-west is the flat-topped summit of Manisht Kuh, the upper portion of which is a fringe of cliffs of grey limestone, 500' to 600' high, overhanging steep slopes of shale and broken rock, well wooded near the base. The sum mit is 9,500' above sea level. To the east lay a wide semi-circular basin bounded by the spur just mentioned; the lovver portion cut up by narrow ravines choked with trees and54 boulders overhanging which were perpendicular cliffs. The north-west end of the Gatcha Kuh ends abruptly in an enormous precipice. Cheni Gutchan .—At the foot of the pass at 16| miles is the Cheni Gutchan, a spring from which a large stream flowed. The road here bifurcated, one track following the contour of the basin, and winding through a gap in the cliffs at the summit. It is a slightly shorter route to Dehbala, but far more difficult than the path we took. Dalowa Pass .—From the top of the pass at 244 miles (7,800') a very extensive view was obtained. To the north-west the whole of the Zarna valley (Route I) could be seen. Several Kurdish Iliats were now camped there, and irrigated crops were planted along the banks of the Gunjir. A steep track led down a narrow valley to the north-west from here into the head of the Iwan and Zarna plain. To the south Dehbala valley could be seen at our feet, spread out like a map. The descent was extremely steep and rugged, down a rocky wooded hillside. The total descent is 2,830', which we did in two hours. The horizontal distance is not more than three miles. The path is a series of steep short zigzags, winding among trees and boul ders, with a sudden drop here and there of 3' and 4'. The ascent must be very tedious. . The rock is a bluish grey limestone. Several caravans of mules were met. This seems to be the only road to Dehbala. The country to the south west is very wild and mountainous. Hassan Ghuli Khan’s vakil, with 50 horsemen, came out to meet us at the foot of the pass as escort the remainder of the way into Dehbala. At 30 miles from Chardowarthe Wall’s house was reached (4,965'). Hassan Ghuli Khan’s house is the only stone building, his retainers being camped around in booths and tents, numbering 2,500 in all. Near the house is a garden 500 yards long by 250 broad enclosed with a masonry wall 4' thick and 15' high, with corner flanking towers. It is well laid out with tanks and fountains down the centre, and rows of poplar and willow trees. Vineyards, groves of peaches, apricots and vegetables grow on either side with some fine walnut trees. At the north side stands the Wali’s principal residence, a square fortified building, built of brick and stone, of 50 yards side. The outer walls are 30' high, 3' thick at the base, and have a small circular tower at each corner. In the centre is a courtyard with a tank. Several suites of rooms open on to this court. Along the wall on the flat roof is a double tier of loopholes. The arrangement of these is peculiar, being simply slits with no splay at all, the upper tier cut at right angles to the wall, and meant for direct fire; the lower cut alternately, slanting in different directions, and meant for oblique fire. There are rooms with minor courtyards in the interior, and a diwankhana, or large visitor’s room, facing the gateway. The rooms are decorated in the usual Persian style with small pieces of looking-glass and pictures let into the plaster at intervals. They are furnished with European tables, chairs, &amp;c., and the luxury of the interior is a marked contrast to the poverty and wretched booths of his retainers outside. The water-supply is particularly good, a large spring from the foot of the hill being led through the house, and the water bubbles up clear and icy cold into the tanks. There is a Turkish bath outside the north wall of the buildingand a stable inside for 20 horses, store rooms, &amp;c. The door of the house is in the south wall, and opens into the garden, with a second gateway in the outer wall defended overhead with a banquette and tier of loopholes. In the lower end of the garden is a three-storied unfinished building; a staring, comfortless sort of place, with rows of large windows, built in the style of the Imadiah Palace at Karmanshah. The house and garden are recently built; and its situation, as a stronghold for a feudal chief in this secluded valley, shut in on all sides, is well chosen. The Dalowa Pass is the only means of crossing the mountain to the north, and that is steep and difficult, and might be held by a few resolute men against any number. The route towards the Mesopotamia plain is also capable of easy defence. To the south-east towards the Kabir Kuh lies an extremely wild, impassable country, full of deep wooded ravines and crags, while to the north-west towards Zarna are a succession of rugged parallel ridges difficult to cross. The position at least seems secure against anything the Persian Gov ernment would care to attempt, and the chief may be said to be practically independent. Hassan Ghuli Khan. —Hassan Ghuli Khan is the principal chief of the Faili Lurs, and makes his influence felt over the whole of Lur-i-Kuchuk. He is known to the Arabs as “ El Faili.” He keeps up the semi-regal title and state of Walicf Luristan, one of the former Walis of Persia— viz., Azerbaijan, Gurjistan, Kurdistan and Luristan. These titles are now more or less in abeyance in the three first districts. He has here at his disposal a force of 700 well mounted horsemen and 2,000 infantry, all armed with Martini Peabody rifles bought or looted from over the Turkish border. He chiefly raids into the Tigris plain, and has several times been in colli sion with Turkish troops from Baghdad. The Beni Lam Arabs and his men are at a deadly feud. He is a fine man, with commanding presence, with a remarkably long beard, which obtained him the name of “ rish-i-buzurg.” He is about 50 years old, and is now much broken down through drink. His eldest son is 25 years old, and a Sartip in the Persian service. Until lately he was with the Zil-es-Sultan at Isfahan, and seems to have been kept there as a sort of hostage for the good behaviour of his father. The climate at this, the hottest time of year, was fairly pleasant; with the thermometer 91° in the afternoon, with Chmate. nights and early mornings cool. Towards the end of October it commences to rain ; the rainy weather lasting about a month, and then snow sets in and remains on the ground 2| to 3 months, according to the severity of the season. The tops of Manisht and the Gatcha Kuh were covered with snow in April, but none remains all the year round on any of these ranges. There is said to be 2 feet of snow in this valley in winter. The tribes then move down to Hosseiniyeh and the Gusdana plain near the Turkish frontier. “ Yailak” is the Lur word for summer quarters. It is equivalent to the Persian “ sardsir,” and is known with the same meaning through Central Asia. “ Zozan,” the Kermanji word further north for summer quarters, is unknown here. “ Querrutch ” is the Lur word for winter quarters, cc garmsir ” or &lt;e kishlak.” Both Kermanji (and Lur dialects are extremely guttural. The people talk or rather shout to one another in a piercing high key, and the effect is curious. They are fond of singing and chanting as they go along. The Lurs are a merry, lighthearted people, very different to the pure Persians.56 26th August-—General direction, S.W. Left Dehbala following broad track down the valley through some patches of Indian-corn irrigated by the stream. Kala Kiran .—At the south-west corner of the valley is situated a curious hill, shaped like a truncated cone, called Kala Kiran. The summit is about 500 yards diameter and scarped almost the whole way round, with only a narrow path leading up. It is used as a stronghold or place of refuge. Our road turns south-east at the lower end of the valley, skirting the foot of a wooded ridge to the west. The country is cut up by several wooded ravines; the road gradually ascends the ridge to the front by an easy gradient. The stream from Dehbala passes through a narrow gorge in the hills at the end of the valley and emerges again on the Gusdana plain. This is the head waters of the Ab-i-Tursakh. At 6f miles turn south round the end of the range we have been skirting (3,380'). The north-west end of the Kebir Kuh bears 18° from here. The inter vening country, drained by the head waters of the Gunjianchun, is a series of rugged wooded ridges, intersected by deep gorges, looking quite impassable. No routes lead through it to the Kerkhah valley. We now commence crossing a series of low wooded ridges with steep sharp summits. Stunted oaks, ilex, pistachio and hawthorn are the principal trees. Rock is mostly grey limestone, with fertile soil between the stones. The valleys between the ridges run down 308° to a small river, which we could get glimpses of, winding through several deep gorges at right angles to the range. This is the river from Dehbala valley, which enters a “ tang/' in the hills bearing STi 0 from Dehbala. No road leads along the bank of this stream. W T e follow a kind of watershed, several small streams from springs flow ing east towards the Gunjianchun. Marbera .—At miles reach Marbera, 5,195', a large spring on the north-east slope of the Kerrapi Kuh, standing in a circular basin about H miles diameter, well wooded, and bounded by low cliffs. The Faili tribes usually make this the intermediate stage when moving to the plain from Dehbala. Atash .—Some 4 miles down a steep ravine, on a bearing of 308°, is Atash, a small cultivated basin, shut in with steep hills, on the Ab-i-Tursakh. From Marbera we follow a broad track, through thick woods, leading over the ridge by an easy gradient. The range to the south-east of the summit is in the Kerrapi Kuh, and to the north-west is the Sanakchir Kuh. The summits are a line of rugged cliffs well wooded (5,840'). Descended the western slope of the hill for a short distance, and then halted on a terrace i mile broad (3,295'), cultivated with a few patches of wheat. Some Lurs were found who lived in booths on the edge of a ravine and who brought us fowls and eggs. There is a fine panorama of the Tigris plain from the summit of the Ker rapi Kuh, it being the last ridge of the Pusht-i-Kuh to the west. Weather pleasant; strong north-west wind from the plain; noon temper ature 87°. 27tli August*—General direction, S.S.W. Left camp, and began descent of the hill in a general direction of 225°, following the line of the spurs, along a rough stony tracs:, with steep gradient. Trees and shrubs gradually disappear as we descend, and the soil gets poorer.57 ge. the foot 'al woofe y an eajj liillsattfe the heal 3D skirtiij q he later, i series oi spassahle, teep sharf lipal trees, mes.

Tang-i-Gulam .—At 5 miles is another narrow defile, 200 yards long, and barely 20 feet wide, and bordered with cliffs 200 feet high, called the Tang-i- CJolam. The track follows the bed of a small stream among boulders, and during the floods in spring the road is quite impassable. The line of cliffs through which this forms the only opening extends all along the hillside for 4 to 5 miles on either hand. Below the slopes become easier, and the lower spurs of the range are more rounded. We follow the line of the small stream which flows at the bottom of a deep gorge on the right. A few stray patches of cultivation were seen on. the upper part of the descent and the country is quite bare and deserted as we descend. Gusdana Plain .—At 6| miles the lowest spur of the ridge is passed, and we enter the plain of Gusdana (2,615''), crossing it in on a bearing of 177° heading towards the Tang-i-Gnnjianchun. This is the usual encampment of Hassan Ghuli Khan’s people for the win ter months. The remains of old camps were seen ; there is plenty of grass in winter and spring on the plain and the low hills adjoining, while everything is now burnt up. Some strata of gypsum were crossed containing patches of a flaky trans parent substance whijh proved to be Selenite. Tang-i-Gunjianchun .—At 19 miles the Tang-i-Gunjianchun (1,490') was reached. A river of the same name emerges from the Kerrapi Kuh through a deep rift called the Tang-i-Dakhursa, and follows the south-west side of^the Gusdana Plain. The Tang-i-Dakhursa bears 24° from here, and is 5 miles south-east of the Kerrapi pass along the ridge. No road is said to lead through it. The lower part of the plain near the Tang is called Bahnrowan. The river runs in a deep bed, 200 to 3CO yards wide, bordered by earth cliffs 80 to 100 feet high. We descend a small ravine to the water level. On either side of the pass are low ranges of a clay formation streaked with gypsum, cut up by numerous small ravines. To the right the range is called the Kuh-i-Kuluk, and runs and north-west in the direction of Tursakh, and south-east is the Kuh-i-Kafirgah, which forms the extremity of a long spur from the Kuh-i-xAnnoran, a high mountain range parallel to and south-west of the Kebir Kuh. The Kuh-i-Kafirgah increases in height from the Tang, and a few miles up is covered with low trees and shrubs. The water of the Gunjianchun and the other streams of this plain is sli o- ht- ly brackish, but drinkable. They become salt only when they reach this line of gypsiferous strata and are quite sweet before leaving the hills. The same thing occurs with all the streams along the western slope of the Pusht-i-Kuh. These gypsum strata extend all the way from Mosul to the Persian Gulf as an out lier to the main ranges. No vegetation was visible now except a few reeds and tamarisk bushes along the river banks. The road follows the river bed through the pass, fording twice. Conse quently if the river is high in spring, this road would be impassable. Another track leads over the Kuh-i-Kuluk, said to be very rough going, crossing several small ravines. VOL. I. T53 Hussainiyeh .—At ll miles (1,180'), about half-way through the pass, reach Hussainiyeh, Hassan Ghuli Khan's winter house, on the right bank of the river. There are two houses near a small fruit orchard. The lower or dwelling house is 60 yards square, with a tower at each corner, and loopholed walls. It is sunk among some low spurs, and is consequently commanded from about 200 yards range. The upper house is about 40 yards side, also loopholed with towers at the corners, and is used as a store. The walls are of masonry set in gypsum, and '6' to 4' thick, and the upper part crenelated with brick. Date palm were seen again in the orchard here. The hills on either side of the valley rise 400' to 500' above the river bed. The weather is much hotter now after descending into the plain. Temper ature 102° in the diwankhana of the house. The glare from the bare hills and dusty roads was severe. Water from the river was brackish, but drinkable. On leaving the pass it gets more brackish from the gj^psum and various mineral springs along the banks. The stones on the bank were covered with white incrustations. 28th. August — General direction, S.W. Left Hussainiyeh at 2 a.m. in bright moonlight. The road, a very rough track, still follows the line of the river bed, fording the stream four times. These fords are now easy, but when the river is in flood in spring, they would be impracticable. The rock is a gravelly conglomerate, and the river bed is a mass of large loose stones. Kala Sengar. —Near the mouth of the pass is Kala Sengar, a rough stone enclosure on a knoll overlooking the left bank of the stream. It is a good point for the defence of the pass, and is meant for that purpose. The banks are lined with a few oleanders and stunted shrubs. Some small springs of sulphuretted hydrogen were passed by the water's edge. The track is very rough and stony and my orderly's horse was badly sprained yesterday. In winter this valley is covered with tents of Hassan Ghuli Khan’s people, and plenty of good grass is to be found then. Now everything is burnt up, and the country deserted. At 3f miles the valley gradually opens out, and the track leads across an open stony plain, cut up here and there by shallow ravines. To the north lay some low rocky spurs, the last of the main range. This Kuh-i-Taliman, as it is called, contains several caves in the cliffs and is a favourite resort of rob bers. A man joined us here, who said he had a few&gt; donkeys, and traded in fruit with Kut-T-Amara; last night he was robbed of everything, and was now making his way into Zorbatiyeh to seek redress from the Turkish authorities. Failing that, he thought to enrich himself again by looting some smaller caravan when he got a chance. At 10 j miles the frontier pillar was passed, and Turkey re-entered. A high peak, the Kuh-i-Annoran, bore 120° from here. A suspicious-looking group of men appeared on the plain and on catching sight of them, our escort of eight Lur horsemen galloped to the front, spreading out into a wide fan, 200 to 300 yards apart, circling round with their rifles at the ready, until they gradually closed in and found out who they were. This dash across the plain was a pretty sight, and these Lur horsemen would make fine scouts. The Gawi stream joins the Gunjianchun after traversing a narrow defile in the range 10 miles to the south. It drains the north slopes of the Kuh-i- Annoran and the country west of the Kebir Kuh.The soil becomes more alluvial as we go on, and a well cultivated belt of crops now appears on either bank of the river. Cross several irrigation cuts, 10' wide and sunk 6' to 8', generally bridged. Zorbatiyeh .—At 144 miles entered Zorbatiyeh, a Turkish frontier town. Our escort of Lurs from Dehbala would not come in, but left us outside, being afraid of the Turkish authorities. They were a fine set of men, armed with Martinis, and well mounted. They di-d not like Hassan Ghuli Khan's rule, saying he ground them down too much. They asked if it were not possi ble to take them with me to India, and enlist them in Her Majesty's army. The Turkish authorities thought I had dropped from the clouds when I entered Zorbatiyeh alone. Bedrai .—Passing through Zorbatiyeh, we struck across the plain and reach ed Bedrai (350') 8 miles further on, where we camped on the bank of the Gunjianchun. Zorbatiyeh is a place of 500 houses and Bedrai of 700 houses, both being surrounded by date gardens. A Mutasarif with 100 zaptiyahs are quartered in Bedrai, and a frontier guard of a Yuzbashiand 50 men in Zorbatiyeh. The country around is said to be unsafe,—on the one side Lur robbers from over the frontier, and on the other “ ghazus ' or raiding parties of the Beni Lam Arabs, who roam over the country towards the Tigris. There is a good deal of trade with Kut-T-Amara, also with Mendali, which lies two stages distant to the north. The stages are— ( 1 ) Tursakh ... ... ... 10 hours, 26 miles. (2) Mendali ... ... ... 10 hours, 25 miles. Total ... 51 miles. The distance was also given as 14 farsakhs. It is a barren road at this time of year with only a ruined fort at Tursakh ; and the water is all brackish. No supplies available. The chief traffic is in dates, fruits, rice and corn. A route leads along the outer spurs of the Pusht i-Kuk to Dizful from here. The stages were given as—• ( 1 ) Mal-i-Katabi. (2) Changolan. (3) Zarkrani. (4) Kafilaja. (5) Kishaduruk. (6) Dehluran. (7) Pattak. ( 8 ) Tak-i-Abbas. (9) Iferkhah Elver. (10) Dizful. This route is not much used by caravans. The villages are few, and only nomads are met with ; most of the streams are brackish. In spring when there is grass on the desert, there is more trade between Dizful and Kut. The Lurs over the frontier and the Beni Lam Arabs are always at feud with each other. The summer is the most favourable time for Arab raiding parties, when caravans travel by night. Large herds of cattle and sheep were grazing on the plain now, picking up anything green they could find by the canals. The date gardens of Bedrai extend some 2 miles inland on either bank of the liver. The town lies on the left bank, and the stream is now fordable at all points, flowing in gravelly shallow bed 500 to 600 yards broad. Dates, pomegranates, figs and grapes are grown, and along the river bank melons, hemp, beans, onions, bamias, bajra and badinjan. 1 260 The soil is fertile and the date gardens are famous. A good deal of wheat,, barley and maize is grown along the river bank, but the general insecurity of the country prevents much prosperity or trade. A series of mounds iind ruins called Tapa Akr lies to the north beyond the gardens, said to be the Tomb of Darius. The population are mostly settled Arabs, with a few Lurs from over the frontier. They are all Shiahs both in Bedrai and Zorbatiyeln The Shaikh of Redrai is a Sunni, and there are some 20 houses of that persuasion there. The river water is brackish and bitter, but drinkable. The place is un healthy on this account, and much fever prevails. In 1884 the plague broke out in the Mendali, Bedrai and Zorbatiyeh districts. Numbers of the inhabit ants tied, and deaths were numerous. No other water is procurable; some, a little better, was got from a canal to the south of the place. The weather was sultry and oppressive, hot winds blowing all day from the desert. Noon temperature 102°; after sunset 82°, and at 2 a.m. down to 73°. Flies, mosquitoes, &amp;c., very troublesome. There is no way of dividing the distance to Kut, except one short stage to- Jessan (13 miles), and a long one from thereto Kut (40 miles). No water or supplies to be had at this time of year between Jessan and Kut. The dis tance was given as 10 farsakhs. 29th August —Left Bedrai at 2 a.m. escorted by six zaptiyahs, whom the Mutasarif insisted on giving. The road was a broad, level, well defined track, skirting the river bank, crossing several irrigation cuts. The ground is left fallow for two years before crops are again taken. Jessan .—At 13 miles at 5-45 a.m. reached Jessan, also in a date grove on the river bank. Stayed during the day in the house of the Shaikh. Tem perature 98° at noon in the house, with hot winds. This is a place of 400 houses. The date gardens seem poorer than Bedrai, and it suffers much from Arab raids. Water is from the river and canals, bitter and brackish, but drink able—rather worse than Bedrai. The population are settled Arabs, all Shiahs. Several cattle and sheep grazed on the plain. Left Jessan at 5 P.M., carrying water in skins, and started across the plain. Remains of numerous canals and watercourses were crossed, for the first 6 miles and then a broad well beaten track was followed over the bare desert. Soil was a caked alluvial clay. At 19 miles (9-45 P.M.), marching in bright moonlight, we came upon the edge of dry salt marshes, in which the track became entirely lost. The zaptiyahs lost the road, but by steering by compass from bearings previously taken from the map, I managed to shape out a very direct course and hit off the track again on the other side within i mile. The bearing from Jessan to Kut is 190°, and the track runs in almost a straight line between the two. This is the Suwekjeh marsh formed by the Gunjir from Mendali and other streams which at this season lose themselves in the desert. Probably some water from the Bel id Ruz canal also enters it. In spring time I was told the track has to be found through 3' of water. There are other large marshes more to the southward, into which flow the Gunjian- chun and the Changolan, a river emerging from the mountains 30 miles to the south-east, and the outlet of which reaches the Tigris near Ali Gharbi. These latter—a large sheet of water—could be seen in the moonlight to the south of the route. It is only in spring or flood time that any surplus water finds its way into the Tigris. d he track led over ground covered 6 to 8 inches deep with white saline powder, through the crust of which the animals sunk at every step. Not a vestige of vegetation of any sort could be seen.61 °f wllQlj fcnritjoi and the Toru| ■ over tie ^aitt of :here. l oe is ti. ?«e l* 'e inlatit iejsome,! ybmtlr mVil &gt;rtsta»et« Nowata Ttie &amp; \h, win ell defy llie groasl i grow oj ikli.

This lasted for 9 miles till midnight, when we emerged close to the track leading to Kut, and found a small caravan encamped. Found one of our zap- tiyahs soundly beating the headman for not being able to supply us with fresh water from the Tigris—rather an unreasonable proceeding. The soil is again an alluvial clay, and a broad well defined track led into Kut-d-Amara, which we entered at 5-80 a.m. of the 80th of August. Total length of stage 40 miles. Stayed in the house of a Baghdad merchant, who offered his hospitality until the arrival of the British river steamer. On the 2nd September we left Kut in the Medijieh, and reached Basra on the evening of the 3rd. This route is the concluding one of our journey; hut it has been placed as Route II, because the district adjoins that passed through in houte I. The weather was hot and oppressive, with a burning wind all day. The nights were fairly cuol, sleeping on the roof. Temperature 80° at 6 a.m. and 9*° at noon in an underground cellar or “ serdab/' The Beni Lam Arabs have been very troublesome this summer, and have looted cattle along the river hank. Route No. XII.—Karmanshali to Baghdad. Khorassabad to Sir-i- Pul. Stages. Hoars marching, Distance, in miles. Rate of marching: in miles per hour. Intermediate. Total. Karind ... 3*3 10 10 3-CO Pai Tak ... 65 21-5 3P5 3-30 Sir-i-Pul... 35 1P5 430 3-30 Two stages and a portion of a third on this route were travelled. It is the main road taken by caravans and pilgrims going to Kerbela to reach the Mesopotamian plain from Central Persia, and has been frequently described by travellers. It descends at once the whole difference of level between the upland country and the plain at tho Tak-i-Girra Pass, and at the foot reaches the valley of the Alwand, a tributary of the Diala, the broad valley of which latter river it follows to Baghdad, over an easy undulating country. This route is of great military importance as King the easiest for troops to reach the important position of Karmanshah from the Tigris valley. It avoids the series of rugged ridges which in other directions separate the central plateau of Persia from the plain. 30th April —Reached the main road from Mandali and Zarna at the small village of Khorassabad, 10 miles from Harunabad. On leaving this we kept along a narrow stony valley bordered by rounded hills which gradually opened out to 5 to 6 miles broad into the plain of Karind. The road is crossed by several small streams which in this loamy soil make the crossing places swampy and bad, and small culverts are badly needed. ’ Much cultivation was seen, and ploughing was in progress. A few small villages were noticed on the banks of the Ab-i-Karind which skirts the south side of the plain. Karind.— This is a place of 500 houses at the mouth of a narrow gorge, called the Tang-i-Enus, in the rocky ridge bounding the valley to the6 a north-west. About miles up the gorge is a large spring from which the water-supply is brought for the town and into several orchards and vineyards. The stream runs south across the valley and forms the principal source of the Ab-i-Karind, a large tributary of the Kerkhah {see Route II). The principal portion of Karind village is clustered round the mouth of the gorge, and the remainder on the main road | mile lower down. There are the two serais,—one a fine brick building of ancient date now in a very bad state of repair, and another a modern one with plenty of accom modation but of a poor sort. A few houses and a small bazar are clustered round the serais, and several caravans encamp in the orchards. There is a large space for camping a large body of troops in the grassy valley to the south. The water-supply is at all seasons very abundant. Somp steep limestone cliffs 500 / to 600 / high, bordering the Tang-i-Enus, overlook the town. A track led through the gorge and over some steep rounded hills into Gauwara, 4 farsakhs distant. It looked a well used track. Jones gives the following description of this road : August 29th, 1844. —Left 2-15 A.sr. going due north up a very steep ascent over rough loose stones and rock ascending the range behind Karind. At 3-10 reached the summit from which was a very extensive view. To the north-west at a short distance was the flat-topped summits of the Kuh-i-Dela.hu extending 325° to 339°. The solitary hamlet of Bowanij in the plain of the same name lay immediately underneath and distant about 10 miles; bearing 330°. Bearing 78° is a peak of the Kala Kazi Range seen through a break through which the Ab-i- Zemkan forces its way. rtauwara bears 83° from here. Commenced descent on foot at 3-30 finding it as abrupt and difficult as the west face. Crossed the plain of Bowanij over several undulating ridgesand abrupt acclivities. After leaving this plain, the road gradually ascends over the lower spurs running south-east from the Kuh-i-Delahu. These slopes are thickly covered with dwarf oak. Forded the Zemkan river whose source is in the Bowanij plain at 5-35; at 6-35 reached Gauwara. Total four hours’ marching. ^ Bearing 24-7° to 2S7° is the Bend-i-Nua Kuh, a bare rounded summit still streaked with snow. It is 8,250 feet above sea level, and is the highest summit in the immediate neighbourhood. Its lower slopes are bare, and along the foot were large number of iliat encampments, mostly Kalhur Kurds, moving up from the plains. The tribes in the neighbourhood of the Bend-i-Nua have a very had reputa tion as robbers. Sirtip Ali Murad Khan, the chief of the Karindi Kurds, has a good house here. He owns most of the land round here and as far as the Bishewa valley near Sir-i-Pul Most of these Karindi Kurds belong to the sect of Ali Allahis, though they outwardly profess to be Shiahs. From the ridge above Karind, Manisht Kuh bears 165°, and Gatcha Kuh 160°; also a snowy peak in the Gatcha Kuh beyond Kub-i-Milao-awan bears 151°, and the Cachar Kuh 186°. 2nd May—General direction N.W. Started from Karind (5,410') in a direction west-north-west along the plain. Passed Harila and Khalata villages similarly situated to Karind at the mouth of small gorges in the range to the north. Two ruined causeways over small streams were passed which mark the line of the ancient highroad. At 7 miles the watershed of the Ab-i-Karind, a low undulation, was crossed and the head of the Tak-i-Girra pass entered. Sir Mil.—There are the ruins of an old fort called Sir Mil at the top of the descent (5,400), and the position is a good one for a post barring the upper exit trom the Pass. ' , Tak-t-Guira Pass. The upper portion of the Pass is a narrow valley shut in by steep rocky ridges, from 200 to 300 yards wide. The slopes are63 sparsely wooded with low trees and brushwood. The range on the south-east side is the steepest, and is composed of bare sheets of limestone. The road follows a ravine with a small stream and is rough going in places where the torrent has eaten into the soil. The gradient is easy, and by smoothing places where the road has fal len in, would be easily passable for artillery. Paved portions of an old high road, which used to run down the pass, are passed at intervals. The tele graph (two wires on wooden poles) follows the road. Surkhadiza .—At 151 miles the valley opens out into a small basin about 11 miles diameter in which is the serai and small village of Surkhadiza (4,280'). Four miles farther, after crossing some wooded spurs, we reached the head of the lower or steeper portion of the pass, and turned down in a westerly direction through a wide gap in the range. The total descent is from 4,200' to 3,150' at Pai Tak. The little stream, the Ab-i-Dera, which we have been following disappears through a narrow rift in the range to the south. No road exists through this rift, which is barely 20' wide, with steep overhanging cliffs. The road was improved when the Shah went to Kerbela this w r ay, but has not been repaired since. The new road is led down several zigzags with fairly easy gradients varying from 8'to 10'in width, with some narrow portions where boulders and earth have slipped down from the hillside, otherwise it is passable for artillery. Some of the zigzags (100 to 130 yards long) would be 1 e; ter if lengthened. A few hours' work would make the whole of the road* up the pass avail able for guts. The ascent is a long pull, steepest at first, of 14 miles from Pai Tak (3,150' to Sir Mil (5,400'). ’rhe pass easily lends itself to defence against a force advancing from the plain ; the steep cliffs on either side if lined with infantry would make a frontal attack difficult. On the north side is Kuh-i-Zenguelan which culminates in a flat crest bordered by a cliff overlooking the ascent; while another flat-topped ridge bordered with steep cliffs overlooks it on the south side. A narrow track by which the pass could be turned leads into the Yarran and Rijab valley and from there into the Bishewa plain. This is rough steep path easily defended. To the south the ridges are steep and topped with a line of cliffs which prevent the pass being turned in that direction. The road through Gilan and over the Kaladja Pass, 30 miles to the south would turn it. [See Route I.) A rough track leads from Zohab through Rijab into the Bowanij plain and Gauwara. This is said to be difficult even for mules. .Pai Tak. —At the foot of the pass (3,150') is the small serai and village of Pai Tak on the banks of the Ab-i-Dera. A caravan was met carrying a coach to Tehran. It was in separate pieces, each being attached to a wooden frame work which fitted ‘ f takhtarwan ' fashion on two mules. Two mules could thus carry a very heavy load on a rough road. 3rd May—General direction N.W. Leaving Pai Tak the road would along the stream valley crossing some low gravelly undulations from the Kuh-i-Zenguelan. The valley makes a deep loop to the south bordered by a steep ridge topped with a ridge of cliffs. This is a long spur from the central mass of the Bend-i-Nua Kuh. Another spur extends along the front towards Sir-i-Pul terminating in a narrow rocky ridge called the Kala Daond range. This gets lower and finally dies away in the plain about 3 miles north-west of Sir-i-Pul.64 To&gt;the north-west lies the fertile valley of Bishewa containing three small villages, all known as Charlghar, belonging to Sirtip Ali Murad Khan of Karind. This valley is irrigated by canals from the Alwand River and the Ab-i-Dera. At 7i miles (2,370') the road turns through a gap in the Kala Daoud Range from 100 to 200 yards wide and 4 mile long called the Mian Kul pass. The Alwand passes through a similar gap 2 miles to the north-west nearer Sir-i-Pul. On the west side of the Mian Kul Pass we entered the Kalashakin Plain, fertile, but little cultivated extending south-east to Kifraour valley. Our road skirted along the ridge to the right and at 11 3 miles reach Sir-i- Pul (2,080'). The whole of this stage the road was easy and passable for artillery. 8 rd May.—Sir-i-Pul or Sir-i-Pul-i-Zohah, its complete name, is a small place of 100 wretched houses on the right bank of the Alvvand, and here crossed by a good masonry bridge The river was a rapid torrent now and not easily fordable. On the left bank are the ruins of a very ancient city called Dera and afterwards Hoi wan. There is a large serai on the right bank in a very tumbled down condition, and along the stream bank below the village are some fruit gardens. There is a post of a Captain (Sultan) and 200 men quartered here and in the watchtowers on the road towards Kasr-i-Shirin. They are of the Guran Kurd Regiment and armed with percussion muskets. There is a small walled enclosure in the village in which are kept 4 small S. B. bronzefield guns of Tehran manufacture. The Kalashakin valley runs up 150° from Sir-i-Pul 6 miles wide, bounded at its upper extremity by some low hills. The head of the valley is the summer pasturage of the Kalhur Kurds under Reza Ghuli Khan, their chief, who lives in Harunabad. To the north and north-east in the Zohab direction are the Guran Kurds under Muhammad Hussain Khan of Gauwara. The weather changed considerably on reaching the foot of the pass; the temperature increased, and the nights became warmer. Temperature 82° at noon. A duststorm lasting about an hour came on in the afternoon. We left the main road here and turned off towards Zohab; as the remainder of this route to Baghdad is well known. The level of the Meso potamian plain is now practically reached, and nothing but a few gravelly ridges, outliers of the main range, are passed after this. The road is easily passable for artillery to Baghdad. Route N o. IV.—Sir-i-Pul to Kasr-i- Shirin via ZoRab. 4th to 5th May. Hours march- Miles. Rate marching in miles an hour. Stages. ing. Intermediate. Total. Zohab ... 3-75 13-00 13-00 3-50 Kasr-i-Shirin 6-00 20-00 33-00 3-3365 4tli May—Genei’al direction, N.N.E. A detour was made north-east from Sir-i-Pul to visit Zohab and return from there to Kasr-i-Shirin. From Sir-i-Pul the road is level to Zohab. At first the track leads parallel to the Kala Daoud Range and rounds the end where it dies away in the plain. The district to the west is Karaboulak, and a large spring of that name comes out of the rock at the base of the Range. The plain round Sir-i-Pul was fairly well cultivated ; the first barley that had been cut was seen here. Some camps of Kurdish iliats were still here but were to move to the hills soon. After rounding the end of the Kala Daoud Range the road strikes across the foot of the Bishewa valley and then over a low watershed into Zohab plain. A large canal has been cut which carries the water from the Alwand across this watershed to irrigate both plains. Any paths leading across the plain are rather swampy because of rice fields and leakage from canals. Some patches of splendid grass, mostly clover, was passed through. Not a single tree or village was to be seen on the plain. Only some Kurdish iliats were camped on the low grassy undulations to the south-west side. A few patches of barley, wheat, cotton and Indian corn, are grown, but much less than formerly produced from this fertile plain. Only about one- third is now under crops. This is due to the general insecurity of this frontier and the constant raiding of the Hamawand and Jaf tribes from over the border. It is also a favourite spot for the Kalhur, Karindi, Guran and other iliats to spend the winter. The only habitations seen were some clusters of wretched reed huts. Several canals were choked up, with the water flowing uselessly about the fields. The road skirts the foot of a lower plateau or spur of' the Kuh-i-Delahu, which bounds the plain to the north-east. The lower slopes are steep and covered with boulders, while along the summit runs a cliff 200'to 300' high jutting out as a prominent bluff into the plain. This is a parallel ridge to the Kuh-i-Zengueljjn, and is separated from it by a deep gorge and valley, through which the Alwand flows, and in which Rejiab and Yarran are situated. J 0HAB _ —At 13 miles Zohab (2,100') was reached on a small stream called the Chemisahu. On the right bank are the ruins of the old town of Zohab, once a large place, containing now only 100 mud-hovels and a small barrack, where a captain and 50 sarbaz are quartered. These are of the Guran Kurd Regiment. There were two large encampments of Jaf Kurds on the plain, who had come over the frontier from Gulambar. They had disagreed, they said, with Shaikh Muhammad, their chief in Sulaimaniah. The plain of Zohab measures 10 miles long by 5 broad. On the south-east side is the spur of the Kuh-i-Delahu already mentioned. On the summit of this is the old fortress of Yezdigird, called Kala Ban Zarda or Kala Yezdigird. In a direction 50° runs the narrow rocky valley from which the Chemisahu stream emerges. The road to Juanro leads up it. To the north-east overlooking Zohab is a high bare undulating ridge, with slopes cut up by several ravines. In a direction 350° is a deep trough in the hills through which the Sulai maniah road leads. Bounding the valley to the north-west are several low round ed hills rising to a rockv ridge, which runs N.N.W. till it reaches the Hiala Route to Juanro .—This is a hilly rough track of three long stages, of eight hours each, given as— VOL. I. (1) Ali Sultan. (2) Habikak Jaf. (3) Juanro. K66 From Juanro to Silina (q.v.) is three stages. Also along a very hilly mountainous road, but less difficult than the first portion. To Gauwara. —The following is precis of Jones’ route from Zohab to Gauwara in September 1844 : 1st Stage, Mir Khussar (3£ hours). —The road leads north by east at first np a stream valley, and then commences a very rough zigzag ascent of the Kuh-i-Delahu in a direction east-south-east, the slopes becoming wooded near the summit. Mir Khassar is a small plain just under the west brow of Dclahu. 2nd Stage, Bihian {4 hours). —Proceeded in an easterly direction to Palan, a Jaf encampment, the road being less steep now. We rounded the most northern brow of the Kuh-i-Delabu, and after | hour of very steep diffi cult descent reach Kila Zanjir. Bitween Palan and Kala Zanjir crossed the valleys of Kam Kowih and Girdi-Kaukureh. The peak of Pir Omar Gudrun near Suleimaniah bore326£° from here. Kala Zanjir is a ruined fort occupying a strong isolated position on the summit of a naturally scarped projection from the north-east brow of Delahu. Bibian is 1-^ miles distant; the road passes along a narrow footpath in a general direction south-south-east through a tangled oak forest quite impassable for loaded mules, who had to ascend by a longer but less difficult road farther down the slope. Bibian is a camp-ground on a small plain under the north-east brow of Delahu. The whole valley of the Zemkan river, 6 miles distant, is visible at our feet. 4th Stage, Gauwara {8 hours). — Hoad a continued descent the whole way over hill ravine torrent and brake through an oak forest round several abrupt projections from the east face of the Delahu crest. Also passed through several rich valleys, the principal of which are Nerijeh, Darawais, Girga- wan, Bindar, Biyamah, and Dasht-i-Mort. Route to Sulaimaniah — The stages were given thus to SulaimaDiab— (1) Sherkala, 4 to 5 hours. (2) Hourin or Shaikhan, 6 hours p.. , p,. ,, . w &gt; Gross Lhala Kiver on this stage. (3) Hallebji, 7 „ ■&gt; ° (4) Shahr Azul, 8 „ (5) Sulaimaniah, 9 „ The Jaf Kurds who had come this way said there were no villages or supplies obtainable this side of the Diala, and that the river was difficult to cross this season. 4rom Hallebji to Sulaimaniah were several villages, and supplies obtainable. Hourin is a very small village. This country has been entirely depopulated by Hamawand raiders, and now may be said to have no settled population. Nomad Kurds pasture in the plains in the winter. r ihe climate of Zohab plain was said to be very unhealthy in the summer months. 5th May.—General direction W. Leaving Zohab (2,100') we started south-west across the grassy plain following the left bank of the Chemisahu. A few clusters of reed huts were passed and some fields of wheat and barley. The wheat crop will be ripe in another month. The stream runs in a broad gravelly bed bordered by oleanders, and at 2^ miles the ruins of a large village called Kufi Zohab were passed on the banks. The path led through splendid grass and clover, which reached up to the horse’s knees. At 5 miles entered a gap in the low rounded hills which skirt the plain to the south-west, and followed a small stream. The Chemisahu passes a similar gap 1 k miles farther to the north, and flows into the Diala.The path was easy, over stony undulations; the soil becoming conglomerate with occasional ledges of sandstone (1,920'). To the north the ridge gets high and rocky, and the ranges run in the direction of the Diala. At 10 miles emerge oh a barren undulating plain, crossed by several low sandstone ledges, cut up by small ravines. The road is easy over this gravelly soil. A similar country extends northward to the Diala valley, which can be seen in the distance. At 14| miles rejoin the main road from Sir-i-Pul and follow it to Kasr-i- Shirin. The road is almost level and winds through gaps in the sandstone ridges, which rise from 40 to 50 feet and cross the plain in all directions. From 2 to | mile to the left is the valley of the Alwand, bordered by gardens and a few 1 rees. Patches of wheat were grown on these undulations, and it ripened well in this light gravelly soil without irrigation. We passed several portions of an old wall made of blocks of sandstone about 6 feet square, and an ac- quoduct cut in the rock. Two miles before entering Kasr-i-Shirin (1,410 ), to the north of the road, were the ruins of the palace of the Sassanian king, Khosrau Parviz. Kasr-i-Shirin.—K asr-i-Shirin is a place of 400 houses on the right bank of the Alwand with a masonry fort or loopholed barrack on a spur over looking the river, in which 100 Sarbaz were quartered. On a spur at the other side of the village is a loopholed building about 50 yards square which was built by Jan Mir, a Hamawand chief, who two years ago had the guardianship of the frontier placed in his hands by the Persians; he was a noted robber, and was placed there on the piinciple of setting thief to catch a thief He still kept on his evil practices, and committed several daring robberies, while the frontier was always disturbed, so that an emissary was sent from Tehran with a small force who invited Jan Mir to an interview, and then had him treacherously murdered. His followers fought desperately, and were dispersed with difficulty. His son is now said to be imprisoned at Isfahan. The frontier districts are at present fairly quiet. Sarbaz from the Guran Kurds at Juanro and Gauwara are employed here, and in the watchtowers along the road to Sir-i-Pul. Jan Mir’s house is now unoccupied. The walls are some 4 feet thick at the base with a banquette and loopholes along the top. Jan Mir intended making a bazar in Kasr-i-Shirin covered with masonry arches like in Baghdad, and had half completed it. There are lar^e courtyards attached to the houses in which caravans stop. On the left bank of the river are a row of .gardens and the ruins of a large serai. Another new serai was being built of mud and stone opposite the gate of the fort. The Alwand is 40 to 50 yards wide and 2' to 3' deep with a rapid cur rent. It can be forded by people wishing’ to cross to the gardens on the far bank. The main road keeps along the river bank to Khanikin, the next stage in the Baghdad direction. Weather sultry, with hot winds from the north-west. Temperature noon 92°. 4 p.m. 91°. 6 p.m. 82°, and 78° at 7 a.m.68 Route No. V.—Kermansliah to Mosul via Kasr-i-Sliirin and Kifri. 7lh to 9tli May. Stages. Hours march ing- Miles.

As far as Kasr-i-Shirin the road has already been described ; the present route describes the stages to Kifri. From Kifri the post road to Mosul through Kirkuk and Arbil is followed. This would be the easiest line for a railway g'oing direct from Mosul to Kermanshah with a branch from Kifri to Baghdad 7th May—General direction west-north-west. Left Kasr-i Shirin (l^K)') and started in a direction 258° over an undulating gravelly country cut up by several dry ravines. We gradually ascended a range of low undulating hills 4 miles distant from Kasr-i-Shirin. From the summit (2,02.0') descended an easy path following a long gravelly spur. And at 7 i miles reached a broad watercourse, one of several on this slope, in which flowed only a small stream. In the valley we passed a few reed huts of the Benshira, a Turkman tribe who were cultivating a few patches of Indian-corn and wheat. They talk Turkish. At 10| miles passed a line of round towers about 1^ miles apart which mark the Turkish frontier. The general direction of the frontier line runs 197° and 341° along a line of low undulations. In each tower are 10 zaptiyahs posted* from Sulaimaniah. They com plained of many hard struggles with Hamawand raiding parties, and no pay for the last year. The track is ill-defined, and but little used. These low hills are passable at any point for artillery. Murkus .—At 12^ miles halted at a small frontier-post called Markus (1,045'). This is a Turkman village of 80 houses, and close by is a strong brick building, 30 yards by 20, with an upper tier of loopholes, and two 'circular flanking towers. The walls are about 4 feet thick at the base. A Yuzbashi and 50 zaptiyahs were quartered here ; who also told of many attacks by Hamawand raiders, but the frontier is now fairly quiet. They complained of 18 months* arrears of pay. Water-supply is from a karez; wheat and barley is grown on the low hills, and patches of rice in the valleys. Large herds of cattle, sheep, and goats seen. Most of the grass is withered now. Weather sultry with a thunderstorm and a few showers; temper ature 91° at noon, and 71 u at 5 a.m.8th May.—General direction, N.W. Left Murkus and started towards the Diala. Crossed the wide gravelly channel of a stream at the edg'e of a small plain now almost dry. Then ascended a low range of undulations which separated us from the Diala valley. At 7J miles reached Salahi, a large village in the river valley. On a hearing of 26° some 5 miles distant the Diala emerges from a gap in the hills, and spreads out into a wide channel. On the left bank is a thickly cultivated district, 3 to 4 miles wide, extending south-west for a c; nsiderable distance. A large canal starting from the gap in the hills waters this plain. On the right hank are a succession of low hare undulations; with no canals and only a little cultivation. Finding no raft to be obtained at Salahi, we had to make a wide detour to the south, and finally found the means o£ making one at Shaikh Said, 5 miles further down. Several large villages, Hamrala, Shaikh Said, and others, were visible down the valley surrounded by a few orchards. There were six mills close by, each with a tall watch tower attached. Some tumuli and marks of ruined villages were seen, and the houses in the villages were built of bricks excavated from these. This district has suffered a great deal from Hamawand raiders. Many mined houses in every village, and Shaikh Said half in ruins. The inhabitants are Bagilans, a sort of half Arab, half Kurd, wearing the Arab head dress ; they are to be found all down the Diala valley, and talk Arabic and Kurdi. At 15^ miles we halted on the left bank of the Diala and commenced constructing the raft. Diala Kiv»r.— At the point where we crossed (TBS'), the river flows in a stony bed about 1 mile wide, the water straggling over several channels. On the left bank was a belt of osiers and sedges, i mile wide with several muddy inlets, difficult for loaded mules. The right bank was firmer ground, a series of conglomerate cliffs, 25 to 30 feet high. We forded two-thirds of the way, across the smaller channels, and reached a gravel bank on the main channel near the right bank where we put the raft together. The “ kalak,” or raft, was a reed framework, 7 feet square, supported on 10 inflated sheep skins, pushed and steered through the water by two men who swam behind. The current was rapid and in flood, and the raft was taken down 600 yards each crossing: the mules and horses swam. The river is fordable in the autumn at several points, but the channel changes from year to year, and the points of crossing also. These rafts are very unsuitable ; the skins require constant mending and blowing out, and to be kept always wetted. Larger rafts of 150 or 200 skins could be used for crossing troops and guns. On leaving the right bank and going 4^ miles in a northerly direction, over a bare gravelly plain, we reached Shaikh Said, a Bagilan village, in a small cultivated basin, 3 to 4 miles wide. A few small canals were seen, and wheat and barley in small patches. This plain, which extends to the north-east of the village, is the favourite winter camping ground of the Jaf Kurds, a very large tribe who migrate into Persian territory for the summer. They had left this neighbourhood about a fortnight previous. On a bare knoll on the left bank is a large stone building; the winter residence of Muhammad Pasha, the Chief of the Jafs. He lives in Sulai- maniah during the summer. It is sc bleak-looking place, with a round tower70 at each corner and a great number of long windows. Muhammad Pasha is a man of considerable influence in Sulaimaniah and these districts. To the north-east, under a range of low bare hills, 5 miles distant, could be seen some ruins white and staring against the bare hillside. The Diala is also known as the Ab-i-Sirwan, which is its name in its upper course. The frontier follows the course of the river from where the line of towers meets it. A good wheat season was expected this year, but the locusts have done a good deal of damage. Weather sultry with thunder clouds hovering round ; temperature 80° at 5 p.m. and 65° at 5 a.m. 9th May—Left Shaikh Said (920') and started in a westerly direction over a bare gravelly plain, 6 to 8 miles wide. It grows good grass in the spring time but is withered now. Several small dry ravines were passed. Gok Su .—At 5f miles we crossed the Gok Su, a stream in broad gravelly bed, about 200 yards wide. Along the right bank is the Jabal Khushka, a low range of gravelly hills cut up in all directions by small ravines rising about 400 feet above the plain. The more direct road to Kifri led up the valley of the stream; we tried a shorter way and eventually got lost and made a wide detour to the south west. Prom the stream bank followed a path which led over the rounded summit of the Jebel Khushka (1,290') and commenced a long gradual descent up and down among small ravines. A little water was found in some of the ravines and several low parallel ridges of sandstone appeai’ed in the conglomerate soil. At 17 miles we reached the fertile valley of Chenimassir, 2 to Smiles wide (875'), growing fine crops of barley and wheat. A small stream flows north-east down the centre of it and the south side of the valley is bounded by a low range of gravelly hills, the Jabal Diwanza Imam, similar to that which we had just crossed. On it was the ruined village of Rahimurka, roofless and destroyed by Hamawand raiders. Prom here we turned north towards Kifri, passing a large encampment of Bagbilan Kurds engaged in cultivating the plain. Durkhava River .—A wide gap occurs in the Diwanza Imam Range through which the Durkhana River passed, and the ridge then continues north west under the name of Jabal Khurreh. Distant miles from Chenimassir we reached a broad well-defined track, the main road from Baghdad to Mosul through Kifri. We forded the Durkhana River, in two wide channels flow ing from a gap in the Jabal Khuskha 4 miles south-east of Kifri. Farther on forded two other channels of theChechapan River, from 300 to 400 yards wide, full of shingle and stones. The soil of the plain is fertile, and grew good wheat crops. At 26| miles from Shaikh Said we halted in Kifri (760'). Kipri.—K ifri is a place of 6,000 inhabitants (1,200 houses), situated at the mouth of a small gorge through which the Chechapan River emerges and surrounded bj r a low mud wall in a bad state of repair. Round the town are a few gardens of date and fruit trees with two large patches of gardens outside; with these exceptions the plain is quite bare of trees. The Baghdad-Mosul telegraph line passes through here, and there is a telegraph office. The bazar is small and covered in, with a fair amount of supplies, flour, dates, dried fruits, &amp;c., procurable. The houses are of stone and mud, with flat roofs. There are few two-storied masonry houses on the south side built of lime and gypsum from the hills close by.There is a good stone serai on the north side outside the town. A Kaim- makam lives here, and just now 500 Regulars were encamped on the plain to the south. They had 300 very fine mules, some of them nearly 15 hands, which they used for riding, and formed a sort of mounted infantry for the protection of the post road. There were some 50 zaptiyahs as well. The road is much infested by Hamawands and various other robbers. The inhabitants of Kifri are mostly Kurds, but include a few Arabs and Jews. r lhe Kurdish white felt coat with long sleeves was generally worn with the Persian conical felt cap “ Kulah namdab” and blue trousers. Overlooking the town from the north is a steep ridge of sandstone and gypsum 300 to 400 feet high running 298° and 130°, merging to the south east in the Jebel Khushka, and skirting the plain for some distance to the north-west. On the 10th the weather was clear with a few clouds. Temperature noon 84 j . In the afternoon it clouded over and rained heavily till midnight, with a strong wind from the north-west. Temperature 65° at 6 p.m. Between Kasr-i-Shirin and Kifri, by the route we followed, there are no obstacles for the passage of troops except the Diala River, which would have to be bridged at this time of year. With pontoons or trestle work this could easily be done. r lhe remainder of this route to Mosul follows the post road from Kifri, and has been several times described by travellers. The stages are— Tuz Khurmatu Taouk Kirkuk Altun Keupri Erbil Kulak Mosul .. 24 miles. .. 21 .. 25 .. 27 99 .. 30 „ .. 33 „ Total ... 182 „ Kifri to Mosul. The total distance from Kermanshah to Mosul by this route is 316 miles* Through Sulaimaniah and Koi Sanjal?it is also 346 miles, but the road is con siderably rougher, and there are several difficult points for guns {see Colonel Bell’s Turkey in Asia) ; so distances being equal, the former is far the best to take. The road from Kifri to Mosul has been several times traversed by Turkish troops and guns. Route No. VI—Baghdad to Sulaimaniah via Kifri and the Zagirma Pass. This route follows an almost direct line joining the two places. Prom Baghdad as far as Kifri the Mosul post road is followed and is well known, but from Kifri to Sulaimaniah the road is hardly ever used, owing to its passing through the country of the Hamawand Kurds, whose raiding parties keep the whole country in a state of terror. It is an old trade route, and presents few natural difficulties. The route to Sulaimaniah at present used by caravans lies through Kirkuk.11th to 14th May. Stages. Hours marching. Miles.

Left Kifri (760') and crossed the broad bed of the Chechapan and followed a narrow track through the gap in the hills to the north of the town. For the first 6 miles the road led through mounds of gravel and loose stones, crossed at intervals by low sandstone ridges, running north-west to south-east. The track was abroad easy one, and led through occasional gaps in these ridges. The Chechapan river to the left could be seen between the mounds as it flows in a narrow valley, shut in by the hills, bordered by fruit gardens. A little cultivation and a few huts were noticed on the bank. The road emerges from these sandstone ridges into an open undulating country, dotted with gijpvelly mounds, which gave the appearance of the waves of a sea from the distance. We crossed several small streams in the ravines flowing into the Checha pan, and some good patches of wheat in the ravines. Kohmurmil .—At 8 miles passed the small village of Kohmurmil. The inhabitants, as soon as we came in sight, collected, mounted and armed, on a small mound, apparently thinking we were a party of Hamawands. Two boys were discovered crouching under a bush in a great state of terror. The country is almost depopulated from the fear of these raiders, and the villagers have constantly to be on the alert. Kochachapan Plain .—The Kochachapan plain (1,200'), a broad undulating plateau looking bare and burnt up now,‘lies immediately to the north-west of Kohmurmil. Paoudiyeh Plain. — On the other bank of the Chechapan, and about 3 miles distant, was a similar plateau called Daoudiyeh. No villages were visible; as their usual position was out of sight in some deep ravine. At 13j miles the head-waters of the Gok Su were seen again to the right, and a wide plain stretches down towards the Diala. At 15 miles crossed some vertical sandstone strata which cropped up here and there. This soft gravelly soil is cut up by small ravines with very steep sides. Some green grass still remains in the hollows. Khan Surkhali .—At 16 miles we passed Khan Surkhali (1,440'), a ruined serai, once used as the first halting-place on the caravan road from Kifri. At 19| miles crossed a large stream, the head-waters of the Chechapan river. The road is rough and steep in places owing to the numerous small ravines. A little cutting and levelling, would soon make a road passable for guns. Not a single village was seen or any one met along the road, and the country seemed absolutely deserted. •73 m 3'52 2'60 270 crossed )ugli tie stones, h-east. these s as It, ins. ^ tie road f, dotted sea from mil, The on a small boys were e countr/ gers hare mdalafos tb-west ot iut3 mto isible i as the right) ropped 'P very step a rninsi :fri. Chechapaa irons small assable fe At 2.51 miles there is a steep descent and ascent crossing* the narrow deep valley of a tributary of the Ak Su (IjSlO 7 ). On ascending from the valley the Ak Su could be seen flowing in a deep rocky bed about i mile to the left. Several sandstone ledges crop out here, but are easy to cross. An easy descent now began over some rounded gravelly spurs, which brought us at 30 miles into the Ak Su valley, close to the village of Ibrahim Khanji, now deserted, the inhabitants having moved into tents further up stream. The village stands in an open grassy basin about a mile square, bordered by low rounded hills. Below the river enters a narrow rocky valley. This river emerges into the Tigris valley near Tuz Khurmatu, and forms a large tributary of the Adhaim. It was swollen by recent rain, and I was carried away horse and all by the current in searching for a ford. The mules eventually found an easy crossing | mile further down. There is another ruined village and some ruins of a serai on the right bank. Down stream the valley narrows, and is bordered by some earth cliffs 100' to 150' high. From the ford the track kept along the right bank, and 1 | miles further up we crossed at a difficult ford, 100 yards broad and 2 ' 6 ' deep, with a rapid current. On reaching the left bank, we passed through another deserted village. The general insecurity of the country and Hama- wand raids has caused these villages to be thus deserted. Shaikh Hassan’s Camp .—The road still follows the river bank, skirting the foot of some low undulations which border the valley, and at 34 ^ miles we forded again. On the opposite bank we halted and encamped with some Jaf Kurds, who had left Ibrahim Khanji, and had pitched their tents here. The country here belongs to Shaikh Hassan of Kirkuk who owns eleven small villages in the vicinity. These are miserable, half-starved looking people; notorious thieves, stealing from each other or passers by. Some good grazing was to be had along the river banks, and the grass has been improving since leaving Kifri. In another fortnight it will be quite withered. A few supplies (bread, eggs, milk, and fowls) were procurable. Weather today fine, except a few showers at sunrise. Temperature 63° at 5 p.ivr. Steep earth cliffs border the river valley, and the soft soil is cut up in all directions by small gravelly ravines. 12 th May —General direction, N.N.E. Found the two zaptiyahs from Kifri had fled in the night. W 7 ith great difficulty we obtained a Kurd as a guide as far as Sulaimaniah, and then left camp, heading in a north-north east direction, leaving the river valley almost immediately. This stream rises in the Kara Dagh. The road on leaving the valley ascends a short steep incline in a ravine, winds along a neck between two deep valleys, and then keeps along an easy clay track between low mounds and flat-topped ridges of sandstone. To the right, in the direction of the head-waters of the river, the country is scored by several deep ravines. The sandstone strata are here horizontal, interlaid between conglomerate soil, which gets eaten away easier by the weather, and consequently leaves the rock formed into curious flat-topped ledges. We passed several small springs in these ravines, each denoted by a little clump of oleanders. Cluazarin Su .—At 6 miles, after a sudden steep descent, we reached the Chiazarin valley (1,420'), containing a large stream flowing 125° towards the Ak Su. The valley is 5 mile broad, and comes from a direction 315°. A few patches of cultivation, but no villages were seen. The stream below this VOL. I t74 is bordered by steep earth cliffs and there is an easy ascent to a wide grassy plateau almost level, with a few flat-topped ridges of sandstone. At 12 miles entered a wide gap in a bare sandstone range, which has been visible for some time in front of us, and which rises 600' to 700' out of the plain, running 320° for about 4 miles, and 140° for 1 5 miles. The gap is 200 yards wide, and at the entrance is a tumulus and the site of what was once a large place judging from the foundations of the houses and large stones strewn about. There are also the ruins of a serai. We passed through the gap, and ascended steeply a small ravine alongside a stream fed by numerous springs in the hill side. The rock has now changed to a soft white limestone, very porous, and seems full of cavities to absorb the water. Kalachuk .—On a projecting spur to the right, we passed a ruined fort called Kalachuk (1,985'). It was evidently built to command the gap in the range, and is in a good position to do so. Hatla Dagh .—The road ascends gradually a grassy plateau with a wide ravine to the right. On the other side runs a steep rocky ridge called the Hatla Dagh south-east direction towards the Diala. There is abundance of fine grass and clover and this would form a good camping ground for troops. Water obtainable from numerous small springs. GoJc Tepe Ziarat .— At 19^ miles we reached the top of the incline (2,715'), and passed the small ziarat of Gok Tepe on a mound to the left. There is a sharp descent following the side of a narrow ravine, 340' deep, flowing into a larger ravine, on the far side of which (2,400'), perched on the edge of a cliff, stands Gok Tepe village (23 miles). Gok Tepe .—Here again we were mistaken for a party of Hamawand rob bers, as, on turning the end of a spur opposite the village, we found the cliff lined with villagers, who opened fire as we came into sight. On the mules arriving, the villagers became aware that we were not the dreaded Hamawands, and the firing stopped. The headman came forward with profuse apologies, and said the Hamawands had been raiding in the district on the previous afternoon, hence they were on the alert. The Hama wand method of attack is to advance at a gallop to close quarters, and then commence firing, following up with a second rush, which usually carries the village. Gok Tepe is a small village round a mosque, on the edge of a very fertile grassy plateau, 2 to 3 miles wide, which runs south-east between the Karadagh and the Hatladagh towards the Diala. On the north-west and west is a rapid descent, broken by several very deep ravines, towards an undulating plain in the direction of Kirkuk. Karadagh Range .—Three miles distant to the north-west is the Karadagh, a very steep, impassable ridge, which runs north-west and south-east in a direction 130'’, and extends from the Diala almost to the Lesser Zab in one unbroken line. The southern slope is a rocky wall rising abruptly out of the plain. There are three passes through this range— ( 1 ) The Sagirma, which we cross in tomorrow’s stage, and which goes over the summit of the ridge. (2) The Bazirra pass, 6 miles north-west of the Sagirma. This follows a small stream through a deep rift in the range. The streams from the Temar and Risholan districts flow through this. (3) The Bazian pass, ‘further to the north-west. This is the principal dip in the range through which the Kirkuk-Sulaimaniah road passes. This is the easiest of the three passes.75 Abdur Rahman Pasha, a former governor of Sulaimaniah, in an endea vour to make his districts independent, fortified all these passes. A Kurd led the opposing forces over a narrow footpath, which turned the Basianjpass, and Abdur Rahman was defeated. The remains of the wall and fortifications then erected can still be seen at the top of the Sagirma pass. Route to Kirkuk .—From Gok Tepe to Kirkuk is two stages of nine hours each, Leilan being the intermediate stage. The country is a series of low undulating gravel and sandstone hills cut up by numerous ravines. Supplies are obtainable at Leilan, and between that and Kirkuk, but none on the first stage. Weather has got gradually cooler as we enter the hills. Cloudy today. Temperature 69° at noon; 55° at 6 a.m. A heavy thunderstorm, with wind and rain, came on at 8 p.m., lasting about an hour. 13th May—General direction, N.E. Bearing 66° is a prominent conical peak of the Kara Dagh, rising to the south of the pass, and forming a good landmark. Leaving the village, we crossed a grassy plateau skirting the edge of a deep ravine to the left. Sagirma Pass .—At 3 miles reached the foot of the pass (2,690'). From here to the summit is 4 miles and the total ascent is 1,740'. The ascent is a fairly uniform gradient, with the exception of two short steep bits about half way from the foot. There is no attempt at making or improving the road. Some longer zigzags, which could easily be cut in the clay and loose stones, would make the pass practicable for field artillery. There is a good view from the summit (4,430') towards Kirkuk over a per fect sea of gravelly undulations and ravines. From here the course of the large stream could be traced flowing through the plain towards Tauk. It is the main branch forming the upper waters of the Adhaim river and rises in the district north-east of the Karadagh, passes through the Derbend-i-Bazirra, then makes a wide sweep round the foot of some spurs from Gok Tepe plateau, and flows in a wide gravelly channel west towards Tauk. It crosses the Mosul road just south of that place, and then turns south to join the Tigris. The Ak Su rises in the south-east end of the Hatla Lagh, flows past Ibrahim Khanji, and joins the Adhaim near Tuz Khurmattu. Tang-i-Kalakh .—The descent from the summit is broader and easier than the ascent, and quite practicable for field guns. The road follows a wooded ravine by the side of a small stream, and the hillside is thickly covered with low oaks, hawthorn, and shrubs. At the foot of the descent the road passes through a narrow rift in an outlier of the main range known as the Tang-i- Kalakh (3,210'). The rock strata here are vertical and of grey limestone and overhang the road in a remarkable manner. The track through the rift, 100 yards long, follows the bed of a small stream and two small stone bridges carry the road over the bends of the stream. The pass is barely 10 yards wide, and the road 8 feet, and some boulders would require removing to pass guns through. The lower slopes of the Karadagh are thickly wooded with fine oaks, and the hillsides are dotted with vineyards. Abundance of good grass, mostly clover, at this season. Dolan and Karadagh are villages to the north and south of the entrance of the pass. l 276 On leaving the Tang-i-Kalakh, entered a broad valley filled with low gravelly hills, which run eastward as far as the Gilzerda Dagh. Looking back at the northern slope of the Karadagh, the summit was a series of enormous cliffs, cut up by deep wooded ravines. Except at the pass, there is no path on the right or left. The low hills we are now crossing form the watershed of the streams draining north into the head-waters of the Adhaim river through the Derbend-i- Bazirra, and those to south into the Diala. The road winds up and down over these gravel hills, and at If | miles descends steeply into the Risholan and Temar valley. At 17^ miles Temar village was reached, where we halted. Extending W.N.W. lay a fertile valley 3 to 4 miles wide, which we had skirted during the latter part of the stage. A large stream ran down the centre towards the Dei’bend-i-Bazirra. To the north of the valley was a line of low rounded hills, spurs from the higher range of the Gilzerda Dagh, which lay to the east, and separated us from the Sulaimaniah plain. The lower slopes of these hills were grassy and thickly wooded, and a few Kurd encampments were along the foot of them. ftisholan and Temar were the only villages visible. The district, although fertile has a very deserted appearance owing to the disturbed state of the country. No one was seen or met the whole of this stage. Temar is a small village of flat-roofed huts, with the tops thickly covered with grass, so that, until close, the village was invisible against the green hill side. The walls are of sun-dried brick or stones set in mud. It is hidden away in a small side valley of great fertility; the slopes are covered with vineyards and fruit orchards, growing pears, apples, mulberry, peaches, apricots, and plums; wheat, rice, and tobacco also. Only sufficient ground was culti vated to supply the bare necessities of the village. Some large herds of cattle and sheep grazed on the hills near. This valley would make a good camp ground for a large body of troops. Water and grass abundant now. Supplies of sheep and cattle would be obtainable from the nomads. Opthalmia was very prevalent ; otherwise these Kurds were a very fine stamp of men. 14th May.—General direction, N. Left Temar (2,945') and started up the head of the valley along a rough track, crossing several small clay ravines. Gilzerda Dagh .—At 2 miles commenced the ascent of the Gilzerda Dagh, a range parallel to the Kara Dagh, but not so high, and more rounded along the summit which bounds the Sulaimaniah plain to the south-west, and runs 296° and 150°. The road in the ascent makes a bend to the south round the head of a small ravine. It is a 10' ledge, and is an easy gradient. At the summit (3,670') it passes through a broad dip in the range, and a steep rough track descends by Gilzerda village, going in a direct line to Sulaimaniah. We took an easier route, making along incline parallel to the range to the south-east. There is an easy gradient, except near the foot of the slope, where for some 300 yards are some steep zigzags and portions of paved road were met with, the remains of a former road. To pass guns over this range there are several places where the road has been worn away by the rain, but they are capable of being repaired.From the foot of the Gilzerda Dagh a grassy undulating plain extends to Sulaimaniah (bearing 17°) with abroad easy path. At miles from the town the Khanjiru river was forded (1,860'), flowing in a gravelly bed 300 to 500 yards wide. A few irrigation cuts and some rice fields skirted the banks. This plain is extremely fertile, but only a small fraction of the whole is cultivated and it has a very deserted appearance, with scarcely a village in sight. There was plenty of green grass now, and would be for the next six weeks. Several mounds and tumuli marking the site of ancient villages were noticed. To the south-east, on the right bank of the Diala, is the Sharizur Plain, thickly populated in former times, but now full of ruins. At 13! miles Sulaimaniah (2,550') was reached. The last 3 miles were along a well-frequented track. The villages of Balka and Chenimassir were passed on the plain between the Khanjiru and the town. The whole of route from Kifri to Sulaimaniah is quite passable now for field artillery, with the exception of the Sagirma pass, which would require a few hours' road-making, and some of the deeper ravines in the undulating country to the south of it. The plain of Sulaimaniah and the rich valley round Temar would make good camping gi-cunds for troops. Grass, water, and fuel are abundant, and supplies procurable in sufficient quantities.SULAIMANIAH AND SURROUNDING DISTRICTS. Sulaimaniah is a town of 2,500 houses, the greater portion flat-roofed Kurdish huts, with few buildings of any size. The palace, the residence of the Mutasarif, is a ruinous building in the centre of the town, and the barracks are a tumbled down line of buildings of sun-dried bricks. The population, with few exceptions, is entirely Kurdish, this being looked upon as the capital of Southern Kurdistan and is the centre of the district of Sertchinar. There are 100 Jewish houses and some 20 of Christians, who live in a separate quarter about a mile outside the town to the south. The town is situated in a bare, treeless plain; with no gardens, orchards, or any surroundings, and from a distance it has a very bleak appearance. The streets are narrow and dirty ; the bazar is poor-looking, but fairly well stocked with goods. In the shops are chiefly articles to supply the simple wants of the Kurds. The principal manufacture is saddles and horse furniture, shoes and leather work generally, the leather being dyed in various colours. The saddles are made of thick felt numdahs over a light wood framework, and are very durable. Cotton shoes with rope soles, belts and powder horns, and knives also seen. A fair quantity of Manchester piece-goods, cotton kerchiefs, &amp;c., from Bagh dad. Dates, raisins, several kinds of dried fruits, curdled milk, or yaurt, the universal Kurdish drink, also for sale. Lettuces, beans, young almonds eaten green are the vegetables in the market now. Most of the wood for fuel comes from the thickly wooded ridges east of the Pir-a-Magdurin range. Red wine is made here and exported to Baghdad. A few vineyards were visible on the Azmir Dagh slopes to the north-east. The principal export trade with Baghdad is gall nuts and yellow berries used for dyeing and gum tragacanth, tobacco, of which this district produces a good quality, and wool from the flocks of the nomads. All this goes via Kir kuk, the direct route via Kifri being practically never used. The Hamawand robbers are now supposed to be exterminated. Fifty of them were sent to Mosul in chains a fortnight ago. A determined effort has doubtless been made, and the country is fairly quiet in comparison to its absolutely lawless con dition a few years ago. Their chief Jan Mir at Kasr-i-Shirin and Kak Abdulla at Khan-i-Miran have been made away with; but in a few years it is probable new chiefs will appear, and lawlessness become rife again. I met the Mutasarif a month later in Mosul, called thereto receive a decor ation and a great flow of praise for his skilful conduct in putting down the rebels. Mosul merchants, however, on the other hand, complained of constant robberies which still went on, and the general insecurity of the Sulaimaniah road. There are four regiments of about 400 men each quartered in Sulaimaniah, besides a large detachment of zaptiyahs. The regulars were a fine body of men, but with uniform in rags and pay uncertain. They were armed withMartini Peabody rifles: this was necessary if they were to cope with the Hamawands, who are armed with the same weapon. There is a Persian Consul here. The telegraph, a single wire, goes from here to Kirkuk, where it joins the main line from Baghdad to Mosul. The water-supply of the town is very good, and is from some large springs bubbling out of the gravelly soil on the outskirts of the town. There is a very fine bath, where one of these springs is utilized and five serais in the town. The climate now is very pleasant with the temperature 68° at noon, but in another month the weather commences to get hotter, and July and August are the hottest months. Very little snow falls on the plain, but the routes leading into Persia are partially blocked in winter. Routes from Sulaimaniali. The principal trade route with Baghdad is through Kirkuk, although the more direct one lies over the Zagirma pass. The stages are— (1) Camp after six hours. The villages are mostly deserted. (2) Chemchemal, eight hours. (3) Kirkuk, eight hours, making a total of about 65 miles to Kirkuk and 252 to Baghdad. The Karadagh is crossed by an easy pass, easier than the Sagirma. The telegraph follows this route to Kirkuk. The country from the foot of the Kara Dagh to Kirkuk is a rolling gravelly plain cut up by deep valleys. A few small villages and a fertile grass country lies between Sulaimaniah and Chemchemal. Either Altun Keupri or Kirkuk, both on the Mosul-Baghdad road, can be reached from Chemchemal. This route is very insecure at times from the Hamawands. Mr. Hodgson, a missionary from Baghdad, travelled in September 1886 from Sulaimaniah to Tank, passing through Chemchemal. He says few of the villages marked on the maps are now in existence, and the country is depopu lated by the Hamawand raiders. From Chemchemal to Tauk is a fertile country with numerous streams, but quite deserted. Near Tauk were several stream valleys lined with orchards and gardens. The following is a precis of Rich’s journey along this route : Sulaimaniah to Altun Keupri. 1st Stage, 21st October 1822.—Left Sulaimaniah at 6-30 A.M. Crossed the undulating plain of Sulaimauiah, passing the large village of A1 Bulak on the left. At li miles crossed the Tanjiru or Serchinar river, a small stream in a bed 100 yards wide. On its right bank was Bliaseh village, and, after passing the large village of Bavun Mirdeh, we reached Kilespi or Tepresh at 9-25 A.M., where we halted. This land is watered by a small stream running south-east to join the Tanjiru. Gudrum Mount was just opposite, forming a wall of rock, including north-west and south-east. The west- ern range of hills was visible 1 to 1 ^ miles off, crowned by a crest or line of rock growing higher to the south. Temperature, 2 P.M. 85°; 10 P.M. 59°. 2nd Stage, October 22nd. —Left 6-20 A.M., making a detour to avoid a morass. Soon after 7 we came to the Tasluji Hill, where the line of hills is broadest and lowest, and where the stony crest disappears. After a gentle assent an hour’s ride brought us into the Bazian plain. This is divided down the centre by a line of lower hills than the Karadagh, terminating a little to the south of our road. At 10-20 wm turned south-west to Derghezin, the hills dividing the plain _ making a similar bend, and soon gradually terminating. Derghezin lies under a low range coming from Derbend, and running towards the ridge in the centre of the plain, but leaving an opening in the west ern side of the Bazian plain. At 10-50 reached Derghezin, and halted.80 Temperature, 6 a.m. 56°; 2 p m. 84°; 10 p.m. 64°. 3rd Stage, October 23rd. — Left 6-30 a.m., and proceeded up the valley formed by a small line of hills just behind Derghezin, and another similar one opposite, also coming north-west from Derbend and running to Bazian. At 7-20 traversed the Bazian pass. The strata dip here, and the pass runs through the gap. The outside ridge is a continuation of the Karadagh. North-west of the pass the Karadagh runs for a short distance forming a perpendicular wall • then turning a little west to Chermala Hill, and then more to the west to the Khalkhalan Hill', The Karadagh diminishes in height all the way from the Zagirmapass, where it is highest. Cher- mala and Khalkhalan are inconsiderable; they seem of earth, and their sides are much furrowed. Soon after this the line of hills terminates. Aghjalar is a district beyond Chermala, reaching to the Lessar Zab, and contains ten villages. At 10-30 passed Ghezalan, and after this the level began to rise again, and the road was broken and hilly. At 12-10 halted in Ghulumkowa in the Chouan district. Temperature, 6-0 A.M. 62°; 2 p.m.*84°; 10 p.m. 64°. 4th Stage, October 24th .— Left 6-15 a.m.. and ascended out of the narrow ravine in which Ghulumkowa is situated. Soil is earth and pebbles with ledges of sandstone. The whole tract is thrown up into little hills scoped out into deep abrupt ravines, sometimes cut 60 feet deep by the watercourses. Pass two deep and difficult ravines and the village of Ghnilkowa. Prom here the road wound along the tops of this furrowed and hillocky country. A few fruit trees were seen in the hollows ; otherwise nothing green was seen Gudrum peak was still visible as a landmark. All the streams yesterday and today ran towards the south-east. At 7-30 a road branches off to Kirkuk ; and at 9-20 halted in village of Kafar. Temperature, 6-0 a.m. 50° ; 2 p.m. 88 °. 5th Stage, October 25th. — Left 6-0 a.m. in a direction N. 30° W., and crossed a stream which supplies several villages and a great number of mills, each in a cluster of trees. This valley gra dually widens down into the plain of Gok Dereh. From here we entered a wide p'ain, gravelly soil, but well cultivated. Large villages in every direction. The Kizbir hills were before us stretching from our left, and the plain extended to the foot of them. And to our right was a continuation of broken hilly country we have just left. At noon reached Altun Keupri. The town is not seen until close to it. The Tigris is reached in 18 hours by caravan travelling from here. When the river is full, a raft will go in a day. At this season it takes three days. A force on its way to Baghdad with 18 guns forded here, and found not more than 3 or 4 feet of water along a bank which sloped across the stream. They also forded the gre^t Zab. Kui Sanjak, which lies N. 35° E., is 12 hours on horseback fast walking, and 18 caravan hours. There are two. roads, one of which lies along the right bank of the river, which it quits about six hours from Kui Sanjak. It is broken and hilly all the way, but there is no mountain to pass. Route to Mosul .—To Mosul the most direct route goes north-west up a broad valley from Sulaimaniah as far as Dukhan ferry on the Lesser Zab. From Dukhan the road strikes more west, across a hilly country to Kui Sanjak, and from there to Mosul is over an undulating country. [Colonel Bell’s Turkey in Asia.) The stages are— ( 1 ) Karachatan. (2) Dukhan. (3) Kui Sanjak. (7) Mosul, making a total of 172 miles. (4) Ashkaf Sakka. (5) Arbil. ( 6 ) Kalak (Great Zab). Route to Sihna .—The direct route to Sihna lies through stages are [Colonel Gerard’s Routes in Kurdistan )— (1) Mama Kulan ... (2) Panjwin ... ... ... .„ (3) Merivan ... .... ... ...

It is a very hilly, but fairly easy, road. Route to Sakiz .—From Panjwin a road branches north to Banah, and from there to Sakiz. The stages are [Colonel Gerard) from Panjwin— (1) Serambal (2) Banah ... (3) Kapura ... ... (4) Miradeh ... ... (5) Sakiz Miles, 21 ]3 15 9 17 Total ... 123 Caravans in summer time make two stages from Banah to Sakiz, halting at Miradeh. During January, February, and March, the roads are difficult through snow, though not impassable if kept open by constant caravan traffic. The more direct road from Sulaimaniah to Banah is seldom taken by cara vans. The following is a precis of Rich’s journey through this country in 1822 : Banah to Sulaimaniah. September lOtJi .—Left Banah at 12-30 P.M., crossing the plain in a north-west direction, and entering a narrow valley, with the border hills thickly wooded with dwarf oaks. At 1-45 ascended a small ridge off the road, and at 2-0 reached the small village of Swearwea, where we halted. September llth .—Left village at 7-30 A.M., rejoined yesterday’s road, and continued ascending the valley till 9-0. At 9-30, leaving main road, reached Nweizhgeh, a village on the hill that bounds the valley to the west, where we halted. Road today mostly level and well wooded, principally dwarf oaks and wild pear. Soil slaty and gypseous. September 12th ,—Left at 7-30 A.M., and at 8-0 rejoined yesterday’s route. Soon after we commenced to ascend through a forest of oaks a mountain called Blu which runs nearly north and south. From Banah the slope is very gradual. Not far to the left was Surkin Mountain, rising very abruptly, and running south-east from the summit of the Blu Mountain. On the right and left was a sea of mountains broken and confused. Followed a steep descent leading at once into a deep narrow valley. The country was green and richly wooded, with many villages and patches of cultivation. The line of the mountains was very broken. At 12-30 we reached foot of the descent, and crossed the Banah stream, here joined by other mountain streams. This stream separates Persia from Turkey. It runs north and a little west, and joins the Zab above the Karacholan river. Ascended the far bank of this stream, and at 2-30 reached Merwa in the Aalan district, where we halted. Through a cleft in the Blu Mountain called the Bri was visible Beitush, three hours off by a difficult road. On the face of the mountain opposite Beitush is the Pishder District. To the west of us is a line of hills called Kurkur, apparently running to join that I have just described. On this side of the hill is Shinek, five hours off, and north of it is Ghellaleh. On the other side of the range is Marga (see Route VII), September 13th .—Left Merwa at 7-0 A.M., and immediately commenced ascending towards a curious summit named Gimmo. These mountains abound in springs. At 8-15 reached Deira among a grove of large walnut trees. Left again at 9-10, and continuing the ascent reached the highest part of the ridge in half an hour. On one side the streams ran north towards the Banah stream, and a little further on south to the Shinek stream. This spot is called the Hazir Kenian, or “ Thousand springs.” Above us were Grimo and another peak, bare and stony. We continued travelling under them for some time. Running parallel to us was the Surkin range, a branch of the range above Ahmed Kulwan. It sends a spur from the Sirsir mountain, which sweeps round and joins that on which we now are. South of this is the Kare Kazhav running south-east. The country between is broken hills ascending to either range. Numerous villages are situated on terraces on the hillsides, and a great number of springs. At 2-0 p m. reached the Kenaru village in the Siwell district. Sirsir was due south of us, about a mile off. Our road today lay along the ridge of the Si well Mountain. VOL. I. M82 Septemler 14th.—heit at 6-30 A.M., heading due south, descending a glen to the foot of the Sirsir Mountain. Soon afterwards quitted the glen and crossed the continuation of the range yesterday. We then descended to the Siwell river, which runs by the foot of Sirsir, then north and a little west, and joins the Karacholan at Mawutt, when they both run to the Zab. We forded a broad bed, the channel being 12 to 15 yards wide and stirrup deep. It is frequently unfordable, and has to be crossed on JcalaJcs. The country now became chalky. Descended to Shehribazar plain and observed Pir-a-Magdurin and Giozheh hills, bare and regular like a rampart as far as eye can reach. Soil now sandstone and conglomerate ; the wood diminishing and almost disappearing, except in particular spots. At 8-40 descended a deep valley or ravine into the valley of the Karacholan river, and passe d the site of Karacholan, the old capital of Kurdistan. Halted at Sulimanava, a small garden. This valley is famous for its fruit, grapes, and melons especially, and Sulaimaniah is chiefly supplied from here. The Karacholan river is the same as the Tenguzi, which rises in the direction of Dolidreizh, and runs through the Kari Kazhav mountains. The bed of the Karacholan is i mile wide, and just opposite the old city it receives the Chungura, flowing from Surochik. In winter and spring the Karacholan is a very large river filling its bed. Some way further down was a bridge of wicker work on stone piers. September 15th .—Left at 6-15 A.M., and our road after leaving the Karacholan valley ascended gently the whole way. At 7-30 reached the foot of the Azmir Dagh, and began ascending the steepest part by a very tolerable road zigzagging up the slope. At 8-0 reached the summit, and, after going south for 5 minutes, began to descend. The first part of the descent was not bad; then it ran along the edge of a precipice, where we dismounted. At 8-30 reached foot of principal descent and went south, gently descending a narrow valley, until at 9-0 emerged on the Sulaimaniah plain, which town we reached at 10-0 a.m. Route to KarmansJiah .—This route leads south-east down the valley from Sulaimaniah. It is easy going until the country near the Diala is reached. The stages are [Colonel Bell’s Turkey in Asia)— (1) Mohun ... ... Miles. 25 ( 2 ) Hallabja 20 (3) Nausud ... 23 (4) Distier ... ... ... ... 21 (5) Pawar • •• 8 ( 6 ) Mar-i-Kharwar ... 24 (7) Agha Hassan’s village • •• ... 22 ( 8 ) Guxabun ... 22 (9) Karmanskah ... ... ... ... 9 This makes a total of 346 miles from Mosul and 174 from Sulaimaniah to Karmanshah. Route to Zohab .—Another route lies down theKhanjiru valley, and across the Diala to Zohab. Neither are used by caravans owing to the disturbed state of the country. Kurds round Sulaimaniah. Hamawand Kurds .—The Hamawands live in the low hills to the north and west of Sulaimaniah. They have no regular villages; their head-quarters being round Chemchemal and Bazian. They are divided into four sections, each under a chief, viz., Satenasur, Rashwand, Hamawand, and Safrawand. They are mostly nomads, and determined robbers; they are well mounted, some on Arabs which they have stolen from the plains, and are all armed with Martini Peabodys obtained from the Turkish regular’s.They roam over all the country between Sulaimaniali and the Mosul- Baghdad road between Altun Keupriand Kifri. They are said not to number more than 500 families altogether. Parties of them took refuge over the Persian frontier near Zohab a few years ago, but their chief, Jan Mir, at Kasr-i-Shirin, was killed by the Persian Government last year, and the Turks at Sulaimaniah have also made efforts to put them down. At present they are quiet, most of their chiefs being removed ; but they still rob and burn isolated villages, and probably in a few years they will again be to the front. Jaf Kurds.-^-These are a very large nomad tribe, numbering quite 6,000 tents. In winter they occupy the undulating country to the east and north east of Kifri as far as the Diala. Muhammad Pasha, chief of the Jafs, has a large house on the Diala near Shaikh Said (xee Route V), where he spends the winter. In summer he usually stays in Hallabja. Their yailak, or summer quarters, are in Persia on the slopes of the Kuh-i- Chahil Chashma, about midway between Sakiz and Sihna. Snow remains all the summer on these hills, and good pasturage can be found. (See Route XVI.) * r a v In the district round Juanro, between Karmanshah and Sulaimaniah, are a large number of Jafs under Habbi Beg of Juanro. They are Snnis, and talk Kermanji and Persian. In the mountain districts between Sulaimaniah and Banah are several small Kurdish tribes, mostly sedentary. Along the Diala valley north of Khanikin are some villages of Baghilaus and Turkmans.

Left Sulaimaniah (2,550'), and took a broad track leading in a direction N.N.W. across a grassy undulating country, fertile but little cultivated. The valley was bounded on the south by a continuation of the Gilzerda Dagh, and on the north by hills gradually rising to the Pir-a-Magdurin Peak. Sirckinar .—At Sf miles we passed the Sirchinar spring. A stream, 10 yards wide and 2 feet deep, was formed, and came bubbling up out of the gravel soil. The water-supply of the Sulaimaniah plain is remarkably good. m 284 Half mile from the spring (2,245'), the Khanjiru is forded, having come through a gorge in the rounded hills to the right bearing 12° from here. The stream from the Sirchinar spring flows to join the Khanjiru in the centre of the plain. At 5 miles a series of low rounded hills, the first beginning of tlm Pir-a- Magdurin range, commences about 1 mile to the right. The valley is now from 4 to 5 miles wide, and the track was undulating and easy. Several Kurdish camps were passed, which will move from here in about a^fortnight^s time to the hills. At 12i miles a row of four low rocky mounds (2,700') extended across the valley; forming the watershed between the upper waters of the Khanjiru, which flows into the Diala, and the streams to the north-west, which flow in the Lesser Zab. The road skirts the foot of the hills 1 to 1| miles to the right, passing the small villages of Narchu, Hiskani, Darberberu, each situated in a small ravine, with a stream which crosses the road, and surrounded by little patches of fruit orchards. The road is a broad easy track throughout. Yerankoz .—At 18 miles halt at Yerankoz (2,745'), a village f mile to the right, and almost underneath the peak of Pir-a-Magdurin. This summit was still thickly streaked with snow, and was found to be 9,700 feet above sea level and 6,900 feet above Yerankoz. The name is a corruption of Pir Omar Gudrun. This peak forms an important landmark, visible from Tuz Khurmatu, the Gurmanjol pass north of Kania and from near Karind. Several camps of Kurd iliats were passed today with large herds of cattle and sheep. Some caravans with wool were met going into Sulaimaniah. There is good clover and grass on the plain still; only a small portion of the cultur- able ground is used, and the population is small owing to the unsettled state of the country. Weather cloudy and overcast, with a few showers in the after noon. 17tli May—General direction, N.W. Left Yerankoz, and kept north west up the valley. The hills on the south-west side are low and rounded. Several small hamlets, surrounded by fruit orchards, were dotted on the slopes. The valley is here 5 miles broad; the track stony, but easy going. A very steep rocky ridge continues to our right, formed by a long spur run ning north-west from Pir-a-Magdurin. It gradually gets lower, but is im passable all along. Karachatan .—At 4^ miles we passed Karachatan (2,580'), a village with a large orchard, growing fine figs. Water-supply is from some large springs in the hillside. The inhabitants have the reputation of having successfully resisted several Hamawand raids. Sn Sai .—At 8^ miles pass Su Sai, a village, with a few orchards, on a large stream from the range to the right. Soil rich and fertile, but only a small fraction under cultivation. Khan-i-Miran .—In the centre of the valley to the north-west is Khan-i- Miran, composed of a few huts round a good house built by Kak Abdulla, a Hamawand chief, who until two years ago lived here as Kaimmakam of this district. He has now been imprisoned because of the numerous Hamawand raids he instigated, and the district has been merged in the Kaimmakamlik of Sardasht. Tabin Stream. —At 13 miles we forded the Tabin river near a large spring (2,420'), which supplies the greater portion of the stream.The rest of the water emerges from a narrow rocky gorge in the ridge to the right. This spring, from which an enormous supply comes, is another instance of the abundant water-supply of the Sulaimaniah valley. We now reached the head of the valley, which we followed since Sulaimaniah, the end being closed by a rocky cluster of hills with steep sloping sides called the Sarka Kailkusma Dagh. Bearing west, the Tabin river enters a narrow valley bordered by steep hills, and joins the Zab lower down. A track leads by this valley to Kirkuk, two days distant. To the north-east of the Sarka Kailkusma Dagh is the Sardasht valley, 2 to 3 miles wide, which we now entered. The better road leads along the foot of the ridge, but we turned up east to Sardasht, which we reached, at 16 miles, after a rough ascent. Saudasht. —This is a small place of 100 houses, divided into two clusters of houses by a knoll Immediately behind rises the Askut Dagh, a steep wall of rock with a jagged summit, running north-west and south-east, a continuation to the Pir-a-Magdurin range. It rises 2,000 to 2,500 feet perpendicularly above Sardasht—that is, 5,200 to 5,700 above sea level. Near the village is an old fort or enclosure, bounded at the back by the cliff and in front by a loopholed masonry wall 15' to 20'high, with towers at intervals, and encloses a space round a small spring in the centre of about 500 by 400 yards. The interior slopes up, and could be commanded from below and the walls are in ruins, and in places levelled. This was an outpost of the Pasha of Rawanduz's territory when independent Kurdish chiefs ruled this country. A Kaimmakam under Sulaimaniah lives here now. Water is from some fine springs from the foot of the rock, and irrigates some vineyards and orchards in terraces below. Weather cool and pleasant. Temperature 60° at noon. Heavy thunder storm, lasting only half an hour, came on in the evening. This Sardasht must not be confused with another place of the same name on the Persian frontier, about 30 miles to the north-east across the mountains. 18 th May. —General direction, N. Left Sardasht. Started down the valley to rejoin the main road which ran along the bottom. Track rough and stony, crossed by several deep ravines from the Askut Dagh to the right. Gaichina .—At 4| miles pass through Gaichina (2,555'), a small village surrounded by fruit orchards and vineyards in a ravine, part of which had been burnt last year by the Hamawands. Several small clusters of houses were perched on the sides of these ravines. On the slope of the Sarka Kailkusma Dagh six villages were seen on the upper slopes, which are rounded and thickly wooded with low oaks. Khanikhan .— Reach the bottom of the valley near Khanikhan (1,900'), a village in a thick cluster of orchards, and then followed the line of a small stream towards the Zab. We rejoined the valley road through Kan-i-Miran here. Lesser Zab River. —Following a narrow track over some shaly strata, at 10| miles reached the left bank of the Zab. Downstream it bends south-west through a very narrow valley bordered by steep rounded hills. Kala Dukhan .—On the opposite bank are a series of rounded spurs from a ridge higher up, which jut steeply into the water. On one of these is Kala Dukhan, a masonry fort some 50 yards square, loopholed, with around tower at each corner. This was another outpost of the old Pashas of Rawanduz. Dukhan Ferry .—Follow a grassy stretch along the bank, and at 13i miles (1,155') reach Dukhan, where a raft ferry is kept up. Dukhan itself is only a khan surrounded by a few huts.8G The river runs in a pebbly bed 150 yards wide, and about a mile up stream emerges from a narrow rift in the hills called the Dukhan gorge. The stream was in high water now, with a rapid current; with easy shelv ing banks; the valley itself is not more than from 400 to 500 yards wide, bordered by steep spurs from the ridges on either bank. The ferry is a small raft of a dozen sheep skins, capable of taking about 500 lbs. The crossing is assisted by thecuri'ent forming a double backwater. The animals swam without any trouble. Total time taken crossing the party 1 hour and 20 minutes. Some timber rafts about 20' square were moored close by on this way to Baghdad. On the right bank the road bifurcated. So far we followed the principal route through Kui Sanjak to Mosul, but from here our route to Rawanduz branches off. The road to Kui Sanjak leads north-west, rising steeply over the rounded ridge on the right bank. ^ The stages are— Miles. (1) Bogut ... ... ... ... ... 11 (2) Kui Sanjak ... ... ... ... ... 24 The total distance 35 miles, and to Mosul 134 miles. [See Colonel Bell’s Turkey in Asia.) Our track turned N.N.W. over a grassy spur (1,750') jutting from a high rounded range called the Kotsrut Dagh, which lies immediately to our front. The river forces its way through this spur by the Dukhan gorge. A short steep zigzag descent led us into a narrow stream valley, where, 3f miles from the ferry, we halted at the little Kurdish village of Gulnari (1,265'). Gulnari .—The hill slope descending from the spur w^as 55°, and over slip pery rock in places and difficult travelling. The soil is Soft disintegrated shale, so that a good road could be improvised without much trouble. The southern end of the Kotsrut Dagh bears 329° over Gulnari, and is 4 miles distant. The summit of the ridge is about 4,500'. Alongside the little stream were some fig and pomegranate orchards and vineyards on the slopes. These streams swarm with fish, a kind of carp. There is plenty of good grass on the slopes of these hills at this season. A zaptiyah here explained that for three years back he had received no regular pay ; he usually mortgaged his chance of getting any for 20 krans ready money from the Kaimmakam of Sardasht, who pockets all he can get. Fewer rifles were seen in the hands of the Kurds in these districts, although every tribes-man possesses one round Sulaimaniah and in the Hamawand country. The men are armed with long flintlocks of local manufacture, with a curious hexagonal shaped bore. A waist belt, generally of embroidered leather work, carries the powder horn, bullet bag, &amp;c., and a long dagger stuck in the belt completes the equipment. A few mounted men were met armed with the lance, but much more faith is placed now in the possession of a Martini rifle. The rifles are American Martini Peabody pattern, and either have been bought from Turkish regular soldiers, or were served out in the 1878 cam paign to the irregular troops. A few Sniders were seen, and further north some Winchester repeaters.87 The ijfie, when mounted, is carried over the right shoulder, by a very short leather sling with the butt to the front, and steadied by stretching out the rigiit arm, when moving at a trot or canter. Another way is to place it under the upper felt covering of the saddle, and hold it by a pressure of the leg. ^always delivered from horseback : they do not dismount. ay General direction, N. Left Gulnari, and continued down the stream valley until the Zab is again reached. The river valley is about h mile broad, with patches of wheat along the banks. On the opposite bank, in a south-east direction, runs a very rough, wooded valley cut up by the numer ous ravines. At 2 miles left the valley, and turned up over a long rounded spur from the Kotsrut Dagh, a gradual ascent in soft shale soil. lang-i-Skaikh Ismail. Ihe river emerges from another narrow rift or gorge called the lang-i-Shaikh Ismail, which extends in winding direction trom the Marga plain to this, and is 6 miles long. Torba.- At 5i miles we reached the top of the spur near the village of lorba, and opened out a splendid view (1,760'). Immediately below is a wide flat plain 65 to 40 miles long and 10 to 12 broad, across which winds the Zab, entering by the Baba Derbend from rishder valley and leaving it by the Tang-i-Shaikh Ismail. The northern portion is Rania, and the southern Marga plain. Maro-a village bears E.N.E. across the plain, and is 10 miles distant, the river having to be crossed to reach it. Rania bears nearly north, and is 19 miles distant in a straight line. . Kand ^ pagh. — From 300° to 40° extends amass of very high mountains, with summits thickly covered with snow, called the Kandil Dagh. There are no very prominent peaks and the lower spurs o£ this range^commence north of Rama. The Summu is about 30 miles distant from here. Iiom 40 to 85 is a marked dip in the range and a rounded spur of 5,000 to 6,000 feet elevation extends S. S. E. from the Kandil Dagh. This is’one of the ridges on the frontier dividing the Pishder valley from the upper waters of the Zab in Persia. KurJcur Dagh .—From 90° to 118° werea steep mass of hills, with summits streaked with snow, known as the Kurkur Dagh. The principal rocky peak bears 95°, 18 miles distant, and the summit is about 8,000 above sea level. Marga is on the lower slopes of this range, which rise steeply above it. From 120° to 140° the south-east end of the Marga plain is closed by a very rough hilly country intersected by steep jagged ridges and ravines very thickly wooded. From a direction 123 W , flowing down a deep rocky gorge between low wooded hills, flowed the Kara- cholan, a large tributary of the Zab. All this tract of country to the north and north-west of the Pir-a-Mag- durin peak is very wild and impracticable. The end of the Kotsrut Dagh bears 308° from here. The Marga plain, although well watered,'and covered with good grass, presents a very desolated, deserted appearance, and only a few wretched villages were visible in its whole extent. Marga is a village with the residence of a Kaimmakam. Near it are some extensive ruins. Its former importance and prosperity is vouched for by several remarkable tumuli or conical mounds, which mark the remains of old towns and villages dotted about the plain. Descending from the spur, we passed through Torba village. The houses were well built; the foundations and lower portion of the88 walls wei’e of stone, and the uppei’ of sun-dried bricks;the roofs were flat, of fascines, with a layer of earth on top, resting on cross rafters. The Bilbass and the Sin Kurds live in these districts. The largest and most prosperous villages are hidden away in the most inaccessible ravines of the mountains, so as to better escape the Turkish authorities. At 7 miles the plain level is reached. The road turns west, skirting the right bank of the Zab, here a broad rapid stream, flowing over a pebbly bed from 400 to 500 yards wide. Large timber rafts were being prepared to descend the river. This would show that the river through the Tang-i-Shaikh Ismail and the gorge above Dukhan are both navigable. From marks on the rocks at the mouth of the Tang-i-Shaikh Ismail, the water in flood time rose 12 feet above its present level. From here to the junction with the Tigris represents the navigable por tion of the river for rafts. It is possible that stern-wheel steamers of light draught could ascend thus far, and thus utilize the river as a means of com munication. It would be worth attempting when the water is high in spring. On the higher slopes of the Kutsrut Dagh to the left were several small hamlets surrounded by vineyards and orchards. The soil of the plain is a rich black loam, growing an abundance of fine grass and clover, reaching in places to the horse’s knees and the path led through thickets of wild vines and roses, and the grass was dotted with a great variety of brilliant flowers. Snakes were numerous; also a large green horse-fly, which troubled the animals very much. Khudran River. —At Ilf miles forded a large tributary of the Zab called the Khudran, from the north-west end of the plain. It is 60 yards and 3 feet deep, and the ford difficult for laden mules. The head of the plain bears 318° from here, and is closed by a low un dulating ridge 25 to 30 miles distant. Communication is easy in this direction to join the Rawanduz-Mosul route at Koniatman (Route VII). The villages on the plain are poor and wretched looking ; the houses with low mud walls and sloping roofs of reeds. The people look sickly, and com plained of a good deal of fever in the summer months. Gurhushina .—At 14 miles pass Gurhushina, a small village near a tumulus with some large patches of rice round it. We passed through some fine wheat fields as we approached Rania. At 17 miles Bazmusian, at 20 miles Gouluk village was passed, and at 24^ miles Rania reached (1,245'). Rania.—R ania is a place of 300 houses, situated partly on an old tumulus and partly on the plain. On the south side is the Kaimmakam’s house, a two-storied building look ing on a courtyard enclosed by a high loopholed wall. The water-supply is very fine, coming from a large spring at the base of the mound. The inhabitants are Kurds with a few Jews. There is a post of 20 zaptiyahs here. Margaisalso the head-quarters of a Kaimmakamlik. To the south, about a mile distant, is a rocky range rising perpendicular for about 1,500 feet out of the plain, and forming the boundary of the plain. Baba Derbend .—Five and a half miles from here is a rift in this ridge through which the Zab flo^vs called the Baba Derbend. East of the Baba Derbend is the Pishder plain, through which the Zab also flows. It enters Pishder by a narrow gorge in the mountains, from the Persian side of the hills. It receives several tributaries from the southern slopes of the Kandil Dagh, which appear thickly wooded, and cut up by several deep valleys.89 The Pishder plain looks about 8 miles long by 4 broad, and in a direction 2l0^ isb mnded by some low hills. The route from Kui Sanjak to Sardasht lies in that direction. The stages from Kni Sanjak are— (1) Baba Derbend ... ... ,,, ,,, 9 ( 2 ) Beid-i-Sir ... ... ... ... tti g (3) Sardasbt ... ... ... tti _ 5 or about 62 miles. This follows a direct line between Kui Sanjak and Sardasht, up the Pishder valley; over an easy country, almost level, and after Pishder the ascent of the range commences. The last 20 to 25 miles is a hilly, difficult road. Another road, making a hend to the southward from Pishder, and following the line of the Zab, also leads to Sardasht. From Sardasht toLahi- jan, where the main road from Rawanduz to Suj-Rulak can be met, is an easy track along the valley of the Zab. Also from Sardasht to Banah is seven hours along an open road, with the Zab to cross en route. From Banah the road may be taken either to Sakiz (two stages of eight hours, halting at Miradeh), or through Panjwin to Sihna (six stages or 130 miles). The hills on the road from Rania to Sardasht are closed with snow from the middle of December to the middle of March. h rom Mosul to Kui Sanjak is four stages or 100 miles. This makes the total distance from Mosul to Sakiz through Sardasht and Banah about 220 miles. Although not much used as a trade route, it is an important line of communi cation from Mesopotamia into Persia. Sardasht lies on the frontier, and was bunit in a raid two years ago. The Rania and Marga plains would form good camping-ground for a large body of troops. The low ground might be avoided by camping on the lower spurs of the adjoining hills. Fuel plentiful: grass and water is abundant. A fair amount of supplies. 20th May..—General direction, N.N.W. Left Rania, and started in a north-west direction, following a small valley, which gradually narrowed as we went on. At 3 miles it is | mile wide, bordered by steep rocky ridges. Sarkupkan Su. —At 4^ miles we passed a gap about 300 yards wide in the range to the left (1,450'), through which flowed the Sarkupkan Su, a large mountain stream from the head of the valley. It flows 214° across the Rania plain to join the Khud ran. Several donkey loads of firewood were going down towards Rania. In the valley were some fine mulberry trees, this being a large silk-producing district. The hill slopes become more wooded as we ascend, and are covered with low oaks, ilex, and hawthorn. A canal leads water for irrigation from the Sarkupkan down the valley to the plain round Rania. We forded to the right bank and followed a rough track by the bank. Shawar Valley. —This is known as the Shawar valley and is 300 to 500 yards wide at the bottom, while several deep rocky gorges form the ranges on either side. At 12 miles the ridge to the right ceases abruptly ; the main valley of the stream turns north towards a thickly-wooded basin 6 to 8 miles in diameter, intersected by a network of deep ravines, and surrounded by high snow- covered ridges. One route leads up the main stream valley, said to be tvvo hours longer than that we take, which follows a side valley to the north-west. I! Q VOL. I. N9-0 On the left still runs a rocky ridge, increasing in height as we ascend. The summit is a cliff 200 to 300 feet high, and the slopes are thickly wooded. Bnrzvngeh. —At 13g miles reach Burzungeh (2,600'), a scattered hamlet extending about f mile up the valley. The hill slope is cultivated in small terraces fenced in with hedgerows of roses and vines, which twine up the trees. Oak, mulberry, walnut, fig, and pomegranate grow in considerable numbers. The path is narrow and obstructed by trailing vines, briars, and overhanging branches. The little flat-roofed houses, half hidden by the vegetation, are scattered singly up and down the terraces. Water is from several small springs in the hillside. A large quantity of tobacco is grown here, and a coarse kind of silk produced. These are Bilbass Kurds, a fine handsome race, and these secluded villages seem in a flourishing condition. Some large walnut trees were passed. Kala Burzungeh. —Overlooking the village on a spur is Kala Burzungeh, arr old stone fort in ruins, built to defend this pass into Rawanduz. Golan .—At 17 miles we halted in Golan (3,250'), a similar village to Bur zungeh, with houses scattered about on small terraces, and half hidden by the thick trees and orchards. These Kurds wear a short open jacket of white felt without sleeves. The men never do anything except tend the flocks, the women being the chief workers. Their shoes are of cotton ornamented with tufts of wool. Kermanji is generally spoken. One or two men in the village can genei*ally be found to speak Turkish. They seemed a peaceable, industrious people, and received us in the most hospitable manner. Weather clear and bright, and pleasant for marching. Temperature noon 72 Q and 58° at 5-30 a.m. 21 st May—General direction, N. Left the village, and commenced long ascent of a steep ridge called the Gurmanjol Dagh, which lay in front of us. Met a small caravan of 20 mules on their way from Rawanduz and some Kurdish nomads on their way to summer quarters in the Kandil Dagh. Followed a track in a narrow valley with steep grassy slopes ; an easy gradient. At 41 miles elevation 5,200 feet. A few patches of snow were still in the crevasses of the rocks. This was also the “ tree-limit,” above which the slopes were quite bare. About i mile to the west was a perpendicular wall of rock 400 to 500 feet high, along the foot of which we skirt and which forms the summit ridge of the Gurmanjol Dagh. At 4! miles reach the base of the rock wall (5,200 ), and turn north-east, parallel to it, along a fairly level track. To the right are several deep wooded valleys, all converging towards the Shawur valley, and draining into the Sarkupkan Su. Track is a 4 to 6 feet ledge in clay and shaly hillside. At 7 J miles (5,265') turn sharp to the north towards a gap in the cliff, mounting by some steep zigzags : gradient 1 to i. This is easily passable for mountain artillery, and after one mile of struggling up this steep ascent we reached the summit of the pass (5,940'). Gurmanjol Bans. —A good view is obtainable of the Kandil Dagh, and the country to the south. The summits are rounded with few peaks, and the grassy plateaux form a favourite summer pasturage for the Kurds. The peak of Pir-a-Magdurin bears 156°.% 91 Nucheivan -^Eastward is a high snow-covered range, called the Nu- chewan Dagh which connects this with the principal mass of the Kandil Dao&gt;h. i ie andil Dagh summits are about 12,000 feet and the Nuchewan 10,000 teet above sea level. 1 A few patches of snow lie about here still and the young grass is -just ap- peaung. ne camp of nomads had arrived, and were grazing their sheep hio&gt;h up the mountain side. o » re, In the winter snow lies 3 to 4 feet deep at the summit of the pass, and the route is closed for three months—January to March. Probably, if more used by caravans, it could be kept open all the year round. , r°ui the head of the pass we started north-west down a narrow valley, bordered by stony ridges rising 1,000 to 1,500 feet on either side. A small stream gradually increasing in size, keeps down the centre. Tulips, asphodel, rndfn \ i alk w 1 leS -’ rhubar ^ &amp;c -&gt; grow in profusion, and the soil is a ch b ack loam between the stones. A few stunted pear trees were noticed near the summit; but the trees increase in size, and low oaks and hawthorn appear as we descend. ^ eWon r ^-At 15 miles halted on a small open spot by the stream &lt;5,100 ) surrounded by thick brushwood and trees. This is the Nalkewan valley. Mo village near for some distance. Weather misty and cloudy in the morning, with a few showers : temperature 67° at noon. The road from the top of the pass is very stony, over loose jagged pieces of rock. Every shoe soon disappeared from the animaTs feet. 2 2 nd May General direction, N.W. Left camp, and followed path down the valley, l eather cloudy and overcast, with a few light showers at staiting. The path led through a thicket of low trees and shrubs and the overhanging b ranches caught the mule loads as they passed. Pear trees and hawthorn in blossom now. I he valley is about i mile wide, bordered on either side with steep wooded crags. J Rising beyond these are rounded stony ridges, thickly covered with snow at the summits Several rocky glens were passed, down which streams from the snows flowed. In one was the marks of an avalanche which had swept a dear track through the forest, about 300 yards wide, cutting trees close off by the roots, and bringing down huge boulders aud stones. Plenty of firewood dead trees, and branches seen lying about. No one was met, and the country seemed quite deserted. The gradient is easy, but track rough and stony. At miles the stream we have been following makes a bend to the north-west, entering a narrow gorge choked with a thick forest of oaks and undergrowth, and down which no track seems to lead. It is bordered by high cliffs rising 500 to 600 feet on either side. Our track ascends in a westerly direction over a low col, and enters the head of another long valley running down to Rawanduz. At 4 miles we reached summit (elevation 5 210 ') from which a splendid view is obtainable in the Rawanduz direction, the horizon bounded by the snow peaks of the Hakkiari mountains. . To tlie ri g‘ ht and left the view is shut in by steep rocky ridges, topped with a few patches of snow—the Garak Dagh on the left, and the Beni Hindawm on the right. The head of the valley is from 100 to 200 yards wide and for 3| miles down the valley the track is very rough and bad. . It lies through oak forest and thick shrub undergrowth—a narrow path just wide enough for the mule loads. Rough pieces of limestone, honeycombed and jagged at the edges, project here and there, and the ground is strewn with loose stones. The descent is an easy gradient, and by clearing the stones and92 ' filling the rough places, a road, practicable for artillery, could be made in a short time. If more used by caravans, this road would probably improve. ' Most of the trees were well grown oaks, S' to 3 (*' diameter, of the gall- bearing kind. The district is uninhabited, and consequently the trees do not suffer from cutting for firewood. After 7 2 miles the track improves rapidly, with fewer stones and more clay soil and the valley gets broader also as we go on. q The rock strata here are very marked. To the right they slope up from 20 to 25°, and to the left they have been forced into a vertical position, the valley forming the dividing line of these two slopes. Both ridges are well wooded almost to the summit. At 8 | miles the valley is | mile wide. Our path winds over a succession of small spurs from the left. The trees along the lower part of the slopes, as we near the inhabited districts, become more stunted and cut for firewood. The track is broad and easy, and we passed a few patches of cultivation and vineyards. Gurrawan . —At 9 miles rounded a spur and passed through the village of Gurrawan (8,400'), at the mouth of a narrow rift opening from a upper plateau to the west, 6 miles long and 3 broad. A large stream emer^ps from this rift, and is used to irrigate terraces of cultivation, lining the stream for a mile from the mouth of the gorge. In these terraces were a great variety of fruit trees and large ash, oak, sycamore, and walnut; mulberry, pomegranates, figs, pears and apples; vines and roses twining up the trees. The soil seemed capable of producing anything. High up through the gorge to the south-west was an upper plateau, with slopes covered with vine yards and thickly wooded. &gt; . A few small villages were hidden away in the most inaccesible places. Guillau. —On the north-east side of the valley is another similar elevated basin called Guillau, and communicating with this through a deep rift or gorge down which a large stream flows. It is shaped like a crater, about 3 miles diameter, bounded by a circular wall of cliffs 1,000 to 1,500 feet in height, and streaked with snow along the summit : the slopes were well wooded ; a few patches of cultivation and vineyards and two small villages were seen in the most inaccessible and precipitous places. Altogether a most extraordinary place with cliff scenery of marvellous beauty. These people, the Akoyeh Kurds, perch their houses in these out-of-the-way clifts in the mountains so as to be able to defy Turkish authority more easily. In Gurrawan the people looked half-starved and in rags. At first supplies were refused, the people thinking we were Turks, but on hearing we were English, bread, sour milk, and dried fruits, all they possessed, were produced. ff'he road from Gurrawan continues down the valley, crossing several low spurs from the left and is quite passable for artillery if some of the narrower places were widened. Several wooded glens join in from the ridge to the left and some well-tended vineyards were passed, and small patches of wheat. Trees get fewer and more stunted as we go on, although the upper slopes of the ridges are still well wooded. Fickead. —At 13 miles (2,500') Fickead, a small village, is passed. Like Gurrawan, it is at the mouth of a gorge in the hills to the left, through which flows a large stream, irrigating terraces of orchards and vineyards below. The Guillau stream flows along the north-east side of the valley, here £ to ^ mile wide. An old watch tower on a spur, a relic of the times of the independent Kurdish chiefs in Rawanduz, is passed here.The valley widens to 1 mile below Fickead and the road is a broad track, following the stream bank. A broad ridge (2,2.60') closes the end of the valley 2 miles from Rawanduz, up which the road winds by a series of steep zigzags, and the town is not visible until close above it. The stream, which we have been following, passes through this ridge by a narrow gorge 30 to 40 yards broad, bordered by steep cliffs 200 to 300 feet, and joins the Rawanduz river at the east corner of the town (1,500'). After ascending the ridge, the road skirts the gardens above the town, and then down through the paved streets, so steep and narrow that there is barely room for a loaded mule to pass. This route as far as the foot of the Gurmanjol pass is for the most part level and passable for artillery, with the exception of a few miles on the right bank of the Zab near Dukhan ferry. Some road-making and clearing would be required at the Gurmanjol pass and Nalkewan Valley to pass field guns. The wide valley north-west of Sulaimaniah, the plain of Marga, and Rania would make good camp grounds for large bodies of troops. Fuel fodder, water, and supplies plentiful.KAWANDUZ. The town is situated at the end of a spur between two deep narrow gorges formed by the junction of the Nalkewan stream with the Rawanduz Chai from the mountains to the east. The hillside on which the town is built slopes from 2,260 feet at the gardens to 1,500 feet in the riverbed. It is a town of 900 houses : the population is very crowded, and numbers about 6,000. They are all Kurds, with the exception of about 200 Jews and a dozen Christian families. The houses are built on the steep limestone soil of the hillside : the founda tions of the walls for about 5 feet is rough stone work; the upper portion is sun-dried brick, with a roof of beams and wattles covered with 2 feet of earth. The inhabitants in summer sleep on the roofs in a small shelter of green wattles. The streets are very narrow: the houses are built across them in some places, while in others the road goes over the roof. To pass troops through, some of the houses would have to be levelled. Sanitation is quite unknown. The weather in summer is said to be quite as hot as the Mosul plain, and the situation of the place sunk between bare hills would seem to warrant it. Wool, gallnuts, and acorns are the principal exports, and the town being on the main route between Mosul and Persia, large caravans of mules are to be found in the serais. A small bulbous root from which starch is made was dug up on the hillsides and exported. The gorge of the Rawanduz river is the larger, and is called Rhubar, and the smaller the Kalund gorge. The stream through the latter is dry in summer, and the Rawanduz river is then fordable near its junction with the other stream. It is now a swollen rapid torrent, 50 to 80 yards wide, and quite impassable. In the Rhubar gorge the cliffs overhang, and the river is only from 10 to 15 yards wide, and very deep. A wooden bridge of a single 18 feet span crosses it at the west side of the town. It is made of tree trunks, with fascines placed crosswise, covered with a foot of earth, and a paved zigzag road, 10' to 15' wide, cut in the cliff leads up to the opposite bank from the bridge. From the bridge several paths radiate across the undulating country to the north-west. A loopholed gateway overlooks it from the town. The smaller gorge is crossed by a similar wooden bridge of 20 feet span close to its junction with the river. It flows in a rift barely 10 feet wide. The smaller bridge is defended by a portion of the old wall and two loopholed towers. Both the bridges are strong enough to take pack mules easily, but neither of them are safe for field guns. Two miles to the south-east the town is overlooked by the end of the Beni Hindawin range, a very steep ridge rising abruptly to about 8,000 feet, and wooded near the summit! On the right bank of the Kalund gorge are a series of bare rounded spurs from the range further back. These also command the town. A broad track, by which the narrow streets of the town can be avoided, leads over these spurs from near the south end of the Kalund gorge, and joins the main Persian route on the bank of Rawanduz river, 4 mile above the town. This would be the best line for troops to avoid crowding at95 thn bridge (see sketch of country round Rawanduz). The town was once defended by a line of round towers, only one of which now remains on a knoll to the south-east, To the north of the town, on a prominent rounded spur, 1,500 yards dis tant, is a. masonry fort about 50 yards square, with towers at the corners. It is partially thrown down. The road to Sidaka and the Kalashin pass can be seen winding over the spui by this castle. On the right bank of the gorge of the Rawanduz Chai are a line of low-rounded hills, cut up by some deep ravines, reaching as far as the Beni Barrakia range, a steep rocky range to the E.N.E. The general direction of the valley of the Rawanduz Chai is 83°. Rawanduz is a place of considerable strategical importance, as it stands at the exit of the principal pass into Mesopotamia from West Persia, by the valley of the Rawanduz Chai, and also the more difficult Kalashin pass from Urmia through Ushnu and Sidaka. Other roads passing through it are by the Gurmanjol pass to Sulaimaniah (Route Vi I) and from Kui Sanjak, Mosul, Zebari, and Amadiyeh. The town itself is commanded on all sides by hills, and could not well be defended. A very good position, barring the exit of both passes from Persia, is that along the ridge behind the town marked A, B, C in the plan. A central position would be in the gardens above the town across the road down the Serderria pass to the rear, with the flanks on the line of low hills on either side of the gorges, where redoubts could be easily made in the clay soil. The Beni Hindawin range is too steep to be sealed to turn the position. The landscape sketch of the town looking south-west shows this position behind it. North of Rawanduz is an open hilly country for about 15 miles bounded both on the east and west by steep rocky ridges thickly wooded. Rawanduz is a Kaiinmakamlik of the Mosul Waliat, the KaimmakanPs house being in the gardens above the town. On this ridge, near the gardens, were encamped 500 troops. There are no barracks, and they were in dilapidated bell tents, and had been for two years. They are needed to keep the surrounding districts in order. In the gardens is the small village of Kala Teluk. The water on the ridge is from springs, said to be not as good as the river wafer in summer. There is a sulphurous spring on a spur to the east of the town where sick people come and bathe. The hill slopes around are bare : nothing but a few vines are cultivated. The young shoots of a kind of edible thistle, called kungur in Persian and Jca’ub in Arabic, were in the bazar, and are much eaten here. It tastes like cabbage, and is a species of scorzonera or tragopogon. Peas from a kind of wild vetch were also eaten. Mulberries were just ripe—white and black varieties. Rhubarb, used medicinally, gathered at elevations of about 5,000 feet, is also sold. Withies and green fodder were constantly being brought in on donkeys from the Rawanduz river valley. Ai*abic and Persian are understood by merchants and muleteers passing through on the Suj Bnlak-Mosul road; but Kermanji is generally spoken in the town, and Turkish by officials. The decendants of the old Kurdish Begs of Rawanduz still live in the town. Some 50 years ago they were all powerful here, owned the country as far as the Lesser Zab, and raided up to the gates of Mosul. These Kurds are now split up into numerous small tribes. This is a Turkish quarantine station with an Armenian doctor.96 There is a Protestant Christian merchant, Tumao, who does a good deal of trade, and Missionaries from Urmia occasionally pass through here, and one or two Russian merchants every year. On the 23rd the weather in the morning was hazy; in the afternoon clouded over, with a warm wind from the westward : temperature 80° at noon and 83° at 2 p.m. At 9 p.m. a heavy thunderstorm, accompanied by heavy rain and incessant lightning, broke over the town, and kept circling round the hills till past midnight. On the 24th temperature 66 ° at 6-0 a.m., with clear bright weather : temperature 83 ° at noon. Variations of temperature during the day and on different days are considerable at this time of year. The nights are much cooler than the days as a rule. Barometer readings were as follows: 22nd Mat. 23rd Mat. 24th Mat. 25th Mat. 2 P.M. 2 P.M. 9 P.M. 6 A.M. 4 P.M. 8 P.M. 5 A.M.

The principal trade route through liawanduz is that from Mosul to Suj Bulak and West Persia.

Urmia can also be reached by this route through Ushnu and Baraoduz (see Route XIII). The highest point of this route is 6,000 feet. Merchants say that as a rule this route is clear of snow all the year round for caravans, but in severe seasons is closed from two to three months at a time. Route to Vshnu .—Another route into Persia lies over the Kalashin pass to Ushnu, from which point Urmia and Tabriz can be easily reached. I could find no one who knew this route in Rawanduz, and no trade follows it; and it is closed for six months in the year by snow. In Ushnu it was said to be impracticable for mules, but guides were not obtainable. Xo caravans ever took it, but preferred to take a more southern road to Lahijan. The stages were given from Ushnu—(1) Shaikhan, 4 hours ; ( 2 ) Sidaka; a Turkish frontier post, 9 hours; (3) Rawanduz, 8 hours.97 This pass is too difficult for troops; the road in places was said to be so narrow that two people could not pass each other. The following is a precis of this route from Ushnu by the Kalashin pass from Ainsworth. For the remainder of the route Ushnu to Urmia, see Route XIII: Ushnu to Hawanduz. 1st July 1840, 1st stage .—Left in the afternoon, forded the Gader, and passed by Shikar, and then, instead of proceeding direct to Kalishin pass, we turned west to the summer quarters of the. Seruji Kurds, where we halted. 2nd July, 2nd stage .—Started early for ascent of Kalishin pass, which we did on foot. We crossed the first range, and gained a country of less snow and more wood, and with many flocks of sheep and goats feeding on the slopes. We soon came to another range with glaciers, the slope of which created some anxiety. We passed three of these, and a single slip would have hurled a perso n to a great depth. Continued ascent of the Shaikiwa peak over the first mountain and crossed numerous snow drifts ; then a descent through a ravine filled with snow ; then another steep rocky ascent. Elevation of summit of Shaikh Iwa was 10,568 / . (Mr. Ainsworth seems to have turned aside from the regular track to ascend this peak.) Descended from mountain top, and halted for short time at elevation 8,568'. On leaving this, we crossed several large streams, which united in a wooded vale below called Berkhamma. We descended rapidly from here until the region of oaks and acacia was reached. Going at a fair pace at a distance of 5 hours from the halting place, we reached Sidaka or Sidek valley, and rested in the village of Seffuli. (Elevation 3,742'.) The change in temperature and vegetation was very great, reaching here the level of rice and melon cultivation with mulberry groves. Several little villages are scattered along the bank of the Sidaka river or on the hill slopes. Continued our road along the Sidaka valley. Crossed a river from the south-east, 10 yards wide and 3 feet deep, by a bridge, immediately beyond which was a brook and ravine, which latter isolates a bold projection of rock which is washed on the opposite side by the river of Sidaka, and the last mentioned river united. On this projection is Sidaka fort, a square building with round towers at the angles. The village near it contains 100 houses. A wooded open valley unites with the Sidaka valley from the south-east, and the united waters flow into the comparatively open country between Sar Linitka and Sar-i-Burd. Immediately beyond Sidaka commenced the ascent of the Sar-i-Burd, a wooded mountain, and were 5 hours accomplishing nearly the semicircuit of this, which we had to do to gain the vale of Rawanduz. The latter part of the descent of the Sir-i-Burd for 2| hours is carried along a shelving declivity of schists, and cannot be ridden over on mules. We halted a short time at the Christian village of Diana, and then rode along the plain to Rawanduz. This route is quite impracticable for artillery, the two principal difficulties being the snows of the pass of Kalishin and the descent on slates at the foot of the Sar-i-Burd. Route to Rezan. —To Rezan there is a route passing through the Beni- Barakia Dagh, a steep rocky range running W.N.W. from Rawanduz. The valley to the north-west is the country of the Badilia Kurds, through which the Sidaka stream flows to join the Rawanduz Chai. It looks fertile and well wooded, and contains seven villages, the largest being Barakia, 4&gt; hours from Rawanduz. It is two stages to Rezan of 8 hours each—^(1) Mus- ina; (2) Rezan on the Great Zab, or about 50 miles. The first stage passes Barakia, and the road is fairly easy over undulating country. The second is said to be very rocky and difficult, and scarcely practic able for mules. It passes Boratu, Ahmara, and Shirana villages in the Badilia district, and descends into the valley of the Great Zab at Rezan by a narrow pass called the Derbend-i-Khanibaut, at the north-west end of the Beni Barakia ridge. The route we took to reach the opposite bank of the Zab near Rezan is less direct than this, but seems easier. Route to Mosul .—All routes going west from Rawanduz have for the first stage to descend the Serderria pass into the valley of the Ghalifan Su near o VOL. I.98 Koniatman {see Route VIII). From the foot of the pass to Erbil and Mosul the country is easy over low gravel undulating hills. One road leads direct to Mosul, crossing the Zab at Guirdamamish ferry, and another makes a detour to the south through Erhil and the Kalak ferry. Caravans take five days going the former route, the stages being— Honrs.

From Koniatman the road leads over some rough hilly country, easy for mules (Route VIII). Footpaths are said to lead over the Garak Dagh, but none practicable for mules. The following is a precis of the description by Ainsworth of the direct route from Rawanduz to Mosul : Rawanduz to Mosul. 3rd July 1840, 1st stage .—Left Rawanduz, passed the gardens of the town, and made a descent into a deep valley with a gap through the limestone ridge into the bed of the Rawanduz river. Then ascended 1| hours to the crest of the shoulder of Sir Hassan Beg (Garak Dagh). The road then winds down the perpendicular face of the rock so gradually that it may be ridden most of its length. At the foot of the pass the road turns up the ravine of the Pir Hassan stream. In some places vast slips had taken place, and huge masses of rock for a time hid the river from sight; then we came upon a little open space with a base of sand or gravel, while at other times the road was carried with difficulty under overhanging cliffs. At length we reached the open plain, and bivouacked near the village of Pir Hassan (Ghalifan). 4th July, 2nd stage .—Enter an uninteresting country, consisting of the plains and undulating district which extends between the outlying low ranges of hills of the Kurdistan mountains. Pass the hills of Koniatman, wooded with oaks, and then a square castle called Kala Kin, These hills led us to Herir plain, beyond which is the rocky range of limestone called Gharah Surgh. Pass Anoma, and reach the banks of the Zab, where there is a ferry and two villages—one on the left bank Kasroki ; that on the right Kendil, The ferry was a small skin raft.99 From a variety of data the width of the Zab at Nimrud (junction with the Tigris) at the pomt where the Erbil road crosses, and at Herir, varies from 150 to 200 yards, while the tUIs is seldom less than 200 yards, and occasionally more. ^ ^ Z r r b 13 - al ''; a y s m ’ lc h deeper, and contained, when we saw it, a larger body of water than the Tigris, whose tributaries are not supplied by so many snow mountains as the Zab. Beyond the ferry we entered a cuntry of sand and sandstone, with numerous rivulets. There are several villages on the banks of the Zab, which makes a northward bend round the Gharah Surgh. Halted at the small village of Isa. “ 5th July, 3rd Started up the valley of the Akra river, a tributary of the Zab Left the valley near a low hil called Ser Deriyeh, and below it entered on the extensive p ain of Nabkur, studded with villages, but only partially cultivated. p n 01 The Khazir river flows down the centre.

Bilb ass .—These Kurds inhabit the districts south of the Kandil Dao-h along the Persian frontier in Pishder district, and were once a laro- e tribe' but are now much reduced in numbers. They have a very bad 5 reputa tion, moving over the frontier when they get into difficulties with either Government. Balak .—They are partly sedentary and partly nomad. These also inhabit the Kandil Dagh, and much the same districts as the Bilbass. They are partly sedentary. Both Bilbass and Balak tribes go to the upper slopes of the Kandil Dagh for the summer. Sin .—In the Marga and Eania plains and slopes of the Kotsrut and Kurkur Daghs are the Sin Kurds, mostly sedentary, with a few nomads to go to the Kandil Dagh in summer. Akhur .—South of Rawanduz, on the Garak Dagh and the Nalkewan district, are the Akhur or Akoyeh Kurds, all sedentary, and number about thirty villages. Badilia .—North of Rawanduz round Barrakia are the Badilia Kurds, numbering about 20 villages, in a fertile well-wooded district. Beni Hindawin .—East and north-east of Rawanduz, in the valley of the Rawanduz Chai, are the Beni Hindawin or Hindawani Kurds, all living in villages. liawanduz .—Round and in Rawanduz are several small Kurdish tribes, clans of hereditary Begs, who once governed the place. Herir .—West of the Garak Dagh, in the fertile plain of Herir, along the south bank of the Zab, are the Herir Kurds, once a powerful tribe. They live in villages on the plain. Sursi .—Round Koniatman and as far as the Zab are some sedentary Kurds called Sursi. They are said to be great thieves. They live in fifteen villages. All these tribes are Sunnis, and talk Kermanji. A few men can generally be found in the villages who talk Turkish. o 2Route No. VIII— Rawanduz to Amadiyeh, via the Great Zab Valley,. 25lh May to 1st June. Stages. Hours marching.

Passed through the gardens and the village of Kalateluk, which overlook the town. We followed a broad, well-made road for a short way, and at I 4 miles des cended a narrow valley crossed by steep shaly spurs from the Gurrak Dagh on one side, and divided from the River Gorge, on the other, by a perpendicular wall of limestone 500 feet high. In this is a rift through which a small stream passes. The lower slopes of the Gurrak Dagh to the south are covered with low trees and brushwood/ with a few vineyards. The summit of the range is about 6,500' above sea level. The telegraph (1 wire'on wooden poles) to Erbil and Mosul 'oes over a spur of this range, and not down the Serderria Pass. At 5 miles^we reached the crest of the ridge (3,215') and a deep gorge, bordered by precipices 1,500 feet high, lay immediately to the right, at the base of which the Rawanduz River forced its way through the mountain. Serderria Pass .—The descent into .this gorge is a series of short zigzags and windings, taking advantage of projecting spurs and the lie of the strata in the cliffs. The road is paved, and is in good order; with some places 6 feet wide, but the average is from 8 to 10 feet, with a coping of rough blocks on the outer edge. Some of the zigzags are only 8 to 10 yards Iono*. The sides of the gorge are a series of cliffs with steep terraces between them ; the river flows in a channel from 30 to 40 yards wide at the bottom. The Turks talk of making a road along the river bank. It is practicable, but a good deal of cutting among the clay and boulders would be required; the steep ascent over the ridge would then be avoided. The length of the descent following the windings is 3 miles 6 furlongs. The mules took 2 j hours. I walked down in li hours; but the ascent, of course, would take longer. The descent is 1,635 feet, and it is called the Serderria Pass. Eield artillery might be dragged up by hand, but it would be difficult work. The pass can be turned by a track over the rounded spur of the Gurrak Dagh to the south, following the line of telegraph. At the foot of the descent the road turns west, leaving the valley of the Rawanduz river, and entering that of a small tributary, the Ghalifan Su,101 also confined in a narrow g-orge in the hills 200 to 300 yards wide, bordered by cliffs 300 to 500 feet high. Some enormous fragments of rock have in places become detached from the cliffs above, and obstruct the flow of the torrent, and the banks are well wooded with sycamore, ilex, and various shrubs. In one place the road leads into the water to avoid a jut tin' cliff and m floods it would be impassable. Near the mouth of the gorge is a bridge of tree trunks, stretched across the piers of an old masonry bridge (l^OdT At 12 miles we emerged through a rift, about 40 yards wide, into an open valley, surrounded by low wooded hills. Koniatman. Shortly after passed Ghalifan, a village with a few vineyards and ascenfied some low spurs to the north-west. At 15 miles halted in Ko' mat man (2,965'), a small village overlooking the valley just left. Water is from two large springs, and there are a few orchards on the hillside. . ln a directum 266° the valley of the Great Zab could be seen : the interven ing country is Thidulating and bare of trees. To the south and south-west are a succession of low, rocky ridges, the first being about 4 miles distant, covered with low trees. In a direction 147° runs the valley of the Ghalifan Su, 1 to H miles wide, gradually narrowing. It grows patches of rice and a few orchards along the stream bank. There seems a very slight watershed between this and the north west end of the valley of Rania traversed on last route. A route also lies to tCoi Sanjak across the ridges to the south-west. The soil is stony with jaggedmasses of limestone protruding here and there, hut with rich black loam between the stones. It grows low^ trees and some fine clover. To the north-east and east a great mass of snow-covered mountains shut in the view. From 78° to 83° was the Kandil Dagh. Extending from 72° to 75° was the Boz Dagh, the latter bearing being to the highest point. Bearing 64° was a conical peak covered with snow. Weather today clear and fine. 26th May—General direction, N.W. Continue along main road towards Erbil and Mosul. A low wooded ridge, which we cross, forms the watershed between the Ghalifan Su and the Zab. Karakhm .—At 2 miles passed a rocky ravine with stream from the right, up which is the large village of Karakhin, among orchards and vineyards and a ruined castle. The Kurds from here to the Zab are called Sursi, said to be great thieves, and to have a very bad name for robbing caravans, &amp;c. At 4| miles leave the main road and telegraph and follow a side valley bare of trees. Presently we turn north-west through a gap in the low ridge near the village* and spring of Amoka (1,745'), and emerge on a wide bare upland overlooking the Zab. A few nomad tents with their flocks still remain here, but mosl; had migrated to the hills. A few patches of wheat and maize grow round the village and along the banks of the Zab, otherwise the soil, though fertile, is uncultivated. There is a fringe of long grass by the river banks. The track skirts the base of a steep rocky range to the north-east, the last outlier of the mountainous country west of Rawanduz, through which the Zab forces its way. A slight path leads across an undulating country with several small springs in the valleys. At 10| miles pass Berdin, a small village on a bluff overlooking the river.102 Soon after descend steeply to the strip of level grassy land along the left bank (1,065'). The raft, or “ kalak,” as it is called, used for crossing is some times kept below Berdin, but had now been broken up. Very few caravans ever use this route, and consequently we had to move miles down stream to Khurreh, where we camped and sent to obtain skins, &amp;c., to make the raft. While search was made for the raft, I rode north along the bank to explore the gorge through which the river emerges from the mountains. It is called the Berdin Berwasi (Door). Berdin Gorge .—From the village of Berdin the track led for f mile along the plateau overlooking the river, and then dipped suddenly into a Y-shaped ravine parallel to the foot of the ridge. Turning down this a path led to the river bank. The opening through which the river came was barely 10 yards wide, and must have been very deep, as the whole of water came boiling and eddying through it. A path led round the cliff on the left bank, which I followed for 200 yards until itfbecame a ledge barely 1 foot wide, and the only way of getting along was sideways with my back to the cliff. As the track did not improve I returned. It is quite impassable for mules. From the top of the ridge, forming one flank of the gorge, 620 feet high is obtained a good view of the course of the Zab winding through lines of very steep wooded hills. The junction of the Zab and the Rawanduz Chai could not be seen, but a dip in the hills indicated its position. On both banks footpaths led along the water’s edge, but quite imprac ticable for mules: the stones in some places have slipped away, leaving only a sloping sheet of rock : the right bank seemed slightly better than the left. The cliffs, on that bank, rose to a height of about 1,500 feet. Some metallic nodules were picked up in the vertical shale strata on the east side of the gorge. Analysis gave them as nodules Mineral deposit. 0 £ j ron pyrites. The river widens on leaving the gorge, and flows over a shingly bed, 500 to 600 yards wide, with flat shelving banks. The soil is gravelly but fertile, and low cliffs of conglomerate come down to the water’s edge at intervals. Several small springs in the bank and a deserted village with a thick grove of orchards were passed on the bank just below Berdin. Large flocks of sheep grazed by the river bank. Khurreh .—Our camp v/as with some Kurds by the water’s edge (1,065'), the village of Khurreh being two miles up a ravine to the south. A kaim- makam lives there. The water in the river was high now, and icy cold from the melting snow. Judging from marks on the banks, it rises 20 feet above this level in flood time. The river flows in a gravelly bed 350 yards wide here, with a deep current Navigability of the Great of 5 miles an hour; and has the reputation of being Zab. a treacherous and difficult river to cross. From this point to its junction with the Tigris the country is hilly and un dulating, and the banks open. There seems no reason why the Tigris steamers should not navigate as far as this. No rapids could be heard of at this season, and the stream is remarkably deep. To be able to bring men and supplies thus far, to the foot of the mountains, would be of the greatest importance. There are boat ferries at Kalak and Guirdamamish. Men wishing to cross usually swim, the “kalak” being used when a caravan happens to come, which is about once in two months on this route. Weather clear and bright in the morning; overcast in the afternoon. Temperature 86 ° at noon ; 70° an hour after sunset.27th May.—General direction, N.W. A raft was made of a framework of reeds placed over 10 inflated sheep skins. This took mule loads and two people, and was propelled by a single paddle. Advantage was taken of a bend of the channel to give the raft a good start towards the opposite bank; and then it was carried f mile down stream at each crossing ; the river from bank to bank was 550 yards wide. Total lime of crossing was 3 hours 35 minutes. The animals swam and would not face the current without the leader having a man swimming along side to guide him. One mule was carried 1 | miles down stream, and would have been drowned if he had not managed to reach a timely shoal in mid stream We started from the right bank at 10-40 a.m., heading across some low gral velly hills nearly due north. Weather became overcast and cloudy. Tem perature 94°, with a hot wind from the south-west. j m ^ es th® track turns up the valley of a small stream, and runs paral lel and about 1 mile distant from the rocky ridge from the Berdin Goro- e This runs west-north-west, and no track led over it. The country is cut up in all directions by deep gravelly ravines, with small streams flowing from east to west. After 5 miles the ravines are thickly wooded with oaks and brushwood but the path is broad and easy. ' . K 0 a ^ 2W.—At 10 miles pass Kala Tai (2,000'), a steep gravelly ridge, ris ing 300 feet above us running at right angles to the road which passes the south end of it. The ridge is 500 yards long and 150 yards broad, and commands a large stretch of the surrounding country being too far from the range to the north-east to be commanded by it. It forms a good landmark. At the north end is a ruined fort with only one wall now standing and the remains of two storeys of stone-arched rooms with very low doors. At the foot of the mound to the west is a plateau on which is' Kala Tai v’illao-e, on the banks of a large stream which flows through a well-cultivated strip of countiy^ towards the Zab. Judging by the ruins of acqueducts, mills, and foundations of houses, a large town once stood here. A large camp of the Imam Ka Kol Kurds stood near the village; they intended moving into sum mer quarters in about a fortnight. On leaving Kala Tai, we entered a wooded upland country, crossino* several streams in deep ravines. These flow from the ridge now 1 mile dis^ tant to the northward. Soil rich conglomerate with red sandstone ledges cropping out at intervals. &amp; At 12.| miles pass ravine with a small masonry bridge. Several flocks of sheep and herds of cattle seen; the shepherds about here are armed with long guns and knives. Begil.—At 15 miles, 4-45 p.m., reach Begil or Bezil (1,905'), a large vil- lage at the mouth of a deep gorge. I wo streams, running in parallel ravines, come fiom the range to the east, enclosing between them an isolated rocky mound, on the top and sides of which is built the village. The houses are flat- roofed, and well built of sun-dried brick. The slopes of the ravines are culti vated in small terraces irrigated by small channels from the streams, and are thickly covered with olive, ilex, oak, sycamore, fruit trees, and oleanders along the stream bank. A quantity of rice is grown in these valleys. Akra and this district are both celebrated for the quality of rice produced. There are several mills, one being curiously situated in a rock-cut chamber in the side of the ravine. The inhabitants both here and in Akra are chiefly Jews, the rest being Kurds. Shaikh Muhammad, a Zebari Kurd, has a large house here, owns large tracts in the surrounding districts, and is a man of considerable influence in104 the neighbourhood. He is a middle-aged man, and is held in the greatest veneration by the Kurds for his religious life. His house is on a spur at the north-west end of the village, and is well built of stone, loopholed, the basement being cut out of the soft white limestone. Round the walls are clustered the black tents of some of his retainers. Large herds of cattle and sheep and a drove of 100 brood mares are kept by him in the district. The Turks have removed all political power from the old Begs and Kurdish chiefs, but under the guise of religious instruction these Shaikhs exercise a very large influence over these fanatical ignorant people. The wooded slopes extend from two to three miles from the base of the main range, and beyond that towards the Zab lies a bare undulat ing country with a fertile soil; the valleys are well-watered and culti vated, chiefly with rice and maize crops. A broad tract runs from Begil to Akra, 4 hours distant in a north-west direction across some low gravelly mounds. 28th May—General direction, east-north-east. Left Begil, and crossed the ravine below the village, where was a broken, masonry bridge, and ascended a broad track over the range to the east. The hillside is thickly wooded with low oaks and a few junipers. A camp of Kurds in booths of branches was passed at the summit of the hill (3,940'). Zebar Pass .—This is called the Zebar Pass, and the whole of the rocky ridge between here and the Serderria Pass leading to Rawanduz is quite im passable for mules. The view towards Mosul presents a withered treeless plain undulating and cut up by gravelly ravines in all directions. Easy descent following a thickly-wooded spur. Soil stony but rich, grow ing great variety of flowers and grass. Some oaks measured 3 feet diameter: as a rule they were from IS' to 2', and stunted. In the shaley vertical strata we crossed a seam of coal cropping out along the hillside parallel to the direction of the ridge and Seam o£ coal. about 200 yards broad. It seemed rather bituminous, but burnt well in the camp fire in the evening. Amada Talley .—At 6 | miles reach foot of decent, rather steep near the bottom, and cross valley of Amada, 2 to 3 miles broad, shut in by two steep parallel ridges, containing a very fertile soil, with several large springs of good water. Some groves of large oak, walnut orchards, and a few vineyards scattered on the hillsides. Amada is a village of 100 well-built houses on a small knoll at the east side of the valley. Population mostly Jews. Some Kurds living in small booths made of branches were in the valley, feeding the flocks. The valley runs up 300° for some 20 to 25 miles, and is 2 to 3 miles broad crossed by several low-wooded spurs from the ridges on either side. In a direction 100 ° it extends for about 6 miles, after which it narrows in, and is closed by steep rocky ridges at right angles. Piris Dagh .—Cross the valley and ascend the ridge bounding the valley to the north-east, called the Piris Dagh. It is a steep, rough path following a ravine choked with boulders and loose stones. A good deal of clearing would be necessary to make it passable for artillery. The hills are well wooded, and abound in ibex, partridges, &amp;c. The track improves at half a mile from the summit (3,560'), which we reach at 10| miles. A good view is obtainable of the Zab valley below us. The snowy peak of the Boz Dagh bears 63°. One track leads direct to Rezan (direction 66 °). It is very steep and rough, the hill slope being 36°. Our track kept along the hill more to the north-west. It was a ledge only afoot wide, witli some steep rocky parts in places. The lower slopes became wooded with rich soil dotted over with a few vineyards. For the last 2 miles of the descent the track is very rocky, following a nar row ravine. Along the small stream bank are mulberry, sycamore, oak, fig, and pomegranate trees. It would be quite impossible to make a fair road out of this rugged path, strewn with boulders and rough jagged stones with a sudden drop of three or four feet at intervals. Bila Kenpri .—At 15 j miles emerge on the plain at foot of ridge (1,840') near the small village of Zubbut; from which an easy track leads to Bila Keupri (1,470'), where we halted (17§ miles). This is a place of only 40 huts built with stones from some ruins close at hand of buildings of the time when the Zebari Kurdish chiefs were powerful here. The lower part of the walls of the houses are of this squared stone, and the upper of wattle and daub with a flat roof of wattles covered with earth. There is a stone fort in the village about 80 yards square, with round towers at the corners and loopholed walls. It is partially ruined, and is used as the kaimmakam's house. This is a kaimmakamlik of the Mosul Wahat; and about 20 zaptiyahs are quartered here. The nearest point of the Zab river is If miles distant and it opens into an undulating plain bounded by steep ridges on all sides. The plain is crossed by several low wooded spurs from the Piris Dagh. The course of the river is on a bearing of 107° down the valley. About 1 0 miles down stream the hills close in, and it flows between narrow impassable gorges as far as the Berdin Gorge. Reznn .— Bezau is 3| miles distant (1 hour) on a bearing of 89°. It is on the left bank, and now half in ruins, containing only 30 houses. Near it is a small island in the Zab. A large tributary, the Keklik, coming from the mountain districts of Shirwan, Girdi and Nutcha, flows in close to Rezan. It comes through an opening about 1 mile wide in the hills to the north. The road to these districts and Gavvar leads through this gorge. Some Christians reported the road as very difficult; so narrow in places along the steep moun tain slopes that two people could not pass abreast. Shirwan and Girdi have become depopulated of late years, not more than 100 families of Nestorians live there now; scattered among Kurdish villages, five or six families in each. Caravans rarely follow the route through Rezan. The Zab has a very rapid current below Rezan flowing among boulders and rocks and is not fordable at any time of year. There is a raft ferry obtainable near Rezan, but crossing is said to be difficult. There is no route down stream from Rezan, as the river gorges are too difficult. On the left bank extending from 343° to 55° is high mountain range, with a long rocky summit thickly patched with snow. Dotted about its slopes are the villages of the Beroz Kurds, about 15 altogether. It is a well wooded country. No villages were visible, but their fires could be seen at night. SJjirwan lies at the other side of this range, north of Rezan. The Zab is known here as the Zerb. The peak of the Boz Dagh bore 65° from here. A very rough mountainous country with several high snow covered ranges intervenes east of Rezan. There are 10 Christian houses in Bila Kenpri, and a few Jews who wander about trading among the mountain districts. The valley round Bila Keupri towards the Zab grew splendid grass and red and white clover. Men were gathering it for the winter. Locusts arrived in the morning : the air became thick and the sun darkened. In the afternoon there was scarcely a blade of green grass left. Corn was hurriedly cut quite green to save as much as possible.306 The villagers complained this was the fourth year they had suffered severely from locusts, and in winter wheat had to be imported from the Mosul and Akra plains. The soil though rich is stony. Small terraces are formed, and the stones picked off in heaps. Numbers of these were deserted and overgrown with shrubs. The population was much larger before the power of the Zebari chiefs was broken. Water-supply in Begil is from small wells and it seems to sink in this porous white rock and remain there. Good water was found about 6 feet below the surface. The slopes of the border hills are well wooded, with some isolated groves of large oaks in the valley. The rupee was readily accepted as currency even in these out-of-the-way places. A few Russian roubles that 1 had got en route would not be accepted in the Rawanduz bazar, while the rupee was well known and accepted. The weather was very pleasant for marching : the nights much colder than the days, with heavy dew. Temperature 84° at noon; 64° an hour after sunset, and 53° at 5-0 a.m. Since leaving Koniatman my Baghdad servants have been suffering from fever and ague. . This is a feverish place in summer. Opthalmia very prevalent also. The following is a precis of Layard^s journey from Mosul to Gavvar : Leaving Mosul on the 11th of July, five hours’ ride over the plains brought us to the small Turkman village of Birhillan, which stands on the south-east spur of the Maklub hills. After two hours’ rest we continued the journey by night because of the intense heat in the day time, and crossed the spur of the hills before morning dawned. The Jabal-Maklub is here divided into two distinct ranges by a deep valley. The southern ridge, rocky and furrowed like the northern, is called Jabal-Ain-es-Sufra (the hill of the yellow spring) from a discoloured fountain in one of its ravines. It is a place of pilgrimage of the Yezidis. Leaving the Jabal-Maklub we descended into a broad plain stretching from it to the first Kurdish range. Crossed the Ghazir, a clear sparkling stream bordered by oleanders, and rested at noon at small Kurdish village of Kainmawa. Left again in the afternoon, and, instead of striking for the mountains by the direct path across the plain of Navkur, we rode along the foot of a range of low hills forming its western boundary to the large Kurdish village of Bardaresh. Having rested a few hours, we descended in the night into a plain receiving the drainage from the surrounding highlands and during the rainy season almost impassable from mud. Scattered over it are many flourishing villages inhabited chiefly by Kurds who cultivate the rich and fruitful soil. Streams irrigate fields of cotton, tobacco, rice, and turn numerous corn mills. After we had crossed the parched and burning plain, we entered a valley in the Kurdish hills watered by a stream called Melik or Gherasin. We had to climb over much broken ground, rocky ridges, and ravines before reaching the slope of the mountain covered by the garden A ra * and orchards of Akra. The town contains nearly 600 families with a Turkish Mutasellim or Governor and the whole district about 300 villages and hamlets forming a considerable part of the revenues of the Mosul Pashalik. In summer the inhabitants leave their dwellings and encamp in the gardens. The town contains a few well-built stone houses rising one above the other, a mosque, a bath and a ruined castle, and was formerly the stronghold of an independent chief who enjoyed the title of Pasha. A precipitous and difficult path leads up the mountain. From the summit of the pass the eye wanders over the plains of Navkur and Shaikhan, the broken hill country about Erbil and the windings of the Zab and the Ghazir, On the opposite side is a deep valley ^dividing the Akra hills from a second and loftier range (the Piris Dagh). We now entered the region or dwarf oaks, and stopped after a short day’s journey at the Kurdish hamlet Hashtgah. 0 f Hashtgah, surrounded by gigantic trees and watered by numerous strcR/ros. Through the valley ran a broad, clear stream, one of the confluents of the Zab, called by the Kurds Durusho or Bairaisho. We rode along its banks for nearly an hour, and then struck into a narrow gorge thickly wooded with oak. (These districts still contain several villages, and grow large crops of corn, &amp;c., but not so many as here men tioned.) Another stony and precipitous pass was between ns and the principal district of Zebari. From its summit the main stream of the Zab is seen winding through a rich valley, beyond which rise the more central and loftier mountains of Kurdistan with their snow-bearing peaks.107 Keren ,— Descending into the low country we rode by the village of Bila Keupri, the residence of Mustafa Agha, the former head of the Zebari tribes, and halted in Heren, two miles beyond. Early on the morning of the 19th July we left Heren, and, soon reaching the Zab, rode for two hours along its banks to a spot where a small raft had been made ready for us to cross. Rezan The Zab is not fordable in this part of its course. Numerous eddies and rapids caused by sunken rocks render it unnavigable even by rafts, except during the Hoods of spring. We had some difficulty in crossing, and were compelled to pass the night at the small village of Rezan near the ferry, as one of the baggage animals refused to swim the stream and was not forced over until near dawn on the following morning. We now entered the tract which has probably been followed for ages by the nomad clans in their periodical migrations. The principal “ kocher ” tribes found in this part of Kurdistan are the Herki, who go in winter to the plains of the Tigris and Zab. They are notorious thieves and robbers, and they commit serious depredations on the settled inhabitants of the district, especially the Christians, during their annual migrations. As they possess vast flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, their track has in most places the appearance of a beaten road, and is consequently well fitted for beasts of burden. The country beyond or to the east of the Zab is broken into a number of parallel ranges of wooded hills, divided by narrow ravines. Small villages are scattered here and there on the moun tain sides in the midst of terraces cultivated with wheat and planted with fruit trees. The scenery occasionally assumes a character of beauty and grandeur as the deep green valleys open beneath the travellers feet, and the lofty snow capped peaks of Rawanduz rise majestically in the clear blue sky. The nights were still sufficiently warm for us to sleep in the open air. During the middle of the day the heat of the sun compelled us to seek the shade. Our first rest after leaving the Zab was in the gardens of Kouran, and our first night’s encampment near the small hamlet of Bani on the declivity of a mountain- On the 21st July, crossing a high ridge, we left the Zebari District and entered that of Shir wan, and halted in the large village of Bersiyah, where Miran Bey, the chief, received us. 1 hrough the valley beneath ran a considerable confluent of the Zab dividing the districts of Shirwan and Oerdi. Three names were given for this stream—Av Sherah, Rudbar Keklik, and Berasghird. During the afternoon we rode for three hours along this stream, through open valleys and narrow gorges, until we reached Harouni in the district of Baradost. Most of the villages in these mountains have small mud forts, with either four or six towers, the places of refuge and defence of the numerous petty chiefs during their frequent broils and blood feuds. We met a few Jewish families who wander from village to village. The men are pedlars and goldsmiths, and are not unwelcome guests even in the intolerant families of the Kurds, as they make and refashion the ornaments of the ladies. On one of the many peaks above Harouni is the large village of Klum-i-Resh (elevation 4,872') with its orchards and gardens, the residence of the chief of the district of Baradost. We reached it by a very rapid ascent in an hour and a half. After breakfast we continued the journey, and at sunset reached the small turreted stronghold of Beygishni. The next morning we crossed on^ of the shoulders of the lofty peak of Ser-i-Resh into the valley of Chappata (Chapnaia in Chaldean). There were several Christian villages in Gerdi presided over by a Bishop of that name. Zemin .—-We went to Zernin, the castle of the Kurdish Mir of Gerdi, and, having rested there, we left the bold upland on which the village stands, and entered a wild and narrow gorge. A very steep pathway led us to the summit of the northern shoulder of the Ser-i-Resh, from whence we gazed over a sea of mountain ranges whose higher peaks were white with eternal enow. We had now left the naked hills which skirt the Assyrian plains, and had entered the wooded districts of Kurdistan. On the following day we journeyed through a valley thick with walnuts and other large trees, and followed the windings of a stream called by the Kurds Shambo, a considerable affluent of the Zab. Neva .—We crossed it backwards and forwards by wicker suspension bridges until we ascended through a forest of orchards watered by innumerable streamlets, to Nera, the village of Musa Beg, the chief of Shemdina. In Nera are many Jewish families who make a livelihood by wearing the coloured wooden stuffs worn by the Kurds. Left Nera early the following day, by a very steep pathway, winding over the face of a precipice, and completely overhanging the village. Reaching the top of the pass was a natural carpet of flowers, spread over the eastern declivity of the mountain, and cooled and moistened by the snows and glaciers that fringed the deep basin. Shemesden .—The valley at our feet was the Nestorian district of Shemesden, thickly set with Christian villages, the first of which, Bedewi, we reached after passing a few cultivated patches cleared from the forest of oaks. The inhabitants looked miserably poor and the children starved and naked; the men and women in rags. Leaving the caravan we turned down the valley to the convent of Mar Khanishu. A ride of f hour brought us there, where Mar Isho, the Bishop, received ns. This is on the high road of the Herki migrations who pass twice a year over the settlements of the Christians and despoil everything. p 2From here we turned again into the high road to Bashkala. We had another pass to cross before descending into the valley of Harouna, where our caravan had encamped for the night. From the summit of the pass we looked down into two deep and well-wooded valleys hemmed in by mountains of a singularly picturesque form. In that to the left we could indistinctly see two large villages. Erawa and Serconos j the latter once the dwelling place of the Mirs of Shemes- den. We descended into the more northern valley, and passing the miserable Nestonan hamlet of Sourasor and the ruined church and deserted Christian village of Tellana, reached our tents about sunset near Harouna, a small Nestorian village, the inhabitants of which were too poor to furnish us with even coarse barley bread. ., Next day a low ridge separated us from the district of Gavvar, a remarkable plain of consider- auiu extern}, . . „ , V ttt\ For routes leading from Gavvar plain to Bashknla and Lrmia (see Route A 111;. 30th May—General direction, N.N.E. Left Bila Keupri (1,4701, passed up the valley in a westerly direction throng’ll Heren and Bazi: the valley narrows as we ascend, and is bounded by bare stony ridges. Wheat was being cut green to try and save it from the locusts. The rocky soil was formed into little terraces cleared of stones, the greater part of which are now uncultivated. Water for these villages is from small wells, and is found 6 feet below the surface. Galas/tinea Pass—A.t 5 miles the road turns to the north through a rocky gap (1,730') called the Galashinea Pass. On a spur at the head of the valley, 2 miles to the west, is Kala Hukher, a dismantled fort which belonged to Shaikh Zaire, a powerful chief of the Zebari Kurds, who was imprisoned at Mosul 12 years ago. An alternative pass more rocky and difficult crosses the ridge by the castle. . . The valley which we ascend is stony and rough, the hillsides being sheets of bare rock for the most part. Some wells were passed, curious masonry arched cisterns 20 * x 10 ' : the water in them is stagnant and bad. S/inea .—Kear the summit Shinea is passed (2,765 ), a village watered by a spring from the hillside, and a large underground tank. ^ Shaikh Kuri, a man with considerable religious influence among the Zebari Kurds, lives here, in what appears to he an old church. Turkish is not understood in these villages ; only Kermanji. At 10 2 miles the top of the pass was reached (3,155 ), and from there a very steep rugged descent to the Zab following a narrow ravine choked with boulders, jagged stones and shrubs. It was difficult work for mules, who took 1 hour and 50 minutes to descend. There is a small spring half-way uuvvu. S/iinea Su Serna .—Halted by the river hank (1,425 ) on a small stretch of grass 100 yards broad and ^ mile long, the only open space for some distance in this valley. It is called Shinea Su Serna. The total descent from the sum mit of the pass is 1,730'. Rocky ridges dotted with low trees rise immediately on either bank. The river here is 50 to 60 yards broad with a deep rapid torrent. To the north is the Shirindari Dagh, a steep range cut up by several wooded gorges and in these are several large caves, supplied with water, where Kurds live in the summer. To the south is the Shinea Dagh we have just come over. No road follows the right hank, as cliffs jut in the water and bar all progress. There is a narrow ledge on the left bank on which were seen a few ruined buildings and disused terraces. This would be an alternative route to the one which we took from Bila Keupri; the Zab being crossed near Rezan and the left bank followed from there. No raft was available, and the water was too high for crossing at Rezan, so our present route was taken. The ruins of a bridge across the river exist109 vm a few miles above Rezan. The Galashinea pass would be difficult to make passable for troops, and great labour would be necessary to get field guns along the river bank. From marks on the trees, the river rises 25 feet in flood season above its present level, and must fill the entire valley. The temperature of the river water was only 56° due to the melting snows in the mountains to the north. The general direction of the valley down stream is 130°. Weather clear and bright. Temperature 53° at 5 a.m., and 84° at noon. 31st May—General direction, N.W. Left camp by the water's edge and soon reached a narrow ledge closely overhanging the river, the path leading through a thicket of low oaks, pear trees, creepers, and wild vines. Here and there slippery sheets of rock had to be traversed, some of which required very careful guiding for the mules : one was nearly lost being almost in the water and had to be forcibly dragged on the path again. The river is a deep narrow stream with a rapid current and is full of sunken rocks. To the south rises a wooded rocky slope, the river making a bend in that direction ; the bend is filled up by a low-wooded spur from the Shirindari Dagh, which fringes the left bank, ending in a series of cliffs 150 to 200 feet high. Pn-i-Kalani .—At miles we reached the ruins of an old bridge, the piers only of which still remain called the Pir-i-Kalani. From here the coun try opens out, and we emerge from the river gorge into a wide-wooded valley, with steep ridges on either side. The path through the gorge would require a good deal of blasting to make it broad enough to take artillery, and high floods might at any time sweep it away : a better plan would seem to be to reconstruct the Pir-i Kalani, and the old bridge near JEtezan, and let the line of the road follow the left bank. This would follow the chord of the bend which the river takes from Shinea Su Serna, and would be less difficult to construct. It would avoid the Galashinea Pass, and lead direct to Bila Keupri. Several deserted terraces prepared for cultivation were seen here, showing the evidences of a former larger population. A little rice was cultivated along the river banks. Several small streams come from the ridges to the north and south. Alura .—At 7f miles pass through Alura (1,590'), a small village round which are some fine oaks 4' to 5' diameter, with the ruins of an old church close by. The soil is rich and the trees are well grown. This is an important district for producing galls for dyeing purposes. Ashknfa River .—At 10 miles on the opposite bank of the Zab is a large rift in the range there called the Balinda Gorge, through which a large tribu tary of the Zab comes, known here as the Ashkufa river. It comes from the southern slopes of the Baz and Jelu mountains, and drains a very wild country of steep gorges and precipices shut in by snow covered peaks. To the south east of the Balinda Gorge the range is called the Shirindari Dagh, and to the north-west the Gurajar Dagh. On the right bank of the Zab is the Shinea Dagh, rising to about 5,000' along the summit. Gurajar Dagh .—The inhabitants of this valley are Zebari Kurds, who migrate to summer quarters or “Zozan' at the summit of the Gurajar Dagh, where they find springs of water and grass for their flocks. To the northward of the Guvajar Dagh is the country of the large tribe of Upper Missuri Kurds, touching on the north the Christian districts of Chob and Salabakka. To the south of this are the lower Missuri Kurds, also a large tribe.A caravan of 50 mules was met here, crossing the Zab on two rafts: they were Mosul merchants going into the mountains through the Balinda Gorge, trading from village to village among the Kurds, selling cottons and other stuffs. They were seven days out from Mosul, the stages being small this time of year on account of the animals staying to graze. Latka. —At 13 miles a halt was made at Latka (1,015'), a large Kurdish village on a wooded spur overlooking the Zab. On the higher slopes are terraces of wheat and orchards, and on the lower are rice fields watered by the several streams which flow from the range to the south. The water-supply is very good. Shaikh Futta Ala, a Zebari Kurd, lives here, and is a rich and influential man in these parts; with a seat on the mejlis of Amadiyeh. Honey is obtainable here and in Bila Keupri. The slopes of the border ranges are thickly covered with trees and brushwood ; and the view down the valley reminds one of an English park dotted with fine trees and edged with thick forest. The soil is a rich reddish clay mixed with conglomerate, and grows fine grass at this season. Weather clear and bright: temperature 60° at 5-30 a.m. and 84° at noon, when the sun was powerful and the air damp and unpleasant, with great numbers of flies. The climate is said to be malarial in summer time; and the inhabitants usually migrate to the hills then. 1 st June—General direction, N.W. Left Latka (1,615'), the road trending to the south-west at first, and then running between the main border range and a low wooded outlier which interposes between it and the river. Cutting through the latter are several small ravines through which streams flow, and on the banks of which are Serukani (1,565'), Beau, and other small Kurdish villages half hidden among the trees. The track is broad and easy through a thickly-wooded country. Some fine walnut, sycamore, willow, oak, juniper and poplar trees were seen ; some oaks were 3' to 4' diameter. The soil was reddish rich clay overlying white friable limestone. Round the villages wheat and tobacco were cultivated in terraces, and rice along the stream banks. Along the Zab are lai’ge belts of rice also. Firay. —At 9 miles the road turned north through a ravine, and we reached the Zab valley again near the village of Firay (1,745'). The river narrows between two rocky ledges, and a couple of trees have been thrown across, forming a foot bridge scarcely passable for mules. The piers of an old masonry bridge could be seen. The river makes a sharp bend from the north, emerg ing from a deep rift in the Gurajar Dagh. A high snowy peak, probably a mountain in Chal, bearing 31-8°, could be seen through this. Only footpaths lead through, and there is no track fit for mules. Ghara Su .— Down the valley, from the direction of Amadiyeh, flows a tributary called the Ghara Su, and also through a rift in the range to the south a small river, called the 11 ubat Su, which we forded at 12| miles (1,570 ). It comes from Spindari and the country of the Lower Missuri Kurds. Sircheh. —North-west of the gorge of the Rubat Su the ridge gets lower and more rounded in shape. The village of Sircheh is situated just in the gorge; behind which appears a high jagged range, with the summits tipped with snow. We followed the valley of the Ghara Su towards Amadiyeh, fordmg the stream at 14j miles. Only a few stunted trees could be seen now in the valley; the inaccessible slopes of the ridge were still thickly wooded, although getting barer as we ascend the valley. Soil is a light gravelly clay overlying sandstone and conglomerate. Some traces of former cultivation were seen. Numerous streams come from the ridges on either hand. Clover hay was beingI 111 cut along the streams, and stored in bundles for the winter. Tall reeds and thatching grass were plentiful by the river banks. . Kwaneh.—At 23 miles we halted in Kwaneh (2,775'), a Nestorian village m a very fertile little valley, down which a stream flows towards the Ghara Su. 1 his is situated 2^ miles south-east of Amadiyeh, and pleasanter for camp ing, besides avoiding the climb to the top of the plateau. About 4 miles from Latka on this stage were picked up some nodules of Mineral deposit. ore which lay about in considerable quantity in the , . so ^ shaly strata. Analysis at Calcutta of some brought away, gives them as nodules of ochreous brown hematite, which, it obtainable in large quantity, might be used as an ore of iron.AMADIYEH AND THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY. The town of Amadiyeh is built on a rock terrace of hard sandstone, forming a bold isolated spur from the steep ridge, the Ser Amadiyeh, immedi ately to the north of it. The terrace or plateau is oval in shape, 1,400 yards long and 550 yards broad {see plan), and is everywhere surrounded by limestone cliffs from 50 to 80 feet high ; the lower slopes are very steep and consist of clay soil strewn with boulders. The town occupies the northern part of the plateau, and a large portion of the remainder is occupied by graves. At the extreme southern angle is a ruined castle built by one of the last Begs of Rawanduz after he sacked this place. The houses of the town have Hat earth roofs, and are built of stones from the ruins around. There are two gates—one at the north-east side of the plateau, and the other on the west. The town is mostly in ruins, and only about 500 houses are now inhabited. The population numbers 2 , 000 , mostly Kurds, with some Jews. The bazar is small and ill-supplied, built partially among the ruins. A light woollen cloth called “ munuz” is much used by the Kurds. It is very strong and durable. Various dried fruits, raisins, plums, and apricots, cheese and the curdled milk known as yaurt, were on sale. There are several smith's shops for repair of Kurdish weapons, knives, &amp;c. Both gates are ornamented with iron work and there are some curious carvings of snake-like figures on the rock at the west gate. Overlooking the east gate is a large square building in a dilapidated con dition, but solidly built of large blocks of stone. It is used as the serai or offices of the kaimmakam and barracks for the 40 zaptiyahs who are quartered here. There are no regular troops; and the surrounding districts, which were very lawless formerly, are now peaceable. Muhammad Pasha of Mosul in 1812 besieged and bombarded the east gate from a height about 1,500 yards distant (marked A on the plan). Shot marks are still visible on the butresses of the gate. The old castle at the south end consists of a masonry wall 3 '{to 4 ' thick and 20 ' high, drawn across the end of the plateau cutting off a space about 200 yards each way and containing two bastions. Along the edge of the cliff is a low masonry wall with embrasures and loopholes. The castle has absolute command over all the country to the south. The only point from which guns can be brought to bear on the plateau is from the small spur previously mentioned. The summit of the Ser Amadiyeh range to the north is about 3,000 yards distant to the north. It commands all the plateau, but the summit is a line of steep jagged cliffs almost impossible for mountain artillery to climb. An old bronze howitzer lay dismantled in the castle. It was about a 20 -pr., and much scored with firing. It was in a small bastion looking north on the spur from which the bombardment took place. The chief peculiarity of it was four large iron rings, two on either side, meant to carry it on poles slung between mules, something like a “ takhtarwan.” It was 3 ' 6 ' long and 51' calibre. Its weight was about 10 ewt., which is considerably more than our mountain gun of 400 lbs. This seems a good method for moving a com paratively heavy gun over rough paths.I 113 The plateau slopes slightly towards the west, and the soil along the summit is almost entirely sheets of rock. The Christian quarter consisting of about 20 houses is separate from the rest of the place. Water-supply on the summit is from wells, which is mostly bad in summer; and from aspring in the hillside about 100 yards outside the west gate. It is also brought in skins on donkies from the stream in the valley. Along the north and east sides of the plateau is a deep narrow valley with a large stream called the Rudbar Amadiyeh coming from a gorge in the Ser Amadiyeh Range to the north. The bottom of the valley is cultivated in terraces, thickly planted with orchards of fig, pear, walnut, pomegranate, &amp;c. Some large poplars, sycamore, ash, and alder line the stream banks. The kaimraakam has a house down among these gardens. In summer most of the people leave the plateau and migrate there, chiefly because of the better water-supply. A Dominican missionary lives on the plateau in a good two- storied house. Amadiyeh is now in the Van Waliat since the Hakkiari Waliat has been broken up. It ought from its position to be under Mosul; and no reason could be found for its being thus administered. A valley, known as the Supna valley, 6 to 8 miles broad extends to the north-west, where it meets the Khabur valley at Zakho. The rice to be bought here is very good, coming principally from the Zab valley : Indian corn and wheat also are cultivated. Oak galls, tabacco, dried fruits, and raisins are the chief exports, mostly to Mosul market. Large quantities of tobacco of a good quality are produced for export in the district. In Kwaneh was a large room where bundles were in various stages of drying and preparation in several villages were stacks of wood cut into lengths about the size and shape of railway sleepers of sycamore, poplar, and ash chiefly, waiting to be exported to Mosul. Abundance of good thatching grass and withies for making baskets grow by the stream banks. Kwaneh is surrounded by a thick grove of mulberry trees, and a good deal of silk is produced in this district. Vines twined themselves up the trees. The road to the east gate of Amadiyeh runs along a narrow neck joining the plateau to the spurs on that side. The country is cut up by several deep ravines flowing south into the head-waters of Ghara stream. The soil is a fertile reddish loam with occasional ledges of sandstone. The ruined Christian village of Mariska, with a cluster of deserted orchards burnt by the Kurds, stands about half way to Amadiyeh from Kwaneh. Routes from Amadiyeli. The principal route from Amadiyeh is that leading over the hills to the north by the Zab valley to Bashkala, and from there to Van, Urmia, or Khoi. Trade from Mosul, Jazirah, and Zakho follows this line and it forms the most direct and easiest line of communication between Mosul and Van. This road runs north from Amadiyeh through the gorge in the Ser Ama diyeh range, and after passing Julamerk it joins the Zab Valley, which it follows until Bashkala is reached. The country passed through is rough and mountainous, and it is only com paratively speaking that the road is easy for traffic. It is good for pack ani mals, but scarcely passable in its present state for guns. It is a very import ant strategic road, leading as it does direct from Mosul and the Mesopotamian plain to Van, Bayazid, Khoi, and the country adjoining the Russian frontier. VOL. I. Q114 Amadiyeli to Bashkala. The following is a precis of Ainsworth's journey along this route by the Zab Valley : 13th .Ume 1840, 1st stage .—Left Amadiyeh, and ascended the mountain behind it, called the Tura Matineh by the Christians. The pass itself is called Geli Mazukah. Near the foot of the pass is a mountain torrent, the Sulaf Chai, which comes tumbling over rocks amid steep cliffs on either side. After half a mile of open valley, the second part of the pass is reached. It is a narrow gorge in the limestone rock. . r When we reached the crest of the chain we found patches of snow at an elevation of 5,840. This is Zozan Naodashti, the summer quarters of the Amadiyeh people. From this point the extensive district of Berrawi extended before us, and close by was^ a long valley dotted with Christian villages, at the head of which was a peculiar rounded mountain above the village of Duri, where the Bishop of Berrawi resided. # Beyond were two distinct lofty and snow-clad chains of mountains, the one Tura Devehh extending from N. 5 E. to N. 25 W. and the other Tura Shina, the extent of which was not well defined. To the west the valley opened amidst mingled forests, rock and arable land ; above which rose a group of rude peaks, on one of which was Kumri Kala, a place of refuge of the Kurdish chiefs of Bahdinan, and beyond which rose another group of snow-clad mountains the name of which could not be ascertained. , They were the mountains at the head of the Buhtan country. The chain of Matineh (her Amadiyeh) which we are now crossing is the continuation south-eastward of the Jabal Judi which divides to the north Buhtan from Bahdinan and in the centre that of Hakkiari from the same About an hour’s descent brought us to the Nestorian village of Hayis, where we found the Bishop of Berrawi waiting for us. An hour’s journey brought us to a perpendicular precipice of tabular slaty limestone about 250 feet deep, at the bottom of which flowed the Rudbar Elmei, a torrent about 12 yards wide and 3 feet deep which flows towards the Zab. On the opposite side of the river was a conical hill with a ruined castle called Beitannun, ^ ^ Our road lay down the bank of the Elmei, which we crossed on a wooden bridge, passing several Chaldean villages, and then up a tributary stream to the large village of Duri. We walked from Dari about half a mile to a picturesque wooded glen wherein were a few hamlets, one of which was the Bishop’s residence, while up above surrounded by trees at the foot of a cliff was a little whitewashed church partly hewn out of the rock. This is Mar Kiyomah where the Bishop gener ally officiated. .... . &lt;• t, 15th June, 2nd stage .—We started early in the morning to visit the iron mines of Berrawi in the mountain of Duri. , We found these mines to be worked on the surface in beds of oxide of iron. The people are onlv acquainted with five mines in all Hakkiari, and of these three were visited by us with the result that probably they possess no such advantages as would make it profitable to transport their ores over the mountain roads. , m, , We had a steep descent from the Tura Duri and reached a valley nearly filled up with snow upon which lay a whole grove of trees that bad been carried down by a landslip. Duri was situated at an altitude of 4,917 feet, and the crest of the Duri Mountain at 5,792 feet. The snowy valley was 5,133 feet and from thence we ascended again over rocks of blue lime stone to the crest of the Deralini hills (altitude 5.811 feet), from whence we had a prolonged descent of 11 hours, at a quick pace, to the village of Gunduk, inhabited by tributary Kurds. This deep valley reaches down to the banks of the Zab and is bounded to the north by the great range called the Karasi Tiari which forms the western boundary of the Tiar district, although the outlying village of Gunduk is tributary thereto. , r , On the south side of the Zab and opposite to this valley is a well-watered verdant vale inhabited by dial Kurds. Leaving Gunduk we travelled along a narrow mule path, for it was never any thing more, which took us round the southern slope of the Karasi Tiari, where its huge shoulder presses down upon the valley of the Zab. This rapid river rolled along amid impracticable precipices nearly 1,000 feet below us. Its course could be traced for some distance, but, except two narrow vales watered by mountain torrents and inhabited by Chal Kurds, there was nothing but bold masses of rock vising one above the other and increasing in height eastward to the mountain of Tsariyah and the l uraShma. As we opened upon the valley of Lizan, a scene presented itself more interesting than any we had met yet. Before us was a steep range of rocks stretching E.N.E. and W.S.W., with lofty nrecipices fronting the west and appearing to form a barrier against all further progress. Thero was however one gap through which the Zab found its way past Lizan where its bed is wide and less rocky. It is crossed by a bridge of ropes, and on the left bank is the Kurdish village of Jenan, while on the right is the great Nestorian village of Lizan. The houses of Lizan are scattered among groves and gardens, and are about i a mile from the river which flows past here at a rate, of 6 £ miles an hour. Lizan Church was found to be in north Lat. 3t!° oS' 50'. There are several roads from thence into the Hakkiari country, but all of them have to compass the ascent of the great limestone range immediately east ot the valley. One leaps115 over the slope of the Tsariyah hill, east of the Zab, but is not accessible for mules. All tbe rest present great difficulties. 16th June.—We turned aside from the road up the valley of the Izani stream towards Ashi- tha. At a short distance beyond Lizan we passed the village Miniyani, divided into an upper and a lower portion about ^ mile from each other ; and 3 miles from the same place the village of Umrah, beyond which 1 mile distant was Zawitha. Beyond Lizan the valley begins to rise, tbe river flowing through a ravine below ; but above this, at the foot of the cliffs which shut in the valley, is a shelving declivity, well cultivated in terraces, and dotted with villages. At Umrah we commenced the ascent of the mountain, and in an hour’s time reached the root of the upper line of cliffs: the road was so bad that we had twice to load and unload the mules, until at length we reached a gap in. the rocks which led us through a thick growth of fennel. Some peasants were engaged in cutting this plant, which constitutes the winter stock of cattle pro vender. The crest of the Kuriki, the mountain we were now crossing, leaving Ashitha to the left or west, was 7,650 feet in elevation. The culminating point must exceed 8,00c feet in height. The descent was steeper than the ascent, and was rendered more difficult by the slaty nature of the rock and the smooth sloping surfaces over which the track led. On the side of the hill near the base is a rock called Teraspino, where is a vein of galena with a small gallery for working the ore. It is chiefly used for lead for bullets. We passed through Teraspino, a large village at the base of the hill, and ascended another range, gaining the crest after little more than an hour’s foot work. We then continued along the side of the hill, over several snow patches and above the valley of the Zab. Zoma Smoarri. —At length just after sunset we came to a summer pasture called Zoma Suwarn (altitude 7 , 170 '), where were a few shepherds, with whom we camped for the night. There is a road carried across the mountain at a lower level than the one we were at present following, which is only available during a short season of the year. The view from the Zoma Suwarri was very grand. To the north range after range of rugged mountains succeeded one another like giant walls. Five different ranges presented themselves between us and the snow-clad uplands of Julamerk and the head-waters of the Zab. To the south were the long crests of rock we had toiled over, the summits of Tura Shina and Kuriki rising over all; and after all our labour the gap by winch the Zab found its way into Lizan appeared quite close, but a long way beneath us. 17th June, 4th stage.—Our road still lay along the side of the mountain, the snow was more abundant and the slope often very steep. We got down to the valley of the Kha by means of a glacier or snow r patch about a mile long and 300 yards wide. _ The valley of Itha is encircled on the north side by lofty snow-clad mountains, the jura Tusani, the rocks of which dip north, while they present bold precipices towards the valley. There are here three villages—Itha, Pir Beka, and Galitba. _ . From Pir Beka we proceeded down the valley of the stream to the bridge opposite Galitha. The torrent w T as there 15 yards wide and 5 to 6 feet deep. The bridge was ingeniously cons tructed of wickerwork. From Galitha we commenced another ascent almost as fatiguing as the Kuriki. _ , , j? i&gt; • l Having gained the crest we descended another glacier, and it was the work of a tew mmutes to lose the elevation which it had taken us upwards of an hour to ascend. We then found ourselves in an alpine valley overgrown with fennel, at the lower part of which was Malotah, a small Kurdish village, where we halted for the night. The valley (elevation 6,200 feet) was partly cultivated, partly covered with snowmand the remainder overgrown with rank vegetation ; more especially of umbelliferous plants. The waters of the valley found their way by a narrow deep glen in the rocks into the Zab valley. 18th June. —The ascent today was not so steep, and in some parts we could mount our mules. The hills were now wooded with fine oak ; and gaining the next crest (Warundan) we found our selves immediately above a summer pasture called the Zoma of Warundan. We descended another thousand feet to the valley of Kiyan, where was a small lead mine. There are two villages at Kiyan ; the upper one is Kurdish, and the lower one Chaldean. _ At the same altitude as Kiyan and at the foot of Warundan, the Zab is divided into two branches of very nearly equal size, the southerly branch comes from the country beyond Julamerk and the northerly from Leihun and that district. This latter is called Berdazawi or little Zab. A huge mountain mass called Meskannah extends between the two rivers. After a short ascent we travelled along the banks of the Berdazawi; sometimes over conglom erate cliffs that overhang the river. , , „ . ^ , , , In little more than an hour we came to a torrent which descended from a lofty fTnd snow-clad chain to the west called Maranan. It is 13 yards wide and 6 feet deep crossed by a wickerwork bridge. Near the same point was also a bridge over the Berdazawi and a little cultivation, but no village. Beyond the Maranan river to the north are two rocky ranges of limestone w ic rise up in lofty precipices, in this case fronting west. The most easterly and most lotty of these ranges is called Sinaber, and beyond it is the upland of Leihun. Turning north the path led along the foot of some cliffs and then a series of rock-like steps so that on approaching the crest of the Sinabcr I found myself separated from the river by several116 * tiers of rock terraces. On the upland of Leihun we found the Berdazawi divided into three branches, all of which unite before a gap in the rocks over which we had just come. All these streams we crossed on wicker bridges. This upland is inhabited by the Kurdish tribe of Leihun under Julamerk. Many villages with much cultivation are scattered around. We crossed the river, and turned south-west to Leihun village, where we halted. 19th —From Leihun we altered the direction of our route in order to suit the configu ration of the country better, and instead of travelling nearly north we now turned eastward over the upland of Leihun and some low ranges of hills. The temperature was so low as to feel actually cold. As we went eastward the river of Leihun was seen flowing through pastures as a quiet stream and no longer a torrent as before. Far away to the north was a Christian Church called Mar Ghiyorghiyo Karkal, much reverenced by the Nestorians as the tomb of a Saint. At the head-waters of the river was the snow-clad chain of Para Ashin which stretches in front and beneath the loftier Erdish Dagh. Passing over a range of hills, rising no great height above the upland, we descended to a culti vated vale with houses and gardens, where was a poor Kurdish village called Eslaya. Near Eslaya (6,280 feet elevation) we entered upon the first granitic district we had met with in the mountains. These rocks show themselves first on the upland at an elevation of 6,000 feet, but soon rise 1,000 feet above that in bare masses ; and their prolongation apparently forms the Tura Jelu, the loftiest chain in Kurdistan. # . Julamerk .—Another ascent with a patch of snow brought us in view of Julamerk bearing N. 80° E. The place is situated in a deep hollow at an elevation of about 4,500 feet and in a ravine by which the streams find their way into the Zab immediately below. To the east is a bold rocky mountain, called Shembat, rising at least 3,000 feet above Julamerk. To the south-west is a limestone rock about 600 feet high bearing a ruined castle called Kala Bawa. 22nd June .—Left Pagi, an Armenian village near Julamerk, on our way to Bashkala. We had a gentle ascent up the shoulder of the Tura Burjullah which lasted nearly 2 hours, and then descended to the valley or rather upland of Kochannis, the residence of Mar Shimun. We rode some distance along the sides of the Kochannis Hill, leaving a higher range called the Areb Dagh before us. We then descended by a long and steep though otherwise good pathway to a valley in which were many villages and a varied and abundant vegetation. We ascended again to a cultivated upland at the foot of the Areb Dagh where were the Chaldean villages of Espin and Gharanis. The prospect from Gharanis where we halted at an elevation of 7,000 feet is very fine, and a great quantity of water flows in the torrents down the mountain sides. 23rd June .— There are two roads from Gharanis—one over the mountains, and another along the valley of the Zab. We took the latter, although longer, and made two slight ascents and descents, and passed some deposits of sulphur. We passed the Chaldean village of Kermi and then turned off from the Zab valley which was here rocky and beautifully wooded, and headed to the north-east passing a valley with two more Chaldean villages. The outline of the mountains has now become less rugged, the uplands more lofty, and the chains more continuous. In the evening we followed for some time the valley of the Zab where it wound through a marshy vale. At the end of this it received a large tributary from N. 80° W., which we crossed by a bridge. Ascending a plateau, a little above the Zab we reached the Chaldean village of Mailawa (elevation 6,418 feet), where we halted. 24th June .—Our road still continued up the open valley of the Zab : hours brought us to where two streams meet,—one from the mountains beyond Bashkala, and the other from Kanda Kilissa. We soon came in view of Bashkala, 2 miles to our left. Julamerk to Amadiyeh. The following is a precis of M. Binder's journey from Julamerk to Amadryeh {Travels in Kurdistan, May 1886) : 1st October .—Left the valley of Amadiyeh at the south-west corner where the torrent flowed from it to join the Zab. The path was a zigzag staircase cut in the rock, and the mules could with difficulty turn in the narrow passage. After following the bank of the torrent for some minutes, we debouched into the Great Zab valley. The river was now a yellowish torrent some yards wide flowing between high mountain ranges. . We crossed on a very ricketty bridge of a framework of tree trunks at each end with the centre formed of hurdles and branches interlaced. One man went across alone first, then two men too-ether, then an unloaded mule, and finally a loaded one. ° The muleteers have a curious custom in narrow places of guiding the mule by the head and tail as well.117 We followed a narrow path along the left bank of the river through a thicket of low shrubs and wild vines which climbed over the rocks, and after two hours’ difficult marching halted to rest the animals on a small plateau half way up the hillside. We started again and skirted the river bank again and then left the valley ; turned up another smaller one to the south-west, down which a stream flowed. This is the Thai valley. Vegetation is very abundant,—walnut, oak, and other trees and shrubs line the stream banks. * We passed some Kurdish villages on the hillslopes who refused supplies. The slopes are cul tivated in terraces one above the other, banked up by low stone walls. Rice, maize, millet and hemp were the principal crops. We passed through Becherat, a small village prettily situated on the right bank of the stream. It contains 30 houses echelloned one above the other ; the roof of one forming a terrace in front of the house next above it. Some enormous rocks detached at some period from the cliff overhang the village. In one of these a small church has been cut. The stream entirely disappears in the stony bed of the ravine and reappears again 100 yards further on in the form of numerous springs. The water is collected and led in small channels to irrigate the fields. The ravine as we ascend loses all traces of vegetation, and the soil is nothing more than a mass of stones and rocks. The slopes of the hills are quite rocky and bare of trees also. At a sudden turning of the road we saw in the distance the small Kurdish village of Rabat surrounded by some fine walnut and poplar trees. We halted here for the night. 2nd October. — Left Rabat at 7-0 A.M., and followed a difficult stony path winding up a steep incline to the summit of the ridge above the village. A single hawthorn marks the summit, in the shade of which we halted for a few minutes. We skirted along the crest, keeping the valley down to the right, and shortly after commenced the descent by a path steeper than the ascent, and down which we had to lead our horses. Halted at the foot of the slope in the shade of an enormous rock near a small village now abandoned. The stream in this valley is called the Anthrad. From here new scenery began to open out: the valley was perfectly desolate, the soil being composed of a stone resembling lava. The stream in the valley made a sudden bend, and we ascended a spur to avoid it. Crossing this we entered another bare valley all stones and rocks. Not a single shrub or blade of grass grew beside the stream, and the desolation was complete. C’ext une vallee de Vevfer. The clear waters of the stream tumbled over enormous rocks forming small cascades. At intervals were small stone bridges crossing the stream. It would be difficult to say at what period and by whom these were constructed. The track grew worse among the boulders. The stream grows in size as we go down the valley, and several affluents join on either bank, little by little the valley gets less desolate and a few blades of grass appear and then groves of poplar and walnut trees. The valley winds a good deal and becomes wider as we go on. It is now filled with terraces growing fruit trees and meadow grass. Walnuts lay strewed under the trees, and vines loaded with excellent grapes climbed to the summit of the poplars. We passed the Kurdish village of Guzarek, situated not 50 yards from the Nestorian village of Gunduk. The water from the stream is distributed with such care among the terraces and crops that below the village the stream had entirely disappeared. Some small water mills were seen where oil was being pressed from walnuts, and villagers were now gathering them from the trees. Marching for an hour through this fertile district, we came to another well wooded spot round the Nestorian village of Churub, where we halted. The Nestorians in these mountains may be distinguished from the Kurds by the former, both men and women having their hair plaited into two long tails down the back, while the latter have their heads shaved. 3rd October .—Left the village, and threaded our way along a narrow path through some terraced orchards: the walls on either hand were so narrow that the mules frequently knocked their loads against them. After marching for an hour all vegetation disappeared, the torrent became dry, and no path was traceable through the stones. We followed the dry bed of the stream among boulders through a gorge with perpendicular sides of immense height looking quite inaccessible. Flowing from our right we crossed a small stream, a tributary of the Anthrad. On the slopes were two small villages, one Kurd and the other Nestorian, surrounded by terraces of cultivation from the stream. The name of the Kurdish village is Jessi and the Nestorian Berj. For two hours we descended a winding path following the left side of the valley about half way up the slope. A few dwarf oaks were dotted about the hillside for a short way, and then the valley grew bare again. The panorama in front of us is something like that seen from the summit of the last ridge before entering the plain of Van. It is the same chaos of mountain peaks, but higher still, and more jagged along their summits. We turn up over a spur leaving the valley of the Anthrad, and from the summit the general aspect of the country seems to change. The soil looks more fertile, and the grass and shrubs on the slope soften the universal greyish tint that covers the hills which we have just left..*■ 118 The descent from the ridge is no easier than the ascent, and at the foot of the slope we entered another valley in which flowed a stream called the Belat Su, which flowed west to the Great Zab. It was now noon, and we halted under a tree in the valley. Some 500 yards distant down the valley on theria'ht bank of the torrent was a cliff of great heierht, along the face of which, for about 50 yards, ran the remains of an ancient acqueduct, of which 5 or 6 arches still remained. One is tempted to ask on seeing these ruins when and by whom were they completed and why are they now thus in ruins. After resting a few minutes, we ascended the opposite slope of the valley, and after an hour’s climb we reached the gardens which surrounded the village of Thai, a somewhat important centre where was a kaimmakam and a small post of zaptiyahs. We passed through the village composed of 50 miserable huts built one above the other on the eastern slope of a hill which rises immediately to our right. The little courtyards of the houses were filled with chopped straw at this season of the year. The inhabitants seemed inhospitable and inclined to rob our baggage, so at 3 p.m. we pushed on again. On leaving gardens we descended a bare rocky valley, passing a few low ash trees which produced a kind of berry in great quantities which the inhabitants gather and eat. The valley winds a good deal, and our track leads through a thicket of low shrubs dotted with junipers and low oaks. At last at a sudden turn of the road the waters of the Great Zab again broke into view. It has now become an imposing stream with green, fertile banks, dotted with sycamore and low shrubs. At 5 p.m. (2 hours from Thai) we reached the river bank and turned along a path by the waters edge for about a mile, when we arrived at a wooden bridge. The ends of the bridge are a framework of timbers one projecting beyond the other, while the floor of the bridge in the centre was only loose hurdles and these full of holes. The mules absolutely refused to cross it, so they had to be unloaded, and the baggage passed over by hand. _ river was too deep and the bed too rocky to ford, so a suitable place was found where the animals were swum across. At 9-30 p.m. we encamped with some Kurds who had lit large fires to keep the pigs and bears from eating up their crops. 4th October .— Left Camp at 7-0 a m., and forded an affluent on the right bank nearly as broad as the Zab itself. We ascended the slope of the right bank of this through a wood of fine oaks. Numerous traces of wild pig were seen who had come to eat the acorns. The highest trees are only from 18 to 20 feet high. There are several varieties of oaks, and on some was seen Manna, a kind of resinous deposit on the leaves. The true “ rahat-l-lakum ” is made from this. ihe road keeps through the wood for two hours, when the trees suddenly cease and a rocky hill side commences, which the road ascends. Prom the top of this ridge a fine view was obtainable of the plateau of Amadiyeh, this being the last ridge of the mountain district through which we have been passing. Immediately below us is a deep ravine down which a rough slippery path leads to the gardens of Amadiyeh, which are at the mouth of it. Figs, pomegranates, and grapes were now ripe in the gardens. The climate is much warmer now on leaving the mountains.

Most of the ranges are passable for pack animals in all directions. Another road, which we followed on Route IX, makes a detour to the west through Daoudiyeh. There are 5 stages on this, making a total of 105 miles. It is easy, passable for field guns, and leads through a very fertile country.

Kurds in the Greater Zab Valley and south-west of Amadiyeh. Berwari .—This is a large district north of Amadiyeh, said to contain 50 villages of Berwari Kurds, and few of Nestorian Christians. It is a region of comparatively low-wooded hills, cut up by ravines which drain towards the Khabur. Bahdinan. —To the south and west of Amadiyeh is Bahdinan, a district comprising the mountain ranges south of the Ghara Daghas far as Mosul plain, and from Dohuk south-east towards the Zab. The Dosti who number SO villages, south of Daoudiyeh, is the principal tribe in Bahdinan. Each village may be taken as about 30 houses.120 There are no Christian villages among them ; and these tribes are noted robbers and extremely fanatical, not permitting Christians to even pass through their country. An instance of this may be quoted from our own experience. A small caravan with 10 mideteers, all Christians, on their way from Amadiyeh to Mosul joined us at Daoudiyeh, and asked leave to accompany us as otherwise they would have to make a wide detour by Zakho to avoid the Dosti country, through which they were afraid to pass. At the end of the stage their mules being empty, they pushed on, but next day we overtook them by the roadside in a pitiable condition having been waylaid and robbed mean while. This is a common instance of the treatment the Christians are accus tomed to receive from the Kurds. The Dosti are partially nomad and have their “ zozan, M or summer quar ters, in the hills east of Tkhoma and the Pinianish district. Some of these were met on their way to the hills. They were in rags and had scarcely enough baggage animals to carry their tents and scanty belongings. Most of it was piled on the backs of the women. Shaikh Muhammad of Bamurni in the Supna Valley is a man of consider able influence among the Berwari and Bahdinan Kurds. He is a religious Shaikh, possessing much political influence as well. There were said to be 100 Kurdish villages in Bahdinan. Misuri .—These Kurds inhabit the country adjoining the Zab valley immediately east and south-east of Amadiyeh. They are divided into two sections—Misuri Jori or Upper and Misuri Geri or Lower. The Upper Misuri are sedentary, and have their villages in the Gurajar Dagh and mountains immediately north of the Zab Valley at Latka and Ashkufa. The Lower Misuri live in the hilly districts of the Ghara Dagh south of the Zab at Latka, and also in villages round Spindari. A shaikh possessing considerable influence among this tribe lives at Birif Khan, in the Ghara Dagh. Nerwi .—These Kurds are in the mountain districts north of the Zab near Rezan and Shirwan. They are sedentary, numbering 13 villages. Rekani .—To the north-west of the Nerwi are Rekani, also sedentary, in 8 villages. Beruz .—On the Shirindari Dagh immediately north of the Zab Valley at Bila Keupri and Rezan are the Beruz in 10 villages high up the mountain slopes. Zebari .—There were once a large and powerful tribe with head-quarters at Bila Keupri. They extend all along the Zab Valley in several scattered villages from the Berdin gorge, Begil, the Piris Dagh, and Bila Keupri, to Alura and Latka, near Amadiyeh. They are now much reduced in numbers, and said to have only 20 villages. Shaikh Muhammad of Begil is a very influential man among the Zebari. Futha Ala at Latka and Shaikh Nouii of Shinea are some of their Shaikhs. At Kala Hukher was a strong stone fort, now dismantled, which belonged to Zaro, a Zebari chief, whose robberies were the terror of the district 12 years ago, after which the Turks captured and imprisoned him at Mosul. Some Nestorian Christians, not more than 50 or 60 families altogether, are scattered among the Zebari in the Zab Valley near Bila Keupri. There are several Jews in Begil, Amada, and Akra. There was a deserted church at Heren which bore many round shot marks on the walls—a remembrance of the time when Muhammad Pasha of Mosul overran the Zebari District, about 30 years ago.Route No IX.—Amadiyeh to Mosul via Daoudiyeh and Dohuk. 3rd to 7th June.

Leaving Kwaneh (2,775') at 4-45 A M., we followed a track rounding the southern end of the Amadiyeh plateau. We crossed several ravines, containing gravelly soil, interspersed with ledges of sandstone nearly horizontal; which cut deep in the clay soil, and run south towards the head-waters of the Ghara. The country is rough, but a passable road for guns could be found. At 3^ miles cross the Rudbar Amadiyeh, a large stream which flows from Amadiyeh gardens (2,635') round the west side of the plateau southward towards the Ghara. Several mills were seen. The banks were lined with walnut, poplar, sycamore and ash, and the slopes cultivated in terraces of rice and wheat. Several small clusters of houses were scattered along the stream bank—some Kurdish and some Christian. A small two-arched masonry bridge crosses the stream. The road ascends immediately, crossing some gravelly spurs, mostly bare and uncultivated, from the range to the north. This range is a continuation of the bare rocky ridge above Amadiyeh. It is called here the Ser-i-Amadiyeh (Ainsworth calls it the Matineh Dagh). It continues west-north-west for some 20 miles. On the north side of it lies the Berwari district. Bebat .—At 5 miles pass Bebat, one of several small villages situated close to the foot of the range, where a spring gives the necessary water for cultiva tion. A group of orchards with poplars and sycamores surrounds the village, and the hillside is cultivated with wheat and rice in terraces. Our road leads nearly due west, crossing several small streams running south. Snpna Valley .—To the south the valley is now from 6 to 8 miles wide, and is known as the Supna Valley. It is much cut up by deep ravines. The Ghara Dagh to the south is a series of low wooded ridges with long spurs. At 7^ miles skirt round the south end of a plateau similar in shape to Amadiyeh but smaller and lower. A long flat-topped spur extends across the valley from it. Biriazan .—Half a mile to the north-east is Biriazan (3,100'), a small Kurdish village similar to Bebat. Our road by keeping close to the Ser-i- Amadiyeh avoids the deeper ravines to the left. Pass Kadesik, a Kurdish village to the south, and Anishik (3,210'), a large Christian village on the hillside to the north.122 The soil gradually improves, being a reddish gravelly loam. Wheat on the uplands and rice in the valleys ax*e the chief crops. Several streams weie crossed flowing north to south. As we go on the valley becomes dotted with trees, with orchards round the villages. Some good grass, mostly clover, was passed through. Large herds of cattle and a few sheep also noticed. Arndina .—At 14 mdes pass Aradina (3,560'), a large Christian village on a stream from the Ser-i-Amadiyeh. It produces tobacco and silk in some quantity. The people are very industrious, far more so than the Kurds in the same district Large quantities of rice and wheat iu terraces on the slope beloiv the village. A road leads from here across the valley, joining our route again near the Pir-i-Daoudiyeh. It crosses some deep ravines in the centre of the valley. At 17 miles passed Bamurni, a small Kurdish village on the hillside 2 miles to the right, near which is the residence of Shaikh Muhammad, a Shaikh of the Bahdinan Kurds, a man of much religious influence. His house is in a large orchard on the hillside by a spring. The road commences now to trend across the valley to the S.W. The slopes of the ravines are dotted with a few low oaks. Across the valley to the south were a series of undulations, the slopes covered with vineyards. Daottdiyeh. —Cross a fertile plateau, and at 22 miles halt in Daoudiyeh (3,015'), a small Kurdish village, where a kaimmakam lives. There is a small mud fort close by, now half in ruins. This situation at the edge of a flat spur overlooking the ravines to the south is a good one to bar the passage of the road. The watershed between the head-waters of the Ghara flowing towards the Zab and the streams which flow towards the Khabur is a very slight ridge about halfway from Amadiyeh. Routes from Daoudiyeh .—In the direction of Zakho the country is easy, said to contain several villages, and to be well cultivated, similar to the Supna valley. The path follows a small stream valley all the way. The total dis tance is two stages of six hours each or about 35 miles. The intermediate stage is Baraski village. To the north of Daoudiyeh, the Ser-i-Amadiyeh Range is a steep (&lt; razor- edged ^ ridge of limestone. A track leads over it to Ashitha, and from there to Julamerk, but it is very rough and ditticulc, and seldom xised. Julamerk is said to be six days distant, and caravans usually follow the route through Amadiyeh. No difficulties were experienced on our route today for the passage of guns, and it looks easy the remaining distance to Zakho also. Weather cloudy and overcast in the morning; temperature 54° at 5-0 a.m., and 79° at noon. A thunderstorm came on at 2 p.m., with a sudden violent storm of wind from the north-west, lasting only quarter of an hour, but level ling every tent as it passed. Heavy showers continued till midnight; with high wind and clouds in the morning. 4th June.—General direction, S.W. Descend steeply from the village, a broad grassy slope. Several vineyards and low shrubs on the hillsides, with a few terraces of wheat. After 2 miles the steep descent ceases. At the foot of a narrow valley we forded a large stream flowing in a direction 333° towards the Khabur. There is a crazy bridge (2,500'), constructed partly of masonry and partly of wood ; the muleteers preferred to ford a little above it. This stream joins the Khabur and flows past Zakho.A small ravine enters the stream near the bridge; and we follow the right hank Another track takes the left bank, said to be easier, bet does not look it. For 1 ^ miles from the bridge the road is rough, crossing several small ravines with steep clay sides will: a gradual ascend. The general direction is 219° from Daoudiyeh. , A little widening and some zigzags cut in this soft soil would make this portion practicable for artillery. The soil is rich, with several vineyards and the slopes dotted with low oaks and shrubs. _ . In this district are the Doski Kurds, numbering 30 villages in all. Zaoaka .—At H miles pass Zaouka (3,3950, a small Kurdish village, after which the road improved, and we followed a broad track rounding a woo ec ridge, an outlier from a higher rocky range to the west, beveral flocks of sheep seen on the hillside. Amadiyeh from here bears 79 and Daoudiyeh 3o , and a line view can be obtained up and down the Supna valley. To the south are several deep wooded ravines converging in the direction ot the Daoudiyeh stream. At the summit of the incline crossed a grassy plateau dotted with oaK proves, forming the watershed between the Daoudiyeh stream and the streams flowing into the Tigris near Mosul. On the higher slopes to the west of this plateau are several vineyards. , At 9£ miles passed through a gap (3,235') in the rocky ridge of the main rano-e. This is the Ghara Dagh, and runs 85° and 277 , covered with low trees to the summit. The gap through which the road leads is 300 yards wide, with a small stream flowing south, and on either hand steep limestone chits. From the gap commence descending the west side of a broad stream valley following an easy track through trees and undergrowth. UarasigeL—The valley is from 1 to U miles wide, increasing as we descend. To the east are several long side valleys in . which are Serkun, Ourgha, Barasiyeh, small Kurdish villages surrounded by orchards and terraces ot cultivation. Stacks of wood cut in 6 'to 8 ' lengths were seen piled by tie houses ready to be carried into Mosul for building purposes. The stream banks have a few patches of cultivation, and are lined wit : sycamore, ash, and willow trees. Several herds of cattle were grazing on the hillsides. . To the east the slopes are easy; but to the west they are steep and impiac- tieable. There is plenty of good grass, and the valley is well watered by several side streams. At 15 miles from Daoudiyeh the valley narrows, and the road leads through a o-orge between sandstone cliffs 100 yards wide. It is a made ledge 10 to 12 ^cut in the soft sandstone for a short distance, and is quite practicable for guns (2,615'). The whole of this district and to the south-east is known as Bahdinan. _ , j j Through this we emerge almost immediately into a rough wooded country much cut up by small ravines. A valley about 1 ^ miles wide trends up 110 to a col, over which there seems an easy passage. A few villages of Dosti Kurds lie in this direction, and some vineyards were seen on a reddish loam soil. Still following the stream we cross the lower end of this valley by a rough track, capable of being improved into a good road for guns. The stream here passes to the left through a very narrow rift in the ridge to the south called the Haitut Pass. This opens into the Zawiheh Valley in which on a prominent spur is the large village of the same name. A rough footpath leads through this, but is little used. Our road keeps more to the south-east, crossing the same ridge by the Duriah Badah Pass. The lower slopes are rough, and the124 trpps and brushwood require clearing. The ascent of the pass follows a dry i ocky ravine, and the road is paved in some places. The summit of pass is 8 415'. lie road winds a good deal, but is never narrower than 8 feet, and bv removing some of the larger stones and smoothing the places worn by the rain, it could be soon made passable for artillery. Steep rocky crags rise on either side; but the summit is a rounded clay slope and then a gentle des cent down a broad spur. Deep clay ravines with very steep sides run towards the Zawiheh Valley to the south of the Haitut Pass. There are few trees now, but several large vineyards and wheat fields 2( . J5 e l ' 0cky r ;%e crossed at the Duriah Badah Pass extends in a direction ^b5 tor some 20 miles, and looks quite impassable along tills length, beino- a steep bare wall of rock as far I could see. Eastwards it runs “ At 22 miles halted in Bada (3,0*5'), a Kurdish village, on the edo-e 0 f a narrow ravine Mowing west-north-west. This is a very fertile district! pro ducing large quantities of raisins for the Mosul market. Water-supply from a small spring in the ravine, slightly sulpbu rous in taste. ^eather bright today, with occasional clouds. Temperature 60°at 4-30 a.m., and 70 at noon. Of this stage there are two portions which would require improvino- for 6 passage of guns, viz., the first 3 miles on the left bank of the LW (Jiyeh stream and some portions of the Duriah Badah Pass. 5th June. General direction, S.W. Left the village and descended gradually in a direction nearly west, following the bank of a small stream. U e passed .^ish vdlage of Sundur, and skirted round the end of a steep ndge to the left ( 2 ,o 00 ); the slopes covered with vineyards. To the right is a deep stream valley, ana on the opposite slope of the hill are three small Kurdish villages—Zewa, Chista, and Guntak, all in the kairnmakamlik of Daoudiveh 1 lie road is broad and easy with a slight descending gradient. Several jets of sulphuretted hydrogen along the stream bank which make the water heavy and bad, but drinkable. The grass on the hillsides gets more burnt up as we descend towards Dohuk nnd trees entirely disappear. This is said to be a turbulent district and parties o. men armed with long guns and “ hangars” were met, and in the caravans every man was armed. T iV^ At , 9 T le , s entM the Do| -K 1 ' Pass (1,650'), a dip in the rocky Jabai Abiadh through which the stream passes. in, T 11 ! c P , a t SS is 1 300 yards loYl £- The road follows the left bank, and is a ledo- e 10 to 15 broad cut out of the soft rock. The bridge at the south end of the pass is broken, and the stream has to be ford.-d. This would be difficult in spring when the water was high. A small cliff prevents the road keeping to the left bank. 1 0 Dohuk.—F ord the stream again 500 yards lower, and reach Dohuk (L630') } mi ^ s from Bada. It is a place of 1,000 houses, with a mixed population of about 5,000, and is a sort of frontier town between the Kurds of the hills and the Arabs of the plains. The population consists of Arabs, Kurds, Chris- tians, Jews, and Yezidis Nearly half, that is about 2,000, are Jews; there are 200 Christians, and the remainder Kurds, Arabs with a few Yezidis. A e ure i, several mosques, a synagogue and a Yezidi shrine, all exist in this place. 1 here is a large well-supplied bazar for the size of the place. The chief trade is in wheat and barley, dried fruits, and raisins with Mosul. ' kammiakam and 100 zaptiyahs are quartered here. There is a small stone castellated building at the north end of the place, overlooking the outlet tiorn the pass. It is now in a bad state of repair.125 For about 4 , miles behind Dohuk a wide valley extends in a direction 110 °, thick v planted with vineyards and fig orchards. A track leads over the ridt ItthThead of this valley in the Alkosh direction. It rs very rough and on vr hnt is somewhat shorter than the road we took. the banks of the stream for 2 miles below Dohuk are lined wi i vege a 8a ''The hes? drinking water is from some springs at the south end of the Dorgh Pass, as the water from the stream is tainted by the sulphur spnngs h.gher UP On leaving Dohuk our road continues across a level plain in a direction a litth? north of west. The soil is fertile, and there js a w,de belt ot wheat crops round Dohuk. The harvest was being cut and gathered no . \t It miles ford the Dohuk stream to the left bank : the stieam ^ea is nar^w with a gravelly bottom and sunk 15' to 20 ' below the level of the plain, so that it cannot be used to irrigate the plain. Several large spn g were passed on the left bank near the fold. ^ , , p i here a At 154 miles we turned sharp round the end of the Dohuk lali, here steep stony 'ridge which bounds the Dohuk valley to the south-west, and which ends abruptly on the bank of the Dohuk stream. From the Several rock hewn caves were seen high up the face of the cliff. From the emUf the range a broad track led 185' across the plain to Gurrapahan, where it met. the post road into Mosul from Jaairah(s« Hon e X). This is level and easy going all the way : it would be the easiest “'Tear Gurrapahan this road rounds the end of a long rocky spur jutting out into the plain similar to the Dohuk thigh. . ,, , _„„ n ii 0 i We took another route through Alkosh, and turned south-east pafallel to the base of the Dohuk Dagh. Several caravans of mules and yabus were met GhiGilv of Kurds belonging to the hill districts we had pist lett. Lveiy m, itf't.lie 'eamvan had .Song gun, and some a gun and long curved sword or ‘•h in&lt;&gt;-ar This is unusual, and points to an insecure state of the to i t y. ^/L.-At 18 miles a halt was made at Zahoa (1,500'), a small village at the foot of the rocky slope of the Dohuk Dagh. This range runs &lt;J5» to a knot of rocky hills wh,eh overlook Alkosh The inhabitants of Zahoa are of the Arab type, a sudden change iiom the Ku . they speak an Arabic dialect and not Rermanji. , / i • ^ q. n d tastes W ater is from springs, slightly bitter and unpleasant to dunk, and tastes evcrvttiing cooked m it* Tim soil of the plain is very fertile ; only about one- third was under cultivation, mostly wheat and barley, which grows wltho t 'Ttrier pleasant with a strong wind from the north-west, with clouds and light showers. Temperature 81' at noon. Temperature increased, and air is more sultry since we left the hills. 6 th June—General direction, S.E. Left Zahoa at 4-45 A.M., and started across a level plain in a direction 138 . , c /vP Zenia, Marashi and three other Yezidi villages were seen along the foot of the Dohuk Dagh to the north. A few fig trees grow round them, otherwise the plain is quite treeless.

The stream bed (1,610') is sunk too low to allow the plain being irrigated. The road is very rough and over slabs of rock in places, and would require improving to pass guns through. ^ Shinaioa. At tne mouth of the pass is the small Yezidi village of Shinawa. The road turned east from the pass along the foot of the rido-e to the north. Alkosh. —At 13 miles Alkosh was reached (1,800'). It is a place of l,o 00 houses situated partly on the slope of the hill. The houses are built of a species of concrete of gypsum embedded with small round stones. No wood is used, and the ceilings are arches turned with cement. The houses are built under, in, and on each other in a most perplexing way. The stieets aie nairow, fairly clean, and as a whole the town has a smart and bustling appearance. The bazar is small and straggling. All round the out skirts were piled large stacks of wheat ready for threshing. There is a good trade with Mosul, carried on by small mule caravans, carrying wheat and barley, the inhabitants are exclusively Christians, numbering about 7,000 ; of these about two-thirds are of the New Chaldean sect, and the remainder Papal Chaldean. Alkoy-h Monastery.-—To the south-east, H miles farther along foot of the hilb, is the Monastery of Alkosh. It contains a small chapel and rooms for the monks, of which there are here 25, including the head priest, who is an Ita lian ; the remainder being taken from the Papal Christians of the district. The monks own large tracts of land about Alkosh, Tal Ouskof, and Tal Kaif r and have several flocks of sheep and cattle, besides vineyards on the upper slopes of the hill. ' r Robbaa Eormvz About two-thirds of the way up the rocky hillside to the north is the Monastery of liabban Hormuz. The hill is very precipitous, and a narrow winding staircase leads up the last 300 feet. The chapel and most of the buildings are excavated in the rock, a whitish limestone. Each monk when not engaged in devotional exercises cuts his cell and rooms out of vaiious parts of the rock, to which little stairs lead. They are expected to dig theii graves out of the rock as well. An excellent red wine is made by the monks from their vineyards, and a typical old Simon the Cellarer brought forth a jug on our arrival. They are of the order of St. Anthony, with strict observances. Young priests are educated here, and on coming of ao&gt; e are given their choice of remaining or going out into the ministry. The range on which the monastery is built is steep and rocky on its southern slope and rises 1 000 to 1,500 feet above the level of the plain. Mar Mattel is a monastery on the same range some 15 miles to the south-east and built in a somewhat similar position : there are said to be 365 cells there, also cut out of the rock The monks there are of the New Chaldean sect. Left the Alkosh convent at 12-15 p.m., having been entertained by the hospitable monks. The road over the plain is a 12 ' to 15' track over slight undulations, and is easy going all the way to Mosul. &amp; The soil is a rich loam, and grows wheat without irrigation. Indian corn and melons are grown in the hollows. Very little water is met with now, and the streams are slightly brackish by the gypsum strata passed here and mere. n 7 A ^??n^ F ‘~ Afc 11 ^ miles £l ' 0m Alkosh balt ed in the village of Tal Uuskot ( 1 ,-iOU). °This is a place of 1,000 houses with a population of about 5,000 ; the houses are built of stone and cement similar to Alkosh. The inhabitants are a mixture of New Chaldeans and Papal Chaldeans. The dress of the Christian women in these villages is peculiar, and distinguishes them at once from those of other sects. It consists of a blue skirt bound round the waist with a red girdle, ornamented in front with silver buckles. A red cotton shawl is suspended over one shoulder and hangs down in front like an apron. A small red turban is wound round the head; the hair is plaited in long tails, which reach to within a foot of the ground, where they end off in two or three coloured tufts of wool. A string of coins, generally of silver, is worn round the neck and forehead. These Chaldeans area sturdy and very industrious race : these villages have a far cleaner and more bustling appearance than Kurdish or Yezidi villages in the same district. Most of the work of gathering the harvest and tending the flocks is done by Yezidis, who have no objection to being servants to Chris tians. At Alkosh Monastery all the outdoor servants were Yezidis. They prefer a Christian to a Musalman master. The water-supply here is from three wells, each about 6 feet diameter, and containing water 20 feet below the surface. They are all slightly bitter, and one was at present in use for the whole village for drinking purposes.^ Two small embankments were drawn across hollows in the undulations to collect rain water. A little muddy water remained in one of these, which was eagerly being scooped up for cooking purposes. Tea made from brackish well water is not pleasant. Uound the village were large heaps of corn in process of being threshed. This is done in the usual Eastern fashion with a “chum,” which is a sort of sledge with a roller having sharp iron teeth or prongs underneath. It is driven round in a circle over the spread-out corn by three horses or donkeys. Subsequently it is winnowed, and the grain separated from the chopped straw. A preparation of wheat called “burrul” is common here, and is generally found throughout Kurdistan : the grain is first boiled until it swells, and then put out in the sun until quite dry and hard. It is then put under a large stone roller about 6 feet in diameter which revolves in a sort of. trough. When the outer husk of the grain is taken off by the roller it is again boiled and then eaten. It has the appearance of rice, and tastes well. The people complained much of the locusts, which had been bad now for four successive years. A good deal of the wheat being threshed had been cut green, and was only good for straw; the grain being quite shrivelled. A small worm called “ Sin ” or “Sun” which gets into the grain does much damage, eating all the interior and leaving only the outer shell. This is said to be a healthy place; the bitterness of the water has no evil effects. The priest complained of the withdrawal of the English Consul from Mosul : they have to prefer their complaints now to the French Consul, whom they say has no influence. They wished for the day when the English were coming to take over the country. All they see of the Turkish Governmfent is the periodical visit of the tax-gatherer, and they get no benefit in return. Among other things they think Government ought to dig canals to give them pure water from the Tigris. These Christians are a very industrious, well-to-do people, and with a more enlightened government would no doubt double or treble the area of land they Kave now under cultivation.m Large flocks of sheep and herds of cattle and goats belong to the village; they pick up what they can along the stream banks. Two large Yezidi villages were visible from 5 to 6 miles to the south-east. Alkosh bears 358° from here looking back. Weather hot in the middle of the day, and the glare unpleasant from the bare dusty road, temperature 88 ° in Alkosh convent at noon and 91° at 3 p.m. in my tent. At 5 a.m. it had fallen to 61°. The nights were cool. 7th June — General direction, S. Left Tal Ouskof at 5-30 a.m., following a broad well worn track over an undulating plain. At miles Batinai was passed, a place of 250 houses, and at miles Talkaif, a large place of 1,500 houses. Both these are Christian, a mixture of Papal and New Chaldeans. The houses are built of stone set in a kind of gypsum cement like those of Tal Ouskof. The watei’-supply is rain water caught in small ponds, and a few wells. At 16 miles a small branch of the Tigris was skirted, and at Is miles the boat bridge across the Tigris at Mosul was crossed [see Route X) and the town reached. Large stretches of good land were passed uncultivated. ►MOSUL. Mosul is the principal town of Upper Mesopotamia and capital of the 'Waliat of that name. Its position both strategically and commercially is very important. Towards it converge several important routes—(1) from. Baghdad through Kifri and Erbil ; (2) from West Persia through Rawan- duz; (3) from Sulaimaniah and south-east Kurdistan through Kui Sanjak; (4) from Van and Bashkala by the Zab valley and Amadiyeh; (5) from Erzerum, Mush and t he Armenian plateau by Bitlis, Sairdt, Jazirah, and Zakho; ( 6 ) irom Diarbekr either across the desert from Nisibin or through Midiyat and Oazirah or Nisibin Jazirah and Zakho. From Diarbekr an excellent cart road exists through Kharput and Siwas to the Black Sea at Samsun, and easy roads lead to Aleppo and Sakanderun on the Mediterranean. Thus as a commercial centre Mosul presents advantages of no common order, and were its old position on the main route between India and the Mediterranean restored by the construction of through railways it would again rapidly increase in size and importance. Ail important schemes for railways from west to east are projected to pass through Mosul. It is a town of about 40,000 inhabitants on the right bank of the Tigris ; some estimates giving 50,000. The inhabitants are mostly Musalman of the Sunni faith. There are Christians of various persuasions estimated as follows: 20 liouses of Protestants. I 500 of Jacobites. 500 of Catholic Syrians. j 350 of Jews. 600 of Chaldeans, both Papal and New sects, making a total of about 7,000 Christians and 1,500 Jews. There are no Nestorians except a few who come in to pick up work and then return to their villages. About 50 years ago they were very numerous in the town. The English Consul was removed in 1887; since then there is an Agent, Mr. Nimrod Rassam, a nephew of the well-known explorer of Nineveh and assistant of Sir A. Layard. The Agency is under the Baghdad Residency. There are also Consuls for Russia and France. The houses are built of a con crete of stone set in cement made of the gypsum and lime which is procurable from the country round. But little wood is used, the ceiling being usually an arch turned in the concrete. The best houses are built round a courtyard in the centre into which the rooms and the diwan open. The doorposts are often made of ornamented carved gypsum looking like marble. There are “ Serdabs,” or rooms under the ground floor, where the people retire in the midday heat in summer. Water-supply is either brought from the Tigris in skins on the hack of ponies or from small wells in the courtyards of the houses. The wells are brackish and the river water is the best for drinking. It is very muddy, but when filtered it is sweet and wholesome and is several degrees cooler than the air in floods because of the melting snows in the mountains. Ice or rather pressed snow is brought in from the hills and sold in the bazar. The bazar is a large and bustling one, but not arched over with brick like Baghdad and Kermanshah. Leafy boughs only are placed across overhead to keep off the sun. As u=ual ; each trade has its own place. A very mixedcrowd jostle one another in the streets; Arabs, Kurds, Jews, Christians, and Mosulis. The streets are narrow and paved with round stones which make them very slippery. There are three large serais in the town with very fair accom modation. Crowded round the toll bar at the bridge were hundreds of nomad Kurds with their flocks waiting to pay toll and pass over. They are taxed by the number of sheep they possess. They winter in the plains to the west and are now on their way to the hills. They are mostly nomads from Jabal Sin jar. Seen from the opposite or left bank, the town rises slightly in the centre on a natural mound. There are seven gates. On the east the Bab-es-Sinjar, on the south-west the Bab-al-Baidhti, at the south corner the Bab-al-Irak, along the south-east face the Bab-al-Lagish, Bab-es-Serai and Bab-al-Tup, and overlooking the bridge Bab-al-Jisr. The French Consulate is 1| miles from the Bab-es-Serai on the river bank in a small garden {see plan). The walls are from 15 / to 20 / high, 3 feet thick at the top and 4 / to 6 / at the bottom, with a dry ditch about 15 yards wide and 10 feet deep outside filled up with debris and sand in several places. There is no covered way or glacis capable of defence as at Baghdad. The walls are of sun-dried bricks and have much crumbled away, while in places they have been removed altogether and the ditch levelled. There is a ruined citadel overlooking the bridge head from the north. The walls were built as a defence against raids of the Shammar Arabs some years ago. To the north of the town the walls enclose a large open space. Lime is burnt in numerous kilns outside the gates. To the south-east, outside the Bab-es-Serai, is a large open space used as a market for animals where fairs are held. On the river bank, f mile south of the town, are the barracks and the Government offices of the Pasha. This is called the Serai and consists of one large two-storied building built round an interior court; a fine looking place, but rather dilapidated. There are four bat talions of the 6 th Army Corps, numbering about 4U0 men each, quartered here. An attempt was made to plant an avenue of trees to the Serai from the town, but it failed. The entire absence of gardens of any sort is very noticeable in Mosul. There is a Governor of the town, Hamdi Beg, as well as the Pasha of the Wailat, Muhammad Tashin Pasha, who has his headquarters here. The Dominican Mission has a printing press at which they can print in the Arabic, Armenian, Syriac and Chaldaic characters. There are 8 monks and 12 sisters. Most of the higher officials in Mosul speak French; Arabic, and Kirmanji is most spoken in the town; and Turkish only by officials. In Mosul the Musalmans venerate many local saints. Mar Girgis, or St. George, for instance, is their patron saint as well as of the Christians. The tomb of the prophet Nahum is at Alkosh, whither the Jews make an annual pilgrimage. Nabbi Yunus ,—The tomb of Jonah the prophet is at Nabbi Yunus near a large mosque on a mound opposite the south-east corner of the town on the left bank. Several Yezidi tombs with their curious fluted conical spires are also to be seen. There is also a leaning minaret bending itself, of course, in the direction of Mecca.131 The Telegraph Office is at the south-east corner of the town and has direct communication with Baghdad and Constantinople e egrap is. through Jazirah and Diarbekr, with Rawanduz through Erbil and Sulaimaniah through Kirkuk. . Telegrams can be sent in Roman letters. They are better sent in Irencli than in English as most of the officials know French. # . The wires bifurcate from the east end of the bridge, one going in the Baghdad direction and two towards Jazirah. The Post passes through from Baghdad to Constantinople once a week. Mosul Bridge.—The bridge of Mosul is partly masonry and partly a boat bridge. . , , , The main channel runs along the west bank, and this is crossed by the boat bridge. In the centre of the riverbed is a broad, gravelly island covered at higirfloods and crossed by the masonry bridge ; and at the east end of this is a small channel, which at high water has to be forded. In front of the Babal Jisr gate is a strong masonry pier jutting out 32 yards into the stream; on which is the toll bar. , The boat bridge consists of 18 pontoons and is 123 yards long with a road way of 24 / made of rough wooden planking ; each pontoon ^is flat bottomed and 26' long by 10' wide, the interval between each being 10'. At the east end of the boat bridge is another pier and ramp 46 yards long leading to the stone bridge. The masonry bridge is 278 yards long built of brick faced with sandstone and seems fairly well built. The roadway is 16' wide. There are 29 arches, all of 20' span, but of two patterns. Eleven at the east end are higher in the springing of the arch and have only low cutwaters to the piers. ie other 18 have high cutwaters. The whole has an incongruous appearance and looks typically Turkish. Two French Engineers built the stone portion, but declined to try to bridge the main channel. The ramp at the east end is 52 yards long with three small arches and is much worn by the rush of water round it. Beyond this is a strip of gravelly riverbed 145 yards wide covered at high floods. On the 7th June some 40 yards had to be forded here, and the boat budge had only been fixed up a week previous because of high floods. When the bridge is swung back the crossing is made in ferry boats, of which there are five available. They are 20 * long and 10 / broad with a high gunwale and bow, and the stern cut down within a foot of the water to let animals get in and out easily. They are propelled by two long paddles. They can each take four laden mules. Camels have a great objection to a boat bridge and crossing them is tedious work. Both here and at Jazirah sopie of them took fright and leaped into the water. With a good camel leading they will go easily, but if frightened they all start running. The bridge would take artillery if guns were passed over siagly- When we arrived the river was high with a current of 4 to 5 miles an hour; the main channel was some 15'to 2(F deep. The total width of the riverbed at the bridge is 675 yards, and there is generally a deep water channel 150 to 200 yards wide on the west bank. The principal traffic down stream to Baghdad is done on rafts of skins Rafts called “ kalaks.” It is the quickest way for travellers- Rafts do not ascend the river, and trade from Baghdad to Mosul follows the post road through Kifri, Kirkuk and Erbil. s 2The wood for rafts is floated down here from Diarbekr, Sairdt and the wooded country north of Jazirah. At Baghdad the raft is broken up and the wood sold at a remunerative price. Rafts are of various sizes, usually of about 200 skins, sometimes of 400. This was the end of the sheep shearing season, and several large rafts of wool were about to start. The raft is made of a framework of two layers of logs placed crosswise over the skins and bound together with ropes and branches ; the deck is usually covered with bitumen. In the flood season in March and April, the voyage to Baghdad can be done in 4 or 5 days with a loaded raft. In the low season it takes longer, generally as much as 10 to 12 days. The rafts are built just below the bridge on the right bank where poles are kept ready stacked. r Y!\\e. Euphrates steamer in 1839, under Lieutenant Lynch, surmounted all difficulties and reached as high as the Zikr-ul-Ahwaz Bund, some 20 miles below Mosul. There would be no difficulty in removing this and the river would then be navigable to Mosul. Messrs. Lynch's present steamers, which are far more powerful than the Euphrates, would find no difficulty in reach- ino* Mosul, if the necessary permission would be obtained from the Turkish Government. The Captains of both the steamers thought the project quite feasible. [See description of Tigris above Baghdad ) Between Mosul and Jazirah there are no rapids, and there is a deep channel and suitable for the river steamers all the way. From a strategical as well as commercial point of view, it would be a point of immense advantage that our steamers should know the river and have the right of navigation as far as Jazirah. The idea of starting a Turkish line of steamers between Mosul and Bagh dad was being talked about here. It has several times been mooted, but the necessary capital has not been forthcoming. The principal merchant in Mosul is a Christian, named Abdul Hadr Shukur, assisted by his three brothers. They are agents for Messrs. Lynch Brothers of Baghdad, and he does most of the trade in cotton stuff and English goods with that place. A large trade chiefly in wool, &amp;c., is done, by caravans to Aleppo and Sakandemn. Scarves worn by the Kurds are all of cotton from the Aleppo looms. In spring time droves of cattle are started from Shustar and Dizful and driven along : the bank of the Tigris to Mosul, grazing as they go. From here they are passed on to Sakanderun, where they are shipped for Malta and Egypt. The best rice round Mosul is grown in the Navkur plain and round Akra. Complaints were made of the Hamawands on the Sulaimaniah road, having recently looted £200 of treasure. There is also a considerable trade with Persia following the Rawanduz route. The climate of Mosul is very dry, the great heat in summer is debilitating, and what with the general insanitary condition of the Climate. narrow streets the inhabitants look pale and unheal- l; I .j V • The Mosul “button' is a kind of sore like the Aleppo button and the Baohdad “ date mark.' Ophthalmia is very prevalent. The dryness of the climate is chiefly owing to the entire want of trees or gardens and the proximity of the desert.138 The following notes of temperatures, &amp;c., were taken in doors at Mosul: Instrument. 8th June. 10th June. 11th June. 13th June. 14th June. 9-0 A M. 8-0 A.M. 9-0 A.M.

A Maria Theresa dollar = 26 piastres; and are chiefly current among merchants. A rouble is nearly equal to a rupee, but only a few stray coins were seen. In out-of-the-way places they were refused, while the rupee was accepted everywhere. The Turkish Medijieh usually went for Jls. 2-8-0. 100 roubles are a fraction less than 100 rupees. Routes from Mosul. Route to Baghdad .—The more direct route following the river bank is not much followed by caravans. The spring time, when the grass is on the plain, is the best time to travel along it. There are no villages until Tekrit is reached, and no supplies are obtainable except from Arab nomads. Cameron gives following description of this route in 1879 : Ha started under the protection of Ferhan Fasha, the chief of the Shammar. 1st Stage .—To Hammam Ali, 4 hours, south of Mosul. The first part of the road lay along a perfect level and after 5 miles passed through low hills for a couple of miles, the muddy hanks of small streams being very slippery after the rain. There are sulphur springs at Hammam Ah, covered over by a ruinous building. Many people come here from Mosul to bathe. On the other hank of the river were the ruins of Nimrud. 2nd Stage .—Marched 8 § hours over fairly level country, the only break being at the beginning and ending of the march, when we changed from the lower alluvial plain bordering the river to the more elevated southern plain of Mesopotamia. The change was made by easy slopes; nothing remarkable all day except an ancient canal 30 feet wide : in the evening we encamped with Shaikh Azowi, a sub-chief of the Abu Hamed Arabs on the river bank. 3rd Stage.—In the morning passed some sulphur springs and bitumen ponds, after which kept along the lower plain, A few scrubby oaks and prickly shrubs of acacia were met with. Small parties of Jehour Arabs were met on the move, and soon after we passed cultivation irrigated by small channels from the river drawn up by bullock lifts. The sedentary Jebour Arabs who cultivate the ground are much despised by the Bedouins. # In four hours reached Kala Sherghat, the road being level except for half a mile, where we crossed a promontory running into the lower plain close to Wady Meksir. Kala Sherghat is the head-quarters of Ferhan Pasha, the chief of the Shammar Arabs. Only a few tents of Seoni nomad Arabs are to be seen here. It was once the site of the Assyrian city of Asshur. 4th Stage,-- Left Sherghat and gradually ascended the higher plain having the commencement of the Hamrin mountains between us and the river. The rise about 150 feet out of the plain. At noon halted at Bel-a-dij, a favourite camp ground where a wady broke through the hills. Thunderstorm with heavy rain filled the wady in the night. 5th Stage. Left camp crossing a country cut by wadys running in all directions and entered, a plain bounded on the east by the Hamrin. fiidge stretching* south and west further than eye could reach. Halted in a small Arab camp6th Stage .—Went twenty miles across plain, perfectly levd broken by occasional watercourses, reaching at the end of it a salt stream working its way through some low sandhills to the Tigris, which had just broken through the Hamriu Hills ; 5 miles farther on halted in a camp of Jebour Arabs close to the ruins of an ancient castle called Kala Mekrun. 7th Stage.—'R'ught hours’ marching took us to Tekrit, the road for the first half lying along the low land near the river and then rising about 70 feet to the higher level. Several small parties of men were met, marching north, who had come down on rafts and were carrying the skins of the rafts on donkies’ backs to Mosul, Tekrit was once an important place at a ferry over the Tigris, but is now a quantity of confused ruins and a few mean houses built of bricks from Roman ruins. Kouffahs seen here for the first time. 8th Stage .—Marched across an alluvial plain now. Passed the first grove of date trees near Dur. Plain quite level, except some distant hills to the north-east. Halted with some nomad Delim Arabs. 9th Stage .—Marched to Samara, or rather an island opposite it; passed some extensive ruins called Ashik. For miles along the left bank of the Tigris extend ruins of ancient buildings called by the Arabs Eski or old Baghdad. On the right bank opposite Samara is a. certain amount of cultivation carried on in a primitive fashion by Delim Arabs. Three or four cuttings for fodder are obtained from the wheat crops before it is allowed to form its ear. Samara is a place of pilgrimage for Shiahs: there is a mosque over the tomb of one of the twelve Imams with a gilded dome. A new wall of mean appearance surrounds the town, and inside three-fifths of the space is devoted to camping-ground forJPersian pilgrims, of whom about 30,000 annually visit the shrine. 10th Stage .—Leaving Samara we passed the ruins of Istabilat and then through a level country intersected by many canals at different levels: crossed the Dujail canal by a bridge lately con structed by Ferhan Pasha. Halted in a small Arab settlement. 11th Stage .—Crossing a canal on a bridge called Tiso Harttea and entered a country with several villages, all surrounded by date groves and fig trees, watered by numerous canals. Halted at Sumi- schah. Population was only 175 males, yet it exported 20,000 okes annually of dates, besides figs and corn. 12th Stage.—To Khan Suediyap, 6 hours’ distant over a bare uncultivated country with green grass in the hollows where the rain water lodged. 13th Stage.— Started and soon reached the Tigris, passing much cultivation all watered by bul lock lifts. At Kathimain reached gardens which extended all the way to Baghdad, some 4 miles distant. The chief trade route with Baghdad is through Kifri, Altun Keupri, and Erbil and not by the river bank. It is 12 stages for caravans, the total dis tance being 299 miles : (1) Kulak Miles. ... 33 (2) Erbil ••• ... 22 {3) Altun Keupri ... • •• •«» ... 30 (4) Kirkuk .. 4 ‘ ... 27 15) Taouk ... • •• ... 25 ( 6 ) Tuz Khurmatu ... • •• • •• ... 21 (7) Kifri ... 24 ( 8 ) Kara Tapa ••• ... 22 (9) Dalli Abbas rat • •• ••• ... 28 (10) Zedaida ... • *a • •• ... 33 (11) Jadaida ... • •• ... 16 (12) Baghdad ... • •• • •• ... 18 It is an easy road passable for troops and artillery, with supplies in abundance obtainable at the various stages. Mr. Tart, Chief Engineer for Lynch Bros., •drove along this road in a four-wheeled carriage, reaching Mosul from Baghdad in 11 days. From Mosul he went through Nisi bin and Mardin Diarbekr and from there along a good cart road to Samsun, driving all the way. The post from Mosul to Baghdad by this road takes from 2| to 3 days, horses being •changed at each stage.To Sulaimaniah .—There are two routes from Mosul to Sulaimamah. e most direct lies through Koi-Sanjak. It is 7 stages, the total distance being 17^ miles: ( 1 ) Kalak (2) Erbil (B) Ashkafsakka (4) Koi-Sanjak (5) Bogut ( 6 ) Khan-i-Miran (7) Sulaimaniah Miles. ... 33 ... 22 ... 21 ... 25 ... 24 ... 25 ... 24 This road passes some low hills between Koi-Sanjak and Khan-i-Miran; otherwise it is an easy road. , „ „ , n Bv this route Mosul to Kermanshah is 16 stages, a total distance ot 346 miles (see Sulaimaniah). The section south of the Diala Kiver is rough flnci difficult. -r -TT • il i A. TT' Through Kasr-i-Shirin and Kifri (Route 1Y) is another route to Kerman shah, of *15 stages, a distance of 346 miles also. This latter is by far the easiest route and passable all along for aitilleiy. _ , ^ • i / For a description of the routes leading into Persia from Kui Sanjak {see route VII) Rania. , Through Kui Sanjak Mosul to Sihna is miles and Kermanshah _ miles by this route. It is rough and difficult, after passing the Persian frontier. Another route to Sulaimaniah is through Kirkuk [ees Route V 1). To Bawanduz and IFest Persia.—The principal trade route for goods from Mosul into West Persia is through Rawanduz to Suj-Bulak and f a hriz. Rawanduz is 95 miles distant, Suj-Bulak 188 miles, and Tabriz 307 2 miles {see Routes from Rawanduz). ,, , , .. „ ,i - , ,7 , To Yon.—This route lies through Amadiyeh, the valley ot the breat Zab and Bashkala (*e&lt;? routes from Amadiyeh). ^ ^ 11 i a ^oq Followino* Route IX to Amadiyeh, it is 289 miles to Bashkala and o39 to Van. From Bashkala, Urmia and Khoi in North-West Persia can be easily X*C£lcl.Tt/d* • Beyond Amadiyeh this road is rough and mountainous and practicable only for pack animals. ^ Van can also be reached through Jazirah, Bitlis, Sairdt and the southern shore of the lake. . . . To Sairdi and Bitlis.—Th\s is an important strategic line and the princi pal means of access from the Mesopotamian plain to the Armenian high lands. After passing Bitlis the country is fairly easy towards Mush and Van {see routes from Jazirah). Jazirah by Route X is 110 miles, to Sairdt by the Tigris valley is 190^ miles, Bitlis 247i, and Mush 293 miles from Mosul. To Diarbekr .—The most direct route lies across the desert to Nisibin. This would be about 115 miles and on to Diarbekr by the post road 80 miles, making the total of 195 miles. , . Missionaries travelling to Mardin in spring usually take this route, but it is not much used by caravans owing to raiding parties of the Shammar Arabs. Travellers require letters to the Shaikh of the section of the tribe through which they would pass. Except in winter and spring, there is no water 01 supplies, so that it could scarcely be used by troops. The road along which the mails are carried to Diarbekr goes by Jazirah, and supplies and water are found at all seasons.136 To Jazirah is 110 miles by Route X and from there to Diarbekr is 100 miles, making a total of 210 miles. Another road follows the right bank of the Tigris to Jazirah, but is not much used because of want of supplies in the summer months. It is six stages, and there are no villages of any size, the principal being Eski Mosul, Karhol, Abou Maria (good wells), Halaila, and are along the river bank. They are all small collections of Arab huts. Merchants say that the roads by Bitlis and Sairdt to Van or through Rawanduz are open all the year for traffic and never entirely closed by snow. The route to Van through Amadiyeh, Julamerkand Bashkala is usually closed for three months in winter, that is from the middle of December to the middle of March, unless the snowfall is light. A good carriage road goes from Diarbekr to Samsun passing through Kharput, Malatia, Sivas, Tokat, and Amasia. • It has only recently been com pleted, and the section from Kharput to Diarbekr is not yet as good as ti e rest. NESTORIAW CHRISTIANS. To understand the various sects into which the Nestorians are at present divided, a short account of their early history will be necessary. The Nes torians are so called because they adhere to the doctrines of Nestorius who was Patriarch of Constantinople in A.D. 431. For refusing to acknowledge to the Virgin Mary the title of mother of God and holding not only to tvvo natures but two persons in Christ and other religious differences he was excom municated and banished. His followers formed a new sect, and to avoid per secution left Roman protection and lied to the Persian Court at Seleucia where they were well received and allowed to settle. They g-radually grew to be the dominant Christian community in Persia. Great missionary zeal was displayed and their preachers penetrated as far as China and India. A section of them still remains on the Malabar Coast of India. After the M uhammadan conquest the Church gradually declined, until finally about A. D. 1400, when Tamerlane sacked Baghdad, the remnants of them fled and settled in the districts round Mosul. Some accounts say the mountain Nestorians are descendants of Jews from the Captivity who had settled in these inaccessible mountains and were converted to Nestorian doctrines. The Patriarch of the Nestorians round Mosul lived at Alkosh and the Patriarch of the mountain districts, then called Mar Shimun, lived at Kochau- nis near Julamerk. About A.D. 1625 disputes arose between the Patriarch of Alkosh and Mar Shimun, resulting in a division into two sects, the mountain districts adhering to Mar Shimun who was their elected Patriarch. The Mosul sect soon after transferred its allegiance and adopted the doctrines of the Church of Rome, and the Pope consecrated their Patriarch as “Patri arch of Babylon,” the portion under Mar Shimun remaining true to their former doctrines. The name Mar Shimua eventually came to be used as a hereditary title by successive Patriarchs. In 1873 dissensions arose in the Romish Church at Mosul, chiefly owing to a Bull of infallibility issued by the Pope. This led to a large portion abjui^ iug the authority of the Church of Rome altogether and forming a new sect electing their own Patriarch : these are now under a Mattran (Metropolitan) called Mar Elia Melus. These latter are called New Chaldeans and those still under the Romish Church Old Chaldeans, while those under Mar Shimun are usually called Nestorians.These names are rather arbitrary and not used by the people. The name dating from the earliest times and used in their official Designations. documents is the “ Church of the East ” referring to the time when the Church spread over the greater part of Central Asia. The national name, used exclusively by the people and in ordinary letters is “ Syrians/’ and they consider themselves to be one with the Syrians of West ern Asia. The name “ Chaldean ' has come into use in modern times and is now generally employed to the Roman Uniats at INdosul in oidei to distinguish them from the “ Jacobites,” to whom the name “ Syrian ” is there confined. The name “ Nestorians ” is usually given to the people by outsiders and is hardly ever used, except by those who have been under European influence. The Musalmans use the word “ Nasara” (Nazarenes), which they give only to this people- - • , The name f&lt; Nestorian ” is retained in this report because it is the name these people are best known by to English people; Assyrian Christians would seem to be more correct. ... . By far the largest portion of the Nestorians inhabit Turkey. In Persia they only occupy the flat plains of Urmia and Salmas, extremely fertile and well watered. The mountain or Turkish districts are different to this, and intersected in all directions by lofty mountain ranges separated by deep narrow valleys. Here the people may be divided into two classes, the tribal Nestorians or a Ashiret ” and the Rayah, or non-tribal. The former inhabit the valleys of Tiasi, Tkhoma, Baz, Jelu, Diz, Walto, and Tall. They are under Maliks or chiefs and rarely leave the valleys where they live. They are more or less undisturbed there by their Musalman neighbours, though their flocks are frequently carried off by raiding parties when they are obliged to quit their natural fortifications in search of pasture. These Nestorians are wild and savage, and schools among them are practic ally unknown. Their priests are frequently incapable of reading or writing and generally ignorant of the rudiments of the Christian faith. Preaching is neglected and the ancient rites have become meaningless. The Rayahs, or non-tribal, Nestorians are in a pitiable condition. Their villages are generally the property of Kurdish chiefs, and they themselves little better than slaves. They are taxed up to starvation point; their houses unfit for habitation: men, women and children go about scarcely covered from the winter's cold by a few rags, but in spite of this apostacy from Christianity is almost unknown. The interior of their church is a most touching sight; the old priest clad in a vestment of the meanest material repeating hesitatingly the prayers that have come down from the cradle of Christianity, the poor villagers pressing forward to kiss a little common wooden cross, the emblem of our Holy Eaith ; the monotonous chanting of the congregation conducted in low murmurs as if they were afraid of being heard outside, all constitute a scene without parallel since the persecution of the early Christians. The country inhabited by the Chaldeans and Nestorians may be outlined by taking a line from Sairdt down the Bhotan, Country of the Nestorian.. ^ a j on? the Tigris to its j unction wi th the great Zab, thence to Rawanduz, Urmia, and through Bashkala back to Sairdt. Although no distinct line of demarcation can be drawn, the plain arourd Mosul and the valley at the foot of the hills at Amadiyeh, Zakho and Jazirah may be taken as the Chaldean country, while the Nestorian districts extend from Amadiyeh eastward across several ranges of intricate and lofty mountains— 133 Ecclesiastical organisation. to the Persian frontier, and into the fertile plain country, bordering the west shores of Lake Urmia. The following is the ecclesiastical organization among the Nestorians; also forming a large part of the secular organization : The head of the “ Church of the East ” is called both “ Patriarch ” and “ Catholicos/^ He is commonly known as Mar Shi- mun. In writing he uses also his baptismal name. Thus the presentPatriarch writes “ Reuil Shimun.' His elected successor is now a Bishop called Mar Auraham, but when he becomes Patriarch, he will be called Mar Shimun. The succession is thus managed. There is always kept up in the family , r , „ . „ „ , . a succession of youths who have never eaten meat archs and Bishops. or married. One ot these w JNazintes, as they are called, is chosen during the lifetime of the Patriarch to be the successor, and the others then eat meat, and are disabled from holding the Episcopal office. The present “ natir kursi ” (holder of the seat) of Mar Shimun is a young man of about twenty-four, and has already been consecrated Bishop some few years. A similar arrangement holds good with regard to all the Bishops'. No Bishop or Nazirate is allowed to eat meat or to marry. Until lately when it was necessary to choose a successor for the Patriarchate the two tribes of Tkhoma and Tiari agreed together, and selected one of the Nazirites of the patriarchal family. This has often led to disputes. When the present Mar Shimun was appointed, one party wished to have another candidate and tried to have him consecrated at Mosul as rival Patriarch or at least a Bishop, but by the influence of Mr. Rassam, the British Vice-Consul there, they were unsuccessful. Now the selection of a successor seems to be more of a family affair. Mar Shimun exercises temporal as well as spiritual jurisdiction, es pecially over the tribal or quasi-independent Nestorians of Tiari, Tkhoma, Jelu, and the other valleys of Kurdistan. He appoints the “ Maliks ” or head men of each district, but these mountaineers by no means understand the doctrine of passive obedience, and their independent nature sometimes makes them resent the wishes of the Patriarch. This temporal jurisdiction is to a great extent recognized by the Turks. The Turkish Government of late have made a grant to Mar Shimun (about £15 per mensem)in order that they may have a greater hold on him. In temporal as well as ecclesiastical jurisdiction the Patriarch is assisted by his family council, which has a large voice in managing affairs. There is now only one Mattran or Metropolitan, namely, that of Shams- din, who bears the dynastic name of Mar Khnan- e ropo i an. ishu. It is his duty to invest the new Patriarch and he is second in rank in the Church. Formerly there were others. The last Bishop of Urmia was so styled because the Patriarch once lived there. The present Mar Khnanishu from the piety of his chax*acter exercises a wide influence over the other Bishops and the Church at large. , Next to the Patriarch and the Mattran come the Bishops. t, • , Bishops. There are at present eight in Turkey and two in Persia, viz.,-— The Patriarch Mar Shimun, who resides at Kochannis near Julamerk. Mar Isaac, the Mattran, who lives in Shamsdin. Mar Johannan of Shamsdin. Mar Sor Ishu of Gavvar. Mar Sergis of Jelu.Mar Is\m of Duri in Berrawi. Mar Johnan of Okri near Arnadiyek. Mar A u rah am Patriarch Designate. The above are in Turkey. The following are the Persian Bishops : Mar ti oriel in Urmia. Mar Johnan in Superghan. Of the eight Bishops in Turkey, only six have any diocesan jurisdiction, the other two being the Patriarch Designate and a Bishop, who lives as a simple priest near Mosul; while of the six, one has no jurisdiction beyond his own small village, and three have a mere handful of villages under their care. On the other hand, the patriarchal diocese is enormous and far too large to be properly supervised by one man, considering the mountainous nature ot tie country. This is mainly owing to the fact that when there is no succession to a Bishopric, it falls into the Patriarch like a fief. ^ Sometimes Mar Shimun gives it to a neighbouring Bishop, and sometimes he adds it to his own diocese, which thus has a constant tendency to grow. _ On the other hand, Bishops are consecrated for districts where there is little or no need for them, and thus arises a race of Bishops with hardly any dioceses to care for. „ . ^ , In Turkey most of the tribal Nestorians are under the rule of the Patriarch as Diocesan; the new tribal dioceses being divided very unscientifically and appear to be the subject of constant change. In Persia the mountainous district near the frontier is attached to the diocese of the Mattran, who lives in Turkey; while in the plain of Urmia proper there are three dioceses marked out by three rivers following into the lake. Altogether in the Persian plains there are four dioceses now recognized, and each of the Persian Bishops hold two. The succession to Bishoprics is managed in a similar manner to that to the Patriarchate. Each Bishop has one or more Succession to Bishoprics. {&lt; Naziriteg ^ whom he has brought up not to marry or eat meat, and as they grow up, he chooses a successor, ihey aie generally his nephews or cousins. , There are a large number of priests and deacons; several are incapable of reading or writing, while others have been on Priests and Deacons. begging tours through Russia or England, or completed a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. These return with rather too much knowledge of subjects outside the sphere of their priestly duties. They are sometimes ordained very young; often at the age of sixteen. A deacon has been known to be ordained at ten years old; and of the present Bishops was consecrated when quite a young boy. The deacon, however, is little more than an acolyte; he is never allowed to baptise and only occasionally to preach. The only remuneration of a priest is derived from fees given for baptism, marriages, and occasional offices of the Church. Sometimes there is a field or two by way of endowment for the Chuich ; sometimes the villagers give a very small sum to their priest or plough his fields for him, or in other ways help him. However, with both priests and deacons ordination is considered no bar to secular work, and most of them eke out a livelihood by a trade or in some other way. Monasteries are quite in abeyance among the Nestorians. In common parlance, a monk means a celibate, of whom there are a few. The most famous of these in modern times was Rabban Yonan, who lived in a little room attached to the Church at Kochannis, and by his piety and ascetic life exercised a good influence over the Church. t 2140 A Bishop is called “ abuna ” or father, priest “ kishish ” and a deacon “ Shamasha/ , In every village the elders, or whitebeards as they are called, form a sort Village Councils. °? council &gt; which discusses the temporal affairs of the village, and no step of importance is taken by bishops or priests without calling them together. Maliks&gt; Then, again, the “ maliks,” or village chiefs, appointed by Mar Shimun have a considerable influence. These in the mountains manage the temporal affairs of a district. There are one in Diz, one in Baz, two in Jelu, two in Tchob, one in Walto, two in Tiari Proper. Some villages have chiefs named “ Raisi ” for the same purpose. These mountain or tribal Nestorians are wild and savage : schools are prac tically unknown, and missionaries find them difficult to establish : they have good intelligence, but it is undeveloped : they are subject to little discipline, each man being his own master. They practise none of the rough arts, except a little smithing and weaving. Theoretically they pay tribute to the Turkish Government, but have done so very irregularly and are usually classed as “ Ashiret,” or refusing to pay taxes. They pay taxes in kind, honey, flour, &amp;c., to Mar Shimun, and are supposed to pay a poll-tax of 3 piastres each, but this is seldom done. The liturgy in use in the Nestorian Churches is perhaps the oldest in Christendom—a fact of which they are justly proud. Baptism, the Holy Communion (Kourbana or offering) and Church Consecration ser vice are administered in the same manner as in English churches. And in the midst of all their poverty and ignorance it is astonishing to find services so impressive and so devoutly rendered. This is clearly their brightest jewel, and its preservation leads us to the hope that this Church has indeed a great future before it. I he churches on the outside are plain buildings being merely a square stone or brick building, or even only built of mud with a flat roof. No cross appears on the roof to offend the Musalman eye, and the only sign of Christianity about the outside of the building is a very little cross over the door, which is devoutly kissed by those who enter. The only means of entrance is a little door on the south side, often not more than three feet high. These small doors are sometimes at a eonsidei’able height from the ground and can only be approached by a ladder. The reason of the smallness of the doors is said to be either that all may bow their heads on entering God^s house, or that Musalmans may not put their cattle into the Church. The latter is probably the true reason. The churches are usually dedicated to Syrian Bishops and Monks. Mart Miriam (St. Mary) is the commonest of all dedications. Of other dedications Mar Girgis (St. George), Mar Shalita, Mar Serghis, Mar Audiahu, Mar Sorishu, Mar Mari and Mar Adar may be mentioned. The Nestorians delight in pictures of St. George and the Dragon, but no pictures, whether of our Saviour or of the Saints, are allowed in the Churches. The fasts and festivals of the Nestorians, like those of other Orientals, Fasts and Festivals. ? aft on ^y described as prodigious. Those prescribed ik the books are so long that no one, except perhaps one or two monks, keep them all. All, however, who wish to be accounted members of the old Church keep the gieat fast of fifty days (our Lent), the little fast of twenty-five days (ourHI Advent), and tlie three days fast of theNinevites at the end of the Eastern Jan 2t persons also keep the Feast of St. Mary for a fortnight before Augnst 15th. Moreover, every Wednesday and Friday throughout the year are ast . And during these fasts there are no exceptional days on which they can eat meat, and include Sundays as well as week days. Not only is meat forbidden, but all animal produce of all kinds, such as butter, milk eggs and so forth The principal things eaten during the fasts are haricot beans, plain potatoes, treacle rice cooked in walnut oil, walnuts and raisins. „ ,. , As'is natural, Easter is considered the greatest of the festivals. They call it the Great Feast in Urmia in contradistinction to Christmas, whic is the Little Feast. . . • t „„ The whole day after the Koifrbana is spent in paying visits. In each house fruit and sweetmeats are displayed, of which all are invited to partake, with an unlimited supply of tea. . . Also it is to be feared that arrack and strong drinks form a very prominent feature in these visits. • -nt ± TKov f-tll The village festivals are a great feature mNestomn life. They fa on the feast of the Patron Saint of the village Church, and if the Church is much venerated, people will flock to it from all parts. On these occa sions even Musalmans sometimes come and make offerings. They begin with the Kourbana, and after that games and dances will he kept up all day, ending too often in drunkenness and fights with the at the* abuse does not take away the use, and if these festivals were somewhat reformed they might he made the servants of religion. ^ The Nestorians are a warm-hearted people, and much good feeling is ca out on these occasions. The dancing is peculiar, but stately and pretty : tie men dance by themselves and perhaps in the background women by them selves. A ring is formed with joined hands and with slow step to the music of a sort of fife and drum they move round with many gesticulations and waving of handkerchiefs. , &lt; .i In th°ir weddings the social festivities overshadow to a great extent the religious rite and last for three or four days. A great point is made of the procession of the bride, who is placed on a horse completely veiled and conducted with music, dancing and firing of pistols from her parents loot to She if conducted the first day to a friend's house, the second day to another friend's, and probably the third day to the Church, where the marriage takes place, after which she is conducted to her husband's house. _ . As the procession passes the bridegroom is stationed with his friends on a roof and has a store of apples by him, which, after signing himself with the sign of the cross, he throws among the crowd. If he hits the bride it is a sign ° £ ^Asensual in the East, if it be a first marriage the bride and bridegroom are mere children; and perhaps it is due to their early marriage that the women become prematurely old and wrinkled. Second marriages are allowed even to priests, who are not restrained from marrying after their Ordination. Bishops, however, are never allowed to marry.^ , The law of divorce is very lax even according to the Canons of the Gnurcn, and the practice is even worse. These matters are all decided by the Bishops, to whom it is a great temptation to grant divorces for the sake of the fees,142 There is no country in the world so tenacious of old customs as Persia and Kurdistan—a remark which applies equally to the Christian and Muhammadan peoples. As is natural, the old Christian customs are retained more tenaciously in the mountains than in the Urmia plains. The people of the latter have had much intercourse with Europe, especially during the last fifty years, but, even they cling to their old customs most reli giously. It perhaps is inevitable in a Musalman country that the women should be kept entirely in the background, although they are in a far better position than their Muhammadan sisters. There is unfortunately little of that chiv alrous feeling of men towards women which one finds in Europe. Women are the drudges that are ordered about by the men to do the hard work, carry heavy loads; whose education matters nothing, and who become prematurely aged in their heavy task. In their dress the women to some extent follow their Musalman neighbours. Thus, in the mountains where the Kurdish women wear no veil, the Christian women do not veil themselves either, but in the Urmia plain where the Musalman women completely veil themselves from head to foot, the Nestorian women also wear a veil; thouo-h it covers only their mouth. This is part of their headdress, and it is considered impioper to allow their hair to be seen. For the rest, the Christian women wear red, and very picturesque they look. It is the men, however, who adorn themselves in fine clothes; and in the mountains a well-dressed man is a magnificent spectacle, with all his embroidery and antique weapons. J Pei haps the first thing that strikes a European is the way in which every one lives on the floor. It is only in the most European houses which have anything in the way of a reception room. Besides carpets and cushions, beds are laid on the floor and in the morning people roll them up, and place 'them against the wall, where they serve as a rest for the back of the guest. At meal times a cloth (generally of some red material) is laid, or else a low table about four inches from the ground, is brought in, when all sit round. The Nestorians are most hospitable and never know but what their meal may be shared by a stranger. Hot cakes of bread, almost as thin as a wafer, are spread on the edges of the cloth and serve as plates: this is the custom in Persian houses also. When all the dishes are brought in and the whole meal on the table a long grace is said and the guests fall to. Knives and forks are known only to those who Europeanize. As a rule people eat with their fingers, taking up the meat with pieces of the flat bread. B r Thus, two persons will dip their hands together into the same dish, and it is a mark of friendship to dip a piece of meat or fruit into the dish and give it to another. This custom also prevails among the Kurds and Persians. Be fore drinking wine a man will say to a friend or to the company o-enerally C( your “ y ° Ur llealth ” and wil1 receive the reply “ may it be pleasant to you.” .“ile the men are eating the women serve or are occupied in the background with domestic occupations. They never sit down with the men, but take their meals in private afterwards. If there are guests, the sons of the family will not sit down to table with their father, but will serve the guests and take their meals afterwards. The language used in both Churches, Chaldean and Nestorian, is Syriac Language. or Chaldean, the books being mostly in ancient Syriac or Chaldean. It differs slightly in various districts, e anguage, called near Mosul lahlin, is spoken over a very considerable tract of country. JThe following are the principal districts and the distribution of the Nestorians in the Kurdish mountains. The Tiari District lies on the right bank of the Zab, north-east of Amadiyeh, and consists of several long narrow valleys running from the Hartoshi mountains^ in a south-east direction towaids that river. . Chal and Tkhoma and Salabakka are on the opposite bank. To the north-east along the river are Walto, Tal, Lewin and Diz. South east of these are Boz and Jelu. To the west of Amadiyeh is the Supna valley, the water of which nows towards the Khabur, and the north-west is Berwari valley. Christian villages are also scattered along the foot of the hills in the Khabur valley near Zakho and as far as Jazirah. . Kwaneb, Aradina and Keni are the chief villages in the Supna valley. There is a marked contrast as regards industry, and superior cultivation between these and the Kurdish villages, dotted about between them. Shaikh Muhammad, a Kurd of great reputed sanctity, lives at Bamurni in this valley. He is held in much reverence by the people, and has a considerable influence over them. . . , There are said to he 16 Christian villages in the Supna valley, some ot which are Chaldean. On the plain between Zakho and Jazirah and along the foot of the Judhi-Dagh are Feishkhabur, a large village of Old Chaldeans at the junction of the Khabur and Tigris, Tel Khaban, Wasit, Nahrawan, Girki Budrn, Hassan and Mansuriyah, the last two containing many Protestants. Between Derguleh and Shernakh to the north of the Jndih-Dagh are the ruins of several Christian villages, never rebuilt since Bader Khan Beg's massacre in 184&lt;3. To the south-east of Amadiyeh, the only Christian village is Kwaneh. In Zebari are only a few families in the Kurdish villages and the ruins of several churches. The district nearest to Julamerk is Liz with 11 villages—Akos, Beshma- mash, Chalchi, Orma, Mardish, Kurshi, Suwah, Madis, Shimsha, Sukurran, Cherickurria. Three of these are in Julamerk. Beyond this to the south-east is JBaz with five villages—Urgabi, Gundei, Shaonthi, Huteta, Urwantos, with Tui and Anda, which are Kurdish. Beyond Baz is Jelu, divided into Greater Jelu, with nine villages, and Lesser Jelu, with seven villages, besides the Kurds. In Lewin are eight villages—Alkik, Der, Hergil,Nurgussa, Balakan, Khun- deki, Govki and Zeranis. On the Zab below Diz is Tal, a sort of dependency of Tchob, with six vil lages—Bedari, Rebett, Bekurk, Talano, Mushkoner and Bakht. Below this, but to the east of the river, lies Tchob, dived into Tkhoma Lava (higher) and Tkhoma Gawaia (lower), with six Christian villages—Gun- dukhta, Mazra, Tkhoma, Gawaia, Birijai, Gisseh and three Kurdish-Gereresh, Distribution Nestorians, of mountain Zawitha and Hashit. Below Tal comes Walto, a dependency of Tiari, with four villages—Nara, Surta, Gunda and Kaiziana. Then to the west of the Zab is Tiari district, with over twenty villages and hamlets, the number of families being estimated at 2,500. The principal villages are Ashitha (500 houses) near the head of the valley Lizan (180 to 200 houses) on the right bank of the Zab, and Zawitha mid way between the two. Balseh, Yedi, Shuta, Yedi Gemam are villages in the same valley.144 In SalabaJcJca on the left bank of the Zab there are 180 to 200 houses, and in the district round Gundukhta 800 to 1,000. In Berwari are five or six scattered villages, the chief of which is Duri. There is a small Dominican school in Gundukhta numbering about 40 chil dren and an American Mission School at Marza numbering about 50 children. Neither of them accomplish much owing to the general ignorance of the people. There are American Mission helpers in Lizan, Tkhoma, Mansuriyah and Hassan near Jazirah. Dr. Browne, one of the Archbishops of Canterbury’s Mission, has lived for the last year at Kochannis with Mar Shimun, and his being thus stationed enabled the Urmia Missionaries to take prompt measures to report the intended massacre of the Christians by the Kurds in Tiari in September 1888. There are 13 Nestorian villages round Van and a few round Bitlis. On the south-east side of the Bashkala plain on the left bank of the Great Zab are a few isolated Nestorian villages, the principal of which are Autess, Argi, Hanjoulis and Kelago {see Route XII). Also in the high mountain districts north-west of Lewin and east of Nur- duz are a few scattered Nestorian villages, the principal being Stian, Shah- mannus and Sekunis {see Route XI). In Gavvar there are altogether 12 villages on the plain itself and 48 villages on the slopes of the hills around it, making a total of 60 villages altogether, of which 23 are Nestorian. In Nutcha there are some 20 villages of Nestorians in addition to about 20 families scattered among the Kurdish villages numbering in all from 1,300 to 1,500 souls. This is only a remnant of what it once was. Traces of ruined villages and churches show that a dense and prosperous Christian population once dwelt in these mountains. They are reduced to great poverty now and suffer much oppression. The same remark applies to the Zebari valley at Rezan and Bila Keupri, where a few scattered families still exist, the remnants of a large Nestorian population. In Shamsdin are four large Nestorian villages. Its people and those of the adjoining district of Girdi are chiefly Kurds with but few Christians. In the Urmia plain half the population of the plain is Christian and in habit 200 villages ; 100 are either Nestorian or Armenian or a mixture of both. In both Urmia and Salmas Armenians and Nestorians are much mixed together, and marriages are not infrequent. In the Baranduz plain are also a large number of Nestorian, and Armenian districts. The safety of the Urmia Christians lies in the divisions of the Musalmans into Sunnis and Shiahs, feuds among the Kurdish clans, and presence and influence of Consuls and Missionaries. Although the Christians are not more heavily taxed than others, they are not on a par with the Musalmans as regards the administration of justice. The number of Nestorians in Urmia, Tergavvar, Sulduz and Salmas are estimated by Mr. Thomson at 22,000, of which 2,800 are Armenians and 624 Papal Chaldeans. In dealing with the Nestorian characteristics it must be distinctly remem- Character of the Nesto- ^ ere ^ to judge them by a European standard rians. would produce disappointing results. Their character is a curious mixture of the most glaring defects with very apparent virtues.145 is Baii ii cliliiren, 'Mceofilu ^ansorijai la « lived fd 8 statioirf ^iateni^ 8 .

This absorbing love of gain induces them to judge the religious merits and teachings of the two Missions, namely the American Presbyterian and the English Church sole ly from a monetary standpoint, and from the amount of money each spends on its work. Between the two Mission Establishments in Urmia the most cordial rela tions prevail, and they both work towards attaining the same praiseworthy result; and it is much to be regretted that a party spirit of antagonism seems rising among their respective followers. The Nestoriansare great beggars, their priests wandering over Russia, the Continental Countries, India, England, &amp;c., the result of their gains being in many cases on their return devoted to their private ends rather than the good of the community. There is a want of truthfulness and trustworthiness among them—a fault common to all Christians living under Muhammadan rule. At the same time they have a strong faith, devoted attachment to Holy Scripture and a great love for the ordinances of their ancient Church without any excessive amount of superstition; and though the people are extremely ignorant they are most anxious to learn ; they are only too glad to have schools established among them. The character of the mountain Nestorians, besides, perhaps, retaining the impression of early persecutions, has undoubtedly been affected by their geo graphical position, by the influences of nature and by the vicinity of warlike predatory tribes maintaining hostile creeds and also from their ignorance they look more to the forms and practice of worship than to the proper under standing of the Gospel. It is difficult at a distance to form an idea of the hostility still existing between Christians and Muhammadans. Persecuted as they have been for centuries it is not surprising that they retaliate on their oppressors in a sanguinary spirit whenever they can. Their hatred is too deep and long endured to subside into mercy and for giveness ; and ages of tyranny and intolerance have driven from their bosoms all feelings of pity towards their haughty and implacable Muhammadan enemies. The Missionaries by their improved system of education have done much towards ameliorating the condition of the Nestorian. In addition to edu cational and technical schools in Urmia, they travel constantly among the mountains and are well informed about the true state of the country and public opinion, while an English Missionary resides at Kochanuis with Mar Shimun. They are instrumental in checking abuses and gaining justice for the oppressed. The Walls and Pashas fear the 1 ’eports of any marked abuses which they make through our Consuls and endeavour to retaliate by all kinds of petty annoyances as regards passports, &amp;c., to travellers in the country. The Urmia Missionaries in the summer of 1883 knew of an expected rising and massacre of Christians by the Kurds, and by the prompt action in reporting the first disturbances which broke out at Ashitha in September they were enabled to prevent a repetition of the horrible massacres of Bader Khan Beg. A much better state of things would exist if an English consul were appointed to Julamerk. There is now no Englishman in Mosul and Van is some distance. Old Chaldeans .—The Chaldeans still under the jurisdiction of Rome in the Mosul plains have a Patriarch, Mar Elia, who bears the title of Patriarch VOL. i. u146 of Babylon, and who disputes with Mar Shimun the title to be considered the representative of the ancient Patriarchs of the East. Also several Bishops who are each called Mattran or Metropolitan as the representatives of the ancient Metropolitans of Mesopotamia whose numerous Suffragans have now no successors. They do not u«e the name “Abima” for Bishop, but apply it to a priest who holds some dignity, such as an Archdeacon. The principal Catholic Monastery and school for young priests is at Rabban Honnzed on the hillside overlooking: Alkosh, some 294 miles N.N.YV. of Mosul. Mar Mattel Monastery is on the Jebal Maklub, some 15 miles to the south east of Alkosh. There is a small Monastery at Mar Girgis, 10 miles N.N.W. of Mosul, and another at Kashahr on the Jebal Abiadh, 10 miles north-east of Simel on the Zakho road. The principal Christian villages round Mosul along the road to Alkosh are—Tal Ouskof, Batnaia, Talkaif, population 6,000, and Alkosh, population 8,000. In Mosul are 600 families of Chaldeans. These villages contain the most thriving part of the Chaldean community. The houses are well built and their industry and careful cultivation of the soil shows a marked contrast to the Yezidi and Shabakh villages alongside them. The men supply the sailors for Lynch's Tigris steamers. New and Old Chaldeans continue to live together in these villages. There is no regular line of demarcation dividing these Chaldeans from the community under Mar Shimun. Of isolated communities there are some in Baghdad (500 families). In the Supna valley, north-east of Amadiyeh, some of the villages are Chaldean and some are under Mar Shimun. The Christian villages in this district have better planted vineyards and the people are far more industrious than those in the Kurdish villages. In the same valley close by each other, quite separate but bearing the same name, are generally two clusters of houses,—cue for Christians and the other for Musalmans. West of Amadiyeh near the junction of the Khabur and Tigris are several Christian villages. Feishkhabur is a village of 200 houses of Catholic Chaldeans. In Jazi- rah are 100 families with a Bishop and four Dominican priests. The other villages are Hassan, mostly Protestant, with an American Mission teacher, Mansuriyah also largely Protestant, Nahrawan, Takian, Girki Budru, Tal Khabbin, and Wasit. Maraha, Jinet and Biret are Nestorian villages. In the valley between Zakho and Amadiyeh are a few Chaldean Catholic villages, the total number in the Khabur valley being given as 15 or 16. Bound Akra are said to be some Chaldean villages, but the number have greatly diminished of late years. In Zebari remains of several churches were seen, but few families now remain. In Mardin are 4,600 Chaldeans. In Sibna in Persian Kurdistan is an isolated Catholic community under a Bishop numbering some 40 families. There are other scattered portions in Baghdad, Kirkuk and Erbil. It was not until 1858 that the Chaldeans were recognized by the Porte as a separate community, and in that year the Primate with the aid of the French Embassy obtained a firman acknowledg ing him as Patriarch of the new sect.Tlipiv official relations with Government are, however, still carried on through the United Armenian Patriarch at Constantinople. ^ New Chaldeans .—This is an isolated Catholic communion which has seced ed from Rome and is now under a Mattran, Mar hua Melus. Of the six Chaldean Churches in Mosul (which all belonged to Rome in 1873) four are the property of this Church. ^ . . Many of the chief families of Mosul, including Mr. Rassam, the Unglisn Vice-Consul, are of this sect. „ i o i r Talkaif is now mostly independent. In other villages, Alkosh, lal wuslcot, Batnaia, the churches are in the hands of the Romans and the inhabitants owing to pressure have outwardly conformed. Two monasteries, Mar JCia and Mar Michael, have renounced Rome, and twelve Mosul priests are unaer the jurisdiction of Mar Elia Meins. A printing press is attached to one of the churches. A Bishop, Mar Audishu, is under Mar Elia, in charge of a similar separated Church on the Malabar coast of India. The total number of Nestorians and Chaldeans of all sects is about 150,000, some estimates placing the number at 200 , 000 . JACOBITES. This Christian sect owes its name to Jacobus Baradeus, Bishop of Edessa (Urfa), who, in A.D. 45 , led away a large sect of the church they adhered to the heresy of the one nature and one person of Christ after it had been condemned by the Council of Chalcedon. They are now settled principally in Jabal Tor, or Tor Abdin, between Mar- din and Jazirah, with some detached portions in Mosul. The Patriarch lives at Deir Zafferan, 6 miles east of Mardin. There are 11 Bishops at present distributed as follows : (1) At Mai din, besides the Patriarch. (2) Constantinople. (3) Diarbekr. (4) Urfa. (5) Sis in the Jabal Tor. ( 6 ) Jerusalem. (7) Antioch. ( 8 ) India. There are three others who move from place to place, and each has from 12 to 15 priests and deacons under him. On Jabal Maklub is the Monast ery of Mar Mattei, where are several cells cut out of the rock in which the monks live. There are 500 houses of Jacobites in Mosul and several in Mardin, Diarbekr, Antioch, Aleppo and Damascus. There are 200 houses in Jerusalem and detached portions of the sect in Cairo, Alexandria and Damietta. On the Malabar Coast, in India, they are said to number 20,000. Young priests come over here to be educated and ordained. Between Jazirah and Mardin are several Jacobite villages and also a colony round Urfa. Their total numbers are estimated at about 60,000 now, but the community is very much scattered. YEZIDIS. Yezidis, or Devil Worshippers as they are sometimes called, are chiefly remarkable for the peculiarity of their religion, which includes theories based on Zoroastrian doctrines mingled with Christian, Musalman and idolatrous traditions.148 Their origin is rather doubtful, but they are without doubt the remnant of an ancient race inhabiting the country long before the Ottoman conquest. Their own histories say they take their name from Yezid and that under him they were settled in large tract of country, of which Kas-el-Ain and Yeranshahar were the centre. After lezid, about the time of the Abbaside Caliphs, came Marwan, in whose time their great prophet Shaikh Adi was alive. He was credited with numerous miracles and supernatural power. He was Patriarch, or religious head of tin* people at that time. Shaikh Adi wrote a, book of ordinances and rules of life called il Gelena,” and Shaikh Nasr is now looked upon as his lineal descendant. This is kept at Shaikh Adi, and only Shaikh Nasr is allowed to open or read out of it. Any one else, even turning over the leaves, is liable to instant death. Shaikh Adi’s shrine is “ Lahish ” or a holy place. When a Yezidi enters the inner chamber of the shrine on the annual feast day and covers himself with the dust near the shrine it absolves him for all sins committed. The door of the shrine is first opened by Shaikh Nasr dressed in his full robes holding a crozier on the top of which is the image of a lamb. The annual festival or pilgrimage to Shaikh Adi lasts about a fortnight and included feasting, dancing, &amp;c., each Yezidi bringing presents to Shaikh Nasr. there are several small tombs or shrines in the villages of the Yezidi country remarkable by the curious fluted conical spires. They are white-washed out side and in. After Shaikh Adi the shrine of Shaikh Shamsudin, near Guru- pahan, is the most sacred : certain marks on each tomb show its degree of sanctity. least days are kept on the 1st, 15th and last day of Ramazan. The shrines are visited once a year: presents in kind are brought and feasts held. All prayers by Yezidis are said in the heart and not by the mouth or written, and they remain kneeling with folded arms round the shrines for some time; but nothing is repeated, or is any Musalman or Christian supposed to be present at these devotions. In the morning at sunrise they bow and kiss the earth where the sun first touches ; similarly at sunset when it last leaves the earth. Women join in all acts of reverence like the men. One portion of the \ r ezidis believe that Shaikh Adi was one of the seven gods who will come to govern the world : most of them believe in him as a prophet only. They have seven grades of priests. Owmra—emirs or princes, to which belong all tracing their descent from Shaikh Adi. These are the civil governors of the people. Shaikhs .—These are judges in religious matters and settle all minor dis putes brought to them. These may be called the scribes of the sect, although few can write. iakirs. These teach the dance, performed at the annual festival at Shaikh Adi, and take the sacred brass emblem made in the shape of a cock, on its annual round through the villages. Mullas teach on religion and religious forms, Cawals perform all the burial rites, and chant hymns at the sacred festivals. Kochaks. They play the instruments, trumpets, &amp;c., and arrange and sing songs in praise of Shaikh Adi at festivals. Pirs are the elders or teachers in each village, both on religious and lay matters.These grades were introduced in Shaikh Adi’s time and on feast days there are separate dresses for each. They perform their own special work and no other. The idol cock, said to he the image of Malik Taus, is brought round at all festivals. Each family or Shaikh has its own Shijarrat-al-nasib or pedi gree book. They recognize in various forms most of the early 13ible traditions. And. believe the Earth is ruled by Malik Taus, whom they regard as a fallen angel and representative of the principle of evil. They recognize that good men are under God’s special protection while evil men are under that of Malik Taus. They believe in the eventual restoration of Malik Taus and think that by propitiating him now in his fallen capacity they will eventually be partners in his restoration. Drunkenness, prostitution, and vice are more common among them than their neighbours and this may in a great measure be traced to the idea of pro- pitiating°t.he principle of evil': the name of Shaitan, or even any word in Arabic or Turkish bearing a resemblance to it, is never mentioned, and it is the duty of Yezidi on hearing anyone mentioning Shaitan to either kill him or kill himself. , . All drinking vessels and jars are made with a wide neck so that they will not gurgle. The principle of good requires no propitiating; and Malik Taus is more worshipped than God. With the restoration of Malik Taus the Yezidi nation will again be restored to power, and Shaikh Adi will revisit the earth. They believe in the transmigration of souls; those of good men into other good men; and those of bad men into lower animals, dogs, pigs, &amp;c. This lasts for only a certain period, after which souls are translated to heaven. Yezidis are not polygamous, but marriage ties are easily broken. If a man s wife is barren or commits adultery, he can simply put her away and take another. Their code of morality is very low. They have a greater affinity for Christians than Musalmans; many of them are servants doing field work at Alkosh and Talkaif for Christians. Yezidis are extremely averse to serving as soldiers under an Ottoman Govern ment. The following is the petition which they presented against military service about fifteen years ago, setting forth the various reasons why they could not serve; it also shows many of their curious customs : I.—Our religion enjoins that every Yezidi must see Malik Taus (pea cock like image) three times a year and worship it. II.—Every Yezidi must go to Shaikh Adi once a year generally about September 15th to 2.0th for the festival there. HI.—At sunrise every morning a Yezidi must kiss the spot where the sun’s rays first strike the ground and must not do so inthe presence of a Christian or Musalman. IV.—Each Yezidi has a foster brother whose hand he is bound to kiss every morning. V.—During the Musalman prayers a Yezidi cannot hear the word “ Shaitan ” used, as he must either kill the person uttering it or himself.

DisfriWi-nn Yezidis principally inhabit Jhe plain districts east of Mosul and the hilly district of Jabal Sin jar to the west. The larger portion are sedentary, there are some tents of nomads, who winter on the plains near Sinjar, and spend the summer on the hills south and east of Lake Van. These were met crossing the bridges at Mosul and Jazirah ; toll being collected from them there. They paid a tribute also to the Shaikh of the Shammar Tai Arabs near Sinjar for right of grazing. They had laro-e numbers of sheep, goats and cattle. In Sinjar those living in villages number some 20,000. They have annual disputes and disturbances with the Turkish authorities, and troops are usually required to pacify them. The district is famous for its figs, which are brought into Mosul. Siniar is 28 hours to the west of Mosul. Yezidis lound Mosul are industrious cultivators irrigating small orchards and gardens along the streams. They grow also crops of wheat and barley on the plain without irrigation. Their villages are dotted all about theMosul plain from Feishkhabur to the Great Zab. Sbaikb Adi, their celebrat ed shrine, is among the hills, east of Mosul. Yezidis are divided into four sects : Shaikhan ^ on ]yj osu j plain. Dman ) JIaweri. —Nomads going to the districts round Lake Van. Sinjari in villages round Sinjar. The districts round Redwan to the south of Sairdt once contained several Yezidi villages ; of these only three now remain near Redwan. There are six villages in the Tor A bdin hills, east of Mardni between it and Midiyat, with four villages, near Hassan Kaif arid three round Diarbekr. ^ In Tiflis, Erivan and in Georgia are some lezidis, but not in any gieat nUn fhose residing east of Mosul form by far the most peaceable and flourish ing portion of them ; Mirza Beg, their civil and religious head and Shaikh IS'asr, their chief priest, live at Badri. Hattara, Gurrapahan, Basheikha and Badri are their principal villages. Along the south-west slopes of the Dohuk Dagh are some large villages. The language of the Yezidis is Rermanji. The total number of Yezidis is estimated at about 60,000. They are favourably disposed towards Christianity, and Missionaries have made some converts and hope for more. KIZXLBASH. This is a generic name given by the Turks' to Shabbakhs, Baghilans or Begwans and 'Turkmans. • i • • a Their religion is closely allied to the Ah Allahis of Kannd in Persia and many of the Lur tribes farther to the south. -i i -i r i • Shabbakhs are peaceful cultivators whose villages are dotted about the plain east and south of Mosul as far as the Great Zab. _ Their religion is to a certain extent mysterious, as they profess to like Christian, Muhammadan and Jew alike. Some of them believe in the incarnation of the Deity in Ah, while others state that Ali was merely a prophet. . They believe also in Hassan Kosh, a mythical personage whom they rever ence and look upon as their intercessor in Heaven. ^ They believe in a millennium of 1,000 years in which they are to be the ruling nation, and Hassan Kosh is again to visit the earth. After the millen- nium 5 the end of the world comes. &lt; *, , • , , , They meet together in secret occasionally. A Shaikh or priest at each meeting gets up to pray and preach. Stories of certain indecent rites perfoim- ed at these meetings are said to be quite libellous. They keep three or four fast days in the year. They do not receive the Koran, keep Ramazan or any of the Muham madan fasts, and are much given to drink. There are said to be 50 or 60 villages of Shabbakhs and Bedjwans in the districts south-east of Mosul especially round Akra and Navkur. Bed!wans hold similar religious views to the Shabbakhs. There are large Turkman villages on the Tigris near Mar Girgis and dotted along the east bank of the Tigris. . . In Kirkuk, Altun Keupri, Tuz Khurmatu, Kipn, Tasa khurmatu are several Turkmans.152 Route No. X —Mosul to Jazirah-ibn-Omar via Zakho. Distance, in miles. Stages. Hours marching. Intermediate. Total.

From Mosul, took the post road through Zakho to Jazirah. Crossed the Tigris boat bridge at 3-40 p.m., and followed a broad road through extensive melon and cucumber beds. The telegraph, two wires to Baghdad, and two wires to the northward, bifurcates at the bridge head. Khizir River .—After 1 mile forded the Khizir River in preference to going over a masonry bridge of six arches, now in a bad state of repair. It was built by a French engineer, but the work was scamped ; the found ations of the piers are beginning to give way; the approaches are partially washed away by high floods, and there are sundry holes in the roadway. If the approaches were levelled, it is still passable for artillery. The bridge is just below the mound of Koyunjik, where once stood the palace of Senacherib, and the road skirts a long regular rampart 30 to 40 feet high, the remains of ancient Nineveh. At 3 miles the road bifurcates, one track going over the low gravel undu lations towards Talkaif and another which we follow. Turning north-west along a small branch of the Tigris, which encloses an island covered with low bushes and gardens. Our route follows the line of the new post road, visible at intervals till Zakho pass is reached. It is 15' to 18' wide, with a shallow ditch dug at either side, but only about half a mile of it, near the Khizir bridge, is complete. Portions here and there have been roughly metalled, and along others lie heaps of stones still standing. The metalled portions require gravelling and rolling to make them smooth, but all work has ceased now for two years. A few culverts, but no large bridges, were built: some of the former, are crumbling away already from scamped work. Forced labour was employed and villagers were supposed to work without pay for six hours on either side of their village. For work beyond that distance a little uncertain pay, issued quarterly, might be obtained. Villagers refused work, and fled from their villages. The road is never used, paths alongside it being preferred for caravans. flhese are broad tracks 15 to 18 feet wide, over gravelly clay soil, crossing a series of low undulations. Hadiyah, -At 3 5 miles pass Hadiyah, a ruined village on the river bank, destroyed by high floods, and a modern village of the same name on the low heights to the north of the road.Mar Virgin—ki 5| mllps, at 5-25 P.M., turned aside, a mile from the road, and halted in the convent of Mar Girgis (St. George), or Deir, as the Arabs call it. . .. . There is a strong masonry building on an isolated mound, in which live six hospitable monks. The upper portion of the walls are loopholed for defence against Bedouin raiders. There is a good spring in a ravine close by, but is choked by dead locusts at present. They crowd into the water in thousands as fast as the surface can be cleared. Several springs in this district were polluted in the same way. Water had to be obtained from a smaller spring a mile off. The Tigris is 2^ miles distant, and makes a sharp westerly bend here. In the loop are four small Turkman villages surrounded by gardens and a thick brake of low bushes. . The monks here are of the Papal Chaldeans, the head priest being an Italian. Noon temperature 89° today; and the glare on the bare plain severe. After midnight the air became much cooler, and at 4-20 a.m. temperature fell to 62°. 17th June.—General direction, N.W. Left the convent at 4-20 a.m., and rejoined broad track across the plain. The telegraph from Mosul to Diarbekr through Jazirah (two wires on wooden poles) follows the general direction of the road. The soil of the plain is a gravelly loam, and very fertile ; only a small frac tion of it is cultivated ; although wheat grows without irrigation. Crops have suffered a good deal this year from locusts; and some fields were seen with nothing but a few bare stalks. A small worm called ce Sin or Sun which gets into the grain is said to have done much damage also. Numerous tracks cross the plain running towards Talkaif. At 12^ miles passed through Filfil, a small village on a stream with Tndian-corn grown in patches along the banks. The water of the stream is slightly brackish; and for drinking, shallow wells are dug in the stream bed, and the water from which is found quite sweet. A good deal of lime is burnt in these villages. The kiln is a small circular T . , . hut sunk below the ground, with a domed roof per- L,meWn '' g - torated with large holes. Dehistur). —At 22} miles pass Deiristun, where once stood a convent, now a Kurdish village with a few Yezidis. The headman had a rough four-wheeled cart, the only one seen in the whole countryside, which he used for drawing stone, for lime burning : he used a pair of oxen for draught. Batak Su. —At 23| miles crossed the Batak Su, a small stream flowing west to the Tigris. We met here a party of Delhi Musalmans on a pilgrimage to Mecca; they were going by Jazirah, Mardin, Urfa and Birijik, fo Aleppo, from there to Damascus, and then across the desert to Mecca, begging their way as they went. The farther the round they took to reach Mecca, the surer were they of finding salvation. It was nearly two years since they left India. Their diary being roughly 5 months in Busra, 6 in Baghdad, 3} in Karbala, 1| inNedjef, 1 month on the march Mosul to Baghdad, and 1 month in Mosul. Most of them knew Turkish. They were happy and contented, full of religious zeal; and recognized the rupee as an old friend. Hattara .—A mile up stream is Hattara, a large village. Passed a caravan of 500 camels returning empty from Mosul to Diarbekr.154 At 27£ miles a deep ravine lies to the left, with some ledges of sandstone, x The stream turns several mills and flows to join the Batak Su. Gurrapahan. —At 29§ miles, at 2-30 p.m. halted in Gurrapahan (1,285'), a large Yezidi village, through which a road led to Dohuk across a level plain (see Route IX). The houses in the village have mud walls with sloping roofs of wattle covered with a thin layer of earth. Good water from a small stream close by, now nearly dry. Small wells are dug in the stream bed and water obtained from them. Temperature at 8-30 a.m. 87°, at noon 97°, an hour after sunset 78°, and at 4-30 a.m. 70°. Hot winds blew all the afternoon. The locusts were very troublesome, invading everywhere and eating anything. Wheat and barley is being threshed now. 18th June-—General direction, N.W. and N. Left village at 5-15 a.m., and rejoined main road. The new road and the telegraph follow the same general direction. The latter does not go through Zakho, but strikes across the plain to the west, rounding the end of the Jabal Abiadh near Feishkhabur, and following the bank of the Tigris to Jazirah. At 5f miles crossed the Dohuk River, flowing south-west to the Tigris. Dohuk bears 68 ° from here. Dulep. miles up stream is Dulep, a large Yezidi village, with gardens and orchards; the same distance down stream is Gireschik, also Yezidi. Simel. AtlOj miles cross a small stream, and passed through scattered village of Simel, composed of miserable mud huts with sloping thatched roofs. There are few Zaptiyahs quartered here, and it is a changing station for post horses. A small square stone fort partially in ruins stands on a mound on the bank of the stream. Patches of wheat and Indian-corn grew round the village, but only a fraction of the culturable ground is utilized. Locusts still seen in large numbers. Among the rest were a large species 4 to 5 inches long, called “chikdem ” in Arabic. The common locust is called “ deragh.■ ,, The inhabitants of Simel are settled Arabs of the Shammar Tai from the right bank of the Tigris. Talzait .—-At 15| miles Talzait, a large village, lay 2 miles to the left. There was a brick bridge here on the new road, built only two years ago, but now in ruins. Several small villages are dotted about the plain to the west, half hidden in ravines. Bashistha. —At 19 miles we could see Bashistha Telegraph Office on the plain, 3 miles to the left. It was placed thus so as to be equidistant from Dohuk and Zakho. I he Jabal Abiadh, the foot of which we are now approaching, is an un broken rocky wall, extending from Feishkhabur to the Dorgh Pass near Dohuk. Besides the Zakho Pass is the Beitas Pass, 10 miles to the south-east of it, just above the village of Baghian and very difficult for mules. Ibis and the Zakho lass are the only two practicable points to cross the range between Feishkhabur and Dohuk. Zakho Pas*. At 2/f miles the road led north through the Zakho Pass (2,150'), a wide gap in the range. The ascent is easy, a 1 O'to 12'track almost clear of stones. At 29| miles reached the top of the pass (2,680'). The northern slope of the range is thinly wooded with low oaks and shrubs. It falls away towards Zakho in a series of rounded ridges, outliers from the main range; a155 little grass still grew on these slopes, and vineyards clustered round the villages. The road keeps winding along the slope by a stream, now and then des cending into the bed of it. The new road is not continued farther than the southern entrance of the pass. There is no attempt at road making in the pass, but the track could easily be improved into a good cart road. At 36 miles the valley opened out, and we entered Zakho, where we halted (1,400'). Zakho. —Zakho is a place of 500 houses, built on a low rocky island about 800 yards long by 400 yards broad, formed by the Khabur River. It is con nected with the left bank by a good stone bridge of three irregular shaped arches 90 yards long, with a roadway of 10 feet. The northern arm of the Khabur is not bridged ; and is not fordable yet, but will be so in a few days. The current in both branches is rapid, and is still in high water from the melting of the snows. In floods the water is said to rush over the bridge, and the western end of the island is subject to floods. The Khabur rises in Berwari and the mountain districts north of it and is navigable at certain seasons from here to its junction with the Tigris. Above Zakho, it is a rapid mountain stream in a narrow rocky bed. Below, it spreads out into several channels over a shingly bed from 300 to 400 yards broad. A large raft, on its way to Mosul, left this evening, but grounded 6 miles down and had to be lightened to get off. The rafts are a framework of timber supported on 100 or 200 inflated sheepskins, like those at Mosul. A supply of poplars, 30 to 40 feet long, for constructing them is kept on the bank above the bridge. Two miles upstream from Zakho is another curious masonry bridge with a central arch of 40 feet span of a very high pomted shape. It has no parapet; the roadway is 15' wide, with a steep ascent and descent to the top of the arch over rounded paving stones slippery as glass. At the east end of the island, on a small cliff, is an old Kurdish castle, now used as the residence of the Kaimmakam and quarters for Zaptiyahs consisting of an irregular shaped building with loopholed bastions, about 60 by 40 yards. The inhabitants of Zakho are mostly Kurds, with a large number of Jews, one estimate giving half the inhabitants as Jews. Coal is found in the Judi Dagh at Kumr Maden near the small Christian „ , . villag-e of Billo, seven hours distant on horseback by a rough difficult track from Zakho. It takes two days to bring it by mule caravan and from here it is put on rafts and taken down to Baghdad. The coal held is a rich one, and would pay well if properly worked, but at present work has ceased. This coal was burnt on the Turkish Tigris steamers, but English coal has superseded it. It is a bituminous smoky description. 19th June.— General direction, W. Leaving the mules at Zakho, I hired post horses, and started west along the river to Eeishkhabur. There is a good broad track skirting the river on one hand and the foot of a line of rounded gravelly spur from the Jabal Abiadli on the other. The summit ridge of the range is composed of vertical sheets of limestone, and is quite impassable. These outliers would form an excellent position for redoubts to defend the Zakho Pass. On the right bank of the river is a plain which extends for 5 to 6 miles to the foot of the Judi Dagh. Ziarat Khalil Aghwar.' in a large grove of oaks. -At 6 miles passed the Ziarat of Khalil Aghwar156 This is much venerated by the Kurds and nomads \vho pass this wav. It was set round with little green and white dags, and inside the low stone wall were various articles, such as black tents, tent matting and poles cradles, fee., deposited one by each set of passers-by as a sort of offering. At 9 miles the spurs from the left cease, and the road turns south-west, leaving the river and ascending the Derebun plateau (see plan). Three Christian villages, surrounded by large groves of oaks, lay at the foot of the ridge, and we crossed several small streams dowing from large springs near these villages. Derebun Plateau.— At Iff miles the level of the Derebun plateau (1,780') was reached. The ascent is stony, but gradient easy. This plateau is a long dat-topped spur, to 2 miles wide, extending to the Khabur, which it overlooks in a series of steep bluffs. At 17Smiles passed the small Yezidi village of Derebun, The rocky ridge of the Jabal Abiadh terminates now to the left. The telegraph, Mosul to Jazirah, passes close by the village. At the foot of the rock is a spring from which dows a large stream with a plentiful supply of good water all the year round. There was a convent once here, but nothing is left of it now. The name means convent of the spring. The stream dows down to the Tigris at Feishkhabur in a small ravine, and is utilized to turn three mills. A long even descent leads from Derebun to Feishkhabur (1,100'), 4-i miles farther on. (Total 21 ^ miles.) this line or hills at the foot of the Jabal Abiadh forms an excellent posi tion to command the outlet of the passes from Upper Armenia and the mountainous country to the north-east. Derebun plateau is a sort of natural bastion, and the front is covered by the Khabur river. hevshkhcibur Thisisa village of Papal Chaldeans of 200 houses onaknoll overlooking the left bank of the Tigris, surrounded by fruit orchards and gardens in a loop about 2 miles long to the south, irrigated from the river. Wheat and rice are grown. The cotton crop was destroyed last year by locusts. The Tig ris dows here in a deep channel 150 to 200 yards broad, winding over a gravelly bed from 500 to 600 yards wide, which is entirely covered bv doods. The current was from 3 to 4 miles an hour, .and the water in the river was still high from the spring freshets. On the right bank were a line of steep earth cliffs 100 to 150 feet high, beyond which rose a series of dat-topped undulations, extending 4 miles west of Feishkhabur. These culminate in a low rocky ridge, about 8 miles long, forming a sort of continuation of the Jabal Abiadh, though not so high. These heights are too distant to command Derebun plateau. The country on the right bank looks very bare and withered. No streams or villages could be seen, and the Shammar Tai Arabs were now out raiding on that bank. There used to be a boat ferry here, but it has been removed by the Govern ment in order to force the nomad tribes, who pasture their docks in winter on the right bank, to cross at either of the bridges at Mosul or Jazirah, where officials are posted to collect toll. Some tribes manage to evade this toll and get across at various other points. A tribe of nomad Yezidis migrating from Jabal Sinjar to the Hakkiari mountains were met on the road who had done so. ^ The weather was fine, but rather hot in the day time; noon temperature 94°, but the nights were much cooler. Temperature at 5-30 a.m. was 71°.157 20th June.—General direction, W. and N.W. Left Zakho at 5-30 A.M. As the northern arm of the river was scarcely yet fordable for loaded mules, we had to go up the left bank, cross at the old bridge there, and return along the right bank until opposite the town again. ^ c ^ i -l The road follows the general direction of the river west ot Zakho. A flat plain, 5 to 6 miles broad, of rich loamy soil, extends north-west and north to the foot of the Judi Dagh. The Judi Dagh is a steep wooded range, the first outlier of the lofty moun tains of Buhtan and Hakkiari which lie beyond it. There is a local tradition that it was the original resting-place of the Ark, and there is a small shnne at the summit to which an annual pilgrimage is made. . Hazil River .—At 9| miles reached the left bank of the Hazil river near the small village of Dornoch. This is the largest tributary of the Khabur rising east of Shernakh Dagh, and is a collection of several streams from the Halakur Dagh, Awrakh Dagh, and the north slopes of the Shostheh Dagh andDabazir Dagh Route XI.) . , , .. , i 'it emerges from a rocky gorge in the Judi Dagh, 4 miles distant, beat- • ^ 30° It flows in several channels over a gravelly bed 200 to 300 yards wide. The principal channel was 80 yards wide and 3 feet deep, with a rapid current, difficult to .ford. A guide was procured from Dornoch; otherwise it would be impossible to cross. Ten days ago the mail had to be taken across on a Alono- the bank we saw six encampments of about 600 tents of Hajan. Kurds, on their way for the summer to the mountains at the head-waters of t e Hazil. The water from the river is utilized in canals to irrigate the plain to a certain extent. Passed some large fields of Indian-corn, now about a foot high. The large Christian villages of the Tal Khabbin and Wasit lie at the toot of the Judi Dagh, about 4 miles to the north-west. Near them are some large orchards and some cultivation. . . w Nahrawan. —After 19^ miles along abroad easy road over the plain. V\ e halted in the small Christian village of Nahrawan by a small stream. Indian- corn, wheat, and barley were the chief crops on the plain. Fever, ague, and opthalmia were much complained of,^ and the people looked poor and wretched. Girki Budru and Takian are two Christian \illages in the plain to the south-west. ioao From here the higher bluifs of the Derebun plateau bears 17o to 18U . I met Mr. Annesley here, an American Missionary, on his way from Marnin 21st June —General direction N.N.W. Left Nahrawan at 4-0 a.m., head ing nearly west across the plain. Reach at 3^ miles the edge of a low terrace bordering the Tigris, and the road dipping into the flat alongside the riverbed, here about a mile wide (1,130'). . The line of telegraph coming from Derebun rejoined here. Low gravelly hills come down on either bank. The road follows the river bank, an easy Jam Sharaf.' —At 5| miles crossed a large stream from the Judi Dagh to the north-east. On the right bank of it is a ruined fort called Jam Sharaf on a knoll over looking the river. Near it was a small village and some extensive fruit orchards, with two mills and a fine grove of poplars along the stream. Beyond the village the road leads along the foot of some gravelly cliffs, 60 to 80 feet high, bordering the Tigris.153 The river channel now is 150 to 200 yards wide, and the shingly bed, cover ed at high floods, is from 400 to 500 yards wide. On the right bank is a bare undulating country, now quite burnt up. No streams were noticed coming in on that bank. Close to the bank are a line of steep gravelly cliffs 150 feet high. Nardusfi River .—At 8 f miles came upon the valley of the Nardush river. It rises in the Shernakh Dagh, and emerges from the hills near Shakh {see Route XI). It flows in a gravelly valley 600 to 700 yards broad, entirely filled in flood time. There are several small channels, and we forded one 30 yards wide and 18 inches deep. Crossing at the same time was a caravan of 400 camels going empty from Mosul to the copper mines of Arghana Maden near Diarbekr. From there they carry ore to Sakanderun for export, a good paying business they said. The road is a broad track, 12 'to 15' wide, following the river flat, here | to f mile wide. At 111 miles the river formed a large gravelly island, and the track skirts for \ mile along the foot of a gravelly cliff overhanging the water. Shortly after the river makes a westerly bend of 5 miles round the end of a low ridge in front. Our track leads over the ridge by an easy ascent and down a steep winding descent, until at 17£ miles we reached the valley of the Tigris again (1,230'), and, skirting the river bank at L9| miles, reached Jazirah.JAZIRAH-IBN-OMAR. Jazirah-iLn-Omar, as it is called to distinguish it from A1 Jazirah, is built on a low gravelly island in the Tigris about 700 yards long by 500 broad. It is a town of 1,500 houses, inhabited chiefly by Kurds, with 100 houses of New Chaldean Christians. # i u The Christian quarter is at the east side of the island. A Bishop under the Patriarch Mar Elia of Mosul lives here. . The town was a frontier post in the Homan times, and the remains of a wall built of large blocks of stone, 15 to 20 feet high, breached in many places, still exist. At the east side overlooking the river is the serai or Government offices where the Kaimmakam lives. It is a ruined building, once very strongly built, intended as a sort of bridge head. The walls and entrance gates'Vere built in alternate layers of white and black volcanic looking stone, giving a curious streaked appearance. There is a boat-bridge here of 16 pontoons of the same shape and size as those at Mosul. It was only a w^ek ago connected up, Boat-bridge. t | le r i ver being in flood previous to that. The bridge was rot quite long enough, and there remained some 30 yards to be forded on the left bank. On the right bank is a cut stone pier built by the Romans. The bridge is 120 yards long, with a planked roadway 16 feet wide, made of rough timbers full of holes. There are three spare pontoons used for crossing when the bridge is swung back, which hold four loaded mules each. Several large caravans of camels, numbering 300 to 500, passed over today. When they were on the bridge some became frightened, and the whole started running and nearly carried the bridge away; while three leaped into the river, and were hauled out about tw r o miles down. Some would not face the bridge and had to be swum across. One man had to guide the head and another the tail, and even then it was 1 £ miles down stream before they reached the other bank. 'there is a toll bar on the west bank. One merchant was encamped for three days on the east bank before he could arrange the proper amount of toll to be paid to the Kaimmakam. The latter wanted H piastres per camel, but after telegraphing to Mosul and much bargaining they were got over for 1 piastre each. An arbitrary toll like this must paralyse trade. The river channel was 150 yards wide at the bridge and from 15 to 20 feet deep. The total width of the bed covered in floods is 400 yards. It widens to 600 yards lower down. Pir-a-Bahjit .—If miles down stream is the remains of an old Roman bridge called by the Kurds the Pir-a-Bahfit. The channel is 150 yards wide; there were two large arches, the central pier of which is just visible above water. The spans of these were about 100 feet each. A smaller arch of 60 feet span on the west bank still remains intact. The piers are of concrete faced with large blocks of cut stone. On one pier were eight faces on which were carved tablets representing the sun and twelve signs of the Zodiac. There is a small bridge across the moat at the west side of the town with 4 spans of various sizes of rough tree trunks resting on masonry piers with a160 plank roadway 10 feet wide on top. It is in a very tumbled down condition. The channel round the island is 150 yards wide, and contains several small springs. The houses in Jazirah are supplied from small wells, and the river water is excellent for drinking after it has been filtered. It is comparatively cold from the snows melting. Good ice was obtainable, brought in by Kurds from the mountains. The bazar was poor and straggling, crowded with Kurds from the moun tain districts. Bundles of green grass were brought in daily on donkies from the hills to the eastward. Good fruit is obtainable in autumn from the gardens on the river bank down stream, and several vineyards were dotted about the low hills overlooking the town from the west. Some 5 miles to the south-west were encamped some 4,000 tents of Yezidi and Kurd nomads waiting to cross the bridge with their cattle on the way to the mountains for the summer. Most were nomad Yezidis from Jabal Sin jar. The#e were also 1,500 tents on the right bank near the bridge and some 500 on this bank that had crossed. Immense flocks of sheep and goats and some herds of cattle belonging to these tribes were scattered in all directions on the hillsides. I went through several of their camps; they complained of having to pay a large toll at the bridge. It was 4| Stamboul piastres for each sheep, and for one tribe that had 1,000 sheep this amounted to about 40 liras. A sheep not above the average would bring in 3^ krans per annum as the price of wool, cheese, &amp;c., a good sheep perhaps 5 krans, and a bad one perhaps not 3 paras. They spent the summer on the hills south of lake Van and Yastan, which they hoped to reach in 10 days going fast. An ordinary caravan would take 15 days to Van. They talk nothing but Kermanju, or one or two of the principal men Turkish or Arabic. They had to pay Ferhan Pasha, the Shaikh of the Shammar Tai Arabs, a regular contribution for the right of pasturage. After paying this and the Government toll, they had barely sufficient left for food. They sold their wool on their way through here. About religion they were very vague. One tribe said they tvere all Christians at one time, but professed to be Muhammadans now. They were a lively, cheery people, and came in numbers to my tent, professing great friend ship and respect for English people. The Kireha and Muareschan were the two largest tribes among these nomads. Large numbers of camels could be collected here, as every day a drove of from 800 to 500 passed by on this way from Mosul to Diarbekr. There was a force of 200 Zaptiyahs in tents here used chiefly to defend the district from Arab raids. They are well mounted on light, wiry Arab horses, and armed with Martinis and Sniders. The Shammar Tai under Ferhan Pasha had large raiding parties out now, and threaten Jazirah. Mr. Agob or Jacob, a large Armenian merchant from Diarbekr, did a large trade in wool here. Kurds were engaged all day long bringing in wool from the districts round. This is the export season for wool, and large rafts were loading for Baghdad. The wool from the Bohtan and round Jazirah is particularly soft and fine. Mr. Agob's voluntary subscription towards the war expenses in 1878 are said to have amounted to £25,000. Two rafts from Diarbekr passed down today with a tent on each carry ing a Turkish official and his family.161 sm,!! nverwatti. e Nif K| itains, ^ mom, Joi 'fefro« 1 the gari eiB houttheb ! south-re! ting to cros he summa e and some goats and I direction ing to pjf sheep, and A sheep e price of rhaps not Fan and ordinary mjn, or Ferhu for the ,ey Mi llitougA ^ere all ey were a at iriencl- long these a drove of iarhehr, did ; g briogin? i for wool, the Bohtai s volnntarj unoonted w Kurds came down floating cn single skins from the country up stieana.

There and at Hassan a village to the south-east are pastors under the Sairdt American Mission. Several Protestants also live m Azekh, 10 miles to the west.

Iloutos from Jaalrah. To Diarbekr .—There are two roads to Diarbekr, one leading direct across the Tor Ah din Hills through Midiyat and Mardin (see “ Colonel Bell’s Turkey in Asia”).

Tins road lies over a series of rolling downs watered by numerous streams, and growing fine grass in the spring, but burnt up during the summer and autumn. . , , , , , . c In spring the mail or “ postea ” takes the latter route in consequence ot the good fodder, while in summer and autumn it goes by Midiyat and Mardin. Water also rather scarce then, but there are numerous villages, mostly of Jacobite Christians. The Tor Abdin country is fertile, producing corn and grapes principally. . Route to Sairdt and Bitlis.—TlRs is an important route both strategically and commercially, being one of the main passes from the Mesopotamian plain to Erzerum and the Armenian tablelands. Through A mad iy eh by the Zab valley and Bashkala is another roi^e, and through Diarbekr, Kharput, and the Upper Euphrates valley is another way of reaching the same country from here. Besides these three there is practically no other way passable for troops. ^ The stages on this route are given thus : Fenduk Balak Sairdt Javiersur Bitlis Total distancs: Miles. 33 27 21 27 30 13S This road is rough and difficult even for pack animals ; it follows the left hank of the Tigris until its junction with the Bohtau Su, and then the valley of that stream and its tributaries to Bitlis. The ascent commences at the junction of tlie two rivers, and continues to Bitlis, a rough hilly district. _ _ - , . . From Bitlis it is 43 miles in a direction west-north-west to Mush in the Euphrates valley. , TT . c , Another route to Sairdt lies through Midiyat and Hassan Kait. But from Hassan Kaif to Sairdt are some steep hills. A third route to Sairdt passes through Derguleh, and goes to the eastward of the Tigris through the Boh tan district. It is four stages. The first stage is to Derguleh six hours distant through the Tang-i-Kasr- ghelli through which the Rohsur river joins the Tigris. This pass is a difficult mule track. . The second stage was Birka (eight hours), Besukan being passed en route. The third stage is Barasha Keupri (eight hours). The Bakhtia river is followed from Birka, and several villages are passed; amongst others Awal Serkhutta, Singa, Roshini, Hergul or Bohtan.At Bavaeha is a bridge over the Sedika vivei. The fourth stage is Sairdt, passing through Siddoch and Kiai.lt This route was said to be very difficult for mules, and only med \ foot men. information o-iven in Jazirah about routes through the Hartoshi country to more thun usually -mrelmbl.

KURDS IN THE HAKKTARI MOUNTAINS. The following are the principal Kurdish tribes in the Hakkiari Mountains from Jazirah eastward to the Persian frontier . ,i t rwrfi Q Q /i '—These are a sedentary tribe occupying 2o villages m the Judi Da 0 h, immediately north of Zakho, along the banks of the Hazir. w , They have a very bad reputation. The Christian villages of \\ asit and Tal Khabbin are in this country. . Slopi. —This is a sedentary tribe of 22 villages living on the south-west slope of the Judi Dagh between the Hazir and Jazirah. vr &lt;- f The Christian villages of Hassan and Nerwan are in this district. Mostot the highway robbery on the road near Jazirah is put down to this tri &gt;e. Haji Bairam .—A sedentary tribe of 13 villages also m the Kaza of JaZl ^ _A small tribe living in the Hazir valley in eight villages. They have also a had reputation. , „ ^ - Bohtimi .—This is the generic name for a collection of tribes numbering 62 vdlages in all, living in the country on the road between Jazirah and Sairdt and eastward towards Shattak. A village was given by my informant as about 30 houses eac i. There are a few Kurdish villages along the north-east slope of the Judi Dagh under the Agha of Shakh. Hubla Divin and Shakh are the three laro , est villages. For detailed description of Shakh {see Route XI). °Kiki ,—These are a tribe numbering 24 villages, extending along the left bank of the Tigris for some 20 miles north of Mosul. „ . Sliwan .— These are a tribe living in the Jabal Abiadh south of Zakho. They number 25 villages. . , A portion of these are nomad, or “ Kochers,^ moving for summer pasturage (zozau) to the mountains west of Gavvar. Dtfs/h'.—These are a tribe living in the district round Debok and tne north west of it, and also in the Supna valley. They number 16 villages. A portion of them are nomad, going to Gavvar for zozan. y 2164 Sindi .—These live in 15 villages in Tiari to the north-west of Amadiyeh. They are sedentary. Misuri .—They are a sedentary tribe, roughly divided into two portions,—&gt; the Geri or lower, and the Jori or upper ; the former being south-east, and the latter east and north-east of Amadiyeh. Hartoshi. —This is one of the most powerful of the Kurdish mountain tribes. They are almost all nomads, 15,000 in number, and having 3,000 tents. They are semi-independent, and are under Muhammad Agha of Shernakh, a chieE of considerable influence. In winter they go to the plains round Mosul, Jazirah, and Shernakh, while in summer they pasture their flocks in the high mountain ranges between Bashkala and Jazirah. In Nurduz they live in tents all the summer, and force their way into some adjacent Christian village during the winter. Herki .—These are another large nomad tribe, not quite as large as the Hartoshi, but numbering 10,000 men or 2,000 tents. In winter they come down to the Tigris plain, and in summer go to Shamsdin, Nuteha, and Girdi, travelling by way of liezan. Occasionally they wander over the Persian frontier into Mergavvar and Tergavvar. They are noted robbers, and have a very bad reputation. There are some Herki villages in Shamsdin and Nuteha. Zebari .—These number 1 4 villages dotted about the hills, east of Akra and in the Zab valley towards Amadia. They are all sedentary. Nerwi .—This tribe lives in 13‘ villages northward of the Zab valley near Rezan, and in the Shirwan district eastward towards Rawanduz. Oramar .—This tribe lives in 22 villages in Shamsdin to the eastward of the Nerwi country. There are some living along the frontier and some in Persia itself. The celebrated Shaikh Oheidulla, who raised a rebellion in 1880, belonged to this tribe. He lived at Neri, the principal Oramar village. llekani .—This is a small tribe living in eight villages in the mountains, east of Amadiyeh and north-west of the Nerwi country. Pinianixh .—'this tribe live south-east of the dial District in the Nestorian mountains. They are partly nomad and partly sedentary. In summer the Kurdish nomads move to the hills by easy stages, pastur ing their flocks as they go. They ascend as the snows recede, and in two or three months reach the elevated pasture lands, or “ zozans/ J where they spend the summer, and where the best grass grows closest to the snowdrifts.KURDISTAN. Kurdistan is a convenient geographical expression for the country inhabited by the Kurds. . , . , • j i The name is not used in the country m this general .sense, nm, indeed, would it be technically correct ; for only in a very small portion ot this region is the population exclusively Kurdish, A line traced from Kars to hrzerum, from thence to the Dei sim Mountains at the junction of the two arms ot the Euphrates near Kharput, then touching Diarbekr and following the course of theTioris to join the outer line of hills called the Jabal Hamnn would cir cumscribe” to the west the limit of Kurdistan. Here the Kurdish element comes in contact with Turkman and Arab tribes races, while to tne north-west and west the Kurd comes face to face with Osmanh and Armenian peasants, while to the south the Kurdish hills abut on the wide plains over which the various Bedouin tribes are wont to wander. 4 • The northern portion of Kurdistan formed in ancient geography the east ern part of the kingdom of Armenia, and is now included in the modern prov ince of Turkish Armenia; but the mass of the Mussalman population is a spurious element of Kurds who pretend they have some claim to call them- The limits of Kurdistan to the south are delineated by the Jabal Hamrin, which borders the Baghdad plain, and a line from Kifri to the^Mamsht Kuh and north-east to Karmanshah. This abuts on the frontier of Luristan. The mountain ranges running north and south, forming the frontier be tween Turkey and Persia, has been reckoned as the eastern limit of Kurdis tan ; hut this is not exact, as many Kurdish tribes are settled in West Persia beyond it. . , -n • A district, of which the chief town is Sihna, is known as Persian Kurdistan, while round Zohab, Suj Bulak, Sakiz, Ushnu, and Maku the popu lation is exclusively Kurdish. The total area ol the countiy thus enclosed is about 50,01)0 square miles. &lt; ^ Of the population, especially the nomad portion, it is extremely dithcult to form an accurate estimate, hut at HO to the square mile, which is a fair aver age, the total numbers of the Kurdish population would he 1,500,000. ° Attempts have been made to classify this Kurdish population as sedentary and nomad, and to distinguish between tribal and non-tribal communities; but all such divisions are arbitrary, and ought not to he admitted in a statistical The original organization of the Kurds was tribal, and the prevailing habits have been nomadic and pastoral. . In reality the distinction between living in villages as cultivators and living in tents as shepherds mainly depends on the localities where the tribes happen to be established. The tribesmen, whose natural instincts lead them to migrate between summer and winter quarters, become sedentary only when obstacles either political or geographical are placed in the way of their movements. Tribal Kurds who settle in villages very soon lose their distinctive name, and mix with the peasantry of the neighbourhood. It may be added that in respect to the relative importance of the two classes, the sedentary Kurds greatly outnumber the nomads, but that they are166 not po wealthy, nor so independent, nor do they stand nearly so high in popu lar estimation. The Kurds generally bear a very indifferent reputation—a worse reputation, Character. perhaps, than they really deserve. Being aliens to the Turks in language and to the Persians in religion, they are everywhere treated with mistrust, and live as it were in a state of chronic warfare with the Government. The Turkish officials treat the Kurds as boorish and ignorant, and quite a lower scale of humanity. both the tribal nomads and the sedentary Kurds are taxed in the most inequitable and extortionate manner,—the former on the sheep and cattle, and the latter on their lands and goods,—and are looked upon as fair game to satis fy the rapacity of Kaimmakams and the lower grades of Turkish officials. These officials are constantly changed from one place to another. Conse quently they think nothing about instituting any improvlement in the condi tion of the country or the people, but rather of how quicky they can fill their pockets with money extracted from crushed and miserable villagers, or when they can collect sufficient money either to buy themselves into a higher place, or retire and spend the remainder of their days in a life of ease and luxury. Some 60 or 40 years ago almost the whole of Kurdistan was ruled by Kurdish Begs, who only acknowledged a general suzerainty of the Ottoman Government. Little by little the power of these Begs has been undermined and destroyed, and replaced in almost every instance by the ordinary routine of Turkish officialdom. The principal exception is the semi-independent district on the Hakkiar Mountains occupied by the Hartoshi Kurds under Muhammad Agha of Sher- nakh (Route XI). I he rule of the once powerful Begs of Julamerk, Bashkala, Rawanduz, and Sulaimaniah has now entirely passed away, and the comparative ease with which the lurks deal with any rising among the Kurds is due to their takin^ advantage of internecine quarrels between tribes and inability to combine together in sufficient numbers from jealousy of their leaders and factions among their followers. . Kurds are very ignorant and consequently bigoted, and their religious animosity is-heightened by constant quarrels with the large Christian popu lation who live among them. To elevate these at the expense of the Musalman, or to form an autonomous Christian province to the exclusion of the Kurds, would be the sure means of rousing the Kurds to form such a league as no mere political aim of their leaders would excite. . 1 bus the question of emancipating the Christian population or countenanc ing the aims of the Armenian people as “a nation rightly strugglino* to be free has to be very cautiously approached. The constant drain of Turkish rule on Kurdistan and Russian intrigue threatens to bring this question forward for solution. The experience gained in dealing in India with portions of the community hostile to each other as regards religion could be utilised here, and Kurd and Chnstoan induced to live in harmony under a strong and just Government. The Kurds themselves have very friendly feelings towards English people. I he educated people that I met had a strong sense of the justice and firmness ol Lngush rule and the manner in which the Mussulman population of India is treated. Questions were always asked on this subject. To win over this hue race of soldiers to our side may be necessary at some future time.167 lrser #l : ^ aliens to| 1 ^‘gion/Jifl ^ “f eliij t) a tidijtiit ( , ^ 'i the ug csttl^ S|, to sate ; 1' officials, ther.

In Central Kurdistan and in Persia, where they come in contact with the Shiahs the Kurds are most bigoted Sunnis, and hold strictly to the Koran and the teachings of Muhammad. Mosques are, however, seldom seen in their ^^Turrli^ Mai/ch.—The Kurds have among them, generally one to each tribe a Shaikh or religious head. They are different to the Arab Shaikhs, who are the civil and religious head as well. Shaikh Muhammad of Begil and the Shaikh of Bamurm are instances They are learned in religious matters, and settle religious disputes, and small differences among the tribes. , „ . . , , , , The Turks endeavour to keep all political influence out ot their hands, but do not in all cases succeed. , . . . They are rich and influential, and revered and looked up to by the tribes men, and may be said to take the place of the old Begs to a certain extent.^ Their authority is acknowledged on all religious points. Shaikh Obeidullah of Oramar had sufficient influence to raise the rebellion in 1880. His son now lives at Neri in Nuteha. As soldiers the Kurds have been of very little assistance at any time to the Ottoman Government. . _ . . . . , • , i They can scarcely be considered loyal to the Turkish rule, which t hey have learned to detest. At the commencement of the war of 1878, they held aloof from joining in the war against Russia, and seemed to desire to remain neutral. When the tide of war seemed turning against the Russians, they joined in considerable numbers; but, judging from the frightful excesses and looting- that went on at Bayazid, they did so more with a desire to share the plunder of victory rather than face the enemy. This may have been due to their leaders and having no heart in the Turkish cause ; because the Kurds have natuially some of the best characteristics of a soldier. ^ ^ _ The strategic importance of the district of Central Kurdistan renders it very important to know what action the swarms of Kurdidi horsemen would take. Properly led, paid, and organized by English officers, and their natural spirit and love of fighting roused in a good cause, they would perhaps equal the Cossack. . Used for scouting and for light cavalry work, they are invaluable ; and from what was seen of the independent Hakkiari tribes, they are absolutely obedient and trained to the will of their chief if they know him to be just and firm. With the Turkish army the great want of cavalry is a serious defect; the scouting for Mukhtar Pasha's army in Armenia in the 1878-79 campaign was entirely done by a small force of Kurds and Circassians; hut, owing to the absence of any pay or sufficient food, they deserted before the close of the war. Their scouting work and information about the enemy was always valu able, but on the other hand they were a terror to peaceable villagers, and looted whenever they had a chance. A force of Arab Bedouin cavalry raised round Urfa also did very good work. The Turkish Kurds are found in almost every possible stage from thorough subjection to the Government (as in the villages round Diarbeki and Rizeium)168 up to the semi-independent tribes of Haikkiari and Dersim, who only pay taxes when the Turkish troops occupy their country, and only on rare occasions supply soldiers, either regular or irregular, to the Government. r lhe nomad tribes are taxed at so much each head of sheep and cattle when they cross the Tigris to go to the hills. A great number oi Kurds are armed with Martini Peabody or Win chester repeating rides served out, but not returned after the war of 1878. The mountain tribes are still armed with old flintlocks. The spear as a weapon has entirely given way to the rifle, and is seldom seen. The Kurds are fair shots, usually tiring from horseback, but are not such marksmen as the Bakhtiari Lurs. A curved scimitar with a silver hilt and mountings slung close under the left arm, and a long dagger in the belt, complete the Kurdish warrior's equipment. Powder and bullets are manufactured in the Hakkiari Mountains from the sulphur and lead mines there. 1 he qualities which distinguish the Kurdish cavalry are great agility and suppleness, together with great power of enduring hardships and fatigue. The only evolution they know is skirmishing, the attack being made in disorderly masses. In the beginning of an action they endeavourto extend themselves in a line in order to avoid being outflanked; but this line is so i'tegular that in some parts it is only a single rank, while in others it is three, four, or even ten deep. They do not employ a second line. They know, however, the way of employing reserves. In marehino- order they go just as they please without any regularity. When marching or encamped, they know well how to guard themselves against surprise. Pew scouts and vedettes can reconnoitre the ground so thoroughly as the Kurds are capable of doing. I he Kurds have no particular breed of horses, hut obtain an extremely useful animal, a cross between the heavy and large boned Turkman horse and light wiry Arabs from the Tigris plain. In their annual migrations to the plains they either steal or buy a con siderable number of Arabs. Mules are bred in considerable numbers in Kakkiari. These and small black oxen are chiefly used as beasts of burden, horses being only used for riding. Education among the Kurds is at a very low ebb. The chiefs have one or two writers as a rule, and are able to read and write their lancniau'e. Kennanji is not wntten. Arabic and lurkish with a little Persian are the written languages. The language of the ivurds is known generally as Kermanji, containing a great number of dialects and words from the Persian and Arabic. The Kurds round Sulaimaniab, for instance, speak a different dialect, and would not be understood by those in Hakkiari or Dersim. The Km dish men are of fine physique, but are slow in their movements. They are tail, handsome, strongly built men as a rule, but with a sullen savao'e- looking cast of countenance, and with a certain fondness for military display and gorgeous dresses. J J A dark complexion with piercing black eyes and black hair is usually seen, but light hair and blue eyes are not uncommon. Their fierce, haughty expression distinguishes them easily from their Ghnstian neighbour. The women seem more intelligent than the Turkish women, perhaps owing to their greater liberty. They do not veil, except in chief's families; they prayin public, and take part in the general conversation and talk to strangers without hesitation. They are good looking; and many harems are supplied from Hakkiari. The Kurds are poor cultivators and prefer mountain districts, where they can get pasturage for their flocks as well. Only enough grain is produced for their absolute wants. Indeed they have no incentive to cultivate any more, as it would only mean increased taxes with no means of exporting or selling the produce. The Kurdish mountains are a barren or rather an undeveloped country, where cultivated fields or gardens are only to be found in the proximity of a few towns; and pasturage is consequently the chief resource of the country. Cheese, butter, honey, and sour curdled milk called “ yaurt ” are their chief fond. Route No. XL—Jazirah-ibn-Oroar to Baslikala through the Hartoshi Mountains. 29Ui June to 12th July. Stages.

Left the Jazirah bridge (1,120') at 5-45 a.m., and started by a broad gravelly path over an undulating country cut up by several small ravines. Conglomerate rock appears here and there, and several small springs were passed in the ravine. These ravines run south-east towards the Tigris. At 5| miles pass a cluster of huts called Serau (1,990'). About 1^ miles to the north-east is a rocky ridge with a rounded summit which runs east to the Judi Dagh, and north-west along the left bank of the Tigris. A road leads direct to Shernakh over this ridge avoiding the Gbelli pass, which we take. It looks a rocky difficult track, but is generally used by the nomads in their annual migrations. We turned east, skirting the foot of the hill, the range about 1 mile from it ; crossing the summit (2,300') of a rounded bare outlier from it, and descending towards the Nurdush.170 We met here several small caravans of donkeys carrying- firewood into Java rah. There were a few groves of oaks and stray hawthorn trees, and the streams were lined with oleanders, myrtle, and low shrubs. IS nr clink Hirer .—At 9| miles again reached the valley of the Nurdush river (1,450') previously crossed between Nahrawan and Jazirah. It here emerges from a rocky gorge to the north, at the mouth of which Sh skh is situated. Cross the stream on a stone bridge of an arch of 40 feet span, and turned north-east up the valley towards Shakh. llubla .—Some 4 miles further along the range on a* hearing of 11 i &amp; is Hubla, a Kurdish village, at the mouth of a smaller gorge, through which a stream flows to join tbe Nurdush. It is a village of about 150 houses in a large grove of fruit trees and orchard. On the slope of tbe rocky bill between the Hubla valley and Shakh were extensive ruins and the line of an old wall with towers at intervals. From the bridge we turned up the left bank of the stream, following a narrow track among small cultivated terraces and gardens, irrigated by small streams from the hillside above. In the gardens were almond, fig, walnut, mulberry, olives, vines and pomegranates, and some large ash trees. The walnut and mulberry trees were especially large, and the path in places was choked with trailing vines and briar roses. These terraces grew, besides fruit trees, wheat, Indian-corn, tobacco, melons, bean, bamia, badinjan, and cotton on the higher slopes. Flew scenes could he prettier than this winding path through large leafy trees, hedgerows of roses, myrtle and pomegranate, with vines twining over head. On the opposite bank of the Nurdush is a bare rocky cliff 1,501) feet high dipping sheer into the water. Shakh. —At II 3 miles at the top of the incline (1,960'') reach Shakh, a place of 250 houses, on the end of a rocky spur ending in a cliff overhanging the Nurdush, 400 feet below. A large stream from the north flows through the village, and is used for irrigating the terraces on the slope below. Fhgs and mulberries were just ripe and grapes becoming sweet. The inhabitauts are Hartoshi Kurds, among whom were 30 Nestorian Christian houses with a priest. There was also a Protestant pastor educated at the American Mission School at Sairdt, who also visits the Christian villages Mansuriali and Hassan in the plain. His wife and family live here. Muhammad Beg, the Shaikh or “ Agha” of this village, is the eldest of four brothers, nephews of Muhammad Aghaof Shernakh, the Hartoshi chief, and when he goes into the plain he always has a following of 100 men about him. He is a young man, very quiet and reserved; and shooting ibex is his principal amusement. He is at present at variance with his uncle in Shernakh, this man being more in Turkish hands. No one sits in the Agha's presence until he has done so, and while eating no one is permitted to touch anything after the Agha has finished. Tribal organisation and respect for their headmen is kept up far more ar o ig these mountain Kurds than those in the plains who have become “rayah.” They looked upon the English as the future possessors of the country when Turkish rule had been swept away. Muhammad Beg, Bader Khan Pasha, Zala Beg, and Futha Beg are the Agha’s four brothers, the last being a boy of about 10.171 Bader Khan Beg, the Dergulek chief, celebrated for his massacre of the Nestorian Christians in 1842, was their grandfather, they were found most hospitable and friendly. ... , a • c The valley above the village runs up 23°, with a large stream flowing from a rocky basin topped with cliffs, and joins the Nurdush below the village. The stream bank for 3 miles above the village is lined with gaidens ot almond, fig, walnut, sycamore, ash, and several low shrubs. The valley is 200 yards broad for about a mile, and then opens out. Ilie remains of string masonry wall still remained which had been drawn across tilB Shakh is most interesting from an archaeological point of view, and would take a long time to thoroughly explore. t t K c , t on 1 noticed several rock cut chambers, one of them measured 15 leet by ~0 feet by 10 feet high. It had a door and window, and evidently was used as a dwelling house. . ,, There were some large inscriptions and carving on the cliff further up. . There was high up the hillside a large council chamber also cut m the rock 60 feet in depth and 30 feet broad, the entrance being a well turned arch some 40 feet high. Towards Hubla the line of the walls and some towens still remain, and the place must have been once, a large fortress. Traditions relating to the ancient city are numerous amon^ the villagers and one says there were seven distinct walls encircling the town, and Csesar s daughter had a summer palace here. A gateway into the village passes through a portion of the old Roman wall, and other portions are visible down the valley. Of the Romans it may he said “ Si monumentum quaeris, cir- cumspice.s probably the s [ te 0 f the Roman frontier fortress of Bezabde supposed to be at Jazirah or Finik.* _ . , , A kind of wild silk called 'gez” is procured in some quantities here, the cocoons being gathered from the trees. A very strong silk cloth is spun from it and used by the Kurds. , Fever is prevalent here now. ‘Weather was rather cooler here under the trees than at Jazirah; temperature 9b° at noon ; Hies and mosquitoes very troublesome. Snow is said to lie 2 feet deep here in winter, but this is rather exaggerated. 1 st July—General direction N.E. and E. Left Shakh (1,900 ) at 5-0 a.m., and started north-west up the valley of the Nurdush, following at first a 4 feet ledge in the hillside, obstructed in places by jutting boulders and low cliffs. The river below is a rushing torrent in a narrow bed among enor mous boulders. Gulijuna. —At 1| miles pass a few huts at the mouth of a small gorge (1,900 ) called Gulijuna. Seme large chambers and on the opposite bank of the river the remains of a large aqueduct are cut in the solid rock. The valley is 200 yards wide at the bottom. On the left bank^ some enormous cliffs of vertical sheets of rock 600 feet to 1,000 feet perpendicular. On the right hank is a very steep slope with rock jutting out here and Pir-i-Gbelli. —At 2£ miles crossed the river by a small masonry bridge (1,910'), and zigzaged up a rough difficult track in the cliff for about 200 yards, struggling up a 2 feet track on the edge of the cliff. If the bridge were de stroyed, it would be impossible to get baggage animals through here. * See Kawlinson’s Seventh Monarchy, pages 184-187, for the siege of Bezabde by the Persians, in which a body of Kurdish archers played a prominent part in the defence. Z 2172 In flood time the water washes completely over the top of the brictee This would mean a rise of about 35 feet, which would be quite possible in ilootls in sueli a narrow gorge. r After 3f miles the valley bends sharply to the north, and the road becomes a fairly easy track by the right bank, through a thicket of low shrubs and some good oak, sycamore, and ash trees. A foot track leads over the hill to the left to join the track from Serau. Kala Baginuk on the hills to tlie left and Kala Kelhuk to the right are p -~ of t ' V0 olli Rom an forts, placed here to bar the passage down the The valley narrows to 30 or 40 yards, with steep cliffs on either side, the road being a narrow ledge, very slippery and difficult, round some spurs which jut out here.

The Nurdush rises between the Judi Dagh and the east end of the Sher- nakh Dagh. The lower slopes of the Judi Dagh in this direction are shady undulations, cut up by ravines and dotted over with low scrub, the higher slopes and the valley itself being thickly wooded with oaks. A long gradual ascent over a well cultivated'country leads to| Shernakh (4,650') 12 miles from Chemishum Siki. Sheniakh .—This is a place of 400 houses, all Kurdish, with the exception of 30 Nestorian. It is situated on the hill slope by a small stream. Water is obtained from numerous small springs, and the houses are clean and built of stone and mud with flat roof. Whitewash is generally used, a remarkable thing for a Kurdish village. The hillside hr 2 or 3 miles on either side is cultivated in terraces, with wheat and a quantity of tobacco. The wheat is still green at this elevation, although it has been harvested in Jazirah. The people seem industrious and work hard in their fields. Some good oak, poplar, and mulberry frees grew along the stream. Hartoshi Kurds .—Muhammad Agha,the chief of the Hartoshi Kurds, lives here in a small house in the village. He is the son of Bader Khan Beg, and is a man of large influence among the mountain Kurds, and occupies a position partially independent of Turkish authority. The Hartoshi are a large tribe of some 3,000 tents, almost all nomads, except some settled in these villages round Shernakh, Shakh, Derguleb, and Divin. The nomads spend the summer in a Zozan ” or summer quarters in the high mountain ranges to the north-east, and winter either in the valle}^ near Shernakh and Derguleh, or the plain round Mosul and Jazirah. Muhammad Aghn/s influence is felt as far as Bashkala, where some of his tribe were met, and be absolutely controls the tribes as far east as Mer- wanen. He transacts a good deal of business, and papers kept constantly coming in and messengers from bis vakils on the distant mountains. They were written in Turkish, and the chief can both read and write. Muhammad Agha has three sons, the eldest a boy of about seven, who is looked upon as his heir. The Agha’s brother also lives here, and seems fond of engineering work, and showed me an irrigation canal which had been made under his superintendence, of which he was very proud. He complained that under the Turkish Government there was no scope for his talents. He said he looked upon me as the precursor of the English, who were some day coming to occupy the country, and he would be very glad when they did. Muhammad Agha is a middle aged man, slightly grey, with a hand some, determined-looking face, clear blue eyes, and a fair complexion. He was at Constantinople for four years about 1878, at the time when the British fleet came to Ismidt, and seemed much impressed with England's action then, and the Russian forces stopped at the gates of Constantinople. He was well acquainted with current European politics, and accounts of Her Majesty's Jubilee in London interested him much. He speaks Turkish well, reads and writes it also. Kermanji is the lan guage spoken by the people. The Agha had a scheme on hand now for repopulating and settling the Shernakh valley, which since the massacre of the Nestorians in 1842 has been quite waste. He talked of the value of a good water-supply and cleanliness in his villages.174 At Clietmstium Siki we met a party of men sent from Shernakh to (Ha 1 irrio-ation channels, &amp;c., and it was intended to settle some of the poorer peopla there. ^ ^ Round Shernakh the ground was certainly better and more carefully cultivated than usual in other Kurdish villages. The Agha is independent of Turkish authority, paying only a small tribute. He is much respected by the people, and is said to be a very just man aud not given to oppression. A dispute was now going on between Muhammad Agha and the Turkish officials at Jazirah about taxes collected from the nomads at the bridge there. M u ham mad Agha argues that the lands on which the nomads graze is his, and that he should receive some tribute, whereas almost all the tribute is taken from the Kochers when they pass the bridge at Jazirah. A Mutaserif with a guard of 10 Zaptiyahs was camped here, having arrived to discuss this question. Muhammad Agha expressed openly his hatred of the Turkish officials and their ways, saying they were eating the life out of the country, and it was scarcely to be wondered at that the Kurds occasionally retaliated* aud robbed and plundered when they could. Muhammad Agha could easily raise a force of 10,000 mounted men from toe Hartoslu and other tribes under his control. A large number would he fo.-nd armed with Martinis. They are naturally titled for outposts and scouting work. He sent a Vakil and six armed men with one to point out the road to Uashkala. The Shernakh Dagh extends some 9 miles in a north-western direction where it ends in the Chiraf Dagh, an isolated rocky peak overlooking the Kohsur stream. It extends south-east for about 6 miles, the Nurdush river rising' at that end of it. Climate. The avera g e fall of snow here was about 4 feet, and ’ the roads are closed from January to April usually. The change of temperature and air at this elevation (4,650') compared with Jazirah is very marked. The air here is cool and fresh ; temperature 82° at noon and 69° at 6 a.m. The dress of these mountain Kurds is characteristic. On their head is a tail conical felt cap, which they call kiolos. Round this they wind a puggri {alabi) consisting of two lengths of cotton, the second beino* called azadoi. &amp; These are made of black cotton with red stripes as a rule, and are brought from Aleppo. ° The sleeves of the shirt are open and almost touch the ground when they walk. There is a inside waistcoat without sleeves {^yelek) and an outer one with open hanging sleeves {tchapek), both of which are made of gay coloured silks. &amp; J The handsomest and most remarkable part of the dress is the short pelisse {lulu kiasarek) worn open in front with embroidered stripes of gold laee, aud the back thickly covered with the finest hair of the black Angora goat. This reaches tothe waist round, which is a kamarband of some bright coloured cloth, in which is stuck a curved dagger with an ivory handle. A long curved sword with carved hilt is generally worn with a very short sling under the left arm. vv ide trousers (tchalvar) stuffed into a pair of enormous red boots with green tassels reaching half way up the leg complete the Kurdish warrior's less. It is a very suitable one for sudden change of temperature.Some Martini rifles v^ere seen, but flintlocks of a very ancient pattern are mostly in use. . . , , . ,, &gt;. The spear is occasionally seen, but a Martini is looked upon as the perlee- tioD of a weapon for a tribesman to possess. Houtes from Sliernakb. To Zakho .—This is two btages or about 12, hours. The Hazir valley is followed as far as the Christian village of Wasit [see Route X), which is the intermediate stage. i It is said to be a good track for mules, but the country looks rocky and diiii- cult, and it would probably take three days. To SatuH —This is four stages : (1) Hundukh, a Kur tish village. (2) Deh, a large Nestorian village of 200 houses, where a Kaimmakam is stationed. (3) Terah, a Kurdish village. (4) Saird t. This is the best route for mules or caravans, said to be easier than our route through the Tang-i-G belli. The stages were given from 7 to S hours each, which would make the distance about 80 miles. This is easier than the road through Derguleh from Jazirah [see Routes from Jazirah). . . A ,, m- . To Jazirah .—A road to Jazirah leads through Derguleh and into the iigns valley by the Tang-i-Kasrghelli. It is said to be not much easier tin-a through Shakh or Serau. In all these routes the passes through the outer most range overlook’ng the Zakho and Jazirah plains are the most dirticult ; and once these are passed, the roads are fairly easy for pack animals. 2 k f an _—This is a very hilly, difficult track. A Kurd on f&lt; ofc could reach Van in five days. A mule caravan would take.at least 10, but no one knew the stages. The route passes through Shattak district, and Shokh or Menks. 3 rd July General direction E. by N. Loft Shernakh ascending gradually a small path through stone walls supporting the terraces on the hillside. _ Throuo-h some level terraces of rich soil containing numerous springs, and at 2 &amp; miles turned up east through a gap in the Shernakh Dagh to the 'Shernakh Pas *.—At 3 miles reached the summit of the Shernakh pass (5,180'), from which an extensive view,is obtained of the basin of the upper waters of the Hazil, about 30 miles broad. &lt; , . From 87° to 91° is a mass of rounded summits thickly covered with snow called the Shostheh Dagh, which we skirled later on. _ Follow the course of a small stream down a ravine ; the slopes thickly wooded with “balud ” oaks, on which grew a kind of mistletoe, and a stunted pear, iuniper, pistachio, and hawthorn trees. Wild vines and other shrubs in the valleys. From the berry of the pistachio an oil used for making soap is extracted. The whole hillside was scored with deep ravines in the shale soil. Passed some well grown oaks, 2 feet to 3 feet diameter, in the stieam vallejr. Several kinds of wild pea and vetch also seen. The track was fairly easy for mules, with some narrow places and steep giadients. At 9? miles turned over a low spur to the left (4,270'). The soil of these spurs is a soft, finely disintegrated shale of a light grey colour with no vege tation, not even grass. In the valleys and in patclies along the hillsides is a176 rich loimy clay which overlays the shale, and in whicli trees, shrubs, and grass grow. The whole basin of the Hazil is this formation, and presents a curious mottled appearance of large groups of trees with spaces absolutely bare, soil intervening. Conglomerate overlying limestone was seen at the bottom of some of the ravines. The road winds among some small ravines until a small ccl is reached at Vl miles (4,810'). llnlakur Dagh .—From the summit bearing 358° to 15° is the Halakur Dagh, I 0 miles distant. The south-east face presents along the summit a precipitous wall of rock, which firms the edge of a grassy plateau running north-west, merging into flat-topped hills rising beyond it. I he summit of the Halakur Dagh was patched with snow, and it is used as a “ zozan ” by kochers, abundance of green grass being found there now. Tracks led from here towards the Halakur Dagh. One track led over the hills to lake Van through what looked a very rough country, cut up by deep narrow valleys. Halakur Dagh probably corresponds with Harakel Dagh mentioned by Chermside. At 15 miles descended steeply into the gravelly bed of a small stream (8,310'), the Busta Berouseh, coming from the Halakur Dagh, and flowing south-south-east towards a narrow gorge in the mountains to join the Hazib Left the stream valley by a very steep ascent in a bare shaly slope, and pass two large heaps of stones marking where two men had been murdered* Crossed a bare ridge (3,830 ), and descended into another small stream vallev, well wooded, with an open grassy space for camping, where we halted, called Keni Mahwesik (3,430'). Keni Mahwesik, these wooded valleys have abundance of dead wood suit able for firewood. This little strenm valley runs down 173°, and the slopes on either hand are thickly wooded. Some 12 mile# down stream could be seen the gorge, through which flow the united streams which go to make up the Hazil, which emero-es into the plain, and joins the Khabur west of Zakho. This gorge looks very narrow and precipitous with some enormous cliffs. The soil valleys is rich; ash, willow, and sycamore grow by the stream banks. Some of these valleys are cultivated by people from Shernakh in the summer; otherwise this large tract of fertile country is entirely desolate. Temperature at 4 p.m. was 88 ° and at 6 a.m. 50°, the night being much cooler than the day. 4th July—General direction E. by N. Left camp, ascending the valley for a short way, and then turned to the right up a steep shaly ridge. At II miles reached the summit (3,875'), and turned along the ridge. The path was a 1 foot ledge in a slope of 45°, and a single slip would have sent the mules 300 to 400 feet down into the ravine. The mule carrying my tent got hung up in a small tree, and the branches had to be carefully cut away to extricate him. About 2 mile further on followed a long narrow-backed spur towards a deep valley in front of us; and a short way along this the track turned down the side of the spur, here a slope of 45°. The only way I could find of getting down was by putting both feet together and letting myself slide. The mules managed in something the same way, picking their own way, as the muleteers were quite unable to guide or help them, and the riding horses gave a good deal of trouble. Several sheep tracks used by the kochers in the migrations led about these spurs, but none of them were any easier.At H miles entered a stream bed 150 to 200 yards wide, bordered by steep shale slopes, and crossed a stream 30 feet wide and 1 foot deep (3, 7 ). Some miles down the valley to the south-east is a hill with steep f-ides shape like a truncated cone, with some steep precipices quite 2,000 leet high m the gorge to the south of it. The streams we have crossed unite and form the Hazil river, which flows round the western front of this. Our track follows the bank, crossing and recrossing the stream. In flood time the whole of the valley is filled from bank to bank. The stream rises in a'thiekly wooded hill with a rounded summit 4 miles to the north. At 7 miles left the valley, and climbed up a spur nearly bare, with only a few scattered shrubs. &lt; . At 8 miles reached the summit of the ridge (4,645 ), and kept along a path with deep valleys on either side, following a contour for a short distance, and then a gradual descent, through a fairly wooded country, into the deep valley of another stream in front of us. . /o c&lt;w\ At 12 miles crossed a stream 40 feet wide and 18 inches deep (3,800 ) in a stony bed with scattered boulders 200 to 300 yards wide. This also runs down 165° round the base of the flat-topped hill mentioned above. Followed the river bank up stream, through some thick groves of oaks and sycamores, and at 14| miles climbed another steep shaly ridge (4,680'), dividing this from another stream valley (4,060 ). _ The whole stage was a constant ascent and descent of these ridges divid ing these small streams.. There were a few patches of good grass, but the greater part was withered. From here the eastern end of the Halakur Dagh bore 317°. It was found to be 5,175 feet above this or 9,240 feet above sea level. ^ We ascended a broad well worn track used by the “Kochers” in their, annual migrations along a narrow spur (5,150 ). Several groves of good oaks were dotted about the bare shale slopes. From the summit of the ridge is an easv descent, and at 18^ miles reach valley of stream (4,175 ) also flowing south. Close by is the junction of a small tributary, which we follow in the direction 110 °. 7 Buslasar .—At 20 miles halted in a small open patch (4,530 ) about 3 mile square, surrounded by trees, called Bustasar. A little green grass was to be found for the mules. # . Along the latter part of this stage the road is a well used track, and is the main communication between Shernakh and the high mountain ranges to the east of it. This does not prove that it is an easy road, as the nomads climb up and down any slope, however steep, so long as they eventually reach good pasture. Some of the gradients are steep, but zigzags to improve them could be cut in this soft shaly soil. No villages were seen today, and a small caravan of donkeys were the only people we saw. Weather cool and pleasant today. Temperature 70° at 5-15 p.m. and 43° at 5 a.m. Mornings cold. 6 th July—General direction E. Re-started up the valley, following the left bank of the stream. Several side valleys, most of them thickly wooded, strike out on either side, and the valley gradually narrows as we ascend; while at 3 miles it bifurcates, ajid our track follows the south-east branch. r Ihe hillsides are thickly wooded with oaks and juniper, and a few patches of long green grass commence to appear. Awralh Bagl .—After 4 miles reached the head of the spur (5,180') dividing the two branches of the valley. From here, bearing 350° and 11 miles 2 a VOL. I.distant, is the Awrakh Dagh, a prominent, isolated rocky peak, forming* tfce north-west end of the Dahazir Dagh. At the foot of it was the Kurdish village of Awrakh and the “ zozau ” of some nomads. Shosthek Dagh .—To the south, and 4 miles distant, is a high mountain range called the Shostheh Dagh with the summits thickly covered with snow. There are three rounded peaks, the upper slopes being covered with good grass; the lower a series of steep cliffs, terraced one above the other, and overhanging the valley of a stream which flows along the northern face to join the Hazil rivet. The smoke of a few camps of nomad Kurds could be distinguished along the upper slopes. Haws and Mer .—At the north-east of the Shostheh Dagh, at the bottom of a deep narrow valley, are the two Nestorian villages of Haws and Mer. Down this valley a stream flows between the east end of the Shostheh Dagh and the western slope of the Dahazir Dagh to join the upper waters of the Khabur river which (lows by Zakho. The Shostheh Dagh could be seen extending to the south-east in a succes sion of lofty snow covered peaks. At 7 miles we commenced winding along the ridge of a long wooded spur, on either side of which ran numerous deep narrow V-shaped ravines The great range of the Dahazir Dagh lay in front of us now, and all day it was one long ascent. Shortly afterwards we reached the “ tree limit,” and only a few pines Tree limit and a solitary pear, hawthorn, or willow remained on the hillsides. Excellent green grass commences now, and the soil is a rich black loam. r l he few pines here seen were the only trees of that kind we saw the whole journey. The road is an easy broad track with a steady ascent, and the first few patches of snow were reached about a mile from the summit of the range. We passed a fine spring by the roadside; the temperature of the air 61°and the water 43°. From the spring ascended through a gap about i mile wide in the rocky summit of the Dahazir Dagh. Maidan J as/m.sh. —x\t 14 miles ( 8 ,loo') passedover the ridge by an easy path, and descended into a wide grassy basin shut in by low undulations, and covered with patches of snow. This is called Maidan Jashush, and we halted here in some Kurdish tents (7,720'), the first we had met since leaving Shernakh. There were some 100 tents belonging to Muhammad Agha of Shernakh, the people being employed grazing his horses, flocks, and herds. A hundred and fifty mares and young horses and 200 mules and donkeys were grazing on this little plain, besides numerous herds of sheep and cattle. The camp is situated at the end of a plateau which runs up 92° for 4 miles, and in which are several deep snow drifts. A large stream from the melting snow flows down the centre, and about 4 mile to the north of the camp disappears bodily into the heart of the mountain without-leaving a trace of its departure in the rounded hillside, except the mouth of a sort of tunnel. This small plain is a perfect carpet of short sweet grass of a brilliant green colour, thickly studded with flowers of great variety and brilliancy—blue hyacinths, buttercups, star of Bethlehem, irises, daisies, polyanthus, forget- me-nots, and others. Bunches of thyme grow all over the hillsides. There are two hot sulphur springs near the camp. The men in camp were a strange mixture Kurds, Yezidis, and Nestorians all together, all being servants of Muhammad Agha of Shernakh. Religious discussion must be debarred in179 such a community. Round tho camp were numbers of the large white breeo of do«-s kept by the nomad Kurds. They are splendid watch dogs. The headman of the camp is Muhammad Agha’s younger brother. The country from Shernakh may be said to be entirely desolate, no one being met all the way, and no villages seen. It is well wooded, with several fertile valleys and streams, and the reason f or being deserted was that no one would settle in such a district to be attacked and looted by nomad Kurds in the migrations. There was a considerable change in the temperature at this ^elevation (7,720'). At noon it was 63°, and it froze at night (temperature 31 and 30 ), the ground in the morning being white with hoar frost. r lhe temperature was 107° at Jazirah at noon barely a week ago. Air was clear and bracing. Nights felt intensely cold to new arrivals from the plains. Children play about here in the snow in a state of perfect nudity and filth, so that only the fittest of them can possibly survive. Cowdung is principally used for fuel. Wood is brought on donkeys from the other side of the ridge. . , There has been a constant ascent from Bustasar (4,530 ) to the top of the * pass (8,155'), a total of 3,625 feet in one stage. The Dahazir Dagh is the chief outlying ridge of the mountains which ex tend eastward from here to Van and Baslikala. There is a rocky ridge along the summit from 9,000 to^ 10,000 feet eleva tion and nearly level. It runs for 10 miles north-west of Maidan Jashush, when it ends abruptly, and where a deep valley intervenes. The isolated craggy peak of Awrakh forms a sort of continuation of it in this direction, and is distant 19 miles. . . In the opposite direction the range runs east-south-east for 8 miles, getting gradually higher from the pass, and overlooks the Khabur valley to the south-east. _ ..... i i i i The summit was thickly covered with snow in this direction, and looked rugged and impassable. ' Shostheh l)«gh. —To the south-west, and running nearly east and west, is the Shostheh Dagh at an elevation of about 9,000 feet. The ridge is 11 miles long with three rounded peaks, all of which are still thickly covered with snow. The central peak was calculated 9,200 feet above sea level, The top of the Shernakh pass bears 253° from the Dahazir pass. The central peak of the Shostheh Dagh bears 2:23°, and the eastern end of the Halakur Dagh 295° from here. 6th July—General direction E. Deft Maidan Jashush,having been most hospitably treated by these Kurds. Six men were given as guides. The road at first was a broad track ascending the grassy valley in an easterly direction. . , At 2| miles we reached the summit of a grassy spur (elevation 8,250 ), .and then by a gradual descent followed the shaly slope of the hill into a deep basin stretched at our feet. To the north towards lake Van was an extensive view of mountain ranges with no particularly prominent peaks, all thickly patched with snow and interspersed with grassy stretches. Shattak and Meuk lay in this direction. Ruekaran Stream.*— miles reach bottom of descent (7,455 ), a narrow grassy valley, in which flowed a large stream called the Ruekaran. This stream comes from the snowy slope of the Dahazir Dagh to the south, and flows due north, being soon lost to sight in a narrow deep valley 2a 2180 bordered by stepp cliffs. It is a tributary of the Shattak Su which joins the Bhotan Su. (See description of Tigris and Tributaries.) The soil is now a kind of clay and disintegrated shale, and grows little good grass, except along the stream banks and by the snow. Some curious rocky peaks jut out here and there in the hillside ; otherwise the slopes are rounded. Tall thistles, “ gavvan,” a low prickly shrub, and karnoch, ” a kind of fennel, were almost the only plants seen. There is a small camp ground at ttuekaran, where the stream is forded. Naifckailau Dagh. —The road ascends from the valley, crossing some spurs of a high range thickly patched with snow called the Naifchailau Dagh. Wq made a detour to the north to avoid the main ridge of the range. A great number of small torrents were crossed rushing down from the melting snows to join the valley now to the west. Some snow drifts were passed 12 to 15 feet deep. These do not entirely molt as distinct layers, each corresponding to a year's snowfall can be traced through each drift. At 8^ miles 1 could see a high mountain peak some 30 miles off in the direction of Shattak bearing 317°. This is one of the peaks of the Lahijan I)agh between the Shattak Su and the Meuks Su. Some of the ascents and descents over these spurs were very steep, hut fairly easy going for the mules, as there were few stones. Shiv Shalail. —At 11 miles halted at a small camp ground called Shiv Shalail (8,075') alongside a large stream. The hillsides are now quite bare of trees, and cowdung and “ gavvan ” had to be collected for fuel. This stream runs down to join the Ituekaran through a narrow gorge below us to the left. It comes down 15° from a wide basin in the Naifchailau Dagh, surrounded by steep snowy slopes, the numerous small rivulets from which go to make up the main stream. Below this elevation, 8,075 feet, there seemed to be no snow. The marks of several camp grounds of last year were visible round here, and the soil becomes richer, containing more clay and loam and less shale as we go on. Temperature at noon 63°, with hoar frost in the early morning. 7th July —General direction N.E. Left camp, ascended a small valley, and continued rounding the north-east of the Naifchailau Dagh. The names of these mountains are those given by the Kurds, but probably the Christians in Tiari have quite different ones for these same ranges, which they see from the south. Cross two long spurs enclosing grassy valleys with streams flowing towards the Ituekaran, and at 5^ miles a wider basin running in the same direction. At the east side of this is a prominent pointed rocky peak called Kusr Pasha (tee sketch) rising about 600 feet above the level of the path (H^OO'). Several large springs emerge from the base of it. This basin trends up someb miles in a direction 120°. Passed several snow drifts entirely filling up some of the smaller ravines. The streams that run underneath hollow out a sort of tunnel dangerous for mules to cross over. These hills are never inhabited, as there is not sufficient grass for the flocks in summer. The slopes are generally rounded, but at intervals lone jagged- looking peaks project from the hillside. Momamis and Nismo Peaks .—At 9 miles we turned east, and passed over a col (9,050') forming a prolongation of the Naifchailau Dagh. To the Inorth-west is a rounded hill called Momamis rising to 11,000 , and to the south another prominent snow-covered peak called Nismo bearing 197 ,and 5f miles distant, rising to 12,000 feet. These are part of the main range of the Naif- chailau Dagh, the general level of the summit of which is from 12,000 to 13,000 feet. Boshik Pass. —Crossing another col (9,235*), the road dips into a grassy valley miles broad, and ascends a long easy gradient to another similar neck called the Boshik pass (9,300'). From the summit is a very extensive view, Halakur Dagh bears 220°, Aurakh Dagh 282°, and Nismc Peak 219°. Remains of camp grounds were passed, and the soil becomes much richer, growing a carpet •&lt;d rich grass dotted with flowers of countless varieties and the greatest bril liancy. From the top of the pass the road leads down a narrow grassy valley, fol lowing a small stream increasing in size as we descend. Numbers of small streams flow from the snow drifts, and join on either side. By the waters edge is rich green clover dotted with gentians, forget-me-nots, blue hyacinths, and many English flowers, while on the drier slopes grows in small tufts a long grass similar to the English rye grass which animal- eat greedily. On the hill slopes are “gavvan” and “karnoch” in large quantities. About half-way down the valley we met a camp of Hartoshi Kurds on the stream bank, the first since leaving Maidan Jashush. After 19 miles the valley opens into a grassy basin 2 miles wide, in a small loop of which was a camp of KK) tents of Hartoshi Kurds, and where vve halted (7,855'). These people all acknowledge the authority of Muhammad Agha, and for the winter go to the valley round Shernakh or the Jazirah plains. The road from Shernakh is a well worn track used by them. K/iabur district. —They are a very hospitable people, and supplies were brought at once. The district is called Khabur or Chabburr from a river of that name lower down the valley which flows 'north, and is a stream 30 yards broad and from 18 inches to 2 feet deep. This cannot be the head waters of the Khabur which flows past Zakho, or it must have been crossed at some point further west as well. It is probably a large branch of the upper waters of the Bohtan Su flowing past Sairdt. It is three days to Ashitha over the hills to the south-west, but few of these Kurds ever go in that direction or hold any communication with Tiari. Weather clear and bright, with a slight frost at night. Temperature 57° at 7-30 a.m. 8th July.—General direction S.E. The Kurds we had camped with had moved off m the early morning to a fresh pasture a little higher up the valley. They carried everything on small black oxen and donkeys with a few mules. Horses are used solely for riding. We descended into the valley (7,300'), crossed the Khabur, and turn east- ■south-east parallel to the river, winding up and down over some grassy spurs which come down on the right hank. The course of the river is very rapid, over boulders through a rocky ravine. At 11 miles reach another open basin (7,850') about 1 mile in diameter, bounded by low spurs from the ranges on either hand. It is an excellent site for a cao'p, and is the only piece of fairly level ground we had seen since leaving Maidan Jashush. We halted here in a large encampment of Hartoshi Kurds under a Vakil of Muhammad Agha. There are 400 tents here scattered about on either bank of a large stream which joins the Khabur here.182 r The soil is now a rich loam with excellent grass. The snow 1 rifts lay 500 feet higher up the hill from this (7,980'). Kizilbash Peak .—Situated 2^ miles distant, on a bearing 216°, is a high conical peak called Kizilbash (about 10,500'). For firewood “ gav van ” and the dry stalks of “ karnocb ” aroused, the latter growing extensively on the hillsides. There are three kinds of “ kar- noch^ resembling fennel or the wild carrot. It is used when green as fodder for horses, and eaten greedily by them. No cultivation is ever attempted by these nomads, and wheat and rice have to be brought from Shernakh and the Tigris valley. Gavvan is a low prickly plant, and the only shrub which grows extensively on these mountains. They dig up and eat several kinds of roots, and eat the soft inside part of thistle stalks. In the evening some 600 horses of all ages and sizes and 200 mules, besides droves of cows, sheep, &amp;e., were driven in from grazingon the hillsides. Bearing 91 u to 103° lies a rounded lofty range thickly covered with snow. A large branch of the Khabur runs up 58° from just below camp. A road leads from here over the hills to Julamerk, crossing a high snowy ridge bordering the Zab valley. We had to halt here on the 9th owing to my interpreter and a muleteer being seriously ill with fever and ague brought on by the sudden change of temperature from the plains to the frost and snow. The interpreter was delirious, and had to be supported on his horse by two Kurds. The people here were extremely hospitable and kind to the sick. 10th July.—General direction E. The men were slightly better, and we continued the road to Bashkala. The road led beside the Khabur for 11 miles, and then turned north east up a small grassy valley, following an easy track. Far a shin .—Extending 8 to 10 miles to the east, and forming the basin of the upper waters of the Khabur, is the Farashin district, bounded on all sides by a circular range of snowy mountains called the Akarak Dagh, over which a road to Julamerk leads. These mountains separate us from the valley of the Zib. A broad track leads up the bank of the river to Farashin. The hill slopes are covered with splendid grass, and it forms a favourite “ zozan ” or summer quarter of the Hartoshi. There are no villages in Farashin, but it is a fine pasture ground. Cbalm Pass. —At 8 miles we reached the summit of a rounded o- ra ssv range (9,465') called the Awlamar Dagh, which extends to the right to'a hill I, 0(H) feet above us, and which forms the northern end of the range which borders the Farashin valley. ® This is known as the Chalia pass, and a splendid panorama opens out from the summit. r - Naiicliailau Dagh beyond the Kizilbash peak extends from 210° to 250 . From 10o° to 107° is the highest range of the Akarak Dagh. The general eve of the summit is from 12,000 to 13,000 feet, and from 184* to 206 ?o is the fimit of the high jagged ridge of the Dahazir Dagh. In a direction 315° is a high rocky ridge some 20 miles off in the Shattak district, lo the north are a tumbled mass of high mountains with rounded grassy summits but with less snow on them than on the mountains here. n leve ^ tl ] e Awla mar Dagh may be taken at from 10,500 to II, 000 feet above sea level.From the top of the pass we descended giadually over a broad spur circling round the west end of the Awlamar. Dagb, going north-east, At 11 miles we reached a level grassy badn (8,500 ), from which a stream flows in a deep narrow valley to the right. We crossed two more similar basms with streams flowing in the same direction. _ . . At the bottom of the valley is the Nestorian village of Awlamar, and in it are the first houses we have seen since leaving Shernakh seven days ago. _ _ The hillside is a rich black loam with several patches of cultivation irri gated from the small streams. , i ji Ploughing was now in progress by the villagers from Awlamar, and bundles of the long grass and clover were being gathered for winter fodder. Short clover o-rew by the stream banks, affording splendid grazing for cattle and sheep. ^ The road continues over these grassy spurs, skirting a deep narrow valley fivm 2 to 3 miles to the north, in which runs a stream flowing towards t le upper waters of the Bohtan Su at Meuks. , . . 11 Merwanen.—A t 22 miles we reached Merwanen (8,09o ), the residence of a Kaimmakam, where we again came under regular Turkish authority, and left the independent country of the Hartoshi Kurds. Merwanen is a village with a population of about 600, situated on a small plateau at the head of a narrow valley running 280° bordered by a succession of cultivated terraces. The bill slopes are well cultivated, and there is no snow here now. The population is chiefly Nestorian with a few Kurds and some oO Armenians. A post of 20 Zaptiyahs is quartered here. The houses are flat-roofed, with walls of stoneand mud, one house contain ing several others like a rabbit warren. „ n T » , ■ , . i i • 1 1 i. “ Gavvan 33 and cowdung are used chiefly for f.uel. A little wood is brought over the hills from the Zab valley near Julamerk. ™ t tv . ■ ^ Nubduz.— To the north-east and east lies the Nurduz and Meuks District, containing several Nestorian and Armenian villages fairly prosperous and well •cultivated. . . , i • £ j • It is two days from here to Julamerk, the intervening stage being found in a Kurdish camp. A high range, the Arabi Dagh, has to be crossed en route. The road was said to be unsafe now because of raiding parties irom the 8he- kak Kurds from over the Persian border. , , TT , , , Our Hartoshi guides and Muhammad Agha s Vakil from Shernakh now left us They would not come any further, or come in the Julamerk direction, as they were afraid of being attacked on the return journey by tribes they were at feud with, or have to pay toll to the Kaimmakam. f hey would on no account go near the Kaimmakam of Julamerk. Van to Julamerk. The following is a precis of the account given by Layard of the journey from Van to Julamerk through Merwanen : 10th August. —Left Van, and struck across a fine undulating corn country abounding in Chris tian villnges. The soil is well cultivated by dint of much labour. . . Reached at sunset a deep bay hemmed in by orchards and gardens and sheltered by an amphi theatre of low rocky hills. Halted about a mile from Anukh near a transparent spring m a small rrlade shelving to the water’s edge. . . „ v ,. 11th August—Rode across the country in a direct line to the large Armenian convent of Yedi Klissia (seven churches), whose gardens on the side of the lofty mountain of Varak are visible from most parts of the plain. It is situated near the mouth of a wooded ravine, half way up a hold mountain which ends in snowy peaks. . . j i. j. ^ ^ 12th August-Left gates of the convent of Yedi Klissia in the afternoon, and started down a winding path in the hillside, and made a short journey of 3i hours to the village of Artamit or Adremit, and encamped beneath the fruit trees in a garden near the lake.IBt 13 th Angvut . Our path led today tlirougli a hilly district, sometimes edging a deep hay then again, winding over a rocky promontory, we crossed by a bridge a large stream which comes bv Alahmudiyah, and which here discharges itself into the lake. 3 We passed through Vastan, where was a boat just come from the convent on the island of Akhtamar. The convent and church are built on a small rocky island about 5 miles from the shore. A violent storm of wind came on and lashed the waters of the lake into high waves crowned with foam ; a mountain squall which sometimes sweeps down the deep valleys and expend their fury in a short hour. ^ 14th August. Left the lake of A an, and followed a track which led up a deep ravine, and which gradually became narrower as we came closer to the high mountains that separated us from the unexplored districts of Mukus and Bohtan. We passed the large Armenian vi'lage of Pagwantz near which, on the summit of a precipitous rock, stands the ruined castle of Khan Mahmud a rebel chief. ’ On both sides of the ravine were villages and ruined castles. Numerous streams from the hillsides irrigate plots of cultivated ground. Ere long we entered a rocky barren tract patched here and there with Alpine flowers. After climbing a declivity of loose stones, and dragging our horses with much difficulty after us, we found ourselves amidst eternal snows, over which we toiled for nearly two hours, until we reached the crest of the mountain, and looked down into the deep valley of Mukus. This is considered one of the highest passes in Kurdistan, and the most difficult for laden animals. The flocks of nomad Kurds of Bohtan were feeding in the ravines. The descent was even more rapid and precipitous than the ascent, and we could scarcely prevent our tired horses from rolling down into the ravine with the stones which we put in motion at every step. At the foot of the pass is a small Armenian church called Khorous Klissia. There was no other path down the rocky ravine than the dry bed of the torrent. As we approached the valley, the springs began to collect together and form a considerable stream, through which we had to wade as best we could. A track, occasionally followed by a solitary foot traveller or nomads going to the hills, has been carried here and there over the foaming torrent by trunks of trees. Most of these had been washed away by a recent storm. We passed a deep natural cavern, from which issued a most abundant spring, one of the principal sources of the eastern branch of the Tigris, here called the Mukus river. A ride of eight hours brought us to the large scattered village of Mukus, the principal place of the district of the same name. r The branch of the Tigris is here a deep stream crossed by a stone bridge. The houses are built without order on the slopes of the mountain, each family choosing some open place more free from stones than the usual.locky declivities, there is no room for them in rocky valley. The place may contain altogether about 2,000 inhabitants. Of the 60 villages of the district, 40 are inhabited by Christian Armenians. Mukus was anciently celebrated for its mines. None a.re now worked, and even the site of the greater part, of thorn is unknown. The Armenians of Mukus weave some striped woollen stuffs worn by the Kurds, and export a little honey and wax, but have no other trade. The border dis tricts are Karkar (containing about 18 villages), Khiawash, Isparut, Bidar, and Shattak. The principal villages in the Alukus’district are Aughin, Nouravos, Kasr, Achichos, Kerkichos, Anrenj, Kotzabiher, Auveriss, Parangos, Mangoneh, Komos, Ketchoks, Amaghus. Maiakos, and Berwar., From Mukus to Jazirah it is five days’caravan journey, and to Sairdt three days by difficult mountain roads. loth August.—Ijcit Mukus early in the afternoon. The path, following the course of the river, leads to Sairdt, Jazirah, and the Assyrian plains. We soon turned from it, and entered a valley running eastwards. (in the mountain sides were many villages buried, like those of Tiari, in olchards and groves of walnuts. We forced our way through thickets and matted climbing plants hanging from the branches of the trees, the track being continually lost in rivulets or in watercourses for irrigation. The valley soon narrowed into a wild gorge, which ended at length in the gardens of Aurenj, where we halted. 16th August A*ext day we crossed a high mountain ridge covered in some places with snow, separating the district of Mukus from that of Shattak. Its northern and western slopes are the summer pastures of the Miran Kurds, and on the opposite side of the pass were camps of Hartoshi Kurds. We descended by a precipitous pathway in a deep valley, through which wound a broad stream, another arm of the Eastern Tigris. Halted in the gardens of Shattak. . Shattak is a small town rather than a village, and is chiefly inhabited by Armenians, an indus trious and hardy race, cultivating the sides of the mountains on which are built their villages, and weaving in considerable quantities the gay coloured woollen stuffs so much esteemed by the Kurds. J The mountains produce galls, wool (of the same texture as that of •wool of the goat called tiftik, and minerals. Angora), the small under-The town itself is called by the Armenians Tank and hy the Kurds Shokh, and when spoken of together with the numerous villages that surround it, Shattak. It stands near the junction of two considerable streams, forming one of the head waters ot the Tigris, and uniting with the Bhotan Su. The entire district contains 50 villages and numerous nuzras nv hamlets. 17/k AiigtisL—Left Shokh by a bridge, crossing the principal stream. After a long and difficult ascent we came to a broad green plateau called Tagu,the pastures ot the neople of Shattak, and now covered with their tents and flocks. This high ground overlooked the deep valleys, through which wound two streams, and on whose sides Were many smiling gardens and villages. , . . We stopped at an encampment of Miran Kurds, a large and wealthy tribe, pasturing their flocks far and wide over the mountains and ravines of Shattak and Nurduz. Crossing a high mountain pass on which snow still lingered, we descended into a deep valley like that of Shattak, chiefly cultivated by Armenians. We crossed a small stream, and ascended on the opposite side to Ashkaun, in the district of Nurduz. ^ 18th August.—O wy ride today was over upland pastures of great richness, and through narrow valleys watered by numerous streams. Here and there were villages inhabited by Kurds and Armenians. We were now approaching the Nestorian districts, and Chilgiri was the first village met with. \\ e passed tlnough this, and stopped in Merwanen, which we found deserted by its inhabitants for the Zooms or summer pastures. . 19th August .—A party of armed Nestorians escorted us today to a large encampment or Hartushi Kurds, near the outlet of a green valley watered by many streams, forming the most easterly sources of the Tigris. The mountain rising above us was the boundary between the Pashalics ot Van and MakKiari and the watershed of the Tigris and Zab rivers. . On the opposite side the streams, uniting their waters, flowed towards the latter river. ^ ine first district we entered was that of Lewin, inhabited chiefly by Nestorians. The whole population with their flocks had deserted the villages for the Zomas. . W r e ascended to the encampment of the people of Bill! (elevation 8,612 above sea level), a wretched assemblage of dirty hovels, behind which towered, amidst the eternal snows, a bold and majestic peak called Karnessa-ou-Daoleh. 20th August .—Bound the base of this mountain we dragged our weary horses along over loose stones, sharp rocks, and through ravines deep in snow. After a wearisome and indeed dangerous ride, we found ourselves on a snowy platform vane- o-ated with alpine plants. From a prominent peak Ararat was visible, distant 145 miles, and bearing north 15^° east. To the east were mountains scarcely less imposing than Ararat, but more rocky and more naked, , , . We were drawing near the lofty peaks of Jelu, beneath whose eastern precipice is the Oavvar plain. The Zab valley divided us from them. We could look from the top of the pass into the deep and narrow valley through which this river flowed. „ _ 1 We descended rapidly by a difficult track, passing here and there encampments of Kurds and the tents and flocks of the people of Julamerk, until the region of cultivated fields succeeded the green pastures, and we seemed to approach more settled habitations. _ Following a precipitous pathway, we soon reached Kochannis, the residence of Mar Shimun, three hours’ distant from Julamerk. The following is another account of the country between Van anti Julamerk extracted from M. Binders travels in Kurdistan, &amp;c.,in September 1886: 26fh Septemler.—Left Van at noon, and for I hour followed the road by which we had arrived from Bashkala, and quitted it near a small Armenian village, taking another road branching more to the right. The path led along a barren valley bordered by low undulations, on which not a single blade-ot grass could be seen. The weather became menacing, and a heavy bail and rain storm broke very suddenly on us as we ascended one steep slope. _ . Arrived at the summit of the ridge. We descended by a very slippery path in the clay slope into the valley of Haiguetzor, dotted over with several Armenian villages. There are some ruins here which tradition ascribes to Haik, the founder of the Armenian race. The road across the plain was vety muddy after the storm, the horses sinking 1 to their girths in the deep mud. We halted at sunset (about seven hours) in the little village of Eremeru, which contained the ruins of a small church. 27th September .—The night was very cold, and on waking the ground was covered with hoar frost. We left the village at 6 a.m.,. crossing a wide plain with very fertile soil, shut in to the south east, in the direction in which we are going, by a high ridge with a very abrupt slope. The path over this ridge was known to the villagers as “ The road of the forty windings.” At the summit the barometer read 1,970 feet above the plain we had just left, while the horizontal distance was barely 1,100 yards. •2 B VOL. I.]86 The crest was barely 10 yards wide, and we commenced an equally steep descent on the south side. These very steep ascents and descents fatigue the baggage animals very much owing to the constant shifting of the loads. From the crest of this ridge we saw lake Van for the last time, with the snowy peak of the Sipan Dagh rising to the north-west beyond it. The Varak Dagh and many of the crests close by preserved traces of yesterday’s storm in the snow on their summits. We descended, leading our horses down the narrow path, and passed the small village of Bijin- gat, near which is the source of the Semiram Chai, a stream which falls into lake Van. Some time after we passed a very old monastery called Okotswauk (Ketreat of men), in which we were told some ancient manuscripts were preserved. At 11 A.M. we halte'd on the bank of a small stream. Some way to the west was a ruined castle at the foot of which was a small village, and to the east were some nomad tents. At 2 o’clock we started again along an easy road over undulating plains covered with dry grass. At 4-30 we passed a small group of buildings, where the muleteers wished to halt, but we decided on pushing on to Merwanen, which we thought was only two hours further, but which in reality, was much further. There was no path, and we ended by losing our way. Night came on rapidly, and neither moon nor stars were visible. We followed no particular line down a sloping hillside nearly perpendicular in some places. A mule fell down a cliff, and an hour was expended in pulling him up, and putting the load to rights again. Struggling on in the dark we lighted on a Kurd camp, the inhabitants of which were most inhospitable, and threatened to rob our baggage. Finally a guide was procured, who led us to a small Armenian village, where we halted after midnight after having been 14 hours on horseback. 27th September .— We arrived today at Merwanen in safety. 28th September .—Left the village, and passed some fields of wheat still green, and reached Dime, a small Armenian village prettily situated on the slope overlooking a large valley at its junction with another. This stage was a short one, as there were no villages further on, and the sta^e to morrow was a long one with a high range of hills to climb. One portion of the inhabitants of the village lived in tents, and another in the houses. Two large walnut trees grew on the slope close by. A party of Kurds attacked us on a hill close by, whither we had gone to take photographs; they broke all our instruments and apparatus, stripped us of our clothing, and left us to find our way back enticrement nus, 29th September.—The nights were very cold at this elevation (7,800 / ), and the air extremely rarefied. We left the village at daybreak, and at sunrise had reached the opposite slope of an immense basin at the same elevation as when we left the village. We kept ascending from this point, and had a considerable range in front of us still to get up. • Fine rain began to fall, with a high wind, which rendered us numb with cold. The higher we got, the worse the weather became, and snow and sleet became mingled with the rain, so that it was almost impossible to see. The ground became very slippery, and we traversed a narrow ridge having a deep valley on either side. At noon we halted, when the weather got clearer and warmer, and we ascended the last rid»e. Finally from the summit a splendid view broke on us, a vast chaos of mountain peaks, rocks, and precipices. We were more than 10,000 feet above sea level, and at a similar elevation Mont Blanc is covered with snow. We descended sharply among boulders and broken stones, among which grew quanti ties of enormous thistles. We were shown some zinc mines that had been exploited superficially by the Kurds, and the soil seemed rich in minerals, but the difficulty was how to transport material from such an inacces sible spot. Kochannis .—To our left, at the bottom of a deep narrow valley, could be seen Kochannis the residence of Mar Shimun, the Patriarch of the Nestorians. The hamlet was surrounded by a green patch of trees, and, situated at the bottom of an abrupt gorge, overlooked on the east by a rocky hill rising nearly 3,000 feet perpendicularly, and on the other sides by extremely steep slope. We descend by a very stony track, passing several cemeteries. Julamerk ,—At the foot of the hill was a very steep slope, below which we could see Julamerk surrounded by some scattered groves of trees. The place is situated at the bottom of an immense basin, bordered on the south-east by a high perpendicular cliff, and on the other sides by slopes somewhat less steep. . Water comes down the hillside in four small torrents, which unite into two branches which join into one torrent at the south corner of the valley, where it passes through a narrow rift in the cliffs to flow into the Great Zab. At the south corner of the valley is the town properly so called, situated on a steep rock 300 yards long and from 80 to 100 yards broad. The Armenian and Nestorian quarter is separate from the rest, and is built on a small mound in the centre of the valley. The town itself is half in ruins, and does not contain more than 100 houses. There are the ruins of a fort on the rock in former times, the stronghold of Nurullah Beg.In the mountain districts in the villages the houses are run one into the other under one flat roof, so that the village looks like Description of moun- one house, although in reality it contains several. This tain village. ^ etter protection against the winter cold. In the winter cows, sheep, and animals are crowded in, and give an addi tional warmth, and keep the temperature above freezing point. Entering by the low door, immediately to the left, is a large room with a low roof of thick rafters supported by uprights at intervals. Over the rafters were fascines and two feet of clay. There was one small hole for ventilation. This room was intended for cows and sheep. A little further along the passage, barely 6 feet wide and roofed over, was a door opening into the living room of one family. It was about feet square, and lighted only by a hole 2 feet square in the roof; and t e roof was slightly raised in the centre and supported by wooden uprights. In the floor was the oven, and the heat and smoke inside at this time of year was stifling. _ In one corner was a large brick vat for holding water in the winter to pre vent its being frozen. _ , The walls of the house were built of slaty shale and turf sods, rurther along the passage were other doors leading into the houses of othei families. The villages are usually situated iu sheltered positions at the bottom of t ie ^ 00 p vallevs. The Kurd nomad tribes in the mountains usually quarter themselves in the Nestovian villages for the winter. 11 th July General direction E.N.E. Left Merwanen (8,095') following a broad well-defined track over undulating clay hills. Several fields of millet and sesame were passed and quantities of good hay still uncut. Stian.—A.t miles passed Stian, a small Nestorian village, at the head of a grassy valley similarly situated to Merwanen. At miles crossed a small spur ( 8,000 ), and descended a wide grassy valley, following a small stream. Tall white and red clover, ryegrass, two small kinds of vetch, and numerous English flowers and grasses grew in great abundance. There were numerous springs in the hillside, and district looks as if it would support a very much larger population. Only a few cattle and sheep Sekunis .—At miles we reached the bottom of the valley (6,925 ), and crossed a large stream in two branches, each 40 yards broad and 2 feet deep. On the other bank is the Nestorian village of Sekunis. This stream is one of the many forming the upper waters of the Bohtan Su. A few stunted poplars and willows grow along the banks. These are the first trees seen since leaving Maidan Jashush. A large herd of cows and a few water buffaloes were grazing by the stream bank. Several tracks lead up and down the valley, and the hills look easy and rounded to the right and left. Our track is a broad clay path ascending a wide spur, dividing this from another stream»valley also running west.^ The general direction of the main valley from Sekunis is 295 . The Lahijan Dagh is clearly visible now to the west. It overlooks the valley of the Bhotan Su from the south. At 91 miles we reached the top of the spur (7,970 ), and descended a long narrow valley by the bank of a small stream. The hill slopes are, as a rule, rounded, with isolated volcanic-looking peaks of rock jutting out here and there. 2 b 2188 At 1H miles we came to the foot of the descent (7,130'), and crossed a stream in a narrow valley flowing- west. There was a small g-rove of poplars and two mills by the stream. A snow peak of the Arabi Dag-h bore 145° from here. This is in the range which forms the watershed of the Zab and the Bohtan Su. The ascent was steep for the first half mile out of the valley, and then wound round the base of a spur from a high range to the north-east called the Nish- khava Dagh. Shahmannns .—At 13| miles a wide valley lies to the left in which is Shah- mannus, a large Nestorian village. The remains of an stone fort in ruins stand on a knoll close by. This is all the Nurduz district. Level terraces, well irrigated and cultivated, extend 3 to 4 miles on either side of the village. Our road keeps along an upper contour of the hill, while another easier path leads round a lower level direct to Shahmannus. K/inrkhurrut .— At 17 miles we crossed a small spur, and turned aside from the road into a camp of 50 tents of Hartoshi Kurds called Khurkhurrut (8,275'). ■ The Shaikh claimed relationship with Muhammad Agha of Shernakh, whose influence extends over all these tribes up to the neighbourhood of Bashkala. In winter these Hartoshi do not go to the plains, but crowd into Shah mannus and the neighbouring Christian villages. They have to pay a yearly tax of 1 para per sheep to the Kaimmakam at Merwanen. There are very few Kurdish villages in this district. The Nestorians cultivate the district round Shahmannus with o-reat care. Millet, rice, hemp, and sesame are chielly grown. They show great ingenuity in winding irrigation channels round rocky spurs on the hillside, and'’utilize the water to its fullest extent. This small stream joins the larger one which passes Shahmannus. Short grass of an extraordinarily brilliant green grew by the stream banks, while a longer variety, which animals eat greedily, grew in large tufts on the hillsides. Several mules and horses belong to these Kurds. A large number of transport animals cogid be collected from these nomads in case of necessity The soil is a shaly clay with portions of igneous trachyte projecting here and there. The rock formations were very varied, blue limestone and cono-lo- merate being also noticed. &amp; Two crops of wheat and millet are gathered in these elevated districts. Ploughing is done very deep, the plough having a wooden board, shaped like in England, resting on two wooden wheels in front, and is usually drawn by a team of six bullocks. It turns up about 1 foot of earth. It is a very clumsy looking arrangement. J 12th July—General direction E. Left Khurkhurrut camp (8 275') g ong north for the first two miles, and then east along a broad easy track rounding the base of a steep peak of the Nishkhava Dagh to the right This splendid grass country would graze any number of cattle, but is quite deserted. ^ Akhola. At 4| miles descend into a plateau, about 2 miles wide, of rich soil called Akhola. At 6 miles crossed a stream (8,400') which flows in a most peculiar winding course from a broad grassy valley bordered by low spurs of the Vishkava Dagh bearing 165 from here. At 62 miles pass Akhola, a village of Shida Kurds, deserted in summer and on y inhajiteu in winter. Water-supply very abundant from small springsar' 1 streams. Ascend gradual!)' a broad grassy slope, and at 9^ miles dip slightly into a narrow V-shaped valley with a stream flowing west. The road ascends steeply out to the head of this (10,235'), and at 1 4 miles reach the summit of a called the Geshkalin Pass (11,050'). There is small grave yard at the summit. Geshkalin Pass. —On either side steep rounded hills rise about 2,000 feet. This is the Barajul Dagh, and constitutes the watershed between the Bhotan Su and the Zab, towards which we descend. The general level of the Barajul Dagh is from 1^,000 to 13,500 feet. The summits of the hills are sometimes rocky peaks, but the sides are o-rassy, with numerous small springs. All round the horizon from 90° to 300° is a continuous chain of high snowclad mountains. Although this is a considerably higher level than the Boshik pass, there are few snow drifts, and the edge of the plateau near Maidan Jashush seemed to have the coldest climate. Commence descent from the head of the pass, follow ing a valley bordered with shelving grassy slopes. Several springs were passed, which quickly joined and formed a large stream. The soil is a rich black loam, and the remains of several former camp grounds were passed. Saris khan Valley .—The descent is easy at first, but the valley gets nar rower, and soon becomes V-shaped with steep stony sides. Two long spurs, with a line of rounded steep summits, run parallel to the valley on either side. The grass gets poorer as we descend ; quantities of karnoch and gavvan were seen, and the slopes get steeper and barer, and are now of a loose shale. This is called the Sariskan valley. At 18| miles the valley sinks to the right, and we follow a 2-feetdledge (9,61 O') along to hillside, gradually trending to the left. A few camps of Hartoshi Kurd with their flocks were noticed on the hillsides. A good view is obtainable from here of the country towards the Zab (Route XII). The Sariskan stream flows in a direction 125° in a narrow valley bordered by grassy terraces using one above the other. On reaching the plain it cuts its way to the Zab in a narrow ravine 50 feet to 80 feet deep bordered by low cliffs. At 20| miles we turn sharp to the left along a contour of the hill and reach a col (9,325') dividing the Sariskan from another similar valley to the north-east. Keurik .—From the col the road descends diagonally the right side of the valley, passing the village of Keurik deep down to the left on a little grassy terrace. At 22 miles the path led down a very steep slope into the bottom of the vallev (8,245'), and then followed the bank of a small torrent. Every loop of the stream is cultivated with patches of wheat and barley, and the irrigation cuts are sometimes led for 3 or 4 miles along the contours of the hills. At 25 miles the level of the Bashkala plain is reached (7,700'). This plain is a broad terrace of rich gravelly soil, irrigated by various small stream from the Barakul Dagh, and extending south-east to the Zab and north-east to Bashkala; the streams flow across it in deep ravines eaten out of the soft soil. Bashkala could be seen now bearing 25° from here, and we joined a broad gravelly track which leads across the plain towards it. This is one of the two roads from Bashkala to Julamerk across the hills. The other road follows the Zab valley more to the south-east. Several mule caravans were met on their way to Julamerk. Every one in the caravan was190 armed with a long gun, spear, dagger or some weapon, as the country between this and Julamerk was in a very disturbed state. At 30 miles Bashkala (7,915') was reached, the foot of the hills being skirted all the way. Several rocky valleys similar to the Sariskan valley open into the plain, down which streams run. Weather today cloudy with a few showers.BASHKALA. This place occupies a most important strategic position at the head of one of the principal lines of communication from Mosul through Hakkiari into the Armenian plateau round Van. This is implied in the name which signifies v fort at the head of the pass. * To the north and east of it extends an undulating open country with few natural obstacles up to the Russian frontier. To the south-west leads the main road through Julamerk and Amadiyeh to Mosul. x . . To the south-east is an easy road through Diza to Urmia. To north-west run also an easy track over the hills to Van. ^ To the eastward is a good road to Ixhoi and Salmas and labuz over the Persian frontier. . , , , Bashkala is a town of 2,000 houses or 10,000 inhabitants, most of which are Kurds. There are 800 houses of Armenians and 200 of Jews, and some 50 Per sians lately settled here. The town has increased greatly of late years, induce ment having been given by tlie Turks for Jews to settle, fifty Jews had arrived cpiite lately, driven over the Russian frontier. Some 40 years ago there were no Jews, but a quarter was then assigned them, and they have since increased in numbers. Several new houses were being built. The place is situated on the side of a gravelly spur from the range behind, and on a steep spur higher up the hillside is a castle in ruins, once an important Kurdish stronghold. The principal streets are wide and fairly clean. The houses are of sundried bricks, and are built each with a small courtyard. There is no regular bazar, but numerous small shops are scattered about the town. Good carpenter’s and smith’s work is done here, and English cloth and goods are to be found in some quantity in the shops, brought from Tribizond through Erzrum and Van. The water supply is good all the year round, and is from two small streams from the hill behind, led in channels through the streets. The Hakkiari Waliat, of which this place was the capital until two years ao-o, has now been dissolved. A Mutaserif lives heie now, appointed under the Wall of Van ; and the whole of Hakkiari is part of the Van Waliat. A Mir Alai (General) and about 1,000 regular soldiers, made up of three battalions, and forming part of the Vlth Army Corps, are quartered here. They marched out one day for drill, and practised the attack formation on the hillside near my tent. They were well in hand, and carried out the move ments with a good deal of method and precision. They were armed with the Martini Peabody rifle, and wore new blue uniforms. They have a very miscellaneous sort of equipment. _ . . . The barracks are two rows of low buildings of sundried bricks, two stories There is a Persian Consul appointed here for the first time some eigh.&lt; months ago. He is a Shahzada, and speaks French fluently like* most of the higher Persian officials. . . The newer houses are surrounded by rows of poplars; otherwise no trees can be seen anywhere on the plain, and the landscape is very bleak There are no fruit gardens, and besides cabbages few vegetables can be got to grow. Most of the fruit, grapes, &amp;c., are brought from the Sulduz plain over the Persian frontier.191 The range behind the town runs in a general direction 25°, and the road to Van can be seen skirting along the base of it for some distance. Immediately below, stretching to the Zab valley, is the Bashkala plain now covered with good grass, and on which several herds of cattle and sheep were grazing. It is irrigated by numerous small streams diverted, from the hills. The soil is a rich gravelly clay, and the chief crops are millet, barley, wheat, and sesame. Wheat is now ripening. Lying east from here beyond flie Zab rises the Mur Dagh, a range running along the Persian frontier, consisting of a line of low rounded summits, and with its sides scored by some deep impracticable looking ravines. do the south-east rise a mass of very high mountains belonging to the dis tricts of Baz, Jelu, and Liz. Two prominent peaks in these mountains were the Jura Daouil and Tura Bermarghi, which rise to a height of 17,2X0 feet and 15,800 feet respectively. The greater part of the range is covered with per petual snow. This range was seen closer from the Gavvar plain. Little wood is used in Bashkala tor firewood, covvdung and ft gavvan” being chiefly employed. The latter is collected on the neighbouring Mils, and brought in by strings of donkeys. Some very fine mules were noticed passing here in the various caravans, and this would be a favourable point for collecting transport for an army, ihe chief caravan traffic is with Persia. Some Armenians here complained that a few years ago they endeavoured to emigrate to America, but were hindered from doing so at Constantinople. Ihere is one Protestant Christian family here. In the Bashkala plain and at several points along the route were groups of enormous blocks of stone, 6 feet to 8 feet square, piled one on the other as n they were the remains of the walls of buildings. Ihe climate in winter is very severe. Snow commences to fall about the middle of October, and remains on the ground until Chmate. April. Last year the end of August saw the nearer hills still covered. The town is ? feet above the sea, and the general level of the plain is 7,700 feet. Beyond suffering from the severity of the winter climate, the place is very healthy. The noon temperature now was 72°, and the climate rather like an English June. The nights were cold, the temperature being 00° at 9 P.M. Routes from Bashkala. From Bashkala to Van is two days across the hills (50 miles). There is a telegraph office in Bashkala, and the clerk, an Armenian, is able to telegraph in European characters. Lines run to Tabriz through Salmas and Dilman and to Julamerk and Diza, also to Van by the post road. To old Salmas the stages are given by Colonel Bell thus : (1) Khana-i-Snr ...

Binder in 1886 . 20th September. — Left Baslikala at 8-0 a.m. ti The telegraph followed the line of road which skirted along the foot of the chain of hills which bounded the plain to the west . . . We followed for a short distance a new military road begun by an Austrian Engineer named M. Alexandre, who was then staying in Bashkala. „ ,, , „ ^ . ... . Three hours from Bashkala we passed the small hamlet of Choukh, and from this point turned north-west up a hare rocky hillside, the road being stony in some places. We passed some patches of green grass by the bank of the small streams which flowed clown the hillside, and reached the summit of the ascent at an elevation which the barometer gave as 10,500 feet. ’ n i ■ A fine panorama opened out from here, and we seemed to command an ocean of mountains like the waves of some gigantic sea which had suddenly become petrified. There was a regular chaos of crests, peaks, and precipices, all of them quite bare of trees, some a brick red colour ; others blue, green, grey or violet. The descent was fairly easy, passing to our left a small village called Silh. We followed a ravine, in which flowed a stream which commenced in very small proportions at the head of the pass, but gradually increased into a torrent as we descended. It receives from the south a large tributary, and the valley commences to close At a sudden turning of the road it again opens out, and across the defile was an isolated rock on which was situated the fort of Mahmudiah, occupying a very strong position. At the base of the rock, separated from it by a stream, is a small village called Ivhosh Ah. dhe houses are for the most part in ruins, and do not contain more than 100 inhabitants. There is a small Turkish post and a few soldiers here. _ The outwork of the castle consists of a wall forming an enciente about 500 yards square. The principal castle is situated on a rock with scarped sides from 200 to 300 feet high. It occupies the south-east corner of the enciente, and commands the defile through which the Bashkala road emerges. At the east face was a prominent round tower forming the corner of the castle. The enciente wall continues flanked at intervals by small round towers, but, instead of completely surrounding the rock, ascends to a neighbouring mound, and includes another small fort on it. Inside the wall, in the space between this mound and the principal rock, are the ruins of some houses used by refugees in time of siege. The main entrance gate once stood on the .west face, but an enormous breach now replaces it. We ascended the rock by a roundabout path up some stairs cut in the rock, and reached the inner gate of the castle, the only entrance into the keep. The gate is only 3 feet high, and studded with enormous nails. The lintel and side pieces are enormous blocks of cut stone, while over head are some curious inscriptions. It is situated at the foot of a large masonry round tower some 30 feet in diameter, perched on a lutting portion of the same rock that forms the foundation of the castle. The doorway being choked inside with fallen debris, we climbed up a large breach into the interior. Nothing but the outer walls of the castle still remain, all the interior rooms having been destroyed. The summit of the rock commands a splendid view. 21st September. —Left Khosh Ah at 10 A.M., and started across some bare desolate country through a series of low undulations. Hares, gazelle, and partridge were plentiful. Panthers were also said to exist. The valley grew wider as we descended, and the stream which we followed increased in size, and received several large affluents on either bank. It is now lo to 20 feet broad, and flovs in several shallow channels. The banks are bordered by furze and other shrubs, and the grass near the water grows thick ^Ittfknown as the Tersan or Khosh Ah Chai, and flows eventually into lake Van. The stream valley makes a sharp turn between two hills with steep rocky sides which overhang tl10 Tliei-e is a small ruined bridge here, and we forded the stream in preference to trying it. The stream extends to lake Van, getting wider towards the shores of the lake. The soil is fertile, and would yield good crops if cultivated. , tt- , . In the distance we could see the two small hamlets of Zernak and Hindustan, each containing not more than 100 inhabitants. . . The sky suddenly clouded over, and a very violent storm of wind and ram came upon ns almost before we were aware of it. The rain fell in torrents for about half an hour, when all become clear again, the clouds disappearing as rapidly as they came. Wo passed through the little village of Norkieg, and ascended the last ridge that separated us from lake Van. The clay soil of the ascent became.very slippery after the shower ascending the Sl ° P We reached the summit of the col at a sudden turning of the road, and the plain of Van broke into view, 2 c VOL. I.194 lu the centre was the rock citadel overlooking the town ensconced in a wide stretch of gardens- to the north-west, beyond the lake, the lofty peak of the Sipan Dagh. ' To the eastward was the Varak Dagh, and to the west was the blue sheet of the lake reaching almost to the houses of the town. 6 At tuo o’clock we entered the outer gardens of Van, and on entering the town we staved at the Mission House of the Dominican fathers.

Left Bashkala, and followed a broad gravelly track south-west across the plain. The road follows the telegraph line of two wires—one for the line to ihza, and the other for Julamerk; these separate at Karmi in the Zab valley, when the Diza line strikes direct across the hills. At 6 miles we crossed a ravine 3 to 400 yards broad and sunk 50 to 80 feet below the plain level, in which flows a large stream from the Barajul Dagh. Reached at 0 miles a flat cultivated terrace (OjOOO') alongside the valley of the Zab. The river valley itself is about one mile broad, running up 27° fiom here; the river winds from side to side of it, and some rich grass grows by the banks. The country generally is absolutely treeless. The actual river valley is bordered by low earth cliffs, which merge into the Bashkala plain on one side and the Mur Dagh on the other. Ploughing is done in deep furrows, as in England, by a large wooden p ough drawn by 6 or 8 oxen. Several loads of firewood, wattles, and pop Li i trunks were met on iheir way into Bashkala. The larger poplar logs aie diawn by a pair of oxen—one end of the trunk tied on the yoke, and the o rer trailing along the ground. The firewood has to come two days* iourney from the Zab valley near Karmi. it ^^ l ^ ava ' ^ Hf miles we crossed another ravine near the village of Kattibava, on a large stream from the hills flowing towards the Zab. i • \ e 18 ^ ]ere known as the Albaki Su, because it rises in the Albak district some 40 miles to the north of this. 4 .u | )a . n k a plain gradually rising to the higher ridge of the Mur Dagh behind. Hanjoulis, Kelago, Autess, and Argi are small Nes- tonan villages on the lower slopes of this range. i ne road gradually descends into the river valley, passing some sulphur ous springs, from which the pure mineral is collected by the Kurds for making powder, It is found deposited on the stones beside the springs.At 16| miles the road bifurcates ; a broad track and the telegraph line runs south-west over a spur towards Julamerk. Immediately to the north-west rises a high mountain ridge with a rounded o-rassy summit, dotted over with tents of Hartoshi Kurds. At the foot of the ridge on this side is the village of Umerava. Our road still follows the river bank, and at 19| miles turns across the valley. We forded the Zab, 50 yards wide and 2 feet deep, with a rapid current (6,180'). On the left bank was a swampy water meadow left by an old channel of the river through which the road led. In this grew some splendid grass, tall white and red clover, and various English grasses. From the valley we ascended a series of wide grassy terraces. At 20| miles passed the small village of Bawis, and at 23 miles halted in Sarderan (6,820'). Sarderan .—This is a small Kurdish village on a grassy terrace. There are two good houses of sundried brick belonging to the headman ; the rest have walls of stone and mud with flat roofs covered with earth. There were a few tobacco and vegetable gardens close by, but no trees. Water was from a well 6 feet deep. In the valleys no streams are formed, but the water seemed to percolate through a sort of spongy swamp ; consequently was easily obtained by dig- ging. From a knoll close by Tura Daouil peak bore 198° and Tura Bemarghi 2°5 0 . „ . We had a night alarm here. At midnight horsemen came galloping up from Bawis, saying the Shekak Kurds had attacked their village and had driven off all their sheep and cattle, and an attack was probably to be made on Sarderan. The villagers turned out and proceeded to drive their cattle and sheep with a rush towards the village to get them in the houses if possible. A party of six Nestorian priests who had accompanied us from Bashkala were discharging some antiquated flintlocks into the darkness to the common danger, and added more confusion to the scene. Matters having quieted a little, I ascertained that no lives were lost, but some 400 sheep were captured from Bawis, and the raiders had cleared off. It was impossible to pursue them, as they had about an hour s start on a dark night over the hills. Such raids are common in the frontier districts. 15th July,—General direction S.S.E. Left Sarderan at 6 a.m., and started south along a broad track, over some low rounded spurs from the frontier range to the east. A narrow stony ravine with an easy gradient led to the valley°of the Mashiro stream (6,120') running north-west into the Zab, which we reached Sj miles. The actual bed of the stream is narrow, but grows wider to the east, and is bordered by grassy terraces rising one above the other. Several villages, each surrounded by a clump of poplars, were dotted about on these. Just here is said to be a favourite place_for thieves to waylay and attack caravans, and inhabitants have a lawless reputation. We ascended steeply from the stream bed, and crossed some high rounded spurs (7,775') which lay in front of us. A few trees, chiefly hawthorn and wild pear, and some stray shrubs giew in the ravines. The hawthorn and the wild rose were now in bloom. Two crops of wheat are obtainable in a year in these elevated districts. The second crop was now 4 inches to 6 inches high, and will be fit to cut 2 c 2196 in about three months' time. The first crops have just been harvested. Also several patches of a tall purple-flowered vetch used either as green fodder or dried for winter use. At miles pass Takurava, at 9§ Disbera, and at 11 miles Maniss, all small Kurdish villages surrounded by a few trees and orchards. The hillsides abound in small streams and springs, and the water-supply is very abundant. The long grass by the streams and “ karnoch ” on the fall- sides were being cut as hay and stored for the winter. After passing Maniss (7,250'), the road turns south-west down a long descent towards the valley of the Mihaila Gavvari river, which lay at our feet. After 2f miles reached the foot of the incline, the last 600 yards of the descent being very steep zigzags down the end of a spur (6,000'). 1 he Mihaila (xavvari flows north-west to join the Zab at Karmi on the Bashkala-Julamerk route. The stream is here 60 yards wide and 3 feet to 4 feet deep with a rapid cm rent over rocks and boulders. There are occasional deeper pools, and it is not fordable here. Low trees and shrubs line the banks, willow, pear, apple and ash chiefly. On the left bank the slope rises in a succession of grassy terraces and easy slopes to a lofty snow range, a continuation of the Jelu mountains to the south, flhisiange runs generally parallel to the Mihaila Gavvari stream until it joins the hills overlooking the Zab valley. Missionaries going from Gavvar to J ulamerk in summer usually cross the summit of the range without much difficulty, taking a direct line between the two places. To the north-west, and situated about half way up the hillside, are Dadi and Pirkauli, both Nestorian villages, and five other villages out of sight. A narrow track follow the line of the valley on this bank towards the Zab, and a path leads down the right bank to Karmi. Our route continues up the right bank of the river, which here almost falls up the narrow valley. The path is easy for mules, and the Turks have lately been cuttino and revetting some zigzags in the worst bits. This is almost the only road by which they can send troops from Bashkala to Liza to keep in order the Kurdish districts round Gavvar. 1 he distance of miles in this valley and the descent of the spur leading down to it are the only difficult points for the passage of field artillery in all this route. Widening the track in the valley and cutting longer zigzao-s m the slope would make this passable in a short time. Several streams enter from the western slopes of the Mur Dagh on the Persian frontier, and the country towards the frontier is cut up by a series or deep valleys flowing generally east to west. At 17 miles the valley gradually widens; the hills recede and become more rounded ; the soil is a mixture of shale and clay, with patches of igneous rock here and there. ^ u ^ n y ina ^ Agha Keupri .—At 18 miles is a wooden bridge over the stream called Muhammad Agha's bridge built by the Shaikh of the Oramar Kurds. It is a strong construction of 30 feet span, and is of great use, as the river is a roaming torrent, and impossible to ford at any point. 1 rom the left bank roads lead to the districts on the east slope of the Jelu mountains; it is a long day's march from here over the hill to Julamerk, and tfae^ highest point of the range to be crossed is 14,000 feet. _ The telegraph line (one wire on wooden poles) from ' Bashkala to Liza rejoins our road here. It follows the Bashkala-Julamerk line as far as Karmi,197 and tli^n takes a straight line here across the hills. The Gavvar plain. (6.500') is now reached, and gradually opens out to view. The river winds down the centre in a very sluggish course, looking like a canal. There are no trees visible, and the plain has the appearance of having been once the bed of an old lake. Our track skirts some low undulations by the east side along a broad easy track ; the ground in the centre near the river looks swampy ; at the edges the soil is a rich loam growing wheat well. DiZA.—At 3H miles arrived at Diza, or Dizza as it is also pronounced, the principal place in the Gavvar district, and the head-quarters of the Mutaserif and the Turkish troops. It contains 700 houses built on a spur of rocky soil jutting out into the plain. The inhabitants are Armenians and Jews for the most part, with a few Kurds. There are some good houses of sundried brick, but most are huts of stone and mud, with a few small gardens and poplars round the town. Fruit and vegetables have to he imported from Urmia gardens. Ice is stored in pits throughout the summer. There is one battalion (500 men) of Turkish regular troops and some oO zaptiyahs quartered here since the Kurdish rebellion of IbSl. The barracks are a square block of one-storied buildings in a rather tum bled down condition, situated on a spur overlooking the town. There is a telegraph office, and the wire from Bashkala does not go beyond this. The Gavvar plain is 20 miles long and 8 miles wide, and I could only count 12 poor looking villages, generally a collection of mud huts on a low mound. A few clumsy carts or i( arabas ,J drawn by two buffaloes were seen on the plain. . . . Looking west was a splendid panorama of the Jelu mountains, with, peaks &gt; covered with perpetual snow. The central peak, called dura Daouil, bore 249° from here, and was I 62 miles distant. Measured by sextant, its altitude above sea level was 17,280 feet, or only about 150 feet lower than Mount Ararat. It rises 10,780 feet above Gavvar plain. Bearing 255°, and 13 miles distant, was Tura Bermarghi, another peak m the same ridge 15,800 feet high ; and another peak 19 miles distant healing 246° and 15,430 feet high. _ oaqo These form the culminating points of the range. As tar as 200 the sum mit of the ridge is jagged, and a series of stupendous cliffs with ravines filled with perpetual snow. . n . . 1 1 i From 263° to 276° the summit of the range is rounded, with a general level of 14,500 feet, and thickly covered with snow. From 276°, northward to the Zab, the range gradually gets lower, and has only a few patches of snow. . South of the main peaks from 205° to 236° is a marked dip in the range, the hill tops being rounded with few patches of snow. A road seen winding over here, and leading in the direction of Rezan (see Route V 111). On the other side of these ranges to the west lie the deep narrow valleys 0 Christian districts of Baz and Jelu. _ . . „ From 205° to the southward the range again rises m a series of ridges with numerous peaks, all thickly covered with snow and with high jagge summits. And it looks a most impracticable sort of country. Nutcha and Shamsdin, both elevated districts, lie in this direction. I could hear ot no road leading through there to Rawanduz. , ,-i . • ±. The plain runs up in a direction 167° for some 12 miles, and at that point a narrow valley seems to enter, coming from the direction of bhamsdin198 and Nutcha. A broad road led up the plain in this direction from Diaa to some large villages which could be seen at the mouth of the valley. The Kurds build their villages in the most inaccessible places, so as to get away if possible from the Turkish authorities. Nutcha and Shamsdin are said to be elevated wooded districts, but no trees could be seen in any direction either on the plain or on the mountain slopes. A little wood is obtainable in Diza, and “tezek'” or cowdung cakes are almost exclusively used for firewood. Several poplar logs were met on the road being dragged into Diza. A good deal of fever is said to prevail here in the summer and autumn, caused probably by the swamps in the centre of the plain. The winter climate is very severe. The road we came from Bashkala can Climate usually be kept open, if sufficient caravans use it, and k ee P the snow drifts trodden down. This is the case with all the roads here in the winter. 16th July .-General direction N. E. Left Diza, taking the principal caiavan road to Urmia. At starting kept up a valley with a large stream It miles wide, but gradually getting narrower. It is a broad gravelly track with a slight ascending gradient. The hills on either hand are rounded with easy slopes giving good grazino- for sheep and cattle. Hay was being saved for the winter. Shaikh Amir .—At 6 miles the valley has narrowed to 400 yards, and on a spur across the valley was a half ruined castle, the residence of Shaikh Amir, a chief of the Shekak Kurds. . Ga(lu j l The road continues up the valley, crossing and recross- ing the little stream, until at 13f miles from Diza the rounded summit of the range isreacued atapoint called the Delasi Gaduji pass (7,680'). An easy descent is commenced into the valley of another large stream from the Mur Dagh to the north. This is the upper waters of the Nazlu Chai, which we cross later on in the Urmia plain. The Mur Dagh is some 6 miles distant on a bearing of 315°. The summits have still a few patches of snow on them. A high ridge also runs parallel to the road to the south, and from 4 to o miles distant. Millet, wheat, sesame, wheat mixed with vetches were the principal crops. The valley gets gradually wider as we descend, and at 18 miles is about 2 miles wide, formed by a series of terraces and slopes rising from the stream bed. beveral streams join from the direction of the Mur Dao-h. Bazirga.—kt 21 miles the half ruined village of Barsan was passed, and at 29 miles Bazirga was reached (5,800'). .^fni Ba U S i la / e ?fi O j t , 20 i i '' 1 ,aljited houses, hut it was once much larger, untilthe Kurds fortified the knoll near it during Shaikh Obeidullah’s rebellion in 1881.

Llke , tll , e o£ . the T urko-Persian frontier, these districts are in a c ironic state of disturbance, and bands of nomad tribes raid over the border ^aravans of mules and ponies were met carrying baskets of fruit and bags of ce tiom Uimia to Diza. No rice is grown in Gavvar. of \^ erSl T Frontier '~ A ^ 30 2 miles we crossed the frontier, marked by a pile loose Stones, on a small spur. At 32| miles the valley opens out suddenly,and we emerged into the Baradost plain. At 351 miles we halted at Gangachin, a small village in the centre of it (5,495'). Baradost Plain .—The plain of Baradost is 6 to 8 miles long (and 3 to 4r broad, surrounded by low rounded hills. The Nazlu Chai, which we have followed down the valley from the head of the pass, turns down the centre of the plain in a direction 140°, and some 7 miles down disappears between some high spurs in a deep rocky gorge. North of Baradost is a similar plain divided from this by a few undula tions. A stream, a tributary of Nazlu Chai, flows from it through Gangachin. The plain contains a very fertile gravelly soil, and grows fine wheat crops, one crop standing ripe, and ready to cut, with another by the side of it green, 4 inches to 6 inches high, and not fit to cut for another 3 months. Notwithstanding its fertility, there are only a few small poor looking villages to be seen on the plain. This is chiefly due to the disturbed state of these frontier districts and constant raids of the Herki and Shekak Kurds. During the night a caravan was entirely looted on the road close by. Near the village is a square fort with mud walls 3 feet to 4 feet thick and 10 feet high, of about 200 yards side, situated on a small mound. It was begun as a defence against Kurdish raids in 1851, but has never been finished. The inhabitants of the village are chiefly Armenians with some Kurds. This Baradost plain is very likely to be confused with Baranduz, another plain to the south of Urmia. 17th July.—General direction E. Left camp, and started along a broad track down the plain, rejoining the main road from Diza after 3 miles. The road turns east, leaving the plain and ascending the line of low undu lations, bounding it in that direction. The hills are quite bare, the grass being withered up now, with no trees except a few stray pear and willow. At 8 miles descended into the valley of a small stream flowing south to join the Nazlu Chai. Shortly after ascended a rounded ridge by an easy path, and again descended into the Zangachin valley, also with a stream flowing towards the Naziu Chai. From Zangachin crossed another ridge, and entered a broad flat basin in which the Kurdish village of Ishkasu is situated. Some “ arabas ” or country carts were seen here for the first time. In Baradost were sledges drawn by two pairs of bullocks carrying corn down the hills. There is a small garden growing beans, cucumbers, melons, and potatoes near the village, watered from springs close by. At 12 miles reached the edge of the plateau (elevation 6,030'), and opened out an extensive view of the country to the east. At our feet was the fertile plain of Urmia, dotted with numerous large villages qnd dense orchards, looking a perfect paradise tons, who had scarcely seen a tree since leaving Shernakh on the 3rd July. Beyond the plain extended, till lost in the haze, the glimmering blue sheet of water forming Urmia lake. Descend a broad easy track, until, at the foot of a long spur, we reach the village of Hassan, where we halted (4,840'j. Hassan .—Near the village was a fruit garden surrounded by a strong mud wall 15 feet high, forming a square enclosure 600 yards side, with round flanking towers at the corners. This belongs to Sir Agha Mir Panj, commanding the troops in Urmia, who has a large house with extensive stables here. We found him encamped in the garden, and were received in the most hospitable manner. He drives200 in an antiquated sort of barouche from Urmia, and usually spends the summer here in tents. The garden is Avell kept, growing apricots, almonds, pears, apples, and vines, besides cucumbers, melons, potatoes, badinjan, and other vegetables. The apricots were ripe now, and the grapes just commencing. The garden is irrigated by a stream from the valley, and for drinking there is a large well. Water from an irrigation channel is never good to drink, being flat and stale On a mound above the village are the ruins of an old mud fort. The village is just on the edge of the Urmia plain (UbOO 7 ). Eastward to the lake is an extremely fertile country, with numerous villages and large fruit orchards. The wheat and barley crops were being cut now. The weather was very pleasant for marching; the sun was powerful, although the noon temperature was not above 80°. 18th July.—General direction S.E. Left Hassan, and following a broad track over the plain towards Urmia. Nazlu .—At 3 miles passed through the large village of Nazlu, half Armenian and half Persian. The houses were well built of sundried bricks, each with an elevated wooden framework, on which the family sleeps at night. Haifa mile further forded the Nazlu Chai, a large stream with two channels, 50 feet wide and 2 feet deep, in a gravelly bed 300 to 400 yards wide. In winter this ford is not practicable, and the only means of crossing is at the bridge at Shungar Ali, 3 miles lower down. Carts are used on the plain, but only for bringing in corn from the fields, &amp;c., and never for journeys of any length; pack animals being invariably employed for this. From Nazlu is a broad easy track to Urmia, reached at 14 miles from Hassan and 11 from Nazlu. Several large villages with orchards were passed on the way. Most of these had large enclosures with high mud walls for defence in case of Kurdish raids. In two villages they were at work building, and evidently expected a repetition of the raids of 1881. This route from Bashkala forms an important line of communication. It is passable for field artillery throughout, with the exception of a short dis tance in the valley of the Mihaila Gavvari stream just before reaching Gavvar plain. A little road making would soon make this right.URMIA. TTrmia is a town of 7,000 houses with 35,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, situ ated iu the centre of an extremely fertile, thickly populated country, 12 miles distant from the western shore of the lake of the same name. The city is surrounded by a wall with 7 gates, and is built partly of mud and partly of sundried bricks, the gates being of burnt brick, closed every evening by heavy wooden doors. The wall is flanked at intervals by circular bastions, and is 20 to 25 feet high, 6 to 10 feet thick at the base, and 2 feet at the top with banquette and loopholes. It is irregularly built, and several portions are crumbling and unfinished. On the east side, facing the lake, it is most complete, and is there quite 30 feet high. On the south it is breached in several places, and has no banquette. It would be useful to keep out Kurdish troops armed with rifles only, but could easily be breached by field artillery. There is a ditch 15 to 20 yards wide and from 10 to 12 feet deep, fdled in some places by stagnant pools. The small water channels which supply the town are led over on hollow tree trunks. There are several country seats of Persian officials, &amp;c., dotted among the orchards outside the town, and a few well built houses in the town with open courtyards and fountains, ornamented with coloured tiles in the usual Persian style. ■. o i tt Water-supply of the town is drawn by canals from the oahar or Urmia river, which Hows about H miles to the south of the town. It is led in small channels through the streets and houses of. the town, and must in its course get very contaminated. Some houses get their water from wel s. The streets are wide for a Persian town, but the majority of the houses aie wretched mud huts, and there are no public building of any size._ The principal building is the arsenal, an enclosed building in the centre of the town, with high brick walls having a round tower at each corner. 1 m courtyard is about 250 yards square, and contains 13 bronze 6-pr. smoth-bore guns, and one small brass howitzer, with limbers and stores. At present there are three regiments of regular troops quartered here armed wit i ern . There are several unenclosed graveyards inside the walls which disfigure the town very much. A very ancient Nestorian church and the graves ot the three Magi are shown. Urmia is also reputed to he the birthplace ot Zoroaster. About | mile outside the east gate is the Christian village ot Diga a, near which is a large mound of ashes, the remnant of a hrewoislnpper s emp e. There are 100 houses of Nestorians in a separate quarter near the soutii gate, and 50 or 60 families of Jews, . . , v i -fu There are five American Presbyterian missionaries who live here witn their families, and two missionaries of the Archbishop o an er ury Mission to the Nestorian Christians, who were established here m ibbo. Another of the latter lives with Mar Shimun, the Patriarch of the Nestonans, at Kochannis. There is also a Dominican mission of priests and sisters who work among the large Christian population of the U rm ^ an . a mas p ains. The American mission has a house in the town for the winter, and another about a mile to the south, outside the gates, called the College, w eie aie schools, &amp;c.202 Their summer residence is on the slope of Mount Seir, 5^ miles from the south gate, and has a church and school also. They have recently started a technical school, where carpentering and smithes work is taught, and a printing press. The English mission have a house in the town, with a small church schools, and printing press. The inhabitants of the town are exclusively Shiah Muhammadans, and have a bitter hatred and fear of their Kurdish neighbours on the Turkish fron tier, who are Sunnis. There is a telegraph office, and a line runs from Tabriz through Dilman along the north side of the lake. The clerk was unable to read Roman characters, and all telegrams had to be first translated into Persian. There is a weekly post to Tabriz. The town is surrounded by a very fertile plain, containing numerous Environs of Urmia. enclosed vineyards and orchards, which grow fruit in great profusion. In the town several of the better houses have courtyards enclosing gardens, and grow some fine chenars and poplars. This plain is the delta of the Sahar Chai, and extends eastward to the shores of the lake and westward along the river, from which all the water for irrigation is derived. Roads through these gardens are bordered by mud walls or hedgerows 6 feet high, crossed by numerous canals from one garden to another. The raisins (kuru uzum) produced here are exceptionally fine, and there are upwards of thirty different kinds of grape (uzum) cultivated on the plain. Apples (elma), pear (armud), apricot (kayssi), peach (sheftali), plum (aiik)^ mulberry (tut), walnut (jeviz), almond (badem), quince (aywa), and a few pomegiante trees (anar) are the principal fruits, while melon (karpuz), cucumbers (khiyar), beans (bakla), badinjan (patiljan in Turkish), bamia potatoes (yer-elmassi) are the vegetables. Lucerne (ionga) is also grown in considerable quantities for fodder. Quantities of wheat and barley are grown on the higher ground, but scaicely any is exported. Raisins, dried plums, and apricots are the principal exports. Cotton and tobacco are also produced in large quantities. Hop vines are grown at the American Mission House. In the midst of all this seeming plenty and fertility, the people, wherever they were met, looked poor and ground down by excessive extortion. Last year, when there were threats of famine, the principal merchants formed a wheat ‘ ring, and bought up most of the corn in the market. Famine did not come, so they forced the peasants to take back their corn at the original price, and lost nothing by their speculations. . Poplar (kawak-aghaji), chenar, elm(kara-aghach), and walnut (ieviz) are the principal trees. Willow (suglind), mulberry (tut), and ash (dish-budak aghaji) are also to be seen in numbers on the plain. Poplars are extensively used for building purposes. Taxation in North-West Persia. The following notes by Mr. Abbott, British Consul at Tabriz, show the system of taxation now in force in North-West Persia. . T lle P rinci pal tax levied in Persia is called the “ maliat/’ which in Azerbai jan is assessed at £220,588 a year. The name is a generic one for all government imports in Persia, and in the present instance includes the taxes on lands, shops, &amp;c.203 z, IDg DUli| growfinitu of tile km i clienarsiil stward te tls all the wfe or hedjp ,notlier, I d there &amp; he plain, eftali), pk nee fa/ffi Ion fbrpoz ish), Wai so grown a ■ ground, k the printip les, iple, where'? :tioa. pal merdnc: market, iack their® , (jeviz)®^ .budaka^V isively B^ i; ’ iriZjSb^ ichinA^' It is levied in multifarious ways. For instance, in a district of Azerbaijan consisting of 200 villages, it varies in each village in amount and in the object on which 5 it is levied. The bulk is levied, on land and its produce, but in some cases oxen for the plough are taxed, while in others both the oxen and the land are taxed. In some villages so much per head of population is collected in addition to an impost on horses, cows, asses, and sheep. # f In the Urmia plain certain villages are liable to a tax called “gur-al-lik” (see and take), which is apt to become an instrument of oppression. ^ Speaking generally, the “ maliat ” when applied to the produce of the land is one-tenth of the whole crop. When it is a poll tax, it is levied thus Every male adult pays a sum equal to 2s. while married women, marriageable V o U ths, and girls pay a sum equal to U. 5|^. per annum. A yoke of oxen for the plough pays Us. 9,1; a horse, ass, and cow 8|cl, and a sheep IK each. The system works tolerably under fair-dealing landlords. These furnish seed to the tenants on loan to be returned at the end of the harvest with an addition of 50 per cent, as interest. Thus altogether two-tenths of the crop must be given up, one going to the landlord and one to the Government. Suppose the former supplies 10 karwars (1,000 lbs) : This with the tenant s portion would give a crop of at least 200 karwars. From this must be deducted 20 for the Government, 20 for rent, and 15 to repay the loan of the seed with interest, and there remains to the peasant 14*5 karwars clear for himself The* unjust landlord lends no seed, but takes two-tenths all the same. He practices extortion, saddles the peasant with innumerable imposts, and disregards the nature of the seed and the harvest. _ On the whole the peasants of Azerbaijan are in a state of comfortable penury, and misery arising from oppression is not common. Many of the evils from which they suffer have their origin m the careless and unequal dis tribution of the fiscal burden rather than in systematic oppression on the part of their masters. „ . . £ , • , But there is no progress, and a certain amount of animal comfort exists among the inhabitants, but nothing more. , . , pf Q ; n Until great modifications take place in the religious and civil law obtain ing in the country, progress, as we understand its meaning in the west, must remain a sealed book to the Persian peasant. „ The landlords or masters of the villages are chiefly of the Afshar tribe of Turks settled in Persia, and are Shiahs in religion The “ Gur-al-Lik ” system of taxation is collected as follows : House tax on Musalman subjects 4s. 2d. per annum ; and on Christian subjects 6 s. 8d. 11.11 On life stock it is paid in equal stares thus by both classes : For each buffalo 3 bans (2a. 6 A) •n ... 1 bran 10 shahis (Is. 3d.) For a cow „ ... 3 krans (2s. 6 d.) For a mare — ••• _ ti i ... 10 sliahis (5d.) For a sheep ... ••• •*• s i , ... 1 kran 10 shahis (Is. 3d.) For a donkey ... ••• ••• , T TT • ... 20 shahis = 1 kran == 10 d In Urmia ... ••• In addition to this, all Christian males above 15 years of age pay a poll-tax in lieu of military service amounting to 5 krans (4s. 2d.) per annum. The landlord is responsible to Government for the collection of taxes, either Musalman or Christian, to the amount which every village is assessed ; the fixed amount claimed annually being entered in the Government register. 2d 2201 The tenant, on the other hand, is responsible for the due discharge of the imposts to the landlord, upon whose individual character it wholly” depends whether a system, which in principle seems equitable enough, can be converted into an instrument of oppression. Near the American Mission College were two villages, one Musalman and the other Christian, each of about 15 houses, and both underthe same landlord. In both of them the landlord provided the seed for sowing. The annual pro duce was 50 karwars of wheat. ^ The Government imposts amounted to 5 krans per karwar, and the total taxes would be therefore about 25 tomans per annum. Putting the population at 75, the annual tax would amount to individually 3 tomans or £1-5-0. Christians and Musalmans were here subjected to an -analogous system, but the Musalmans were favoured thus : Instead of keep ing literally to the terms of the agreement regarding the distribution of seed, the landlord sometimes allowed the Musalman tenants to sow a few acres with his own seed, and appropriate two shares of the crop ; whereas a similar indul gence is never shown to the Christian, who is kept to the letter of the law. After visiting several villages on the plain, the Christians seemed more prosperous than the Musalmans ; but being considerably in the minority, they were less able to make a successful stand against an oppressive landlord 5 than their neighbours. In some of the villages on the Nazlu Chai the landlords resort largely to forced labour in the cultivation of their vineyards and cornfields. ” J The labourers, who are both Musalman and Christian, receive no pecu niary remuneration, and rarely a morsel of food, besides beino- beaten as fre quent complaints seem to show. It appears that more Christians than Musal mans are pressed into this service. The oppressive system resorted to for the collection of taxes, where the master of the village is a man of unscrupulous character, and the corruption of the sources of justice, are evils which form the common heritage of Chris tian and Musalman. ® As the result of class prejudices, the Christians are often unable to brin«- their produce for sale the Musalmans refusing to buy it. In consequence of their being on the border land between two weak ill-o-overned states the ^citizens of Urmia aod the whole population of its “plain are iTaUe to incessant Kurdish raids, which render life and property more insecure than in any other part of the empire. Another grievance is the Jedid-ul-Islam law. By this, if one member of a Christian family embrace Islamism, he or she becomes entitled to the property of the family ; and by the word family not only father and mother, but collateral branches are included. It is seldom that a Christian apostatises under the law; but a young Musalman may seduce or forcibly abduct a Christian girl of well-to-do family, and declare that she has become a Musal man, and thus claim all the property. If the girl has not really deserted her religion, it is easy to get another to personate her, as she can only be produced in court veiled, . , r f he testlmon y of a Christian in the country is not received in a court of justice any more than in Turkey. Turkey has admitted it in principle by the promulgation of various Imperial/^ ordering that there is to be no difference made between the two races, and the European powers have thus a solid basis to work upon, by which they are entitled to demand as a right the complete religious and civil emancipation of all the Christian populations. The Shah might be induced to act in the same manner.Although the Nestorians pay a special exemption poll-tax from military service, the authorities have begun lately to make them serve as musicians in the hands. It is customary for the Nestorians to resort every year to Russia. Some obtain work at Tiflis and other parts of the Caucasus as day-labourers and artisans, while others confine themselves purely to legging, visiting Moscow and St. Petersburg for this purpose. There is probably no race in the world who are such persistent mendicants, and they appear to do a thriving business at it. It is computed that 5,000 Nestorians annually visit Russia, and that from 300 to 500 go for begging, the remainder for work. Begging brings in an annual income of £4,000, and work £100,000. They are relieved or robbed of a large portion of their gains on their return to Persian soil by the Kurds, who are government guards, placed osten sibly to check brigandage. Urmia Plain. The plain of Urmia stretches north and south along the west shore of the lake for 50 miles, and west for 15 to 20 miles. It is thickly dotted over with villages, numbering some 550, of which 200 are Christian, Nestorian, and Armenian, and the remainder Musalman. The majority of the Musalmans are Shiahs of Turkish extraction, talking the Turkish language. The large Turkish tribe of Karapapak (Black Hats) settled here and in Sulduz. Bounding the plain on the west is a range of rounded hills rising from 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the level of the lake. Beyond this, along the Turkish frontier, forming a higher and parallel line of hills, are the lofty ranges culminating in the Shaikh Iwa peak above Ushnu, and the peaks above Gavvar and the Mur Dagh. Pgtween these two lines of hills are a series of elevated valleys, the prin cipal being Mergavvar, Tergavvar, and Baradost. Beyond the frontier are a line of still more elevated valleys among the hIdler ranges, Nutcha, Shemisden or Shamsdin, and Gavvar. °To the south of the Urmia plain is Mount Seir or the Kuh-i-Seri, and a Ion 0 ’eastward spur from it separates the Urmia from the Baranduz plain. °South of Baranduz, along the southern shores of the lake, is Sulduz plain watered by the Jerratu Su, a large stream flowing also through the Ushnu plain and rising the frontier ranges. Baranduz plain is watered by a stream called the Baranduz Ghai from the same hills. _ The plain to the north of Urmia is ail known as Anzal, and it merges into the extensive plain of Salmas at the north-west extremity of the lake Mergavvar, Tergavvar, and Baradost contain fertile soil, but are but little cultivated owing to the unsettled state o£ the frontier districts. Two crops of wheat in one year can be obtained there : the first sown in April, and cut in August, and another sown in June, and cut in October. The Sahar or Urmia Chai and the Nazlu Chai are the principal rivers of the Urmia plain. They rise in the frontier, flow through narrow valleys in the outer range of hills, and open out into the plain country before falling into the lake. „ . . . . ,, . , The climate of Urmia is severe during the winter, Climate. pleasant in the summer months. There is usually rain in April and May, and again in the autumn in Sep. tember, October, and November. In winter there is sometimes 2 feet of snow206 on the plain, and during the thaw the roads are almost impassable from the deep mud. In spring the hills are covered with splendid grass and form fine grazing ground. The temperature at noon in the end of July averaged 80°, and the weather was like an English summer. The nights were cool, and the inhabitants sleep on the fiat roofs of the houses then. Urmia Lake. The lake is about 200 miles in circumference, 82 miles long and r 21&lt; broad. It is the saltest piece of water in the world, more so than the Dead Sea. Its specific gravity is D155 with 2l , 4 percent, of salt. In the adjoining plain of Salmas and near Ivhoi are deposits of rock, salt, and gypsum, forming part of the great tertiary deposits of the frontier chain of mountains. The lake is 4,100 feet above sea level, the town being 4,610 feet. A person bathing can float easily, but the water is very painful if any reaches the eyes or throat, producing a smarting or choking sensation. Swimming is difficult. There are no fish or living thing in the water except a tiny colourless iellv fish. J ^ Of late years the waters have risen some 2 to 3 feet, and the level flue- tnates up or down slightly every year. There seems no sign of a permanent rise or fall, and there is a fringe of land thickly crusted with salt round the shore. A small quantity of salt is extracted from the water, chiefly alone- the southern shore, the mines near Khoi supplying the country to the north. Iheie are three boats, the property of the Vali-Adh, Governor of Tabriz, -they are 30 feet long and 10 broad, clumsily built, with one large square sail, and are quite unable to beat against the wind. In a favourable wind they could cross to the nearest point to Tabriz in 6 or 7 hours ; but the wind o ten drops, leaving them becalmed for 5 or 6 days in the centre of the lake, ihey can cast anchor at any point, the depth being only 20 to 30 feet, this is the easiest line of communication for the rich products of Urmia to reach the Tabriz and Tehran markets, and the advantages of a few steamers would be enormous. At present it takes five days for caravans to reach Tabriz by the north shore of the lake. J i-n ^ r jf Pnt i State things is entirely due to the shortsighted policy of tne Vah-Adh, who prohibits any boats on the lake except his own, or those paying him a tax so high as to make any trade prohibitive. U-om the town is a 2^ hours' ride to the American Mission on the shore of the lake. The first 8 miles is a very pretty ride through orchards and gardens, crossing numerous small irrigation canals from the Urmia river. tions mTn y i 1S W6 1 r°M’ Wlt,1 i m ? ny enclosed vineyards, tobacco planta- 2Zr'2: nd ** ? n “ The finest trees are elm, rounded mnie of w® aSt £ ° m ' mile8 was over some s P ms from a low an e e of hills which form an isolated mass on the edge of the lake.

They are to he found on either side of the border, and parties were heard of in the Zab valley near Julamerk. They are the noted robbers in this part of the country, and are constantly planning or carrying out some raid. They can furnish 1,000 horsemen, and some of them took part in the looting at Bayazid in the war of 1878-79. Their chief is Ali Khan, now in prison at Tabriz, who has a son called Ahmed Agha. They are armed mostly with Martini-Peabody rifles, served out to them in the Russo-Turkish war. Some were met in Baranduz armed with Werndl and Chassepots, which they had got from the Persian Government, and a few were armed with the spear. They were well mounted, and doubtless with a proper organisation would produce some good men for scouting and light cavalry work. They are Sunni Musalmans of the Shafi sect like most Kurds, and are very fanatical and bigoted against Christians. Jierki .—These are a large nomad tribe numbering 2,000 tents or about 10,000 men. . In the summer they pasture their flocks in Shamsdm and Gavvar, oeeasionT allv coming over the Persian border into Mergavvar, Tergavvar, and Baradost. In winter they descend into the Tigris plain round Mosul and the Bahdi- nan district (see Kurds round Mosul).^ They also have a very bad reputation, and constantly pillage the country in their annual migrations. I hey are Sunnis of the Shafi sect. Oramar .—These area small sedentary tribe living in 22 villages m Shamsdin. Some are nomads, who cross the Persian frontier into Mergavvar and Tergavvar in the summer time. Shaikh Obeidulla, who raised the Kurdish rebellion in 1880-81, was chief of this tribe, and reputed as a man of holy descent, of the Nakushbendi sect of Sunnis. He lived at Neri in Shemisden. His son is now chief of the tribe. „ i t ^ Karapapak .—These were originally a Turkish tribe of nomads who have set tled now some 40 years in the villages of the Sulduz and Baranduz plain. hey number some 8,000 families, and are Shiahs; consequently at constant ieud with the Kurdish tribes on the frontier who are Sunnis. c c • tj i i Milcri. —Inhabiting the country to the east and north-east of Su 3 Bu ak in the direction of Miandab is the Kurdish tribe of Mikn, numbering 2,000 families.

The following precis will show the part taken hy these tribes in the Kurdish rebellion of 1880-81 [Blue Book, Turkey, No.o, Ibtil): In July 1880, Shaikh Obeidullah, the Chief of the Oramar Kurds, obtained considerable power over the neighbouring tribes owing to his religious203 influence. His aims seem to have been the creation of an independent province of Kurdistan acknowledging- the suzerainty of the Sultan, but removing- all the Turkish officials. He accordingly made overtures to Mar Shimun, the Nestorian Patriarch to assist him against the Tucks, and also asked the Armenians for assistance! He professed to be friendly to the Christians, and said he would protect them, although doubtless his real object was to gain their assistance against the Turks and confirm his authority, which was by no means strono-, amono- the Kurds. There is no doubt that at first the Turkish Government connived at and encouraged his views, and their attitude towards the Shaikh in 1879 seemed likely to produce serious complications. Instead of inflicting on him due punishment for rebellion, they heaped favours on him, and encouraged him in carrying out his ambitious projects with impunity. His first effort was to conquer the fertile plain of Urmia and march on Tabriz. On 14th July 1880, the Shekak and Hyderanlu Kurds seemed to be in Opposition to him, and sent raiding parties into Turkey. Shaikh Obeidullah sent his son Abdul Kadir with a force to Baziro-a, on the road to Baradostfrom Gavvar, to rebuild the fort there, and coerce these tribes into allegiance. The Shaikh said that the Shekaks and Herkis were all nominally Persians, and had constantly robbed Persian caravans and his own, and he now wished the three plains of Mergavvar, Tergavvar. and Baradost to be rented to him, and that in case of refusal he would at once march against these tribes. Abdul Kadir finally came to terms with Ali Khan, the chief of the Shekaks, and built a fort at Gangachin in Baradost between the Shekak and Herki lands. The chiefs of Ushnu and Lahijan began negotiating with Shaikh Obeidul lah to join him on the 8th October. It was reported in Tehran that a laro- e body of Kurds, numbering 15,000, belonging to various tribes on both sides of the frontier, headed by Abdul Kadir and Hamza Agha, a Persian Kurd, had seized the town and surrounding district of Suj Bulak; that the Persian authorities there had fled, and the rebels had moved on Marao-ha, and pillaged numerous villages en route. This was the first news which broke suddenly on the Persian Government. The forces then available in Azerbaijan were three regiments, and five more were at once called out. o nnn he tro 1 °P^ wllicl1 eventually started to quell the rebellion, were a force of d,000 regular troops, with irregular cavalry from Tabriz under the Itimad-es- Sultaneh, which reached Maragha on the 21st October ; and another under laimur Khan Pasha, Governor of Khoi, of some 5,000 men and six guns from Khoi and Maku, which arrived at Salmas on the 24th, and expected to reach Urmia on the 30th October. r Irom Tehran a force of some 4,000 regulars under Hamza Mirza Hukhmut-ed-Dauleh, an uncle of the Shah, were despatched by way of Biiar on Suj Bulak with five Austrian officers and 1,200 Persian troops drilled by Austrian instructors armed with Werndls, with a battery of rifled o-uns. not her detachment started from Hamadan and the Geru country under Hassan Ah Khan, with two regiments and 700 cavalry, towards Maragha. Hamza Agha, the Kurdish chief who took an important part in the rebellion, was chief of the Menkuri Kurds, and having quarrelled with the209 ^ Nl!» re ffl0?i|i9 jJ , ai1 Patriai^ :or assistant ^ouid pfo^, • taoce agaiis roil 8i araoEJ wed at aai I ^JSsecad tby bp| tons projeii d fflarcbi iined to tail izirga, on tk e these trite II nominal! wn, and k tto be rente! these tribes, he Sheiab, land Heiki h Obeidul- iat a large kill sides ! a Persian iulak; that m Maragha, jovernineiit d five mors 3 re a forced ie Itimad-fS' ootfier tmJfl nd six ^ i expected^ amza Mj® way of Kj 81 5 s drilled If Governor of Suj Bulak^ resolved to join Shaikh Obeidullah. Taking a few of tlie principal men, he went to the Mamash tribe, who in consequence of a general dissatisfaction against Persian rule joined him. He then went to Ushnu, where Abdulla Khan, chief of the Zeza Kurds, also joined him, because of some ill-treatment received from the Governor of Urmia. Collecting these men together, they appealed to Abdul Kadir, then in Mergavvar, and the whole then marched on Suj Bulak. On their way they compelled the Karapapak to join on pain of extinction ; these with the Mikri also joined unwillingly. Suj Bulak was surrounded ; the governor was allowed to depart, and the town surrendered. Abdul Kadir then summoned the tribes as far south as Banah to Sakiz to join, but they came in only in a half-hearted way. He appointed provisional governments for the districts he occupied. From Suj Bulak he advanced to the Tatavi river, attacked Miandab, and pillaged 600 out of 1,000 houses, capturing several guns and munitions of war. Meanwhile there was a force in Mergavvar to protect Abdul Kadir’s retreat, and another under Shaikh Khalifah Said Muhammad, brother-in-law of Shaikh Obeidullah, on the road between Gavvar aud Urmia. Abdul Kadir fought an engagement with the Persian troops near Banah, where he was defeated, and a son of Shaikh Obeidullah and brother of Hamza Agha with 300 men were killed. On the 9th November the Persians at Urmia having been reinforced, drove Shaikh Obeidullah out of the entrenched position he had taken up on the Seri mountain, and forced him to retire into Mergavvar. On the 12th November Suj Bulak was retaken, and Abdul Kadir and Hamza Agha both fled, and a cordon of nine battalions was drawn by the Turks along the frontier to prevent the Kurds re-entering Turkish soil. On the 19th November the rebellion was practically over, and Shaikh Obeidullah in full flight in Mergavvar. Taimur Khan Pasha, the Governor of Khoi, defeated Shaikh Sadik between Salmas and Urmia. On the 20th December the tribes were quiet, and a fine of 40,000 tomans was agreed on. The whole of the country between the Tatavi and Jaghatu rivers was desolate, and upwards of 2,000 villages were burnt and 10,000 people rendered homeless, while as many as 2,000 Persians were massacred at Miandab, including numbers of women aud children. Thirty Armenians and fifty Jews were found dead there. Out of 330 Jews, only 13 were seen alive, and large numbers of Jewish women and children were taken into captivity by the Kurds. Indeed, the tribesmen joined the insurrection more with the prospect of getting an opportunity to loot and plunder than for any of the loftier motives which actuated their chiefs. The same happened at Bayazid during the Russian war of 1878, when the Kurdish levies committed the most inhuman excesses. The attitude of Russia during this outbreak is of importance, as the same inflammable materials still exist, and the blaze of rebellion might easily break out again. The troops at Kars were reinforced, the frontier strengthened, and a Cossack corps of observation formed at Julfa ; while it was stated in St. Petersburg* thatj if tbe Kurdish rebellion had succeeded* Itussia would have had a new and formidable enemy to confront in the vicinity of Kars and Bayazid, ready to spread havoc round Tiflis and Alexandropol, and would have to take measures to protect her provinces. VOL. i. 2 E210 Shaikh Obeidullah’s plan was to attack in three armies—one on Khoi and Salmas; the second on Urmia and Mergavvar; and the third on Suj Bulak and by the southern shore of the lake on Tabriz. Among various attempts to collect the tribes and form an autonomous Kurdish principality. Shaikh Obeidullah sent emissaries to sound Prince Abbas Mirza, the Shah's brother, at Tehran, and endeavoured to induce him to join the insurgents. He tried hard to induce the Christians to join him,- and obliged a few from Shemisden to accompany him. He sent to Mar Shimun saying his object was solely to punish the Shekak and Herki tribes who had robbed his people, and asked his assistance. Some 400 to 500 accordingly did join, but did not go beyond the frontier, and returned to their homes as soon as they found out his real intentions. He also made overtures to the Armenian Vartabed at Bashkala. The Nestorian Metropolitan Mar Yusuf accompanied the Shaikh from Nutcha, and Was in the Kurdish camp before Urmia. The Shaikh had then 300 mountain Nestorians, whom he had impressed. Shaikh Obeidullah stated that be was resolved to strike a blow for independence, and form Kurdistan into a separate principality, restore order on the frontier, and place Christians and Musalmans on an equal footing as regards education, and allow churches and schools to be built. For this he required the moral support of the European powers, especially England. The massacres at Miandab did not look much like carrying out this programme. Up to the 7th October the Nestorians in Sulduz were respected, but owing to some supposed provocation those in Miandab were then massacred. With reference to the rumoured attempt of Shaikh Obeidullah to form a Kurdish league, the existence of such organized by the Turks was quite im aginary, as the Turks would scarcely be so foolish as to raise up a league which would only be directed against themselves. The policy of the Turkish Government usually is to set tribe against tribe, taking advantage of internecine quarrels and jealousies. In June 1880 the Armenians complained that at the instigation of the Porte a Kurdish league was being formed in order to stifle the Armenian question. If exceptional privileges were granted to the Armenians and Christians, it is possible that the Kurds would rise and combine, and a massacre of the Christians would ensue. To raise the status of the Christians would appeal to the ignorant fanati cism of the Kurds, and would be almost the only cause for which their many divergent clans and tribes could be got to combine. Shaikh Obeidullah was the most influential man in east Kurdistan, and no doubt his first intentions were to get rid of the Sultan's officials and set up as Ruler of Kurdistan—that is, the south portion of Van and the north part of the Mosul Waliats, and as far more as his influence will allow. To carry out this, his policy was to conciliate the Christians, not out of love or regard for them, but to further his designs. It is possible that he made his move into Persia under the impression that the Persian Government was more rotten than that of the Turks, and that independent authority would be easier obtainable there. The Shaikh was believed to be more or less personally loyal to the Sultan, and would be ready to submit to his authority and pay tribute if he could get nd of the Turkish officials.

Chjnar, poplar, ash, elm, sycamore and willow, besides pear, apple, plum, apricot and other fruit trees, are principally grown on the plain. The inhabitants of some of the villages are exclusively Armenian and Nestorian Christians, while others are entirely Turks of the once powerful Karapapak clan, who many years ago settled down here. Persian is only imperfectly known, and Turkish or Syriac is the language of the people. The Karapapak are all Shiahs. The track keeps through the lane along the right hank of a small stream we have followed since leaving Jundarli. Chucha. —At 20f miles reach the village of Chucha, at the foot of a low range of bare hills bounding the Baranduz plain to the south-east. Passing through the village, the road enters a small valley | mile wide, down which the stream we have been following flows. Ckasimlar. —Follow an easy track, swampy in places from irrigation cuts, and at 22 miles reach small village of Chasimlar (4,510'), where we halted. Some bundles of fascines, easily procurable from the numerous willow trees, would be very useful in crossing the muddy canals on the plain. Bushes, teazle, and many English flowers grow along the stream banks. The people in Baranduz seem, to be expecting another Kurdish raid. Jundarli is a partially walled village, and there are mud forts at Chucha and Dizei'techeh with numerous watch towers. The orchards cease at the edge of the plain at Chuchaj and the hillsides now are perfectly bare of trees. There is plenty of grass on these hills in the spring time. Wheat, barley, sesame and a little cotton grown in small patches round Chasimlar. There was only one cart in the village. Very few carts could be collected in the district, and are too heavy and clumsy to go any distance over hills, or to be of much use to the transport of an army. 29th July—General direction, S. Left the village, and continued alono- a broad track up the valley, here about ^ mile wide. The valley narrows as we ascend, and the border hills are steep clay slopes, getting higher as they recede. The road is a broad track, easily passable for carts, and follows the windings of the valley. A few small clusters of Kurdish huts were passed, and some patches of ^ cultivation along the stream ; but the country looks very deserted after crossing the rich plain of Baranduz. There are several small springs on the hillsides noticeable by the patches of green grass round them. After winding up the valley for 11 miles, we emerged on an open undu lating moorland (5,510'), measuring about 10 miles each way, quite bare of trees, but growing good bay by the stream banks and in the valleys. It is bounded by high rocky hills on either side, those on the west being the highest. In that direction they merge into the snow-covered ranges along the frontier. . ^ k roac i track leading from Sulduz to Mergavvar crosses our route here, going 293° over some easy hills towards the latter place.

At 17 miles pass the head of a flat valley 1 to 1| miles broad which extends some 5 miles among the hills to the west. At the head of it is the large village of Aghbulak.At 20 miles the road crosses a low undulation, the highest point of the ridge separating the Baranduz and Ushnu plains (6,185'). A gradual descent is begun now over an undulating plain 3 to 4 miles wide, with plenty of good grass, and clover obtainable by the small streams, which the villagers were cutting for winter. At 211 miles cross a narrow ravine, and continue the descent, keeping it to the right. To the east, between the hills, a wide valley, some 6 miles long, containing a few small villages, was noticed. The snow-topped Shaikh Iva range is now visible to the west, also patches of snow on the lower spurs 10 miles distant. At 24 miles descend steeply into the ravine, which we have been skirting to the right, and at 25 miles the valley opens out into the Ushnu plain. Our track rounds the hill to the right, and at 31 miles, following the foot of the hills along a broad road, we reached Ushnu (5,080'). This route all the way from Urmia is quite practicable for field artillery, with the exception of the short descent just before reaching the Ushnu plain, which might readily be improved by zigzags.USHNU. This is a town of 1,000 houses ensconced in a belt of gardens and orchards about a mile wide and 3 miles long, extending along the foot of the hills and watered by streams from them. The orchards are enclosed by mud walls and hedges, with numerous small canals intersecting them. The principal water-supply is from a small stream from the hills to the north-west and from springs. Several drinking fountains are provided by the roadside through the gardens. Some fine walnut, elm and mulberry trees grew in the orchards, besides vineyards, melon and cucumber beds, pears, apples, apricots, plums, &amp;c. The houses are for the most part built of sundried bricks or mud, withl some good two-storied ones built with a sort of open balcony along the upper storey, as is the custom in these districts. The inhabitants ax - e entirely Kurds (Sunnis), and are a handsome, fine stamp of men. Kermanji and Turkish are chiefly spoken. The eastern slopes of the Kandil Dagh are visible from here, still patched with snow {see Route VII). Routes from Ushnu. There is a route to Rawanduz leading direct by the Kalashin pass over the Shaikh Iva, a lofty mountain mass with its summit thickly covei’ed with snow, situated on the frontier to the west. The route is never used for caravan traffic, or in fact at all. Parts of it weie described as being quite impassable for mules and so narrow that two persons cannot pass each other. The Zeza Kurds on this line are a very tuibulent lot. Caravans from Urmia to Rawanduz go by the pass more to the south through Suj-Bulak and Lahijan {see Routes from Rawanduz). To Suj-Bulak, there is one route to the westward leading into Lahijan, and from there to Suj-Bulak, and another more direct one to the eastward of this, which we take. It is one day to Lahijan by a hilly, but fairly easy, road, and another day on to Suj-Bulak. ^ ^ j Route No. XIV.—Ushnu to Suj-Bulak. 30th to 31st July. Distance IN MILES.

Left Ushnu (5,080'), starting east across the plain. After 4 mile the gardens are left behind, and the Ushnu Chai, a small stream flowing in a wide gravelly bed crossed. There are no trees on the plain, except a few round the villages, The soil is a light gravelly clay, not quite so fertile as the Baranduz Plain.The wheat and barley crop has just been harvested, but is not yet gather ed in for threshing. , , . , , , ,, Cotton, castor oil, and sesame are the chief crops, while round tne villages are small patches of tobacco, hemp and melon. Several small muddy irrigation channels were crossed, and most of the villages have watch towers near them. At 3 miles pass Kurishawa, and at miles Khaltawar, both small villag-es, and at miles reach the left bank of the Jerrata Su, a river 30 yards wide and 2 feet deep, flowing down the centre of the plain from the hills to the west. The upper part is known as the Gadar Chai. On the right bank several deep irrigation cuts and some swampy beds were crossed before fording the river. On the opposite bank was a long gravelly mound, on which was the village of Kirkhlar, with a half ruined fort. These villages are all Kurdish, and they look much smaller than those of Baranduz and Sulduz. The soil becomes now a rich loam, overlying gravel, improving as we go on. At 11 miles the hills narrow in, forming a sort of strait about a mile wide, and separating the Ushnu from the Sulduz plain, which we now approach. The Ushnu plain is some mile» long and miles wide. The Sulduz plain widens out rapidly, and extends to the east to the shores of lake Urmia. It is dotted over with numerous large villages surrounded by orchards, and it forms a very rich and prosperous-looking district. All this end of the plain is cultivated with rice for about 5 miles down. After passing the village of Derband (12 miles) at the entrance to the pif in (4 680') we turned south, and kept along the foot of some undulating hills which bound the plain in that direction. It is a broad gravelly road, crossing some muddy irrigated bits here and there. . , , . Gornawa.—kt 16^ miles pass the large village of Gornawa m the plain, | mile to the left. •, Chiana.—kt 184 miles another similar village called Chiana, 1 mile to the left. Near this is a large rectangular-shaped fort, 400 yards by 200, with mud walls 30 feet high, loopholed, and in good repair having bastions at the corners and along the walls ; some with small embrasures. The fort can be commanded at about 2,000 yards range from some low rounded spurs, along the foot of which we skirt. . . „ , Gvzigailan, —At 23 miles turned to the left from the main road for 2 mi e into the plain, and halted in the village of Guzigailan (4,495 ), a place of 150 houses with a small mud fort, surrounded by a grove of fruit orchards, vineyards, poplars, elders and willows. Drinking-water for the village is from the canals, and consequently not good. Water m irrigation cuts is always unpleasant to drink, and liable to bring on fever. j VQWr . Some carts were drawing the wheat from the fields. ey aie y two buffaloes, and have small solid wooden wheels bound with a ring tire. Nagirdeh. —Bearing 322°, and 24 miles distant is Nagirdeh a place of 500 houses, scattered round the base of a gravelly mound, 500 y ar( J s * diameter. There are some good two-storied houses, and gardens and orcha d round o£ p ers i ans passed through here on their way to hawk quails. They had a pack of six couple of hounds looking like a cross between a porn ^ and spaniel, used for hunting hares also. This is a favourite amusement among the upper classes, both Kurds and Persians. 31 st July.—General direction, S.E. Rejoined the main track along the foot of the hills to the south of the plain. 2 f 2Some strings of camels were met with, the first seen since leaving Jazirah They are not used at all in Kurdistan. g •'azirah. le^t Baginkafo. A.t 4| miles pass the large village of Baginkala, 1 mile to the The road is a broad gravelly track, with occasional muddy bits from thp canals.

This is a place of 2,500 houses on the banks of a small stream flowing 1 towards Urmia lake, sunk in a sort of basin bounded by bare rounded hills. There are some 20 Christian houses and a few Armenian ; the remainder of the inhabitants are Sunnis. Turkish and Kermanji are generally spoken, with a little Persian. The houses are on the right bank of the stream, on the left being a belt of orchards and gardens extending for about miles. Most of the water from the stream is led away for irrigation and for drink ing purposes. The best water comes from some springs along the river bank at the foot of the hill to the east of the place. There are some 400 soldiers quartered here, recruited variously from Urmia, Sulduz and Tabriz. They are armed with percussion muskets,. with a few Werndls and Chassepots, and are dressed in a blue cotton tunic and trousers with red facings. They have a band! Trade is a good deal in the hands of Christian and Armenian merchants. Mr. Rassam, brother of the English Agent in Mosul, is one of the largest merchants of the place. He complains very much of the robberies and exactions of the governor, whose action quite paralyses trade. The governor is a man of about 25, recently arrived from Tehran, speaks French fluently, and was most hospitable. Four soldiers were sent by day to prevent people crowding round my tent, and no less than 18 townsmen to guard it at night. The telegraph runs from here to Tabriz through Miandab.

Started throug-h the narrow dirty streets of the town (4,575'), and at the east side ascended a valley ^ mile wide, following a well-defined track. The valley gets narrower as we ascend, bounded by steep rounded hills; the lower slopes of clay with rocky strata along the summit. At 4 miles turned up a steep slope to the north by some short zigzags in the clay soil. This is the steepest gradient all the way to Sakiz, but by making some longer zigzags, might easily be made passable for artillery. At the summit of the ascent (5,535') we crossed a small col, rounded the head of a wide basin running north, and the base of some high-rounded hills to the south. We got a fine view here of the Sulduz plain with the Urmia lake in the distance. Met some caravans composed partly of mules and partly of vabus. A few strings of camels also seen. Skirt the head of another valley running north and growing fine wheat crops. People from the villages lower down the valley had encamped up here, and were harvesting the crops. This hilly country of rich soil and numerous streams extends almost the whole way to Sakiz. Wheat and barley are the chief crops. Cotton, castor oil, hemp, and bajra also grown. Sunflowers are grown in small patches by the villages, the seeds being roasted and eaten. The snow lies deep in winter, and, unless the drifts are well trodden by caravans, the roads become impassable. At 8 miles cross a low ridge (5,905') and open up a wide flat valley running 137°, 2 to 3 miles wide, draining towards the north-east, bounded by hare rounded hills. The hills to the north-west are higher and rocky near the summit, there are several small streams, dry for the most part now, the water being led over the adjacent crops in small irrigation channels. A few karez weie noticed; but, as a rule, the water from streams or spring's was sufficient. ^ Burhan.—W, 15| miles passed through Burhan (5,655'), a large village on the side of a ravine with a small stream. On either side extends an open cultivated plain, some 6 to 8 miles wide here. ^ By the stream is a large fruit orchard, the property of the governor of Suj-Bulak. The size of a stream is measured by the number of mills it is capable of turning. It is either a ct two stone ” stream or a “three stone 3&gt; stream, accord ing to the number of mills turned. The road continues along the plain going south-east, and at 19 miles we passed Sakendi, and at 26 miles halted in Karakend (4,510'), a village of 150 houses on the banks of a small stream, and surrounded by a fruit orchard. Drinking-water is from a huge spring close by. The general level of this country is from 4,500' to 5,000' above sea level, ttie hills rising to 6,000' or 6,500'. The temperature at noon today and the glare in such a treeless country were trying, but the nights were cool (temperature 57°) with a heavy dew. 3rd August.—General direction, S.E. A party of the Kurds from this village came some distance with us. They had a small band of drums and pipes, and later on showed me some coursing with greyhounds and hawking partridges. o 0 j &amp; They were a very hospitable set, well mounted, armed for the most part p A, . M artini-Peabody rifles. Altogether about 50 mounted men turned out ot this little village alone.223 The stage today is very similar to yesterday, being along a valley bounded by undulating rounded hills, cultivated with wheat, barley, castor oil, and cotton. Water is from springs in the hillsides or karez; the streams drain to the eastward into the Tatavi river which flows into Urmia lake. There are two roads to Sakiz, both equally good, one taking a lower level than this, and more to the eastward. The upper one is used in summer, and is usually blocked by snow drifts in winter. The border hills are bare of trees, but contain good soil, and patches of wheat grew without irrigation some distance up the slopes. Akhtatar .—At 3 miles pass the large Kurdish village of Akhtatar, | miles to the east. At 9 miles we reached the valley of the Tatavi river, and forded it near the small village of Kasalian (4,620'). The river flows in a gravelly bed 200 to 300 yards wide, with only a small stream 30 feet wide and 6 inches deep now with scarcely any current, the rest of the water being led away into the irrigation cuts. The river valley is 3 to 4 miles wide and extends some distance to the west, where the river rises among some steep hills south-east of Lahijan. The country towards the Lesser Zab valley is a series of steep hills, enclosing narrow stream valleys. Bugdabasi .—At 2 miles up stream is Bugdabasi, a village near a mound, on which is a half ruined mud fort. Down stream the river flows north-east, bounded by bare rounded hills less steep, however, than those to the west. Our road continues south-east, and gradually trends away from the Tatavi valley, following a small stream valley, which gets narrower as we ascend. Tera .—At 16£ miles, at the head of the valley, pass the large village of Tera, surrounded by some orchards and groves of poplars by the stream. At 18| miles reached the head of the valley, and crossed a rounded ridge at 5,560 feet. There are numerous springs and swampy bits of ground, and the soil is a rich loam growing luxuriant crops. From the summit open out the head of another cultivated valley, which grows wider as we descend (1 to 2 miles wide). j. • •u' u Akhan .'—At 20 miles a large valley joins ours from the north-west, in wJncU is the large village of Akhan. At 22 miles the road leaves the valley and trends east undulating some low rounded spurs, and at 27 miles the town of Sakiz was reac ed (5 050'). ,, People were met digging up thistle roots and low shrubs like “ gavvan or gum tragacanth, and carrying them on donkeys to Sakiz to be used as fire-wood. The whole route from Suj-Bulak, excepting a short steep bit already mentioned near there, is a broad clay track, easily practicable for artillery. There is an abundant water-supply even at this season, and the whole district, especially the valleys of the Tatavi and Jaghatu rivers to the east, form a fine granary, yielding wheat, barley, cattle and shetp in consi eia e quantities for the support of an army.SAKIZ. Sakiz is situated on some low spurs of a steep range of hills which rises immediately to the north-west. It overlooks the left bank of a small river, the Sakiz Chai a tributary of the Jaghatu. It is a place of nearly 1,500 houses, and is somewhat smaller than Suj-Bulak (one estimate gave only 1,000). The inhabitants are Kurds, with about 80 houses of Jews. The houses are built for the most part of sundried bricks, resting on a lower foundation of stones and mud. The bazar is a very poor, straggling place : raisins, dried fruits, curdled milk, and the usual Kurdish articles of equipment were for sale. Pack saddles, saddles, &amp;c., were obtainable also. Persian is more understood here, and Turkish is less spoken as we get further south. Kermanji is the language of the common people. The governor’s house is a dilapidated building on a knoll in the town. The governor had only a week previously arrived from Tehran to take up his appointment. He received me in the most hospitable manner, and posted a guard of 20 men at my tent. These were Kurds from the surrounding dis tricts, and were strong built, very willing fellows. They were without uniforms, but were armed with JVerndls, and carried some 30 rounds slung in a bandolier. Sakiz is situated at the junction of two wide valleys, coming down 85° and 255° respectively; both were cultivated and dotted with villages. They are from 3 to 4 miles wide, bounded by rounded hills. Millet, tobacco, cotton and sesame are also grown. The water-supply is from the Sakiz-Chai, and some streams behind the town which are led through the streets in small channels. There is very little water in the river now, most being used for irrigation. It flows in a direction 50° down a narrow valley bordered by steep hills. The hillsides are quite bare of trees, but the river valley had a thick green fringe of fruit orchards. Firewood is scarce. Cowdung cakes (tezik) used chiefly. Routes from Sakiz. Several caravan roads lead through here. Mules and yabus are the pack animals and no camels can be used in this district. Carts were last seen in the Sulduz plain. Strings of mules brought loads of chopped straw into Sakiz from the surrounding districts. The straw is carried in large nets slung on each side of the animal. Donkeys are largely used by the villagers carrying firewood, &amp;c. . Route to Sainkala and Tabriz .—The principal road to Tabriz lies through Sainkala, Miandab, and Binab to Tabriz. To Sainkala is two days by caravan. The stages are—- (1) Tekan Tapa, (2) Sainkala, and the total distance is about 40 miles. This is said to be an easy road crossing a country similar to that from Suj-Bulak here. From Sainkala tp Tabriz the main route is joined and is an easy road throughout.

From Karmanshah to Tabriz, via Bi jar, Sainkala, andBinab, is 342^ miles [Routes in Persia, No. 372). Route to Bijar and Hamadan .—There are two routes from Sakiz to Bijar, both used by caravans. The stages on the more northerly are— (1) Karanan. . (3) Khosh Makhan. (2) Tikan Tappa. | (4) Kara Bulak. (•') Bijar. The total distance is about 95 miles by this route. Onjhe southern or more direct route the stages are—- (1) Zahub. l (3) Ustnan. (2) Mirza Mirashah. j (4) Derband. (5) Bijar. The total distance by this route is 75 miles. Both these® are said to be easy roads through fertile country. From Bijar on to Hamadan is four stages : (1) Babransban. 1 (3) Kul Tappa. (2) Kbokhurt. &gt; (4) Hamadan. The total distance being 90 miles. This makes from Sakiz to Hamadan by the shortest way to be 165 miles. Muleteers said the whole of the route to Hamadan was through an easy undulating country containing plenty of water and supplies. Route to Zinjan .—The stages on this route are— (1) Karanan. (2) Tikhan Tappa. (3) Kbosb Makban. (4) Yengbi Kban. (5) Khain. ( 6 ) Zinjan. The total distance is about 130 miles. From Zindjan to Tehran is 205 miles [Routes in Persia, No. 395), making the distance from Sakiz to Tehran to be 335 miles. This would be almost the most direct line joining the two places. A large caravan of 150 mules and yabus were starting by this route to Zindjan with wool. The Jaghatu river was said to be the principal difficulty in winter and spring. It has then to be forded. In summer it is occasionally quite dry, all the water being used for irrigation. VOL. i. % G226 Route to Banah and Sulaimaniah .—The principal caravan road to Stilai- maniah is through Banah. It is two stages, the intermediate one being Miradeh (17 miles), and the total distance is 41 miles. The first stage is an easy road by the valley of the Sahiz Chai, but the second, a steep pass, has to be crossed, and the road is hilly and bad. A caravan was starting to Banah with loads of general goods. From Banali to Sulaimaniah is a very rough mountainous road, the stages being—• (1) Serambal (2) Panj win (3) Mama Kulan (4) Sulaimaniah Miles. 13 21 27 21 Route No. XVI.—Sakizto Sihna.

There are two roads to Sihna, the principal one, most used by caravans, makes an eastward bend, skirting the foot of the Chahil Chashmah range. The other, which we take, is a direct line between the two places, passing over the eastern spurs of the same range. The stages by the former route are— (1) Telaku. I (3) Baklabad. (2) Divandereh. I ( 4 ) Sihna. Each stage was given as 6 farsakhs; total 24 farsakhs, or nearly 80 miles. A\ e left Sakiz (5,080 ), and crossed the Sakiz Chai, ascending a broad easy track towards the low hills bounding the valley to the south. At 3| miles reach the top of the ridge (5,830'), and continue along the neck between two deep narrow valleys ; one to the west draining into the Sakiz Chai, and another to the east into the Jaghatu Chai. the road winds along these rounded hills, with deep narrow valleys on either side for about 8 miles.

Caravans and single horseman manage to get through at all seasons. wrtli-Mst h | he river is toff only t In most m Ikm.—i hjjrml lithafruit c firewood: Supplies i I iphcots and 0 “Karnocli viH carrot 0 l tbughout K It grows a here are i 1 ‘'Loch,” fitter, , bmperatu. sultry. he lower tobacco wate track f md amThese valleys are well cultivated with crops in small patches wherever water can be got from one of the small streams. Wheat, barley, millet, sesame, tobacco and cotton, principally the latter, grows from 4 to 6 inches high only, and seeming to be a smaller variety than that grown in India. . Several small streams were passed, fed by numerous springs in the hillsides. In some cases earthbanks were drawn across the stream bed, forming ponds for watering cattle. Jaghatu River. At 13 miles descend into the valley of the Jaghatu river near the small village of Shaikh. , . . The river flows down 60° in a narrow valley (5,065 ) bordered by high steep hills and empties itself into Lake Urmia. # Berdazer. —The valley here is from 3 to 4 miles wide. In a loop to the north-west is the large village of Berdazer. The river in spring occupies in a gravelly bed 200 to 300 yards wide, but is now only 30 feet wide and a few inches deep, and an occasional deep pool. In most maps the upper waters of the Jaghatu have been incorrectly drawn. The streams draining the northern slopes of the Chahil Chashmah lange have been shown as the upper waters of the Khurkhura river, while they are actually the sources of the Jaghatu. The Khurkhura rises in the east side of the range and the Jaghatu on the north-west slopes. Musra .—At 15 miles we passed the large village of Musra, 4 mile from the left'bank. From here our path gradually leaves the river valley, turning up a side valley by a small stream. Renqrazal. —At 17 miles halted in Rengrazal (o,470 ), a small village, with a fruit orchard and vineyard. Water-supply abundant from a large SP11 Fiiewood is scarce, cowdung cakes being principally used, and occasionally branches of fruit trees, stalks of large thistles, and “ gavvan.” Supplies are fairly abundant in this district. Melons, cucumbers, pears, apricots and onions were obtainable. , 1 . 1-1 41 “ Karnoch ” or “ kammagh,” a species of umbelliferous plant, like the wild carrot or fennel, grows extensively about these hills, and generally throughout Kurdistan. It is dried as winter fodder for cattle, and was being cut now. It grows at an elevation of about 6,000 feet and over. There are four descriptions of the plant— (1) The “ karnoch, ” like the wild carrot. | (31 Hahz, like fennel somewhat. * (2) “ Loch ” * Bannah or manneh. Besides these, hay is cut along the stream banks, and stacked for the ^Temperature 85° at noon and 87° at 4 p.m., when it clouded over and became sultry. Morning temperature 67°, with bracing air. 6th August —General direction, S. Left the village (5,170 ), an , a ter descending a short way, turned up a narrow valley with steep border bills. ^ The lower part of these valleys is cultivated in small patches of wheat, cotton, tobacco and millet. Several small springs in the hillsides gave a to ood SUP The 0 tr^k follows a narrow col or ridge having deep narrow valleys on either hand and is fairly easy for mules with some steep gia ie .1 s. 2 g 2ns Kalnkadjar Dagh .—At \\ miles reach the summit of a spur (G^SSO'), from which is a good view to the west of the Kalakadjar Dagh, bearing 248° with the summit streaked with snow. The range overlooks Banah. Follow a stony road with some steep ascents and descents in and out of the deep valleys. The rock was granite and limestone chiefly, with occasional patches of black volcanic trachyte. Makhan Safasur .—Pass over a rounded ridge (7,385'), and at 10 miles reached a grassy plateau called Makhan Safasur (7,745'), at the base of a high rounded hill to the west. A Persian force was camped here operating from Hamadan and Karmanshah against some nomad Jaf tribes who had wandered over the frontier, and who w r ere ordered to be driven back again. There were 600 infantry and 200 cavalry, with two 6-pr. smooth-bore field guns. The guns had six horses, and were dragged up and down these hills for the most part by hand. They said they had no difficulty in getting them along. We were received a mile from the camp by an “ istikbal ” of 50 cavalry and 50 infantry, and had breakfast with Aga Dervish, Sirhang, in command of the troops, and his officers. The men were armed, some with Werndls, some with Chassepots, and some with Turkish Martini-Peabodys, and lived in bell tents. The camp was arranged according to no plan, and was in a very dirty condition. Water-supply was from a large spring close by. Good green grass was obtainable for the horses from the hillsides round. There seemed none of what might be called military discipline. The usual polite forms of etiquette was all that was noticed. The men had no regular uniform, except some with a blue cotton frock, and the officers wore the long black frock coat buttoned up to the throat, the usual Persian dress. Snow had only disappeared from here about a month ago, and this route is impassable in winter to caravans. The Jafs number 6,000 tents. The villagers in this district are peaceful cultivators, and these Jafs had so pillaged their villages that this force was sent from Harnadan to drive them bafck into Turkey. The villagers now com plain that they are in a worse case than before, as they have to supply the Persian troops with provisions free; and the Jafs continue their depredations as before, having moved only a short way towards the frontier. The Jafs have for the last five years made this their summer quarters, retiring for the winter to the districts along the Diala, south-east of Kifri, and round Sulaimaniah (q. v.). The Persian commander takes money from the chiefs of the Jafs, and allows them to remain here, while at the same time he reports to Hamadan that he has annihilated and driven them across the border. Ehurkhura River. We descended steeply from the camp,’ crossing a narrow valley running down 28° (6,910'), and at 18 miles forded the Khurkhura (5,620') in a narrow winding valley, the stream being now 30 yards wide and only a few inches deep. To the north-east is a succession of bare brown undulating hills. To- the west the hills rise steeper and become more rocky. There are numerous springs in the hillside and a few shrubs by the river bank. Mulanabad .—Ascend steeply out of the river valley, and at 19 miles halt in the small village of Mulanabad (6,020'). The river makes a sweep of 2 to 3 miles to the west.Supplies in small quantities only were procurable, and the inhabitants arc poor and wretched. Caravans do not as a rule use this road, but take that to the eastward through Divandereh. 7th August.—General direction, S.S.E. Left the village, crossing some low spurs from a high-rounded ridge to the eastward, and descended again into the Khurkhura valley (6,850'). Kuh-i-Chahil Chashmah .—Bearing south, and some 8 miles distant is a lofty mass of mountains, extending west to the Turkish frontier, called the Kuh-i- Chahil Chashmah, or “ the Mountain of the Forty Springs/'’ from the number of springs and streams that take their rise there. The higher peaks are still streaked with snow. We follow the river valley, and skirt the east side of the range, from which several small tributaries join to swell the stream. The valley is from 50 to 100 yards wide, bounded by steep bare hills. The road is an easy track, following the right bank, fording the stream several times. Takia .—At 11§ miles pass Takia, a small village surrounded by a grove of poplars and willows. A short way beyond Takia our road turned aside from the main valley, and ascended a side valley running south-east. At 14 miles reach a narrow neck (elevation 7,570'), and commence des cending another small valley by a 3 feet mule track in a clay slope. At 16§ miles we reached the foot of the slope, and turned up the Khurkhura valley again near Tawikalau (7,240'). Shalikala. At 18 miles our track turns south, leaving the stream, and crosses a rounded clay spur to Shahkala (21 miles), a small village on a stream, in a small valley shut in by steep rounded hills (0,865'). Numerous tracks lead over these hills from one village to another. These villagers are “ Rayah ^ Kurds of the Goran tribe. The Shaikh of this village was known as an eminently good man, who allowed no traveller or stranger, however poor, to pass by without entertain ing him. They complain a great deal of the depredations of the Jafs, and say they are unable to store any wheat, and if a famine came, they are certain to suffer terribly. Last year there was a partial famine owing to the depredations of a small worm called “ sin,^ which eats the inside of the grain. Wheat, tobacco, millet, sesame and gram are grown about here. A few poplars and gardens of melons, cucumbers and vegetables grew by stream bank. Kermanji and a little Persian are spoken. The weather clouded over today, and was sultry towards evening. The temperature perceptibly increases as we travel south, temperature 88 at noon, and 69° at 6 a.m. 8th August— General direction, S.S E. Left the village, striking south east, over some low rocky hills, and then south-west, skirting the foot of a high range with a rocky summit 2 rciile to the south, with open undulating country 3 miles to the north. A high peak, a part of the Chahil Chashmah range, bears 275° from here. At 4 miles, after crossing a succession of clay spurs (7,380') from the ridge to the left, we entered a narrow valley with a large stream from the Darragawan pass. The path is rough and bad^ ascending steeply among boulders and large loose stones in the stream bed.2 50 valley widens 3 miles to the the Kuh-i-Musjid Mirza, with To the east the hills become By removing 1 the loose stones and a few boulders, a good track could be formed. At 6^ miles the road improves, and the west. In a direction 245° is a peak called a jagged rocky summit streaked with snow, more rounded and lower. The tall rank grass by the stream was being cut by the villagers for winter fodder. Darragawan Pass .—At miles reach a rounded col at the summit of the Darragawan Pass (B^rO'). The principal mass of the Chahil Chashmah bears 2thS°, and the summits are from 10,000 to 10,500 feet above sea level. Descend steeply following a narrow stony ravine, and at 11^ miles pass through Coar (TjlOO'), surrounded by a few poplars and a vineyard. Shortly after emerged on a wide undulating plain, through which flow several small streams in an easterly direction. Kosuma .—At 16 miles reached a small grassy plateau called Kosuma (T/lbS'), on which was a small camp of Kurds grazing their flocks. Extending 10 miles to the east is the same undulating country, watered by several streams, which unite to form the upper waters of the Kizil Uzen, which discharges itself into the Caspian. In the Chahil Chashmah range several important rivers rise, viz., Jaghatu, Khurkhura, Kizil Uzen, large tributaries of the Diala and Lesser Zab and it is the highest knot of hills at this part of the frontier. Ghimzil .—Bearing 64°, and 11 miles off on a low range of hills is Ghizmil, a village of 500 houses of Gerou Kurds. Bearing 113°, 125°, and 147° respectively were three isolated conical peaks in the low range bordering the plain behind the village. Bearing 30° was the most eastern of the spurs of the Chahil Chashmah, which then died away in some low hills. Bearing 287° was a conical peak of the Kuh-i-Chahil Chashmah streaked Verandah. A B C G D A plan of the typical Kurdish tent is shown here, and gives an idea of what the interior of the black blanket tents of these nomads is like. At one end is the diwankhana or verandah spread with rugs and carpets and meant to receive visitors, &amp;c. A is the women’s apartment, B is for the children, C is the kitchen with the oven dug in the ground, churn, fireplace, &amp;c. D was occupied by the Shaikh’s son and his family. E was occupied by eight calves and three lambs, too young to be sent out grazing. E is a manger and trough of mud, where the horses stood. G is where guns, saddles, &amp;c.,are placed. These sections inside the tent are partitioned off by strips of reed matting woven with patterns in coloured worsteds. Kermanji is the only language here, but is quite a different dialect from that spoken by the Hartoshi and other Kurds farther north. Good grazing is found by the small springs and streams. 9th. August.—General direction, S.S.E. Left camp (7,155'), and started south-east over an undulating country, following a small stream, and at 9f miles passed Eiraba (7,090 ), where we left the valley and ascended a flat spur Door.231 by a broad easy track. Small donkey caravans were met collecting &lt;e gavvan ” for firewood. The road descends along the side of a rounded spur, with a well cultivated valley to the east. Wheat, barley, cotton, and castor oil were the principal crops, irrigated by the numerous springs from the hillsides. Duisah. —At 204 miles passed through Daisah (5,760'), where a road from Sulaimaniah through Panjwin joins in from the west {see Colonel Gerard’s Kurdistan). , . Duisah is on the edge of a stream flowing east towards the Kizil Uzen, and the valley is filled with orchards and vineyards. In the direction of Hamadan are some high rounded ridges. The country from here to Sihna contains a rich soil, the upper slopes grow ing cereals, and the valleys fruits and grapes. From Duisah a succession of &amp; deep valleys and low ridges and an open hilly country is crossed, until, at 32 miles, Sihna is reached (5,09(y). This route from Sakiz is difficult for guns owing to the many deep ravines, with steep ascents and descents, to be gone over. There is an easier route making a detour to the east through Divandereh, which would be easier for troops. Our road would be of little use except as an alternative route for pack transport and for bringing in forage and supplies from the district through which it passes. The road is closed by snow during the winter for four months from the middle of December to the middle of April, and in the more severe seasons for longer,—for five or six months. 1M iff SIHNA. This is a town of 5,000 houses and some 25,000 inhabitants, sunk in a basin about 5 miles diameter, shut in by steep rounded hills, and overlookino- the valley of a stream, which forms the upper waters of the Ab-i-Sirwan or Diala river. The surroundiug hills so enclose it that it is shut out from view until quite close. It is a flourishing place and the houses are built of sundried bricks, for the most part with some larger ones of burnt brick. There are 300 houses of Jews and SO of Papal Chaldeans under a Bishop appointed from Mosul. A Roman Catholic Mission has flourished here for some time conducted by priests from Mosul. J The governor at present is Farhand Mirza, a cousin of the Shah, who has considerable influence in the district, and suppresses lawlessness well. A Turkish Consul resides here also. The governor's palace is a fine building, situated on a knoll overlooking the town, Two regiments are quartered here with foui guns, numbering about 800 men. The barracks are on some risiuo' ground to the north-west of the town. Ihe water-supply is from springs and karezes in the valley above the town. . re place is surrounded by gardens and orchards, irrigated by numerous canals, an glowing pear, apricot, plum, peach, apple and cherry trees abundantly, -the streets are narrow and winding, paved with rough stones, but the bazar is a well supplied one._ The carpets here are considered to be the best in West 1 ersia, and are the principal local product. They are exported through Kar- manshah to Baghdad, and thence to England. Wool, gum tragacanth, and gall nuts are collected from the mountainous districts to the west. . both for riding and pack animals, Kurdish felt caps, various des criptions of dried fruits and raisins, curdled milk, shoes and belts made in embroidered coloured leather work were also among the articles in the bazar, l^rom the numbers seen, this would be an excellent place for collecting both riding horses and pack animals. flhe officials talk Persian here, but the language of the common people is Jvermanji. they are Sunis like the majority of Kurds. There are two pretty mosques at the west end of the town; one built over a large spring. The altitude above sea level varies from 5,100 to 5,300 feet, and the Climate. climate is a very good one, and the district healthy. It is looked upon as a sort of sanitarium from Baghdad, and people come here to spend the summer. L T1 J e of the day was found hot, but not oppressive, the noon temper- auure being 92 . The nights were very cool, and the morning from 55° to 60°. Routes from Sihna. Several caravan routes converge on this point, the principal being the follows Xs* 0 ^ al ° ng WhlCil ^ P ° St h ° rSeS £ ° r travellers * Tlie telegraph Route to .ZZhwzatfow,—-The stages are— (1) Dehgulan. ( 2 ) Kurbah. (3) Hamakasi. (4) Hamadan. Each stage is said to be 6 farsakhs, and the total distance is 90 miles.This is the usual time taken by caravans. Another account gives three stages by post horses, the first half being among some Kurds at Chibukli; the second being at the village of Kamkas, and the third day is 6 farsakhs across a level plain in a south-east direction into Hamadan. The road is easy for pack animals, and the Hamadan plain is not less than 6,000 feet above sea level. The entire country is a succession of very high rounded ranges, the summits of two of which are 6,500 and 6,500 feet respectively. There are two main trade routes from Hamadan to Urmia—one through Sihna, Sakiz and Suj-Bulak, and another through Bijar, Sainkala and Salmas. Caravans take from 15 to 18 days from Hamadan to Urmia by either of them. From Karmanshah to Urmia by the route through Sihna, Sakiz, Suj-Bulak and Salmas they would take about 18 days also. Between Sihna and Urmia, Sakiz and Suj-Bulak, are the only towns of importance, and these are no more than large villages. All the other places are clusters of flat-roofed huts, inhabited in common by human beings, sheep and cattle. There is no post north of Sihna. Route to Sulaimaniah .—The caravan route to Sulaimaniah is through Panjwin, a large village on the Turkish frontier {see Sulaimaniah). Route to Zohab .—This is a rough hilly road, following the Karmanshah road for first stage {see Route XV II), and then turning west through Juanro to Zohab {see Zohab). This road is only practicable for pack animals, and could scarcely be used for troops and guns. The best line for wheeled transport to reach Sihna from Zohab and Baghdad would be through Karind, Harunabad and Karmanshah {see Routes I if and IV). Route No. XVII —Sihna to Karmanshali. Stages.

Left the town (5,090), winding through vineyards and orchards, and commenced a gradual descent over some low spurs from the range to the north-west towards the valley of the Sirwan. The valley is from 4 to 5 miles wide, bounded on the south by a steep range, with rocky summit, called the Kuh-i-Lailagh. Seveial small villages are scattered about the valley, each surrounded by a few poplais and a vineyard or orchard. . . , , Karadia .—At 2| miles passed Karadia, surrounded by an irrigated patch of wheat, barley, and melon crops. _ . Ab-i-Sirwan.— At 4 miles forded the Sirwan river, here called the Kukma, a rapid stream in a gravelly bed 150 to 200 yards wide (4,725 ). It is now only 20 yards wide and 8 inches deep, the water being led away into large irrigation canals. 2 H VOL. i.234 The road is a broad easy track, and follows the left bank of the river trending south-west. A good deal of rice is grown in the low-lying bends of the river. At miles the actual river valley was about | mile wide. On the right bank are a succession of steep rounded ridges, and on the left broad terraces, one above the other, which increase the width to 2 or 3 miles. At 12 miles (4,580') the road turns south, ascending a broad rounded spur from the east and leaving the river valley which goes on south-west, and 3 miles from here disappears in a narrow gorge, bounded by steep rounded hills and is at once lost to sight. Previous to entering the gorge, it is joined on the left bank by a large stream called the Gavvara river (in some maps the Gaveh Rud). The principal road keeps in the valley of the Sirwan until it joins the Gavvara, and then turns south up the valley of the latter. Our track takes a shorter cut, crossing some rounded spurs (5,000') from a high bare range to the east, and at 19j miles we camped at the mouth of a ravine, a mile up which is the village of Zamiran (5,060'). Shaikh Haji Muhammad, a man with considerable religious influence among the Sihna Kurds, lives here. A few oaks grow at the entrance of the ravine, and a stream fed by several springs out of the hillside flows down it, bordered by willow and ash. A small vineyard and orchard surround the village. The first stage of this route is usually made to Kurugh, or Choruk, a village in the valley below this by the river bank. Rearing 223° to 245°, on the other side of the Gavarra valley is a high range with a rounded summit called the Kuh-i-Udahlan with good grass along the summit, on which a few patches of snow were still visible (elevation 8,000' to 9,000'). A deep gap in the range occurs, and from 275° to 300° is another high range, distant 15 or 20 miles. 12th August-General direction, S.S.E. Left camp at 5-40 a.m. to avoid the noonday heat, and descended steeply into the Gavvara valley, which we reached after 1§ miles. The valley is about j mile wide, the stream winding from one side to the other. The banks are lined with wild vines, briars, and low shrubs. We forded the river at miles (4,500') and followed an easy mule track, with some narrow portions, where spurs from the hills abut on the water’s edge. A road fit to take guns could be improvised without much trouble. At /j miles passed the mouth of a narrow valley, up which leads a track to J uanro and Zohab. It leads through Yeminan, a village miles up the valley; and Juanro can be reached in one long stage of 8 hours. The first four hours are a hilly, &gt;ad xoad, crossing the southern spurs of the Kuh-i-Udaklan; the remainder is said to be easier. At llj miles the course of the Gavvara changes south-east, coming from a narrow rocky gorge. Our route turns up a side valley in a direction 215° with high rounded hills rising steeply on either side. Kuldscra. At 17 miles the village of Haltushan is passed, and the valley widens. A valley, 1 to 2 miles broad and 8 miles long, runs up 314° from here, at the head of which is the village of Kulasera. A path luns over the rounded hills at the head of this valley to Juanro, one day distant. Several springs were passed at the foot of the hills. amiran. At 191 miles, after a long gradual ascent, we reached a rounded neck, the highest point on this route, called Mil-i-Merwara pas235 (6,510'), and commenced a gradual descent by a small stream valley until, at 26i miles, the large village of Kamiran is reached, where we halted (5,195'). The village stands on the edge of a level plain trending south-east for some 20 miles, bounded by steep rocky ranges, and north-west into a circular basin some 5 miles diameter. A few patches of cultivation were seen, but only a fraction of the cultur- able soil is utilized. Six small villages could bo counted on the plain. Noon temperature 93°, 4 a.m. 61°. 13th August—-General direction, S. Left Kamiran, and struck across the plain, going south. At 7 miles enter a gap | mile wide in the hills called the Tang-i-Kalashakani (4,815'). Through it flows the Rahzabar stream, rising in the south-east end of the Kamiran plain, and joining the Kara Su north of Karmanshah. The stream is nearly dry now, but in spring is difficult to ford, the bed being full of quicksands. The road is a broad level one, and at 10 miles it turns sharp round the west end of the ridge marking the southern limit of the pass. This ridge has a rough jagged summit, with scarcely any vegetation, and rises 3,000 to 4,000 feet nearly vertically above us. To the south is a plain 2 to 3 miles wide, forming a continuation of the Karmanshah plain. It is only partially cultivated, although the soil is very fertile. Our road skirts the north side of it, and another track, equally good, keeps to the south. The villages are small clusters of wretched mud huts, and at this season the villagers leave the houses for booths of branches erected close by. Kala Yawan. —At 14g miles pass Kala Yawan, a small village with a ruined fort on a knoll close by a large spring coming out of the base of the hills. From the village our road strikes south-east across the plain, and at N 2 miles again reach the Rahzabar stream, which has skirted the south side of the plain. „ , , „ . , Kaklassan. —At 234 miles, after following the left bank, forded the stream Kaklassan, and halted there (4,720'). _ oe -i i Bearing 2H6° runs a grassy valley, 3 to 4 miles wide, some ~5 miles long. Bearing 308° is a rocky peak of a rounded ridge called the Kuh-i-Khurrin, rising some 3,000 feet out of the plain (7,700 above sea le\el).^ From 50 v to 108° extends the highest portion of the Kuh-i-Baluch. Itie summit is a long serrated ridge composed of enormous pinnacles of bare rock terraced one above the other. . , Fires for burning the gum tragacanth were dotted all about its slopes. Bearing 120°, and some 25 miles distant is a rocky peak covered with snow called the Kuh-i-Paru. This overlooks Bisitun on the Karmaushah-Hamadan '^Bearing 1341° is the extremity of a rocky ridge jutting out into the plain north of Karmanshah, a continuation of the Kuh-i-Paiu. Bearing 260°, and 7 miles distant, is a small tomb called the Imam-i- Wais-i-Nasar on a line of low rounded hills. It forms a very good landmaik The weather was sultry and oppressive at midday, the temperature be 0 97° and at 2 f.m. 101°, with a hot dusty wind. After midnight it became cool, and at 3-30 a.m. the temperature was only 14th August—General direction, S.E. Left Kaklassan, and continued along a broad, well defined track going south-south-east. _ , -i At 3^ miles pass close under the south-east end of an isolated rocky 11 g , miles long, which rises abruptly out of the plain. 2 h 2236 m Kaeasu.— At 1H miles forded the Kara-Su, here 40 yards wide and 2 feet deep, between steep clay banks, 15' to 20' high. In spring this ford is not practicable, and to reach Karmanshah a wide detour has to be made to the south-east to the bridge on the Tehran road. The plain is dotted with a few small villages, and is only partially cul tivated. The wheat and barley crop have just been harvested. K af mai At 18! miles reach Karmanshah, and, after threading our way through the { r j c t andi narrow crowded streets, put up in the hospitable house of Muhammad Agha ; festPe rs1 Hassan, the British Agent. which form The description of the journey to Kut-^l-Amara on the Tigris, where we j oWSi finished our journey, has been embodied in Route II, as the district travelled j s a ‘ through is similar to Route I.

Karmanshah (4,760') occupies the centre of a fertile grain-producing dis trict, and is a point of convergence for tlie principal trade routes entering West Persia and is situated at the foot of some spurs from a low range of hills which forms the southern boundary of the plain through which the Kara-Su flows. _ . , . It is a town of 6,500 houses, and contains 40,000 inhabitants, all or them Kurds and Persians of the Shiah Muhammadan faith, a mixed lot of no par ticular tribe, with about 300 Jews and a few families of Baghdad Christians. There are some fine buildings in the town, most of them in a state of decay from disrepair. Muhammad Agha Hassan, the British Agent, is the principal citizen, and is a man of considerable wealth and influence in the surrounding district. Out of‘200 villages in this district, he is said to own 100, and is constantly adding to his property. His universal probity and honesty make him much respected. Pie has a special house set apart to entertain European travellers on passing through. He is a British subject, and consequently the Persian Government has no power to squeeze any of his riches, as they invariably do any of their own subjects who make any parade of their wealth. He has made several improvements in the town, opening out one very crowded portion of the town into a public square, and building and repairing several caravanserais. There are six in the town, all of which he owns. ^ Her Majesty had a month previous to my arrival conferred on him the C. M. G., of which he was very proud. The illumination of the town and the rejoicings which took place under his auspices on the occasion of the celebration of Her Majesty’s Jubilee last year were remembered as being the finest display for many years in Karmaushah. The town was once surrounded by a mud wall, now in ruins and entirely thrown down in several places. It is oblong in shape 1| miles by 1 mile, and at the north-west extremity is the governor’s palace and garden, a fine building, lately repaired, but still rather delapidated. The Telegraph office is on the line from Tihran to Baghdad and is situ ated overlooking the central square called the Maidan-i-Nua. In the centre of the town on a knoll is the Arsenal, an enclosed building, well kept and in a good state of repair. A new artillery commandant had arrived a few months ago from Tihran and had put things in very good order. r l here are 500 rifles, all of them Austrian Werndls, in store and about 1,500 rounds of rifled and smooth-bore ammunition for the field guns. There were two 12-pr. Austrian Krupp guns kept in a shed adjoining the public square, and also two 6-pr. bronze smooth-bore field guns.^ There are some 500 men quartered here ', their uniform is a blue tunic with red facings, and they are armed with smooth-bore, percussion muskets of a very ancient pattern. Four regiments could be raised among the neigh bouring Kurdish tribes, but they are not now embodied. The Governor is the Hisam-ul-Mulk, a Persian official from Tihran, notable chiefly for the extreme cruelty with which he administers the law. I attended a reception which he held in the courtyard of the Arsenal and where two bands were in attendance.23S A constant stream of pilgrims passes through Karmanshah, some of them Shiahs, on their way to Kerbala and Nedjef, and others going north to the shrine at Meshed. The bazars are arched over with brick, like Baghdad, but the streets are only 8' to 10' wide and very crowded. The shops are well supplied with English goods brought from Baghdad chiefly Manchester cottons and cloth, brass and iron work, sugar from Marseilles! There is no special local manufacture except it be silver filagree work and carpets ; most of the latter now come in from Sihna. Riding and pack saddles repairs for saddlery, &amp;c., required by the numerous caravans which pass throuo•h , can be obtained here. The districts round Karmanshah, more especially to the south and in the Pusht-i-Kuh, is a fine breeding ground for mules, and it would be an import ant centre to collect yabu, mule and donkey transport for troops. The donkey is a small black variety, not as a rule used in caravans goin^ long distances, but every villager has one, and they would be invaluable for collecting supplies from the outlying districts, &amp;c. Mr. E. F. Law, Commercial Attache of the Embassy at Constantinople, Persian trade. has been making a four months’ tour in Persia, and haa collected some important observations on the position and prospects of British trade in the country. M ith regard to cotton goods, it is quite clear, he says, from an examination of the bazars, that England continues easily to hold the first place. English prints beat all competition at Ispahan and Tabriz. At the latter place Russian prints have been introduced, but they have been fairly beaten out of the market by the greater cheapness and the extra width of the English goods. There is some Russian competition in other places, but in consequence of special advan tages as regards carriage to Southern Persia, English prints completely com mand the markets south of Ispahan. On the general subject of Russian com petition in cotton goods, England still has the advantage, even in Northern Persia as a whole, and with increased energy and attention to small details the greater part of such ground as has been lost may still be recovered.” ' In woollen goods, English manufactures are at present entirely eclipsed by Austrian competitors, but there is no reason why this should continue It has been brought about by the fact that, in the first instance, the Austrians ottered cheaper goods, of inferior quality, but better suited to the require ments of the purchaser. With regard to the extension of British trade in cotton goods, Mr. Law sug-gests that although the ordinary European com mercial traveller would be quite out of place in Persia, occasional visits should be made to the principal business towns, not for the sake of effecting sales, but of procuring information. As proof of the need of this he adds that he noticed in the bazars of Massanderan and Khorasan, a very large percentage of prints in a style of which there was no English specimen, though English manufac turers could certainly produce them quite as well and more cheaply than their Russian competitors. Karmanshah Plain.—k large portion of the fertile plain north of Karman- shah is lettuntilled, although the surrounding districts produce quantities of wheat and bailey. The wheat harvest was now being gathered. Castor oil, opium, beds of melons, cucumbers also grown on the plain. I saw the process of extracting gum from the gum tragacanth shrub on the hills on the march from Sihna. The upper part of the branches of the bush is burnt, and then the stumps snapped off. After the first day a long239 stick of grim has exuded from the broken portion. This is clear and trans parent, and is the best quality. The villagers collect this, and on the second day another portion appears of a brownish colour, not so valuable; on the third day another stick is gathered of a poorer quality, and after that the shrub is allowed to sprout again. .... , To the south of the town is a stream from a large spring which comes down a ravine, and is used to supply the town with water. The Water-supply of slopes are lined with fruit gardens irrigated from the stream, town. Some fine walnut, mulberry, chenar, and poplar trees are grown. Grapes, pears, apples, peaches, apricots, plums, figs, and mulberries are the chief fruits. The governor has a summer palace in this valley called Dilkusha, lately purchased by Hassan Agha. . Firewood is brought in from the mountain ridges to the south, principally from the Kuh-i-Yardalan (see Route II). _ Fine descriptions of lime, like plaster of Paris (called getch), are brought in from the same district, and used for interior decorations of the houses. Handsome coloured tiles are also extensively used in decoration of the better class of Persian houses. , , , The best houses are of burnt briek, opening on an inner courtyard, through which streams of water are led and fountains play. The commoner houses are of sundried bricks or mud with doorways faced with burnt brick. Ihere are several lime and brick kilns outside the town, the fuel used being the stalks of the plain. suss” or wild liquorice plant which is found in quantities on the On the 16th August drove in Hassan Agha’s carriage to visit the rock sculptures of the Tak-i-Bostan. , • p o m ^ After going in a direction 63° across the plain for 3 miles reached the Imadiah palace on the left bank of the Kara-Su^ The river is here from 10 to 50 yards wide, 2 feet deep, and not fordable in flood. Theieis a small ferry boat which would hold two mules. It is a sluggish stream, between clay banks 15' to 20' high, and consequently of no use for irrigation purposes. Imadiak palace.—The Imadiah palace was built some 50 years ago^ by the Imad-ud-Doulab, grandson of Fathi Ali Shah. It is now unoccupied, and gradually falling into disrepair. It is a three-storied building facing the uver, and profusely decorated inside in the Persian style. On the noith side is a garden 250 yards square, enclosed by a strong brick wall 1 with two tiers of loopholes—the upper along a banquette at the top of the wa , and the lower in a sort of casemated gallery along the bottom. The walls are well built and some 6 feet thick at the bottom, and have round towers at each corner. Altogether it is an exceptionally strong place as Persian forts are constructed, and would form an important tactical position. Tak-i-Bostan. —Bearing 32° from Karmanshah, and 6 miles distant, is t e Tak-i-Bostan, remarkable chiefly for the ancient rock-cut inscriptions, which have been frequently described. . . „ir«v onrl There are some large springs, and a small riser comes gushm 0 , deal and 6old ou of thXse of^the wall of rock above it. It is led into two large tanks ptoted with trees. The adjoining plain would form a good camping-ground for troons and would be close to tbis fine watei-supply* Agh P a Hassan has recently purchased the Tak-i-Bostan and a large slice of the adjoining land, and proposes building a summer residence here Kuh-i-Paru. —Immediately north of the Tak-l-Bostan rises a sei e y steep mountain ranges composed entirely of pinnacles of limestone rock, and240 is known as the Kuh i-Paru, a continuation of the Koh-i-Baluch to the last and extends east to Bisitun. The hiudiest peak, now streaked with snow, of the Koh-i-Paru bears 51° from Karmanshah. Three kinds of bread are found in the bazar in Karmanshah and through out West Persia : “ Sunguk ” baked in strips 5 feet long, 1 foot broad, and about ^ inch thick. Men may be seen walking with a row slung over their shoulders on their way home to dinner. Another kind is called “ lubbash ” or “labash,'” which consists of very thin round cakes about 1 foot in diameter and baked crisp. Another is “taftan,” made in cakes about the same size as lubbash, but about 1 inch thick. On the 18th August I drove with Agha Hassan to see a flower garden and orchard he had laid out at Amarmel, a small village about 1| miles to the west of the Sihna road, 3 miles distant from Karmanshah. Kurdish village .—A description of this village would give a very fair idea of the status of the people in these villages. It contained 200 houses of Kurds, who were all Shiah Muhammadans. The water-supply was very good from a large “ karez ” which had been dug by A gha Hassan. The village owned 300 cattle, 350 sheep and goats, and 300 donkeys, which graze on the hillsides behind the village free, as the ground is the property of the State. For cultivation the village possesses as much ground as 60 pairs of bullocks can plough. As each can plough about 12 acres, this amounts to 720 acres, in this they sow 5 karwars (500 batmans) of wheat (•j 0 cwt.), and a small amount as well under opium, barley, and in some years'* cotton. Wheat, they say, yields fivefold. , I he value of a batman varies very much throughout the country. Here it is 6-6 lbs., but it is different in Tihran, Ispahan, and Bushahr. In Tabriz it is more than 13 lbs. A karwar (6 cwt.) of wheat these people can sell for 12 kra ns (4s.), and a karwar of barley for 15 krans (5s.) Last year the villagers gathered 45 batmans (297 lbs.) of opium, which they sold for eight tomans per batman. The kran is valued at 4&lt;/. and the toman at 6s. 5c7. i Besides crops, the village had an orchard, where they gathered apricots, pears, plums, apples, peaches; and of vegetables, they grew potatoes, a small kind of pea, onions, beans, garlic, melons, and pumpkins, with a few walnut, poplar, and ash trees. r 1 he houses are built of mud surrounded by a small enclosure common to two houses, and which serves to keep in the cattle at night. There is a single opening forming door, window, and chimney combined, and in the centre of the floor a hole which serves as the fireplace and oven. A bed of coarse felt, a primitive sort of cradle, some earthen jars, and a spinning' wheel' com- plete the furniture. Opposite the door another opening leads into the stable, where in winter the people live together with the cattle. In one room 6 yards long and 4 broad and 7 feet high were a man and his wife, their son-in-law and his wife, two children, and a pair of oxen, two don keys, and four sheep. The principal food is bread made of wheat, indian-corn, or o a soi t of a corn pounded up and baked in cakes on a curved piece of sheet iron placed over the fire. . Cucumbers, onions, and garlic are eaten with bread, and a pilau of rice occa sionally on feast days. A sheep is killed some times in the village, each family uj ing a small portion. ^ Fowls and their eggs are as a rule sold, but not eaten, oamtary arrangements in these villages there are absolutely none.241 snej .i :oo ^Kaii l i| &gt; in &amp; werlf,! . ^sists of tdj s l ; | ^ gidmi ■ miles to tlj very fair mu ousesofEurlr liicli kdtttl 300 dool-srs, i ground is tk s muck grow 12 acres, fc nans) of wk iin some yens mtry.

Most of the disease from which the town suffers is caused by absence of sanitary arrauge- Chmate. ments and pollution of the water-supply. The nights were cool, the custom being to sleep on the flat roofs of the houses. The temperature at noon and in the afternoon in the house varied from 87° to 89°. The day and night temperatures differ greatly throughout West Persia. Kurdish Tribes round Karmanshah. The following are the principal tribes round Karmanshah. Some of the larger ones have numerous subdivisions, which change from year to year. Kalhw. —These are partly nomad and partly sedentary; the nomad por tion numbers 5,000 tents, inhabiting the country east of Mendali as far as Harunabad and Mahidasht, to the north as far as Zohab, and south to the I wan plain. In winter quarters or “zerdsir” they occupy the low-lying country of Zohab and Kala Shakin plains, and from Kasr-i-Shirin to the Turkish frontier. In summer their u garmsir or summei quarters spread over the mountainous country to the north-west of the Pusht-i-Kuh portion of Luristan, and include the fertile valleys of Gilan, Zarna, Iwan, Guara, Chilla, Kifraour, Tirao, and the valley of the Gunjir river [see Route I). _ They were just arriving at their a garmsir,” and leaving Zohab plain in the end of April. There are ten subdivisions of the main tribe. They are of the Ali Allahi sect of religion, although they profess to he Muhammadans. . Their chief is Reza Ghuli Khan, who lives at Harunabad now. He is a Sartip in the Persian service. . , They furnish one regiment of infantry and some cavalry. I hey breed large numbers of mules. Where met with, these Kurds were a frank, open people, and very hospitable. . tv/tu-i i^ Sinjabi .—The Kurds number 1,500 families, and live in the Mahidasht plain to the west of Karmanshah. These are also of the Ali Allahi sect. Quran .—This is a large tribe, numbering 5,000 families, partly sedentary and partly nomad, extending all along the valley of the Upper Diala, t ie Kuh-i-Shahu and Delahu, and the mountain districts drained by the Alwand. They extend as far south as Sir-i-Pul and the Zohab plain, where they spend To the north they extend along the Turkish frontier as far as the Kuh-i- Chahil Chashmah, along the east slopes of which some villages were met with ^ Their Chief^or Sirtip is Wusain Khan, who lives in Gauwarra, some 20 miles north of Karind. They furnish a regiment of infantry. They profess to be Shiah Muhammadans also, but are said to be All A11 feS-Theseare partly nomads and partly sedentary, and number about 2,000 tents. In winter they encamp on the Bishewa plain at the of Tak-i-Girra pass, and in summer along the northern slope of Bend-i-JNua Rm and Karind valley. ... Their Sirtip, Ali Murad Khan, has a large house in Karind. . Bowanij and Jalalawand are-Kurd tribes under the Sirtip of the Kan Kurds. They number about 1,000 tents together. Bowanij valley 15 miles north of Kariud. 2 i VOL. T.Ahmedawand or Hamawancl. —There are some 200 families of this tribe scat' tered in the villages round Karmanshah [see Sulaimaniah). Sunguru and Kuliai. —These are two sedentary tribes of Kurds, numbering some 2,500 families, living in the country north of Karmanshah, along the route to Sihna, in the plains round Kamiran and Kaklassan. A large number of the Kuliai live round the head waters of the Gravvara river. Nan-i-Khali. —These are a tribe of Kurds, sedentary for the most part, who live from 3 to 7 farsakhs west of Karmanshah in the Mahidasht plain. They number some 300 houses, but are much cut up and separated into small portions. Jeiilawand. —These are a sedentary tribe of 400 houses in the direction of Bisitun, east of Karmanshah. Maji, ChubanJcera Ghazil .—These tribes are all sedentary, and number some 400 houses in the districts immediately round Karmanshah. Hululan are a large tribe of Lurs living in the mountainous districts south east of Karmanshah, along the upper waters of the Karkhah. They number about 4,000 tents. Many of the Lur tribes and subdivisions mentioned by Layard have since disappeared. Akhur. —These live to the south-east of Hassanabad and the Yardalan Kuh {see Route II), and number about 1,000 tents Routes from Karmanshali. Karmanshah is situated on the main trade route from Baghdad to Rama dan and Tihran (Routes in Persia, Nos. 384, 197, and Route III). Baghdad is 210 miles, Ramadan 103 miles, and Tihran 290 miles distant by this route. Direct to Baghdad through Mendali is 177 miles (Route I). From Karmanshah to Kut-T-Amara, and down the Karkhah valley to Dizful, is already described {see Route II). Through Hulilan is an alternative route to this joining the Chardowar valley. This is not used at all by caravans. Another route to Dizful used by caravans passing through Khorramabad is as follows : ( 1 ) Hajiabad. (2) Harsin. (3) Aulad Gobad. (4) Cavah. (5) Alisbtar. (6) Robat. (7) Kborramabad. ( 8 ) Barufta. ( 9) Ab-i-Sert. (10) Bad-i-Mak. (11) Cham-i-Walikban. (12) Cham-i-Gaz. (13) Pal-i-Zab. (14) Hussainiyeb. (15) Belarud. (16) Dizful. This is said to be a fairly easy mule track as far as Khorramabad. From there to the Kerkhah valley is rough mountainous country. There is no direct caravan route through Zangawan to Dizful. This is more because of the lawlessness of some of the tribes than any great natural difficulties {see Route II).NOTES ON TRANSPORT. Pack saddles in Baghdad are seen coming from all parts of the east for camels, mules, yabus and donkeys. Though none of them are much to look at, each is the result of perhaps several generations of actual experience in road and mountain transport. The Persian “ palan ” is the commonest sort in use for mules, and is made of two curious semi-circular pads joined to a high peak at each end. Round the edge is a broad rim of padding. This is used in Karmanshali, Sihna, and all through West Persia. Large numbers are made in Rarmanshah. tor donkeys the same pattern exactly, though a smaller size, is used. The construction is very simple, the pack being made of rough sacking stuffed with straw. The weight is lifted well off theanimaPs back, and taken partly by the projecting pads of straw and the rim Carried down the animal s side, while over the centre of the back it is hollowed out. ... There is a single leather girth and a broad, leather breeching held in position by two breeching straps. Very little leather is used, and nothing liable to get easily out of order. ' A breastband is used in most cases, but not invariably. There are no buckles at all, and such articles are much prized and liable to be stolen by muleteers. Girth and other fastenings are made by a pliable leather thong knotted to an iron ring sewn on to the pad. A leather surcingle is used over the load, and no numdah is used. Packs are not removed when animals come in after the march ; only for a short time while they are being groomed. They are seldom injured by the ani mals rolling, which they invariably do directly the load is taken off. Ordinary pack mules are never bitted, but led about by a halter wit i an iron noseband, to which is attached a short picketing chain carried looped loosely round the mule’s neck when marching. In North-West and West ler- sia it is customary to tie the whole caravan head to tail by these chains, e^P®* cially if passing through the narrow streets of a town. In Baghdad this is scarcely ever done, and on the rough mountain tracks of Kurdistan it would be dangerous to do so. t . . In bad places the muleteer generally holds the leading chain in his han , and on some occasions the mules are guided by head and tail. To picket a caravan of 8 animals, two iron pegs are driven in the ground and connected by a rope of camel’s hair about 80 feet long, to which pic eting chains are attached. For a restive animal a forefoot hobble is used ; but alter along march animals show little disposition to break loose. The Arab “ palan ” or pack is seen on the Mesopotamian plain, and also in West Persia. It is a somewhat simpler looking construction than the Persian • It consists of two rectangular pads of rough sacking stuffed with straw well set up in the centre, secured by a broad leather girth breeching, an in some cases breastband. i i i • 1 In the Pusht-i-Kuh the pack saddle used for mules and donkeys con sis- ed simply of a pad of straw about 8 inches in diameter bent into a nairow shape, the distance between the two sides being not more than 6 inches. This is placed on the animal’s back over a thick cloth or ‘‘ jhool, aur ’ a crupper and breast plate secure it in position. The same pattern of saddle can be seen in India. 2 i 2In the Karmanshah district a curious method was observed of carrying corn to the threshing floors from the fields. There are two sticks, about 8 feet long, joined in the form of a rectangle by cross pieces 2'6' in length. This was placed* crosswise on the ordinary pack, and the sheaves are piled on top of the rectangle. The whole is secured by two ropes and a surcingle. Round Mosul they have another way of carrying corn. It consists of two light wooden frameworks joined together in a V-shape. This is in verted and placed on the mule's back over the ordinary pack saddle. The sheaves are placed on this framework, and secured in position by ropes. Camels are not used in. Kurdistan at all, as the country is too mountainous. Some droves were seen as far as Karmaushah and on the Camels ' plain adjoining Urmia lake. Large numbers, SOU to 500 a day, were seen passing through Jazirah. North and east of this line they cannot travel. Camels are used largely between Mosul and Aleppo or Damascus. The dried fodder of Turkish Arabia (tibban) consists mainly of wheat and barley straw reduced by threshing to the broken up state known in India as “ bhusa' and “ kali' in Persian. Large stores of this exist in the towns and larger villages. This mixed with barley is the universal fodder when no green stuff exists. In the spring time, when there is an abundance of green fodder, both horses and mules, when marching, subsist entirely on grass, no barley being given. Caravans make short marches, and animals are allowed to linger and graze by the roadside. To do long marches it is advisable to add some barley. In Baghdad, during the greater part of the year, “ hashish, ' the generic name of all green food, consisting of various natural and cultivated varieties, comes daily into the market, and during spring the irrigated barley crops are cut frequently and sold as green fodder. This is “ kasil. ' In the end the stalk comes to ear and ripens well. English clover and ryegrass and other English grasses exist throughout Kurdistan and round Baghdad. The large white and red clover and smaller yellow trefoil are commonest seen. Maize and wheat crops are sometimes cut for green fodder. Through the Hartoshi Mountains and Northern Kurdistan and in Per sia also the Kurds use for fodder a peculiar kind of umbelliferous plant like fennel or the wild carrot seen in England. It grows 3 to 4 feet high, and the dried stalks are used occasionally in place of firewood. The leaves are gathered by the villagers in the autumn, and stored for winter use for horses and cattle. “ Karnoch ' is the common Kurdish name of this plant. On the route between Sakiz and Sihna four distinct kinds, all something similar and all umbelliferous plants, were being gathered and stored as fodder. The clover and meadow grass seen in Hartoshi were exceptionally fine (see Route XIII). Horses can be shod and spare shoes obtained in most large villages, espe- Shoeino- cially on known caravan routes. Shoes of the same pat- b tern are used by Arabs, Kurds, and throughout West Persia, and eastward as far as Afghanistan. They consist of a thin flat sheet of iron covering the whole sole, except a small portion at the frog. There are three nail holes close together on either side, making six in each shoe. Shoes are kept of various sizes ready made, the principle apparently being that the foot should be pared down to suit the shoe. Eore and hind are the same.The smith arrives in camp with a hag of ready-made shoes, and shoeing takes a very short time. When the nails are hammered in, the outer sets are clinched with a small pointed hammer. The projecting end of the nail was Process of sboemg. ^ p ut cur l e d. U p with the point of the hammer into a spiral, and tapped to lie flat against the hoof. The inner sets of nails are broken short off with a pair of pincers, and rasped down to avoid brushing. While this was being done, the foot was placed on a little round wood block 6 inches high and 10 inches diameter, and a small iron wedge jammed in under the shoe between the block and the point of the toe. This ensures the shoe bearing well up against the sole while it is being hammered in. The drawing knives, of which there were two kinds, were of formidable dimensions, and the hoof was pared in the most ruthless manner before the ehoe was fitted. For paring the sole there is one handled knife about 7 inches broad, and curved up slightly in the centre, so as to avoid taking too much off the frog. The other is a straight-edged knife, taken in both hands, by two projec tions, and used for paring the sides of the foot. These shoes caused a good deal of brushing, and came off very easily, going over rough roads, and seem not at all suited for rocky, slippery ground. In the evening the packs are taken off the mules, and they are^ rubbed down with a currycomb, the principal article for Grooming. grooming used for both horses and mules. It is a curved shell of iron of a flattened U-shaped section. The edges are serrated like an ordinary currycomb, and joined together by a dozen or so small iron bars on each of which is made to slide a small iron button ; and as the animal is Groomed, these strike the iron edges of the comb, making a peculiar clicking noise. After the comb the animal is well rubbed down with a piece of coarse Cl0t| The comb is about 9 inches long and 3 inches wide, and seems an excel lent article for grooming an animal coated with mud or dust after a long During our march it was used for horses and mules, and kept their coats, looking very well. „ , , , , , .1 j Animals were given their first barley feed at about 4 A.M., and the second in the evening at about 5 p.m. On coming in from the Feeding. march, they were turned loose to find the nearest grass ° l ThTsam^mulesTIre taken from Baghdad the whole journey to Karman- shah, a distance of about 1,600 miles. _ i i • i a Thev came without a single gall or having to leave any behind, and they took on again almost immediately to carry goods from Karmanshah to ^Themules were hired through the Baghdad Residency under an agree- mentof 10 piastres per mule each day. i -r„ i This at the rate then current in Baghdad amounted to nearly Be. 1 eac i This includes pay of muleteers, food, &amp;c., and the agreement said they were to go any road ordered, and not leave unless required to. Their pay, if paid in rupees, was at the Baghdad current rate. . The two muleteers procured were good men, and beyond an occasional ’ grumble at the length of the stages, they would go any road or to any place.246 They talked Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and a little Kurdish. Most mule teers in Baghdad can talk the three first languages. They were always willing to help in camp, pitching tent, &amp;c. As a class the muleteers of Baghdad, Mosul, and Karmanshah are a hard-working set of men, very willing to do what they are told. The mules are splendid animals, averaging over 13 hands, with a large proportion over 14, and Some more. They are accustomed to carrying loads of from 250 to 300 lbs. over the hills, which they accomplish with ease. They travel on the level 3^ miles per hour on an average. Bound Karmanshah, and in Luristan to the south of it, is a particularly good mule-breeding ground. Hassan Ghuli Khan at Dehbala in Luristan possesses a good number.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000912.0x00004d_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/144</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000912.0x00004d</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/144</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Reconnaissances in Mesopotamia, Kurdistan, North-West Persia, and Luristan from April to October 1888.
