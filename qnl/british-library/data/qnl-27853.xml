INDIA 'OFFICE. oeg Would you pleas'e^eTerTo^rourTetler ^ No. P.Z.2331/39 of April 15th enclosing the request of Petroleum Development for a survey by one of H*M# Ships of the approaches to the north-east comer of Qatar. I write to inform you that we are regretfully unable to meet the wishes of Petroleum Development Ltd. in this matter. Had we been about to undertake a survey of the area concerned, we should no doubt have been willing to communicate the results free of charge to the Company. Unfortunately, this is not the case and the survey desired would seem unjustifiable on any naval grounds; nor does it seem possible for us to assist the Company to carry out the survey at its own expense, with equipment procured by itself, as we have done in a few previous cases. In the present instance our experts J.P. Gibson, Esq., INDIA OFFICE, S. W. 1. DW. RECd. POL. DEPt. -9JUN1939 1 INDIA OFFICE think(9 ’ V / - 2 - think, I fear, that owing to the absence of shelter on this coast, a ship would be necessary for the proposed survey. Yours sincerely,have to be taken to export oil if such operations are successful. From a study of the Admiralty Charts, it would appear that the only possible point at which a sea loading terminal could be established would be at some point between Has Umm Hasaii and Has Laffain at the north-eastern end of the Qatar Peninsula, since we anticipate having to provide for tankers of 20,000 tons requiring a minimum of eight fathoms of water at the loading terminal. The matter in which I am venturing to ask your assistance is one regarding a survey of the waters off that part of the Qatar coast: it would be of great value to us to know whether there is any likelihood of marine surveys being undertaken in the Bahrain/Qatar waters in the near future by any of His Majesty f s survey vessels and, if so, whether it would be possible for a survey of an approach to a terminal site between the two points mentioned above being undertaken for this Company. I hope you will forgive me troubling you for a matter which, I realise, is not the direct concern of your department. RECd. POL. DEPi- UAPR1939 INDIA OFFICE Yours sincerely. _.T.
