The ’picture* is as follows: For a good many years past the Royal Air Force had a depot at Bahrain in connection with which certain payments had to be made. So long as this depot was under a non-commissioned o ficer, at the request of the Royal Air Force the Political Agent made payments on their behalf. This was not of course really the work of the Political A? ent, but I was willing to agree to this procedure in order to assist the Royal ^ir Force, who are very good in helping us in various ways. This procedure was regularised by the Accountant General Central Revenues in India. V' r hen a responsible ofiicial in the shape of the Air Liaison Officer was appointed, however, the situation was different, and this officer could of course make the required payments himself and proceeded to do so. 3 . There still remained the provision of funds for this officer, and so long as the Post Office was in the Agency, and was therefore in a secure position to keep funds, the Air Liaison Officer could be provided with funds from this source.

This being so it will not be possible for the Political Agent to draw funds from the Post Office in oner to replenish the Air Liaison Officer's existing account with the Bank. The advances made at present by the Political Agent to the Air Liaison Officer involve a complicated aocountin procedure for their recovery via the Accountant General Central tie venues, India Office and Air Ministry* This would be avoided if arrangements were made for funds from the Iraq Com...and to be placed direct to tie credit of the Air Liaison Officer's account with the bank here as and when he required them, and would save us all, including the Hoyal Air Porce financial authorities, a certain amount of trouble.

(938 You will see from the attached copy of a letter addressed to the Air Officer Commanding, British Forces in Iraq that the Political Agent at Bahrein now wishes to terminate the arrangement under which he provides funds for works services and the Air Liaison Officer’s expenses. I am not quite clear as to details hut as I note from the last paragraph of his letter that he is still prepared to disburse Royal Air Force payments to the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast and, as alternative arrangements for the provision of funds for the Air Liaison Officer and works services are a little complex, I should be very much obliged if arrangements can be made for the Political Agent to continue to provide rupees for these services. If this can be done all that will be necessary is for funds to be provided in bulk to the Air Liaison Officer and we will arrange to take over the actual disburse ment of the funds provided for works services and thus relieve the Political Agent to a certain extent. I hope you will be able to arrange for this service to be continued which I need hardly say will be much appreciated. Yours sincerely, P G'WEPAL’sTP Kv : ' ' 11 NOV i938 OfA oFn c 9 •* . W.

Though Squadron Leader Coates has been appointed Air Liaison Officer, Bahrain, and has now been in residence for some time, I find that I, as Political Agent, still receive frequent requests to provide funds for the Royal Air Force Works Supervisor here, and indeed for the Air Liaison Officer’s ’’Public Account” which has been opened with the Eastern Bank. 2. Presumably this is due to a misconception that a branch of the Indian Treasury exists in Bahrain. Although the Apolitical Agent is designated Treasury Officer, there is in fact no currency chest or treasury, and the Political Agent at present actually obtains his funds by indenting on the surplus receipts of the Post Office here. It is anticipated that the Post Office will move in the near future from the Agency compound to the centre of the town, and when that occurs the present practice by which the Political Agent obtains his funds will cease. The Political Agent will then have no more than an account with the Eastern Bank and will in fact be in identically the same situation as the Air Liaison Officer. 3. In these circumstances I request that arrangements may be made for the Air Liaison Officer’s account with the Eastern Bank to be credited direct by you with all funds necessary for the operation of his own office and for meeting the cost of other Roya- Air Force activities in Bahrain including the Works and Building Branch. I am of course prepared to continue to disburse Royal Air Force payments to the'Shaikhs of the Trucial Ooast indefinitely, since the Political authorities possess the only existing means of making over regularly such payments to the Shaikhs in satisfaction of agreements made with them.

Dear Laithwaite, Will you please refer to your letter No.P.Z.2877/34 of the 1st May t about the land at Bahrain. It is necessary for the Admiralty to obtain Treasury sanc tion for the excess cost of the land to be borne on Navy Votes. We have already written to them and I will let you know directly their sanction is received. No doubt the India Office will then make a claim on the Admiralty for the whole amount. We agree with Loch’s suggestion made in paragraph 11 of his despatch No.C.413-7/1 of 19th April 1934, that the Officer of the Boyal Air Force who goes over the title deeds of the Air Ministry land should also examine those of the land at Jufair and hope the Air Ministry will agree to tiiis. As regards paragraph 2 of your letter, the Admiralty cordially agree that expressions of appreciation for the assistance they have given should be sent to the Political Agent and Financial Adviser to the Bahrain Government, and that you should suggest to the Resident that the Sheikh should also be thanked for his co-operation. I am sending copies of this letter to Rendel and McClaughry. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) R.R.Powell. J.G.Laithwaite Esq., India Office, S.W.l.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 1. P.Z. 2877/34. 1st toy 1934. L]y dear Powell, You will have seen the report from the Political Agent, Bahrein, No. C.414-7/1, of which copies were sent to you, Foreign Office and Air Ministry under our printed letter No. P.2.2741/34 of 27th April, ana the political Pesiaent’s telegram of 30th April, No.136, of which copies have gone to you to-day under our printea letter P.Z.2877/34 about the acquisition of lana for naval ana air purposes at Bahrein. 2. The Aamiralty will, I think:, agree that it is very satisfactory to have concluded this transaction so promptly and with so little friction ana it may he desirable not merely to express our appreciation of the assistance given by the Political Agent ana the Financial Auviser to the Bahrein Government, but to suggest for the Hesident's consideration the aesirability of an expression of thanks to the sheikh for his personal cooperation. 3/ R#R. Powell, Esq., Admiralty, S.W. 1.5/ 2 3. From Loch’s report you will see tnat he ha$, in fact, in anticipation of approval, bought at a cost of x^s.3,300 the area belonging to .sheikh Khalifah-Bin-Salman. An expenditure of j3s.14,231 in excess of the provisional estimates originally submitted has/been incurred consequent on tne cost of certain houses ana gardens proving to be more than was anticipatea at tne time. As the Political Agent points out, the estimates were arawn up unaer rather difficult conaitions and while the excess is not inconsiaerable it is, we think, unaerstanaable in the circumstances. 4. so far as I can see the whole of the excess is debitable to the Admiralty. The extra piece of ground (Bs.3,300) dovetails in with the areas which the Political Agent was authorised to acquire on their behalf. The excess expenaiture of Bs.14,231 appears also, so far as can be judged from the papers, to be wholly in respect of properties within the Admiralty area, for, as you will see from the statement appended to the Political Agent's aespatch, the expenditure in respect of land acquired in ^udhaibiyah and Muharraq (for Air Force purposes) amounts to Rs.137,000, being tne orisinal estimate, ana the additional expenaiture is wholly in respect of acquisitions in Jufair.mum5. If you agree with the above we should be grateful if you would authorise us to arrange on your behalf for payment of ite.17,531 into the account of the Bahrein Government with Lloyds Bank Limited, Bombay, as suggested in paragraph 5 of Colonel Loch's despatch of 19th April. You will see that the political Agent state that it is desirable that this should be done as soon as possible. 6 . We should be grateful if you would also let us know whether you have any other comments on the points raised in Loch's despatch, subject to which, and to the concurrence of the Air Mnistry, we would propose to approve the action taken by him. 7» I am sending a copy of this letter to Renuel at the Foreign Office, and I enclose copy of a letter sent to iwcClaughry. We shall have to let the Bahrein Petroleum Company know in due course that these areas have been set aside by us and it will be necessary to consider the wording of our letter to them rather carefully.

The Secretary, Air Ministry, Kingsway, W»C • 2 •Accountant-General, 'Die purchase of certain areas of land at Bahrein on behalf of H.k.G. has been approved at an estimated cost of Hs.178,500. The purchase will be carried out by the Political Resident and the Political Agent, Bahrein, on behalf of by whom the whole cost will be borne, no contribution being made from Indian Revenues, me Admiralty are prepared to contribute Rs.41,500 to the expenditure, the balance of which will be borne by the Air Ministry. The whole amount will, I understand, be shown in Air Ministry Votes and no reference to it will appear in Naval Votes. It has been impressed on the Resident that it is desirable that the transaction should if possible be completed before the end of the present -financial year, but Treasury sanction has been given for provision in next year’s estimates if this for any reason proves impossible. method oy which the Admiralty propose to iinanee their part of the transaction is set out in para.2 of Mr. Seal’s letter of 17th January on P.Z.420/34 attached. We have no corresponding information from the Air Ministry. Do you see any objection to the arrangement proposed by the Admiralty ana would you be good enough to take up with the Air Ministry the question of what arrangements they desire made? ^ le amount involved is fairly substantial - about £11,000. - and I should be glad for your advice as to whether the xtesident is likely to need to be put specially in funds -p ^ . how or tne purpose oi linancing it. If so,/would you suggest that this should he aone? The instructions for purchaseamr ~— ^ - / \ 2 were telegraphed to the Resident on 18th January. A copy of the telegram went to the Government of Inaia hy the air mail of 20tn January and should reach them about 30th January.

If you uo, perhaps you would be good enough to suggest the terms of tne draft? the current year there will he no difficulty. Enquiry of the Air Ministry has elicited the fact that there is no eagerness as with the Admiralty to get the expenditure brought to account this year, but there will be no difficulty in securing an advance. Consideration of this might, therefore, be deferred for the present. would have enough funds to meet this extra expenditure, but in any case authority from the Government of India would seem to be required. As in the case of the expenditure connected with the Rest House at Shargah it appears necessary The Secretary Political Department If the Admiralty wish to make an advance during It appears most improbable that the Resident to/to ask the Government of India to put the Resident in funds (and possibly authorise him to take the desired action?') In the absence of the earlier correspondence it is difficult to suggest an actual draft telegram to the Government of India, but it might merely request that they will put the Resident in funds to the necessary extent, approximately Rs,180,000,and include a statement to the effect that a letter would follow regarding the method of accounting for the expenditure and its adjustment with His Majesty*s Government. It also appears desirable that a letter should be sent at an early date to the Resident suggesting that he should adopt a method of accounting similar to that applied in the case of the Shargah Rest House with the following suggested variations^ that he should forward to this Office monthly statements in this instance and that these should be sub-divided if it is called for rn^o-the heads'Air Ministry' and 'Admiralty', and further to avoid any confusion in linking up with the corresponding debits in Indian schedules that copies of the receipts obtained from the payees should not only accompany the statements for the information of this Office, but should also go with his accounts to the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, It is presumed that a copy of any letter on these lines would be forwarded to the Government of India for information, and it is, therefore, suggested that opportunity might be taken to advise them that if necessary advances will be secured from the Imperial Departments before the end cf March/(3 March^to request that they will make the necessary notification regarding the suggested method of accounting to the Accountant General, Central Revenues. In suggesting the issue of these letters by the Political Secretary regard is had to the necessity for secrecy but this Department will be glad to furnish a draft if desired. rwmr*</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00015e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3783</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00015e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3783</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/66 'Purchase of land at Bahrain by H.M.G.
