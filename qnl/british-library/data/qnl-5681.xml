Persia has, I suppose, three principal motives in seeking to hoist her flag on steamers in the Persian Gulf,— 1st. A laudable desire to revive a trade which in former times was considerable. 2d. To find good markets for her opium. 3d. At least to vapour about like Persians. Perhaps, to realize their cherished wish to obtain, by means of an imposing squadron in the Gulf, a political influence there, that may gradually bring under their subjection certain Chiefsand tribes who do notnowacknowledge, if they ever did acknowledge, the authority of Persia. With regard to the first, it should be remembered that we know, from Arabic and Persian authors, such as Abool-feda, and the travels of the merchant Sooleiman, who, with much intelligence, wrote of his own times, between eight and nine centuries since, that fleets of large vessels belonging to the Persian Gulf, almost as numerous as those of China then so engaged, carried on an extensive trade with India and beyond, and that it declined only when the flourishing Mohummudan colony in Canton, pre suming at length on the peaceful habits of the natives, indulged the arrogance of Islam in enacting intolerant laws. Then an excited and outraged people rose and exterminated them, as similar pro vocation, five centuries later, cost all the Portuguese in Japan their position and their lives, and as, again, in late days so nearly led in India to a general massacre of Europeans, men, women, and children. But, when possessing a steam fleet, Persia may again pursue a legitimate and profitable trade and pilgrim transport in the Gulfs and in the eastern seas. Under the second head, it is to be observed that speculators in Persia are at present allured by the profits realized on their increasing cultivation of opium. Its superior quality is already appreciated in Java. They export it to that island from Bushire, principally in British bottoms. They are gradually exploring other markets for it in the eastern Archi pelago. In this matter we can say nothing to Persia. Our remonstrating against this competition, which in time may prove damaging to our Indian revenue, is out of the question. It would be too ludicrous; for ours is the Government which has persisted in this forced traffic,—forced by means of 32-pounders in some of the finest merchant vessels that any where sail under the British flag. And it goes on, notwithstanding that Mr. Marjoribanks, President of the Committee, Captain Elliot, Her Majesty’s Superintendent at Canton, and our clergymen in 9638 c. AChina, stated that it can only be regarded as a most pernicious poison, which it is painful to any friend of humanity to see still poured into the sources of human happiness, the misery, demoralization, and frightful ravages occasioned by it exceeding belief, and the detestable disgrace and sin of this forced* traffic leaving little to choose between it and piracy; while, as reported by the Reverend Mr. Welton, the millions of people taunt our missionaries, vent their indignation at our hypocrisy, and say, “ Per- “ suade your countrymen to relinquish the abomi nable trade, and then we may listen to your exhor- “ tations on the subject of Christianity.” Never theless, the scandalous profit is too great to be parted from. The Jamsetjees, Mathesons, and Jar- dines amass colossal fortunes by it, and consequently are honoured and dignified in their native countries. Certain classes of Persian merchants are now hope ful of supplanting them in several ports in the introduction of the filthy drug. The Persian soil and climate are favourable to its production. The Persian Gulf is a convenient line for its exportation. Before long we may see Persian Agas and Khans ennobled by their King for their enterprise in emu- ating the successful activity of those arch contra bandists. icgdiu iu me snan s proiect of placing a steam fleet in the Gulf, it is not new. It was reported to me when I was last Governor in Bombay, by a British Officer employed there. The rrench Captain Picard, commanding the “ Her- mione, ’ visited Bombay, where his beautiful 54-ffun frigate was much admired. At his request, I fur nished him with introductions to Kurrachee, but he did not think it necessary to acquaint me with the main object of his onward cruise to the north-west He proceeded to the Gulf, made acquaintance with he Imaura and other Chiefs and ports there, and lett those favourable impressions which gracious messages from his Government, his own urbanity and the taints of his selected complement of Officers laded not to produce. Soon after, it was rumoured m the Gulf and at Bombay that he Emperor intended to provide the Shah’with four steamers, for service in the Persian Gulf. It stands to reason that, around an'empire so vast as ours in India, there will be here and there positions of some importance, politically com mercially, or strategically, which, if not brought ithm the sphere of powerful, though friendly influence on our part, will become moulded to the views of other great States, when the latte, hive f “ r «« the instance of Russian diplomacy in Persia During the first thirty years of thJ 1 ersia - influence greatly preponderated in the Coundhof the Government at Tehran, as well as at the v® regal Court in Tabreez. I do not refer to the e^' vagant expenditure by Malcolm, though, to be ^3 high functionaries of Persia are remarkably venal. Our ascendancy was rather owing to the care with which Sir Lionel Smith and Mr. Elphinstone selected English officers for command, for drill, and for medical practice in that country, in compliance with the wish of the Shah and the Crown Prince to be furnished with such means of introducing military discipline and progress. But when, to distant and unreflecting observers in England, it seemed that no advantage accrued to us from those friendly offices, comparable to that of saving a few thousand pounds by withdrawal from them, the sagacious Prince Menchikoff, attended by a well chosen staff of able officers, seized that favourable moment to visit the Shah’s Court, and establish that influence there, which has ever since proved so highly beneficial to his country in opening out new channels for her commerce, while eliminating from her military masses and colonies on her south-east frontiers that spirit of republicanism which had for some years proved so troublesome to the War Office at St. Petersburg, and, indeed on one occasion, so nearly fatal to all the members of the reigning dynasty. France, also, took care to profit, though in a less degree, by our reserve and supineness. Hence, I regard these overtures from the Persian Ministers as affording us a fortunate opportunity of strength ening our connexion with them. For some time past, it has appeared to me that there are two subjects in particular which offer safe means of placing the Persian Government under important obligations to us. One is this renewed proposal on their part that we should countenance and assist their making a respectable display of their flag on the waters of the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The other is our arbitrament of their frontier towards Afghanistan. This also is much desired by them. On more than one occasion it has been solicited by their representatives, Ferrokh Khan and bis successors, in London. But in com plying with the first of these requests, it will be indispensable to impose on Persia certain conditions, namely, that she must not attempt encroachment in any form on the rights of independent Chiefs in the Gulf, or on those of the Turkish Government there. That she must at all times be prepared to submit doubtful claims of the kind to the decision of the British Resident at Bushire or Aden ; and that she must avow the terms of the secret treaty which Sir Charles Murray, at Tehran, believed that Persia bad cajoled Syud Thoweynee’s father, Syud Saeed, into signing. In considering the other request, which concerns almost the entire frontier of Seistan, though we need not lose sight of its importance to the several claimants, and, probably, to ourselves in some future posture of our affairs on our north-west frontier, its investigation and decision must obviously await the settlement, sooner or later, of a Cabool administration, in a form which will admit of the deputation from thence of a competent agent of high rank, to cooperate on the spot with4 one similarly accredited by the Persian Court, to act under a British arbitrator. I believe that, sup posing Colonel Merewether, or Lieutenant-Colonel Goldsmid, or Major Pelly, were entrusted with the undertaking, this feud of ages could in three months be satisfactorily settled. In the meantime, we ought not to hesitate to assure the Persian Government that, when a favourable condition of affairs may exist at Cabool, we shall be glad to direct our Government in India to consider at what time and place it will be best to enter upon this friendly office. Muscat and Zanzibar, The Imaums of Muscat have been faithful to us. The late Imaum, Syud Toorkee, like his father before him, evinced uniformly the best disposition towards the British Government. Requisitions on their friendship, owing to the constant presence of our Indian Navy vessels, the vigilance of those cruisers in hunting slavers, and the frequent opera tions of our surveyors on the coast and in parts of the interior, have been continual. Of late years also the goodwill of Thoweynee had been much called on, and proved active, in aiding our opera tions in laying and working our electric line of communication with India. In honour and in policy we must not allow Persia to attempt aggressions, or to revive ancient preten sions, against the independence of Muscat. When I undertook, in 1861, to adjust Syud Thoweynee’s quarrels with his brother, SyudToorkee, at Sohar, and with his nephew, Syud Majeed, at Zanzibar, I had recourse, in the latter case, as the only possible basis, to requiring an acknowledgment of the independence of Zanzibar, in consideration of the payment by Zanzibar of an annual subsidy. At the same time, I felt that the Imaum’s com pliance must prove a painful wrench to his dignity. In fact, it lost him Zanzibar for ever. Nor do I think that anything short of the Arabic eloquence of the Rev. Mr. Badger (a padre whom they all like) could have persuaded him. So advised, he yielded, and, finally, with so much good temper as to convey to me his thanks for all the pains taken with the matter, and his acknowledgment that we “ had given him something more than the bone to “ gnaw.” His late murder by his son has made the longer payment of this subsidy (#40,000) odious to his brother at Zanzibar, and scarcely less so to us to enforce it. The only immediate solution by us of this difficulty, as the case stands, appears to be that now in the course of adoption, by which we are to receive the amount from Zanzibar, and to pay it to Muscat. However, I am strongly of opinion that the suggestion submitted by me in 1862 would be more satisfactory. It would cancel the hateful ■ —obligation on the part of Zanzibar, and indemnify the Muscat Treasury. I aimed also at an acceptable revision of the Treaty of 1845, executed with Syud Thoweynee’s father, who was sovereign of the now disjoined States of Muscat and Zanzibar. It now permits export and import of slaves within certain limits on the eastern coast. This deprives its general restrictions of the traffic of much of their value. I presume that, if its widespread horrors in the interior, caused by the continuance of it, were well understood, an annual disbursement of 8,500/. would be well expended in its annihilation. Ar ticle III. of that Treaty clearly exempts from search, and therefore from the visits of our cruisers, a tract of coast extending from 1° 57' to 9° 2' S. latitude. These points lie north and south of Zanzibar, with the usual offing in reserved waters. In conside ration for such payment by us, this obnoxious clause would by consent be expunged. Muscat would be reimbursed. Zanzibar would be released from an irksome position. Our cruisers would save time, cost, and health. Misunderstandings (for instances of which vide my proceedings regarding Her Ma jesty’s sloops of war, “ Lyra ” and “ Sidon ”) arising from the violation of an imaginary boundary when in chase would be ended. I cannot find Lord Russell’s opinion of my proposal of March 1861. It disappeared. It suggested instead, if I am not mistaken, that the time had come to disregard the treaty. Such a disclaimer would, I conceive, be viewed throughout those countries as an act of signal bad faith. Far better, I think, to redeem it. The Sultan naturally can no longer be well contented to tender the subsidy in any form to or for the parricide. We had trouble enough to induce him to agree to such an adjustment of his differ ences with the late Imaum. We have now a great object to attain, and the means of attaining it— nothing less than to render thoroughly effective our own means, and the cooperation of our Zanzibar ally, for destroying the occupation of the Arab slavetraders on the east coast of Africa. It would be a great step gained in the cause of humanity. I am sure this would be admitted by all who have travelled in Oman and South Africa, and by all Officers of our cruisers on the east coast. But it will not quite exterminate the slave trade in that quarter, so long as the efforts of the French Go vernment, and such of its representatives as Com modore de Langle, are so lukewarm in the duty of suppressing it. When last in Bombay, I was informed by our Agent at Zanzibar, that in the previous year, 30,000 sovereigns sterling had been there imported on account of it, by the proprietors of the thriving sugar plantation, in Reunion. Also, the Portuguese still give vitality to the trade. We waste our sympathies sadly. There is a good deal of talking platitudes. But that position in De la Goa Bay offers us a field for the exercise of genuine humanity, in adopting vigorous measures 9638 c. B.0 - 6 for suppressing their slave trade. We might insis on free access there at all times. We might hav&lt; a station there by right. When employed in Soutl Africa in 1854, I then forwarded to the Duke o Newcastle a copy of the treaty executed betweei Admiral Watson and the Pemba Chiefs, by whicl they ceded to Great Britain the south side of the Bay. This copy had been for many years in the posses sion of a Dutch family, one ol whom gave it to me. I recommend that we should assert our rights, and that we should construct a station-house there ; or least, that the bay should be subjected to the con stant vigilance of our cruisers. A few years subse quent to this, Admiral Keppel, 1 believe, endea voured to arrest the building of a fort by the Poituguese, one object of which, of course, was to thwart our joint claims there. They always main, am a station on shore. In that manner, and owing to our not having, at the time of my report, brought the position at all within the cruising ground of our naval station at Simon’s Bay, they had virtually closed to us and others the mouth of the St. George river. It is navigable for 200 miles, and it is the route through which they deal with the Kaffirs and with the Dutch Booers beyond the Vaal. Thence the Portuguese export, under their flag and that of Spam the staples of the interior, viz., gold dust ostrich feathers, and slaves. Some Kaffirs, such as an°/fK r ^^ Barralon g. the Basutos, and and the Bachaanas, have never been prevailed upon to join m the latter trade. Others are more mer- cenmy and owing to the exemption from search enjoyed in the reserved waters of Zanzibar, and to the loose French relations with Madagascar and the Comoros, mutual facilities exist for the enterprise L'S,' '»■’»''*“« S P S s° U ”.t kt r S . with Chiefs and tribes on the Red approval'of ^Bombay 5 for Die -vice desirable that the Fo^ffign Offii™''''^ ’ 'n' 8 ! perlia P s Navy than an Officer g sent fron^R Wlt n th ® RoyaI apprehend, that neither the Foreign Office B “A * Government of India i* nf &amp;n rior the 'ith Officers ted forV t dS t a W d 1 r Pr 0 V A ded who may not be conversant with 1 d , Uty * 0ne ’ customs, and with the Arabic ^r rabl&lt; l ! 1Story and will never be of much te here r n^^ 3 ’ due influence with the , He wdl r| ot have be liable to be ovclreactd 6 bv^b 'r' * Z'* time r ‘ 5 “ L *' £ ^ h V,.t. .mpLyed di.l'.TSS.fjfSitussian and the French Government, must have been struck with their peculiar qualifications for the discharge of their appointed duties, whether diplo matic, commercial, or scientific. We ought not for any considerations, to be careless in selecting our Agents in such positions. Zanzibar is one where the security of British interests now requires the exercise of considerable vigilance, dexterity Judg ment, and firmness. Of course we cannot create direct obstacles in the way of French enterprise in the Red Sea, or of that of Persia and Russia in the Persian Gulf, but we should do well to be always on the alert to prevent those avenues to India be coming in danger of being closed against us. 17th July.
