Copy of to — SEEN POLITICAL-COMMITTEE. 2 2 DEO m Previous Papers - 4475b 1000 5.30 FOR INFORMATION. In a C.O.despatch of 14th April, the relevant extract from which is attached, emphasis was laid on the desirability of obtaining the consent of the Imam to the reception of a permanent British representative at Sanaa under the control of the Resident at Aden, if and when a treaty settlement is concluded with the Yemen, inecchange, if the Imam so desired, for the establishment of a similar Yemeni representative at Aden. The Resident suggests that the most satisfactory arrangement would be the appointment of a Political Officer of equal value and status to the Political Officer in the Aden Protectorate and that the two appointments/appointments should be interchangeable annually or as may be found expedient. This will necessitate an increase in the Political staff of the Resident which consists at present of the Political (formerly styled Trotectorate”) Secretary and one Political Officer. This office will no doubt be consulted in due course regarding the establishment of the proposed % new post and it will be remembered that the C.O. have suggested, in connexion with the settlement of various other financial items in regard to Aden, that a contribution might be made from Indian Revenues to the expenses of future British representation at Sanaa. Meanwhile the treaty negotiations with the Imam are still in progress and a submission on the subject will shortly be made. &lt; » (7. vti.Ja. SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE. ^ 2 2 DEC 1?52fZ 2 ^ Sir, THE RESIDENCY, Aden, &amp; July 1932. I h^re the honour to refer to your Secret despatch of the 14th April 1932, regardin - the establishment at Sana* of a permanent British representa tive of the Resident at Aden, consequent upon the conclusion of a treaty with the Imam, 2* I understand it to be your view, as it is mine, that this official should be British by birth, and that the nature of his duties should be primarily political# His appointment will not obviate the necessity of the retention of a Political Clerk at Hodeidah, who collects valuable secret intelligence in the Yemen and in the southern part of.the Red Sea. Both the Sana* and the iodeidah officers could deal vith consular matters, preferably under the control of the Resident at £den. Sana* post could be filled either by a ledioal Officer, who, on the analogy of Italian practice in the Yemen, would operate a medical service, in addition to (and without doubt in the interests of) his political work, or by a Political Officer of the ordinary type. In view of the expense and of the probable difficulty of appointment and relief the former alternative would be the leas satisfactory, although there is ample scope in Sap*' for the establishment of a British hospital and dispensary, which would, His iiaj©sty’s Secratary of Sta for th© Colonies, Londo ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. 4 5 17 NOV. 1332 •FROM C CRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE- 2 - I believe, be very welcome to the Imam. I therefore base my recommend?tion on the latter alternative. 4. Uy present political staf' consists of the Protectorate Secretary and one Political Officer, who are both fully employed locally. For the purpose of the Sana* appointment it wouli be necessary to increase my staff by one Political Officer. 5. When the existing appointment of Political Officer in Aden (now held by Lieutennnt-Colonel Lake) falls vacant it will probably be filled by a more junior officer, to whom it will not be necessary to allow the special rates of emoluments authorised in special circumstances for Lieutenant-Colonel Lake. Pith this eventuality in view I recommend that the two future appointments of Political Officers (at Sana’ and Aden) should be fundamentally of equal value and status, and should be interchangeable annually or at such other time as may be found expedient (c.f. my despatch No./J^ of 20th July 1932 on the subject of the appointments of rotectorate Secretary and Political Officer at Aden). 6. I suggest that the emoluments to be attached to the Sana* post (and to the Aden post in normal circumstances) should be as follows:- Salary Local duty Allowance Conveyance ' 45 £845 £700-25-800 (pensionable on a suiteble basis). 100 (A higher rate is proposed for Aden) ?• In addition to the personal emoluments to be attached to the Sana’ post in respect of the Political Officer occupying it, I estimate tentatively that the following annual establishment charges will be necessary: Clerk-Interpreter Local Allowance .■■Hi 1) extract from Colonial Office despatch dated 14th Aoril 1932^^ 7^ c*Z As regards political relations, His Hajesty f s Oovernment consider that every effort should be made to secure the formal agreement of the Imam to the reception at Sanaa of a permanent representative of the Resident at Aden, and it could be agreed, if the Imam so desired, to ^i s in exchange, a permanent representative at Aden. If the Imam agrees, his agreement should, without further leierence to me, be embodied not in the Treaty itself, but in an exchange of notes. If he does not agree to any permanent British representative at Sanaa, or w iH °nly agree to a formal exchange of diplomatic representatives to reside in Sanaa and London , this question should be referred to me. I am of the opinion that, as you and your staff are best fitted, both from the standpoint of local knowledge and knowledge of Arabic, to deal with the Imam, tne staffing of the post at Sanaa, which, it is admitted, ill be a very isolated and trying one, could be most easily arranged by detaching an officer of suitable rank from your staff. This officer might be relieved as often as was necessary by another member of your staff, and I should be glad to have your views as to whether it is necessary to increase your staff by one officer for . ns purpose, in which case it will be necessary for me 00 consult the Secretary of State for India, who may T isn to refer the question to the Government of India. 1 snould also on this point be glad to receive your views as to the emoluments to be attached to this post.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000286_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2108</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000286</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2108</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 6/41 'Yemen: Proposed establishment of a British representative at Sanaa, on conclusion of treaty with Imam.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1932</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-04-26T12:13:22</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (6 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 8; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file relates to a proposal made by the Political Resident at Aden (Bernard Rawdon Reilly) that, following the conclusion of treaty negotiations with Yemen, the British Government should seek the consent of the Imam of Yemen [Yaḥyá Muḥammad Ḥamīd al-Dīn] for the reception of a permanent British representative at Sanaa, under the control of the Political Resident.In a letter dated 20 July 1932 and addressed to the Secretary of State for the Colonies (Philip Cunliffe-Lister), the Political Resident envisages that the post could be filled either by a medical officer or by a political officer.In addition to the Political Resident, the file's other two correspondents are an unnamed Colonial Office correspondent and John Gilbert Laithwaite of the India Office.The file includes a divider (the front cover) which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
