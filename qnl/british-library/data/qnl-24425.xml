A few weeks ago, however the Sheikh of the Ras-al-Khaimah sent a messenger to the Standard Oil Company’s local representative with an oral message to the effect that he, (the Sheikh) 7 /as no longer bound to any other Company (his Option with P.C.L.expired on 31st July) and that he was free to enter into negotiations with the Standard Oil. Mr.Ballantyne wished to know whether, in such circumstances, there would be any objection to his Principals now dealing with this Sheikh.

Weightman, 2squire, H.B.M’s Political Agent Bahrain.H.B.M’s Political Agent, Bahrain, Bahrain, 17th November, 1937. Dear Sir, below a report on the negotiations ith the Sheikh of Ras El Khaimah and a summary of my itinerary since my arrival on the Trucial Coast. My first desire was to pay a courtesy call on every ruler on the Coast in order to establish t relations and to conform to Arab etiquette. I had of course previously met the Sheikhs of Dubai Sharjah and Ajman, the latter v\iien he visited Bahrain early in the year. As my base was at Dubai my first visit was to that Ruler and the various members of his family. My second visit was to the Ruler of Sharjah who at' that time had agreed to the terms and conditions of the Oil Agreement but objected to one clause in the Political Agreement. After these two Rulers had been visited, calls were made on the Sheikhs of Ajman and Ras El Khaimah. The Sheikh of Umm El Q,uwain was away in the interior where he usually passes the hot months. At Ajman and Ras El Khaimah no business was discussed and invitations to lunch and dinner were accepted for the day following our visit. I had several interviews with the Sheikh of Sharjah and explained to nim the interpretation of the Clause in the Political Agreement to which he objected. The Oil Concession was later signed. Owing to the distance to Abu Dhabi I put off my visit to that Ruler till the last.Haji Yusuf Kanoo who was introducing me to the Rulers whom I had not met had received, previous to our departure from Bahrain, a letter inviting him to Abu Dhabi. A launch had been sent to Dubai to take nim to Abu Dhabi and in the meantime the Ruler had apparently heard that I was on the Coast and sent me a letter inviting me to stay with him. We proceeded to Abu Dhabi where we stayed six days. The first two days were occupied in paying calls on the Ruler and his brothers and receiving their return visits. On the third day business was discussed and the Ruler stated his desire to enter into an agreement with the Company for an Oil Concession. When the draft agreement was produced I was informed that the Ruler and his brothers had definitely decided not to negotiate on those terms and that they had already communicated this to Major Holmes who had sent them a copy of the draft lease which had been returned. After certain discussions I was allowed to read through the articles and explain their meaning.This took some considerable time as each member of the family present, four in number including the Ruler, insisted upon giving his own idea of the meaning of the various articles. However, the talks which lasted over several meetings were conducted in an excellent atmosphere and the Ruler finally communicated to me the decision of his family which was that I should bring either the A*I*O.C., or Kuwait agreements when they would agree to talk business. The impossi bility of this was communicated to the Ruler. As the Ruler’s uncle, Khalifa, was absent at Braimi and without whom no business of any importance is concluded, I decided to stay one more day in order to further get to know the Ruler and to be able to take my leave in as friendly a spirit as possible. Nty next visit was to Ajman who informed me that he would definitely sign an agreement with the Company but would prefer to leave it until the present Option expires (22nd January, 1938). I then proceeded t o Ras El Khaimah and commenced serious discussions with the Ruler who informed me he had already given Major Holmes a copy of his conditions and thereupon presented me with a similar book. After weeks of discussions during which time we worked through the Company’s draft lease and his book of conditions, and had managed to dispose of all of his demands with exception of the following three, which the Ruler wished me to again refer to London and promised to abide by their decision. 1. The Company offer a Sheikh’s Representative at a monthly salary of Rs.400. The Ruler insists upon an Inspector as well, combined salaries to be Rs.2500 per month. 2. The Ruler insists upon a free issue of Petrol and Kerosene amounting to 40,000 gallons of each, yearly. The Company are not disposed to give free issues of these but would be willing to give a personal allowance sufficient for his own needs if he would agree to abide by their decision as regards 1, and 3. 3. The Ruler insists upon receiving 20$ of the nett profits of the Company. The Company are definitely not disposed to consider this. The Ruler suggested that if the Company would not agree to the above three conditions it should pay him 1 lakh of rupees per year instead and up till the time I left to proceed to Bahrain he appeared adamant. The Company absolutely refuse to consider this proposal. The Ruler of Umm El Qjiwain returned from his summer residence a short time ago and I paid the usual courtesy call and was invited to lunch the follow ing day which I accepted. A few days later I visited him and asked whether he would like to enter into an agreement with the Comuany for an Oil Concession. He replied that he was‘ready to begin negotiations but as he had an ’’understanding’’ with the Ruler of Ras ElCONFIDENTIAL.

(i) The Ruler objected to the development of the west coast at the expense of Dohah and wished Dohah to be the base for all operations claiming that this was the purport of Clause VI of the Concession. ^t this Juncture this attitude affected the Company’s proposal to land heavy equipment on the west coast near Dohat ez Zekrit. The Ruler eventually agreed to the landing of consignments this season but reserved the right to reopen the discussion in the future. (ii) arbitration . The Ruler claims that the concession is clear and as his interpretations as Ruler of Qatar must be final there is no occasion for any arbitration. He concedes that any new point arising not included in the concess ion might have to go to arbitration. He shews a distinct dislike for the subject of arbitration.• • • - 2 - # • • (ill) The Ruler*8 two ^rtezian Wells * This was an obligation entered into by the Company at the time of the Concession. Last season’s drilling to over 500 ft. failed to produce potable water. The Ruler at first insisted on a fresh attempt this season but later recognized the Company’s argument that the results of the Company’s drilling should be seen before further attempts were Justified at the Ruler’s locations. (iv) The Ruler’s Representatives Pay . It was fairly obvious that the Ruler intends to accept the Company’s offer of Rs.1000 with a last effort to increase it when Mr.Longrigg visits Qatar in the near future. (v) Strength of Guards . The Company suggested 10 as a suitable number for a small drilling camp. The Ruler ridiculed this as too small but refused to commit himself to a figure. He has since insisted on 20 men and the Company have agreed to this figure pending further possible discussions. (c) Final Position at Commencement of Operations . The Ruler has agreed to the Company’s programme and the only unsatisfactory feature is the 20 guards which are considered somewhat excessive and difficult in the early stages to transport k provide for in rations k particularly water. 2. Dubai. Shariah. Muscat, Dhofar . No field operations this season. Consideration is being given to a scheme for co-operation by the RJk.F. in flights over certain areas including parts of Muscat k Dhofar.

He is expected to arrive in December not before the 8th. 3. Has el Khaimah . Mr.Lermitte reports that the situation is satis factory.

The Ruler of Um el Qjuwain stated that he had an understanding with Ras el Khaimah not to negotiate until Ras el Khaimah had signed but that he was willing to grant a concession. 7. Kelba &amp; other minor independent or semi-independent Rulers . It is understood that no action on options nor concessions is contemplated at present. 8. Bahrain (unallotted area ). The situation is unchanged since last April, i.e. H,H. the Shaikh is not disposed to re-open the subject under a year from April, 1937.

Before therefore proceeding^sending Draft No. 3 I would request instructions whether the Shaikhs reply should be accepted. The Shaikh having 'taken notice of the conditions set out in my letter and having agreed to them' the final sentence of his letter can, I think, be ignored as meaningless in effect. On the other hand it might conceivably be argued that this final sentence vitiates the agreement ex pressed earlier in his letter. If that view is held it will be necessary to return the letter to him and insist on the excision of this sentence. This involves firm treatment and I would request instructions whether you would prefer me to fly to Sharjah for the purpose or to instruct Captain Galloway to deal with the matter. If, however, the view is accepted that the interpolated sentence does not have the effect of vitiating the Shaikh*s agreement then I will proceed to issue Draft No.3. 4. Pending instructions I am not sending copies of the ac tual letters to London or India.

Bahrain.IROUTBS IN TEE TRUOI/M GQ/xST STATES The following were the main routes used by the cars of our party during the winter of 1936-37. 1. Dubai to Ras al Khaima . This follows the coast all the way, and is fairly easy to trace. The only difficulty is at the stretch just before reaching Ras al Khaima, where it is necessary to drive along the shore below high water mark. Arrival there should be timed to coin cide with low tide. An alternative route can be taken a short distance inland, but it is very rough and sandy. Normally the trip takes from three to four hours. 2. Sharjah to Dhaid and beyond . From Sharjah the going is good as far as the end of the 'Sabkha* south-east of Ajman. Thence there are several miles of rough sandy going to Tel Ah. Eastwards from that hill, a very well defined camel track which is sandy but not difficult, leads successively past a prominent dune called Ali Sobeir, a depression known as El Houeyah and a well Loughalla. From this point a dry stream course gives a good route south east to the old fort at Dhaid, where there is a canal of excellent water which is slightly warm. From Dhaid we were able to drive about 25 miles due south to the corner of Jebel Rodha, over fairly easy ground. Our escort would not take us farther, but we gathered that with the exception of about a mile of sand there was no serious physical obstacle to prevent a car from reaching Biraimi. Sharjah to Dhaid should take 2 to 2| hours and two hours more should suffice to reach Jebel Rodha. The going from Dhaid by way of the valley called El Jerri to Ras al Khaima is not difficult, and it seemed to us that the logical route to the interior through Biraimi would be either from Sharjah or Ras al Khaima via Dhaid. 3. Dubai to the South . A circular tour which covered a large part of Dubai territory was undertaken. The route was all sandy and rather heavy going. The following places were passed : Roueya (well of bad water), Murra (a pleasant spot with some grass and trees and a well of brackish water), Bahaithat al Hibbarah (water pools after rain), Hezan (prominent sand hill), thence eastwards over a soft plain to Hameidha (prominent sandhill). This point was apparently not far from the eastern frontier of Dubai. From here the route turned south-west to El Eshush (a deep well with brackish water) over fairly easy plains, and then through heavy sand westwards to Hafir, or Hafair (a well which seems to be common to Dubai and Abu Dhabi). From this point we were guided northward to Jebel Ali by a rather devious and sandy way past Ghadur, Leian,» • • • • • Ram er Ram and Kameran, all sand hills or ridges. Then from Jebel ^li a good track along the shore brought us back to Dubai. 4. Dubai to Abu Dhabi. Leave by the shore route to Jebel Ali. There two alternatives present themselves. The quicker my is to the North of the hill, and it follows a series of sabkhas nearly to Semaih. This is not always passable after rain or strong 'shuraals'. The second alternative skirts to the East of the hill along the track towards Kameran, and then turns south-west to join the first at Semaih, a brackish water hole. It passes from there near the well of Moueilah and the hills known as Ajaij and then descends on to the Sabkha which stretches east from i^bu Dhabi. At a prominent rock called Nasailah a track crosses the Sabkha west to Maqta where a watch tower guards the ford to *.bu Dhabi Island. Care should be taken to keep to the beaten track across the Sabkha, as any deviation from it is likely to cause the car to break through the crust into a soft mess of brine and mud from which it is very difficult to extricate a vehicle. 5. From Abu Dhabi to Biraimi . (a) Sheikh Khalifa once travelled by car from Abu Dhabi to Biraimi, and we were shown his route; it was not good. After crossing the ford and returning to Nasailah it cuts south from Hedabet Shakhbut to El Char over some bad sand. Thence the track is heavy past a well Towai ed Dohan and a water hole Bedah al Ajam. From there eastwards the going is better to bed (well by prominent sandhill) and then but for about a mile of heavy going through some sandhills, is quite good to Lumwejeh, a small fort in the Biraimi oasis with good water. (b) We returned by a much better track, which was south of the outward one. Leaving Lurawejeh and cross ing several strips of plain (Seh el Neshesh) Lahamma, (Sandhill) was on our right, and we later passed a water hold Bedah Haramameh. Thence we continued to another water hole Mushairif, and then made use of sabkhas to reach Umm Gatara and Maqta. The outward journey would be an extremely long and arduous days driving, but with a good guide the southern route could be done in a day, the distance being just over 100 miles. 6 - Other Journeys . a. An unsuccessful attempt ms made to reach Jebel Dhanna from Abu Dhabi by car in March 1937 after rain. Apparently the journey had once been done by a truck which came from Jeddah, and we could still see the traces of its wheels. This had been done at the end of the dry season, however. We reached a point called Ram Ram Miyat by following sabkhas from Abu Dhabi and Umm Gatara, past Silimiyah and Gom Aniyat, but we had to abandon the trip there as the sabkhas were impassable beyond this point. By following a route farther inland it might be possible to complete the journey.-3- (t&gt;) Yas Island . We drove all round this island after landing cars very easily in the sheltered hay just by R.A.F. landing ground. (c) Jebel Dhanna . We were able to reach Jebel Wutaid, some 85 miles south-west of J. Dhanna, and Umm er Rus a prominent hill about the same distance to the South, but sandstorms and lack of time prevented us from trying to go farther south along the eastern edge of the Sabkhat Matti. (d) Khumeis area . The area west of the Sabkhat Ivlatti presents no great difficulty as it consists of a flat gravelly plateau dissected by a serious of valleys. Cars were landed at Khumeis opposite the island of £.1 Fazaya. Less than 8 hours were required to visit El Baya and Sila, and return to the landing place. On another day a short trip to the South-west took us up on to the plateau towards a well called El Battha, some 24 miles inland. We understand that itw^uld be possible to drive south as far as Sufuk across these gravelly plateaux. The cars used were a Ford Saloon and a Ford van, both fitted with 7 inch tyres, but the low pressure 9 W tyres would have made the travelling very much easier. It should be noted that the spelling of place names is only phonetic as we have not had an opportunity of checking the Arabic names and transliterating them.Confidential, D • 0 • No • C/70-25/4 r ]’he 24th January 1938, My dear 3alloway f _ - / ^ S ^ x r I enclose herewith copy of some notes made by illiamson, the P,C,L, geologist f in regard to routes on the rracial Coast, these may be helpful to you in certain circumstances.

If he is still obdurate, however, we must consider what line of action to take. There would appear to be the following courses open (a) I v/ould have to report the matter to His Majesty's Government and could propose to them that, as the Shaikh had refused to recognize the Political agreement, and since the Concession between Company and the Shaikh depended for His Majesty’s Government's sanction on such recognition, the Concession would lapse temporari ly until such recognition was forthcoming. Ibis would mean that, thou^ri the Company have paid the Shaikh his lump sum down, they v/ould cease to pay him the monthly payment of Eso25C0/-. This might bring him to heel. (b) I would report the matter to His Majesty's Government and merely state that local pressure v/as being brought to bear on the Shaikh, and that I would report the result. These local measures would be (c) stoppage of travel papers. (d) If the Shaikh did not comply immediately v/e would have to shift the Trucial Gathering from Sh arj ah3. © / 0 v Sharjah to Debai, since it would be obviously impossible to hold the Shaikh^* Gathering at the headquarters of a Shaikh who was in disgrace. I imagine that when he was informed of this, it v/ould have some effect on him, and on his prestige among his people, and might in itself force him to send the correct letter. If the Shaikh^** gathering for any reason could not be held at Debai, then we could announce to all the Trucial Shaikhs that owing to the Shaikh of Sharjah having broken his promise to His Majesty^ Government, the gathering could not be held and they consequently and their people would be de prived of their enjoyment on account of the breach of faith by the Shaikh of Sharjah. (e) Should the Shaikh still prove obdurate, then we shall have to get sanction from His Majesty*s Government to deal with his pearling fleet. 6. In addition to getting the Shaikh to sending the necessary letter, there is a matter of principle involved, and if we let the Shaikh get away with it, and not act up to his word, the general effect on the Trucial Coast will be unfortunate. 7. It may be that the Shaikh will produce the correct letter straight away, and all the above may not be necessary, but in view of the delay involved in communicating between here and Bahrain and vice versa I thou^t it best^in case of eventualities, to save time by considering possible measures now.

The position is that the Shaikh gave a definite promise to Kickihbotham in September last year that he would accept the Political Agreement and the exchange of letters. The following is an extract from Kickinbothan's report M The Shaikh stated to me that in view of the excellent relations which had always existed between himself and the Bri tish Government and his fervent wish to farther these relations he had decided that he would accept the Political Agreement with out alteration and the exchange of letters. He further stated that he regretted the amount of time which had elapsed and he trusted that we would realise that it was entirely due to the fact that he was unaccustomed to dealing with documents such as those with w;ich he had been confronted. I thanked him for his decision and asked him if I could rely entirely on what he had now told me. He stated that most certainly I could rely on it and that I had his word which he would not go back on and that he was writing that evening to his cousin the Shaikh of Has al hhaimah to inform him of the decision as they had been in agree ment over this matter.

It has already been decided in conversation that the Chiefs' Gathering should be abandoned this year, and letters have been written to the Trucial Coast Shaikhs who have been invited, informing them of this deci sion and, briefly, of the realms for it. 3, It now becomes necessary to report the matter to His Majes ty* s Government and to state that local pressure is being brought to bear on the Shaikh, Since local pressure amounts to no^ more than a stoppage of travel papefcs, or more euphemistically the withdrawal of good offices of His Majesty's Government, it is conceivable, if indeed not probable, that this action alone will not produce the desired result. It would therefore seem advisable that His Majesty's Government should be requested to approve in {Signature)- 2 - nr advance the further action contemplated in paragraph 5(e) of your Sxpress letter No. 77-S dated the 27th January 1938, namely the stoppage of the pearling fleet.

In making comparisons there are two aspects to be borne in mind which bear on the acceptability to Rulers and to the Company : (a) The general form and conditions as regards the extent of the rights &amp; privileges of the Company, also to what extent the Ruler is bind ing himself, permitting foreign penetration, and assuming responsibilities both himself and to other Governments. Political Agreements where they exist would come under (a). (b) fte financial side immediate &amp; future in which drilling obligations can also be included as recently these are inclined to be associated by Rulers. 2. i (a) Except where Political Agreements are involved usually provides few difficulties. |(b) In general usually follows agreement on (a) with considerable haggling over individual clauses. ifne Company usually obtaining the additions or modifications they require by increases in payments. 3, Comparison: v«estern Arabia, El Hasa &amp; T.C. Sheikhdoms . (a) As regards para 1(a) - general conditions and terms there are no substantial differences. Some minor ones are - (i) Period of Concession . ’Western Arabia ) &amp; ) 60 years El Hasa ) Trucial Coast - 75 years. (ii) Area covered . Western Arabia &amp; El Hasa : Very extensive - no exceptions nor restrictions, and security assured. Trucial Coast . Areas comparatively small. Restrictions in certain areas and security in some parts coubtful.(iii) Refineries. Western Arabia ) Commitments regarding El Hasa ) refineries. Trucial Coast - No obligations. Western Arabia and El Hasa owing to the enormous differences in territory cannot be compared with Trucial Coast sheikhdoms, as regards initial and annual payments (i.e. payments prior to the dis covery of oil and the usual royalties dependent upon actual quantities produced). Thoseof the Saoudi areas are naturally much larger. (li times Qatar, six times smaller sheikhdoms and possibly twice what Abu Dhabi will eventually accept. The concession terms can be seen in detail from Analyses available in P.C.L. office, Bahrain &amp; London. In general it might very easily appear to Trucial Coast Rulers that the Saoudi Arabia concessions were more desirable than those offered them.PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LTD. BAHRAIN I ^ PERSIAN GULF. .

Dear fo/ctylt/H A With reference to the telegram you shewed me yesterday, my private opinion is that there is everything in favour of the suggestion that Ivlr .Longrigg should come out with wide powers. He is an exceptionally clever man with also a very exceptional knowledge of Arabic spoken and v/ritten. He is a fully qualified and experienced negotiator (in other Arab territories) apart from many years in senior posts in the Political Dept, of Iraq.

Memorandum * With reference to our discussions of the 15th and 16th February in regard to visits to Manama and Jebel Faiyah. 2. With regard to Manama, this is in territory claimed by Shaikh of Ajzaan and he has assured us that he can arrange a visit for your geologists at any time without difficulty* Your Company however do not think a visit to i&amp;anama alone is worthwhile f-nd wish to combine it with a visit to Jebel Faiyah. 3* Jebel Faiyah is in territory claimed by the Shaikh of Sharjah* We have approached this Shaikh but in spite of promises he has been unable so far to arrange a visit. 4. In the schedule to the Sharjah Oil Concession it is laid down tnat H until the Shaikh permits the Company in wri ting the Company may not enter for the present or undertake any work in the two areas named Al-Fayah and tali Al-Hulu M . The Schedule was signed on the 17th September 1937, and the Shaikh has had now five months in which to arrange for a vi sit. Your Company may now be of the opinion that with this lapse of five months, the phrase 'for the present' may bt» held to have been expired, and should the Shaikh in reply to a definite enquiry from you refuse to give the written promise envisaged in the Schedule clause quoted, they may wish to invoke Article 10 of the Agreement dated the 12th November/-«• 2*» November 1937 between Hie Majesty' a Government end the Company* 5. .in this connection I may point out that the Shaikh oi Ajruan has intimated that he can arrange for f&gt; vj^it of your geologists to Jebel Faiyah - though it is not in territory claimed by him - as he is on friendly terms with the Beni Kitab who inhabit that area, 6, X should be glad to know the views held by your Company on this question.

The Company are well aware of the intimation given to the Shaikhs referred to above, but I suggest that their attention be again drawn to it. 4 # The reason why the Shaikhs concerned ? in s ^ite of this intiaation ; ars still holding out against Petroleum Concessions Limited is that they are not convinced that His Majesty's government mean what they say. 5. As time goes by and the ShaiKhs, by not being permitted to enter into negotiations with any other Company should they ah ow signs of wishing to do so, realise that Hie ^Jesty’e government do rae^n to abide by tneir intimation, and that it ie in fact a case of hobs on* s choice i.e. Petroleum Concessions Limited or none, I have little doubt that they will accept Petroleum Concessions Limited’s terms more or less as they stand at the moment. It seems to me therefore that the Comp ny should stick to their original terms and leave the 3m hens alone. In these circumstances I see no point in Longrigg coming out at the present Juncture. His visit would I tninic cxfirm the Shaikhs* impression that the Company have themselves doubts about His Majesty’s Covernment *b intimation to them, and consequently are in a hurry to conclude negotiations. 6. 71th regard to /bu Dhabi.

Tnis conaiste of tne woida *na» been conferred on me by tne tfovernment in tneir Agreement 4tn tne Company 4 and la of no importance. 4. The addition ( b) la tne final aentence of nia letter. This final sentence in my opinion goes definitely against elauae 3 (a) of ^Jraft «o. 1 of our letter to the Snaikh and ^ould seem to Tit late tne Agreement made in tne first para graph of nla letter. o. m spite of mucn argument on tne part of Captain 'lalloway on 8ubse&lt;|ient occaaionu, wno as Aaaletant political Agent Bahrain vaa on tna Trucial coast on special duty* tne Shaikh refused to produce the correct letter. 6. this being so* I hare informed tne Un&amp;ifcii that in my opinion he naa definitely gone back on hi a promise to his Majesty's Government made to Captain iicfcinbotn&amp;m. 7. 1 am informing tne GhaiJ&amp;A that as ne has broken nio promise to His aajesty** Government ne has no right to tneir good offices. This will include stoppage of travel papers for himself and his subjects. This action carries out our policy on the frucial Coast of the principle of tribal responsi bility* and is the only means of pressure sm.cn 1 have at at disposal. a. ihould tnis form of pressure not produce tne correct letter /letter witnln a reasonable tlme 9 on wnicn point X #U1 report in due course, more drastic means will nave to be employed* These might conveniently t^ice tne form of informing the Shaikh that if he was still obdurate, his pearling fleet would have to be dealt with on the lines wnicn were contemplat~ ed on two previous occasions in connection with tne Shaiichs of Usco-al-^uwhin arid Abu Dhabi* 9. Apart from tne particular instance of tns ttnaxfcn of Sharjah breaking nis promise, there le a general attitude of obstruction arid opposition to Hie .majesty’s (Jov«?rrsaent, both latent arid patent, amongst tne snaiicna of tne Trucial Coast at tne present juncture, which is causing ms some concern* The Shaikh of Has aJL Kmimah, for instance, was guilty some time ago of an act of extrema discourtesy to one of Hie /hfcjeety’e Sloops, and nao refused to send a letter of regret to tne Senior Jtaval Officer. In conse^ence of this I have informed nim that he will not receive tne good offices of nis Majesty 9 s Government, which includes tne fhoilltiee of his travel papers. Some men tns have passed by since ne wae Informed of this, but hitherto ne has been obdurate. The various other Shaikhs, as you are aware, are adopting an extremely obstructive attitude towards tne entirely reasonable terms of Petroleum Concessions limited. There seems in fact to be a general feeling that tne Shaikhs of tne rrucial Coast oan flout with impunity ths authority end wishes or iiis Majesty 9 * Government. *0. in these circumstances, apart from the desirability of procuring tne correct letter from the tina.kn of Snarjan, I consider /rionfidcnt ial. a o, C/72* Office of tne Political Resident in tiie Persian Gulf, Canp, Bahrain. hated tne 16tn Pebruary, 193b.

Political Agent, BahrainAbu Thabi 3rd February 1938. pggx Mr • bon^r p Since arriving herQ I have not been able to report ixy progress in the negotiations. Ihe Ruler, a young man of about twenty eight years of age, is absolutely adamant in his refusal $o iiigotiate on the terms of the Draft Agreement. He insists upon being given the same conditions as Ibn Saud and states that he will sign g similar agreement if he sees the signature of Ibn Saud. Ihe impossibility of this has been very thoroughly pointed out to him and the great difference between his territory and that of Ibn Saud has also been thoroughly explained. Although every member of his family has tried to convince him he is still stubborn. I was able this morning to have a private talk with his uncle Khalifa, a man of well over eighty years of ago, who was responsible for making Shakboot the Ruler, and he has promised to do his best to convince him to come into agreement. Khalifa has recently be^n suffering from gout and was therefore unapproachable until now. The three broxhers Heaza, Khalid and Zayid are still ou* hawking and are not expected back until the Rid, about the 10th February, and Shakboot might possibly be marking time until their arrival. However he gives me the impression of being absolutely (i«t«nnined to get what he wants. If I can win over the brothers the total isA^at of opinion might force Shakboot to capitulate. At first the question Of the option having expired was discussed understand th^.t sn extension would b&lt;i welcomed but/Shakboot has even decided against this and has repeatedly said ' either Ibn Baud’s agreement or nothing'. The (paestion of money he pretends is of very secondary importance but f from conversations in which hs hao made comparisons of other count?5 with his own I think we shall have even greater trouble. At the moment he is very hard up and although the Eid is approaching, when be will have a fairly heavy expenditure, he still refusoS to extend the option. His reputation locally is that once having made a decision he sticks to his word. H&amp;jji is going to have a private t*lk with him tonight after prayers and try to fathom the reason for being so stubborn. Prior to my arrival Capt. Galloway cam® here and tried to get the Ruler to agree to an. aerodrome being laid out at Braimi but was met with a flat refusal and no definite reason was given.My personal relations with Shakboot are excellent and I attend the burza both in the morning and in the afternoon and he delights in naving me with him. After the coffee has gone round we discuss A multitude of subjects and he is very interested in what goes on in the world and asks innumerable questions. Aided by travel books written by Bertram Thomas, Philby, Freya Stark and others I am able to illustrate with the aid 01 photographs other parts of Arabia. He is accutely interested in this. Everyone tells me that my personal relations are getting bettor every day' and that it will only be a question of time, but I can see no sign myself as yet. However I suppose it is early yet and tha arrival of his brothers and the pursuasions of his uncle might alter his outlook. A few words on the history of the Ruler's family dih^ihg the past few years might be of interest. Hamdan, uncle of the Ruler was killed by Sultan, his own brother and father of the Ruler. Sultan in turn v/as killed by his own brother Saqr. Saqr in turn was killed by a slave, and it is said by order of Khalifa. When Shakboot was mad# Ruler the sons of Saqr swore vengeance ad for about eight years Shakboot never left the fort. Owing to the state of his health he was pursuaded to go to Baghdad and he stayed there for six weeks being treated by a doctor. Recently when Galloway came here the launch arrived after dark •*ud anchored in the kb or two miles from the town. On being advised of a strange craft having arrived Shakboot sent out guards fearing that his cousins had come. I do not suppose that the history of this family differs much from that of many others on tne coast but in the case of a nervous parson it might have a ver^p^e effect. I have been told that Shakboot rather faars hj s/brothers and for that reason appears to be very determined unless h© sacs that they do not agree with him. Ajman's option expired on 22nd January. Previously the Ruler bad given me his sworn word to sign the concession on the expiry of the option. I paid several visits during the ten days prior to tb® 22nd but found the Ruler suffering from a severe go of malaria, khall I extend the option if I am unable to finish here, I hops to be able to give you some better news in my next reporttar Abu Thabi 11th February 1938* Mr* Iiongrigg, I wrota you a short raport on tna 3rd February id s»nt you a ^alagram by launch yastarday to tka affact that tha il«r hara and his brothers are still datarminad to get Ion Saud editions• H.Y.K. nad no luck in his private talk with lakbnot and I tackled tha uncla, Kkalifa 9 who promised to do his igt, but to all appaarances ha has lost ine power he once hud 0 On tha 9th 1 informed Si:iakboot that as ho seomed itfrminad to gat soma thing that tha Company could not possibly him, it would appaar that I was wasting my time and his in ilks which only had tha ona rasult.

Tfe# R'iilar agraad that what I hud said was true but added that [o tsd definitely made up his mind to agree to no other concession u similar one to Ibn 5aud« I then pointed out that his ua\oghbouxs had both agreed ■ th the Company and added that I hoped I would not see both Ljd, Sharjah and Qatar benefit whilst his country remained ^ it was and perhaps bwenme even poorer through peo|&gt;le leaving h order to obtain emrjleyment in those sheikhdoms. His reply to this was that sven if his country did become iccrer be would never change his mind. After a little more talk I ended by asking him he a tiend not to decide now but to think it over and to discuss jt with hie brothers and other members of his family. I Hi* reply to this was that he had very definitely mads his mind and that on my arrive! he had bid me welcome and kut on my departure he would bid me farewell. I again repeated that I would like Kin to discuss the uiness once more with kis family. H.Y.K. than quoted a few pieces of poetry and added a ibl* cr two and than began to pursu&amp;d© the Ruler to reconsider li decision, pointing out that it was at the Ruler's invitation lit wc were here, and that we had come at his express wish to iscuss the oil agreement# Tho Ruler replied that H.Y.K. was considered an old fiend and an old man whom they rospectod, but that nothing he mid say would alter his decision. Eq added that H.Y.K# was tosidtred as their father but if he continued to talk in the Kf be was doing he would be considered an enemy !, H.Y.K. thanked him for the kind words he had spokenand ^ *«d him to accept the advice of sin old man and to talk over business k±±* as Mr. Lermitte had asked him. ike Ruler replied that as far as the money was concerned 1 would leave that entirely to Mr. Lermitte, but as fr-r as end-Uiojis were concerned he was not going to give up his tots and tnat he would consider anyone who pursuaded him P bo this to be a traitor as well as an enomy. H»Y.k. then reminded the Ruler that it was at his fetation that he was there, find that he had been asked to r P r ®8«nt in order to give his advice. I I The Ruler then flew into a rage, gripped his sword and Pitted to call H.Y.K. all sorts of names, and in sherj lost his | P 9r Coin Pl«tely. Everyone was dumfounded and I looked around,L# assembly and. saw a look of consternation and surprise on the face of everyone present* 1‘he words and phrases used were amazing and I have &amp; #v«r heard such streams of invective. At times his speech was quit* unintelligible. lionever, having got it off his chest he turned te bi* and asked me whether I had anything more to say. I replied Lat for the moment I had not, but that he was to always rtattmber that I was ready to help him in any way he wished *nd that I hoped he would talk over the business after leaving tii« meeting. He thanked me and conversation became once more normal. During the talks nobody spoke a word even when ippea3.ed to by either H.Y.K. or myself. Kveryone seemed to |e dumb, or frightened to say a Bin&amp;le wo»d. To—day is the Eid el Kebir and after the usual Kid prayers I called on the Ruler who was sitting outside the fort surrounded by thousands of bedu and sitting with all the Mnb«rs of mis family 0 I was v*ry well received and was given tic* place of hono^.ir between Sh^kbbot and Khalifa and found that thiy had awaited TAy arrival before distributing the usual sweets coffse etc. I had a very friendly chat with them all and after Aalf an hour I loft* One of the things the Ruler said whilst he was sozmvhjtt angry was 'I will never accept these conditions unless you try by force to fight me ^t’harbni bil gowa) and even then I will do my best to defeat you and if I am beaten 1 will then be excused by everybody. Previous to this meeting I had of course had talks with the Ruler, his uncle Khalifa and Nos 7*8,9* &amp; 10 mentioneu or. page 1. Tilth the exception of the Ruler I had found that •veryone wished to help and if feat they say is true they did k*lp. Both H.Y.X. and myself have used every possible argument •&amp;&lt;* thoso who have helped have also done their best. Various bits of news were brought back to me after sittings in the fort aight at which only relations wore present* and the only possible deduction is that we have a very stubborn and ignorant ^ 01j a£ man to deal with who is very proud and likes to get his way ^ everything. Various factors may have influenced him and a lew 1 eive b.low. 1« He is very proud and will not be considered like the other Rulars on the 'irucial Coast© 2. He is afraid that if anything happens in the future* Xtct ly what he will not say, his bedu will blame himL 0 r not having signed an agreement similar to ifeji Saudia Arabia,, L ig afraid that the Oovemmont might interfere ov/ing t0 the very large number of slaves in Abu Thabi territory.

Apparently he visited here some time age and stated that the Ruler should preserve his rights and stick to his demands, even though/ the Company is an English one. On the 8th the Euler told me that he had received an invitation from the P.R. to attend the meeting of the Coastal iheikhs at .aha*jah on the 28th and wanted an excuse for not Itttnding and thought it aj^ good idea if he wrote saying that ie would be unable to be present owing to the negotiations. The following day he told me tnat he had dedided to accept and was jUaving here on the l6th 0 Since beginning this page I have received the return risit of the Ruilr, his uncle Khalifa and all the members of the toaily. They arrived at 8.30 p.m. and stayed till 10. They were ill in a very good mood and the visit passed off exceptionally wli, and despite the fact that they had been feasting all day tkty did good justice to the fare I provided. If I do not find any signs of improvement I propose to here a day or so before Shakboot leaves for Sharjah, and I will then have the opportunity of seeing the P.R. Tomorrow and the day afthr are also considered as Eld toys here and there will not be much opportunity for business I hope to be able te get some news of what was said amongst family after our rather tempestuous meeting of yesterday. It has been blowing a gale all the afternoon and it is ri *Uy bad at the moment, the atr is full of dust and what are ,u PP°sed to be windows are absolutely useless.Having discussad soma of tha reasons why the Ruler does n0 t want to accept our draft agreement we must now consider what can be done and whether we can offer him an agreement in a different form 0 1 e Is there anything objectionable inthe Saudia Arabia agreement which would prevent its being offered hereo It is of course understood that there are many things which would not be applicable to this territory, 2. hoes the Company want to offer any other agreement, or does it want the Coast to have only one form of agreement. 3. Would it create discontent with the Rulers who had already signed if another agreement is offered. 4. There seems to be no way out atthe moment except to change the form of agreement in order to appease his pride. 1 Throughout the negotiations I have repeatedly said that the Company cannot bring the Saudia Arabian .Agreement, I, of course, am not in a position to say whether the Company can afford to play a waiting game, but it is my considered opinion that the Ruler will not change. On my previous visit the Ruler’s brother Heza’a did most of the talking but this time ha has net opened his mouth. It is impossible and even dangerous to offer the brothers something in order to bring them over, although they themselves would like it. The Ruler and his three brothers all live together in the fort and any approach made would at once be known. stated during his tirade that if any of his brothers took a present he would consider him as a traitor and deal with him accordingly. I do not think that I am being bluffed, although the bedu are adepts at that. The family are typical Bedu and wear their hair in long plaits and not one of them even wears sandals. I will continue here until I see that signs are reallg being made for the Ruler to leave en route for the meeting at Sharjah. The usual letter, P.C.L. or nobody, has been received and the Ruler replied that if he could not agree with that Company ke would be free to negotiate with any other he pleased. This report I amafraid is very pessimistic but you can be assured that we have done everything possible to get the Ruler to agree but have always met with the same reply.6 0 Qq my last visit tks Ruler insisted on tke Koweit jtgretiaent but kas presumably ckanged after realising that iCoweit company is not a part of P.C.L. I kave tried tu mention Muscat but tke Hulter refuses to kear anytking said about tkat territory, se it kas b«en impossible to make any headway on tkat line* Qatar no ckasses witk tke other Rulers wko kave already signed. Althougk he kas been told by some Bedu tkat Ue Company is drilling in Qatar it kas not altered his decision in any way. Financially tae territory is very poor, tke taxes are less tkan in any other and tke quantify of trade is very small indeed, practically tke whole of tke revenue is from pearling and tke rake off on tkat is less tkan in tke other sheikhdoms on tke coast. Please communicate with me as usual, I shall try to kave another go at Ras A1 Khaimah if I leave here and so will be nearer te Sharjah. I kave received an invitation to visit the Ruler of Ras A1 Khaimah and this mighf mean tkat he kas reconsidered kis decision. P.S. Food and water are a real problem here. Vegetables, fruit and meat are unebtainable and I kave to bring all from Dubai. Water is undrinkable and tke amount of undiluted sea water I have had to drink under tke guise of coffee is amazing. I bring all water from Dubai and am never without visitors wko call for a real cup of coffee followed by a glass of Bombay water. Fisk is only obtainable when tke weather is fine. Wechavo been absolutely cut off for several days owing to bad weather. The ford cannot be crossed even by camels wko kave been held up for several days, luckily I brought big stocks nafi with me and kave a flock of sheep ^d numerous chickens and ample water.© Abu Ihabi 15th February 1538. ])0*r , SiixCe writing you on the 11th I have had an interview with &amp;h*ikk Khalifa, the undo of Shalcboot, who t©ld ; that ^aa dene his utmost to try and pursu&amp;de his nephew to discus^ o*n dralt agreeiaent but witheut rosulto Shakboot absolutely rofus/od to consider this step aud only rapoatod his old war cry of 'I want Ibn Saudis agreement ©r nothing ,; # Khalifa is very crestfallen and has now appealed to me to bring tills agreement and thus solve the difficulty ! 0 I asked whether the brothers were of the same idea*and was assured that they were willing to discuss our draft agreement and when I asked why they never spoke in the mejlis when appealed zs was told rt ifiuin Ichajl&amp;nin' they are ashamed of their brother.

I reminded him that last year he had arrang ed for a party of geologists to visit Baraimi, why could hs not do so again this year V He could give no adequate reason for his refusal, but persisted in it, and relapsed into a sulky silence which continued until the end of his visit. 4.

Before finally signing Shaikh demands to see draft Political Agreement and in first place Lermitte is showing him agreement used for Dubai. 3. It is now essential to be ready for possible signa ture and Sharjah experience proves the importance of elimi nating delay over Political Agreement.

I realise that Shaikh may change his mind again or even use Political Agreement as excuse for refusing conces sion but present position is that non-existence of official draft Political Agreement is d elaying concession.

Whether he will keep to his word I do not know, but from previous experience of His Excellency I think it highly probable that he will invent some excuse or other to yet further delay. He informed me that he wanted to discuss the Political agreement with the P.A. # This x&amp;ight be an excuse to get the P.A. to take the trouole to visit hi* and at the same time not to sign. However I a* visiting hi* to-day and will infora the P.A. of the latest situation on his arrival. I sum not asking for any money to be sent as according to the agreement the payment need be paid within 30 days of signature &lt;aid as this is highly problematical it is not worth while incurring expense and going to all the trouble until the signature is actually obtained. I still have Rj. 15000 in hand as an extra incentive, if necessary. My idea in asking the P.A. to bring the necessary papers was because he was coming on other business and there was a slight chance of concluding this as well. If I find the Ruler in a good mood and I think it wortn while for tne P.A. to pay a visit to Has A1 Khaimah, I will inform him of this. His visit might greatly help and it will be an opportunity, if things seem likely to pan out right, to visit him and to get to know him. It is only a two hours uncomfortable ride from Sharjah.2. At tli* noaent the Rulers are rather chary of concluding eny agreement as they are all watching the outcone of the Sharjah efforts to get into the hinterlancU There are other reasons of course which are put f orv/o.ji'i oat tiicjy do not to uio to Hfigpg true© I borrowed Sheikh Said*s car last ni-ht and it Siidd a .uieej. und 1 was stranded ip the desert for four hours© No tools, jack or anything !* X hope lay own chariot will be ready to—day* As time is getting near for sending this to the plane I aa addressing a couv of this to the P.A.

Dear Mr. Weightman, I would refer to my discussion with Sir Trenchard Fowls and you to-day on the subject of landing of cargo from steamers at Dubai, As you know, we do the landing work for The Bahrein Petroleum Jo.,Ltd., and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., here and on the Mainland, and it has occurred to me that in the event of ajv Oil developments taking place at Dubai, we may probably be asked to do this work for the latter there. Should this ultimately take place, it would probably assist matters if it oould be arranged for us to also look after the landing of the commercial cargo at Dubai in the same way as we do here, i.e. , SUpply boats and labour, land cargo from steamers under our ^ncy and pay the Sheikh 5%. At present, the landing work at D ubai i s in the hands of the Sheikh. The matter is not urgent but any assistance you can give us with this object in view will be greatly appreciated.

It has been reported from time to -Dime that some of the Shaikhs believe this pronouncement to be 'wind” and it is needless to argue again how devastating the result would be in loss of prestige and political control on the ^racial Coast if His Majesty's Government resiled from the position taken up. I can conceive only one circum stance which would justify the withdrawal of the ultimatum, and that v ould be a publicly proclaimed statement that P.C.L. had forfeited the confidence of His Majesty's Government and were therefore no longer considered suitable concessionaires on the j.rucial Coast| but that such a proclamation might be made can scarcely enter into the fieli of practical politics. Thus the position is that vis-a-vis the Shaikhs His Majesty's Government are, as it seems to me, finally committed. 2. The question arises whether other political considera tions may arise of sacp overwhelming weight that His Majes ty' s Government must yield to them in spite of the inevita ble loss of control of a large section of the Arab Coast in the Persian Gulf, and in spite of the dan^er that that in volves to Imperial interests. At the present moment the only competitor company that need be considered seriously is the California Company. I have suggested in another connection that if, as seems inevitable, His Majesty's Government allow this Company, through its subsidiary the Bahrain Petroleum Company, to obtain a concession over practically the whole of/-4/- JF;! of the Bahrain Unallotted Area, they may be able to make considerable capital thereby for their dealings with the Company in respect of the Trucial Coast. 1 suggest that there are the following reasons for believing that the ar gument so developed should be decisive: (a) One may doubt if the California Company could count on active support from the United States Government in any demand for an open field on the Trucial Coast, owing to the existence o', 'strained relations' between the President of the UnitedStates and the big oil companies. The impression t:,at I have gathered here is that the California Company would not expect support from their own Government except in circumstances such as the sequestration of property which ' fie&gt; all each o//n, e.g. in aaudi Arabia. In any event the Ame rican component of P.C.L. (which I understand is actually strongt-r than California Standard) would presumably have not less influence in viashington and could be counted on to nul lify any attempt by the California Company to enlist United States Government support# (b) I very much doubt if the California Company would take the risk of offending us by indulging in the very problematic cal effort to obtain the support of their own Government in opposition to British interests# They realise only too well tlieir dependence in the Persian Gulf on British protection and| in their present circumstances, I have reason to know that they do not exclude the possibility of having to ask for that protection on the Hasa Coast if Ibn 3aud*s death is followed by anarchy dn the mainland. 3. I am aware that past history does not altogether sup port my contention, but it is a matter for consideration how far American pressure in regard to Kuwait, for instance, was &lt;hie to the presence in England of an American Ambassador who was himself one of the great n oil kings”.-3- 4.

How far one need take account of the possibility of competition from companies of less amiable nationality I do not of course know, but at least there are no obvious indi cations 0 f it so far. (one can now I think safely deride the Pastori - Diba scare.) 1 believe it would not be over whelmingly difficult m the last resort to counter such com. petition locally, but X prefer not to commit my ideas to paper unless and until the necessity actually arises. 6. In brief, therefore, X hold to the view that no devia- tion from our present policy need be considered in the visible future, and that, given freedom from major world disturbances, should be perfectly feasible to rely on 'mental attrition' tactics against the Shaikhs for at least the next two years, should this be necessary. sr-=asoOo=====5/- m] i r'OSSIBLE MODIFICATION OF THE POTTTTfMr EXCLUSION OP TH^HHAIKHS. The adherence of the Shaikhs to the Political Agreement between His Majesty's Government and P.C.L. has, I presume, hitherto been regarded as necessary to provide a lever to ' ensure that the Company abide strictly by the provisions of the Agreement. As a measure of control over the Shaikh and his treatment of the Company it is of course unnecessary, thagh it is true that the Company might lose by the disappearance of article 10 as part of an agreement accepted by the Shaikh concerned* 2. It seems to me that the essential articles in the Poli tical Agreement are Nos. 1 and 2 (read together), 9 and 11. All remaining articles can reasonably be held to be subsidiary to these four* 3. In so far as articles 1 and 2 are concerned, it could I think be held that the essential requisites can be met with the aid of the agreements given by the True-’a! Coast Shaikhs ir 1:22 not to grant concessions to persons (which includes companies) except those 'appointed by the High British Govern, ment'. What applies to the grant of a concession can reason ably be held to apply equally to its transfer. A further safe- standard guard is provided by the article in the/(P.C.L.) sommereial agreement that 'the Shaikh agrees that the Company may transfer their concession to a British Company to be called Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Limited or to any other company register ed within the British Emnire V Obviously however this safeguard is less effective than the 1922 Agreement. 4* As for article 9, and the pre-emption schedule, this can, one supposes, be regarded as unnecessary when one comes to practical facts. Whether or not there be a pre-emption c lause at all. His Majesty’s Govermnant would undoubtedly take whatever oil they want in the event of war*5. Article 11 ia, I think, really the crux of the situa tion. Though in point of fact it provides for arbitration, the question clearly arises from this article whether or not His Majesty's Government can impose their will on the Company without the aid of the Shaikh. It seems to me that there are two safeguards, one at present existing and one which must come in course of time. The former is the approximate 50% British capital in the Company and the latter will be the inevitable Order-in-Council which must in time be applied to each of the Trucial Coast Sheikhdoms in which the Company operates. Should His Majesty's Government find that the Company deliberately contravenes the terms of the agreement between them, it seems to me that they could rely pr^being able to take action against the property of the Company in the Sheikhdom concerned through the powers conferred by an Order-in-Council on the local poli- tical authorities. 6. I do not for one moment think that any modification in the 1 clitical Agreement or in the method of e xchapge of notes with the Shaikhs concerned, cumbersome though it undoubtedly is, would have any useful result on negotiations so long as the Shaikhs are required to adhere to seme form of Political I think Agreement. It is/true true to say that our insistence on the Shaikhs* adherence to the Political Agreement is an impediment to the Compands negotiations for commercial agreements, though it would be entirely w rong to Suggest that the exclusion of the Shaikhs entirely from the Political Agreement would b e a panacea for all difficulties. Putting it briefly, if it is accepted that His Majesty*s Government can ensure the Company*s strict observance of the Political Agreement without dragging in the shaikhs then it is well worth while to omit the Shaikhs from it since negotiations for commercial agreements should be quite considerably facilitated thereby, even though the immediate satisfactory conclusion of negotiations should not be expected on this score alone.- k,k. -3- i^&gt; 7. On the other hand the one thing which 1 do regani as most important is to insist on His Uajesty-s Government's approval to any Bank which might be st up in any Shaikh* s territory as a result of oil exploitation. A Bank is pe culiarly well situated for becoming the focus of hostile propaganda or intrigue, and it seems to me to be of the highest importance that if an when a Bank is established His Majesty's Government should be satisfied that its finan cial stability is fully matched by the political soundness of its direction. »o0o*2.3639/38.

The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement,/) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Ando- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan. south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference ot November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived 01 1 between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed by the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position in respect of Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 24-28 below). Bahrein. 8. Oil^ development in Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June. 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period of fifty-five years from the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-in Production during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. ( ) B .Y Political Agreement is meant in this memorandum an agreement between th® concessionary company and His Majesty’s Government, to which the Ruler concerned is usually an assenting party, by which the company undertakes not to transfer the concession non-British interests and to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government generally- 9.

Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein 1 etroleuin Company in their lease have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without J r definite result. 10. The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929 t he whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard 'Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oil' Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. tyntar. IT The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- Persian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937. Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. 12. Considerable difficulty has arisen between His Majesty s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Sand claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Sand’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they regard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Trucial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows :— 14 Ajman. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years. The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. 15 Abu Dhabi. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect of this territory for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the 22nd May, 1937, and Political Agreement dated the 5th February, 1937). No work has so far been carried out. 17. Ras-al-Khaimah. —The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 1st August, 1937. A political agreement, preceding the conclusion °f a commercial agreement, was signed on the 25th March, 1938. Negotiations for the latter are in suspense. 18. Sharjah. —Petroleum Concessions (Limited) hold a concession in respect °f this area for a period of seventy-five years (Commercial Agreement dated the tfth September, 1937; Political Agreement signed the 12th November, 1937). 19. D mm-al-Quwaim .—No option or concession has yet been obtained in j_espect of this territory, but the sheikh recently informed Petroleum Concessions (Limited) that he was “ willing to negotiate.' h f hn Protectorate. 20. An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been j e commended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of Wo years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in les pect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft °f the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1—1] b 24 !— o company, and sent to the Governor for consideration. In the meantime, Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploration party to the Protectorate (se$ also note under “ Muscat and Oman '). Saudi Arabia: (i) Red Sea Area. 21. The petroleum rights in this area were granted to Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 9th July, 1936. The concession runs for a period of sixty years and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia to a depth of 100 kilom. (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospecting work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arabia) (Limited) —the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited)—but with the exception of the Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) Nejd. 22. (a) Hasa. —The oil rights in this area were conceded to the Standard Oil Company of California by Ibn Saud on the 27th May, 1933. The con cession has since been transferred to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of which is wholly owned by Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally. The concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as set out in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows :— “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (including islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge of the Dahana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia, provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight line north, 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia, and from the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana, such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company and some oil has been found. It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels of oil per day has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein for refining. It is also understood that plans for the development of a port on the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary chart will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supplied by the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. 24. (b) Remainder of Nejd. —The position as regards oil exploration rights in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea area or Hasa area concessions, referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that the Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some kind ot an option on this territory, but details were lacking. 25. Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and the company agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the 27th May (referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi tion of two extra articles, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been inserted in their appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version of the (renumbered) article 35. . 26. The effect inter alia of these additional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California— | ‘ £ a preference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance ot Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area {i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between tn sedimentary and igneous formations.” His Majesty’s Government are not at present aware whether or wheie this “ contact line ” has been established. There is presumably an area uncov ^ t by any concession or preference rights between the “ contact line,’ - wherever may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession. 27.

A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California ul have the right to recover “by means of deductions from one-half of the alties due to the Government the amount of two loans totalling £50,000 gold reived by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. 28. On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government definino- the any’s preference rights in regard to (a) “the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia” referred to m paragraph 26 above, and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the iDDipany to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered t0 the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil fompany of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. fk Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the ittitude of the Imam Yahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how- fver. been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the [emen for a period of six months. hmt and Oman. 30. Two concessions^) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- ive years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in anyway with any political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Unseat and Oman. fofinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. My, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gnlf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a !1 Je to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons 3er annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. Oie agreement also provides for a re-examination of the question of the refinerv opacity in the event of the total annual production exceeding ] million tons i^r annum. ^-eruption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty’s Govern- J eil t and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured J'.lhe company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence Mich His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Govern- en t shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the ^cessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty’s Government have also bright to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have L ) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, : bwadur.in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position), produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the tirn provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and f take control of the company’s works, plant and premises. Similar provisi/! appear in the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and tt Koweit Oil Company. In the case of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will be provided for in the modified form of political agreement with which the Suit will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in a sepam agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessit (Limited). 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrer (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the SlieiS of Bahrein), but in view of the sheikh’s special treaty relations with Majesty’s Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency.

We have 'been giving further consideration to the question of what action, if any, we should take vis-a-vis the Sheikhs, and what advice we should give to Petroleum Concessions Limited, with a view to ending the present state of deadlock in the matter of oil concessions if no change in the situation has occurred oy the end of the six month 1 s suspension of negotiations. 3. We feel satisfied that, on their side&gt; the Company sre genuinely anxious to reach agreement, and only recently Longrigg has told us that if cash were the only obstacle in the way, the Company would be prepared, within limits, (and provided that in other respects the terms of the agreement v/ere satisfactory from their point of view), to go even further than their present offers in 'man, Lqh t o q y i.O.o., Postmaster, Karachi.A • order to clinch matters. But there would appear to he lio ole doabt thao the financial aspect is not the only stumbling block and that we must look elsewhere to find t tne reasons which have hitherto prevented the parties from coming to terms. For present purposes we need not consider Umm al Quwain, Ajman or Kalba since there is no reason to suppose that if the other Trucial Sheikhs agree to grant concessions these smaller States will not follow suit. ihe real difficulty is in regard to Ras al Khaimah and Abu Dhabi. As regards the former, it would appear probable that the Political Agreement has a good deal^ to do with the difficulty, even though, as stated by Fowle, it may not by itself actually have prevented the grant of a concession. At any rate the Company are quite convinced that but for our requirements in this respect the Sheikh would have put his signature to the Concession Agreement iast March, and they have therefore put forward very strongly their view that in the absence of some form of pressure on the Sheikh from His Majesty 1 s Government (and this seems hardly practicable) their only hope of c linching matters within a reasonable time is that they should be given unfettered freedom to negotiate and c °nclude an agreement with the Sheikh, leaving questions concerning/^M 0 3. concerning the Political Agreement aside until the concession has been signed. Fowle has suggested that in all the circumstances the best course to pursue would he to retain the Political Agreement as between ourselves and the Company hut not to require its cognisance hy the Sheikas, and I imagine therefore that you would see no objection to the course suggested by the Company; but before we consult the other interested departments in the matter there are two points on which we should be glad to have your views. „ Firstly, we feel, and have so informed Longrigg, that if v/e agree to leave the Political Agreement question aside for further consideration, it would be necessary for the commercial agreement to be endorsed, at the time of signature, by both parties, to the effect that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government. Longrigg, however, dislikes this as he thinks that it Might frighten the Sheikhs and he has suggested that if attach importance to the point the best course would Le for the Political Authorities to write at once to oach Sheikh reminding them that in accordance with their written undertakings any oil concessions which they t:1 ay grant hereafter will be subject to the approval °f His Majesty 1 s Government. We feel here, however, that/that any such communication might do more harm than good and tnat it mould he preferable to have the Concession agreement endorsed in the manner suggested. Would you please let me know v/hat you think? 6. The second point is this. Can you say v/hat are likely to he the reactions of the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Dehai if, in due course, we decide in the case of the other Trucial Sheikhs either (a) to modify or simplify the Political Agreements and complementary exchange of notes, or (h) to dispense altogether with the Sheikhs 1 co-operation in the Political Agreement; e.g. would they (and the other Sheikhs) regard it as a climb-dov/n on the part of His Majesty’s Government and if so hov/ far v/ould this result in a lessening of our prestige in that part of the v/orld? I now turn to Abu Dhabi. Here the position is different from that at Pas al Khaimah in th&lt; t although the Sheikh has been offered more generous terms than those actually accepted by his neighbours (and the offer is not necessarily the last word)? he persistently refuses to discuss business v/ith Petroleum Concessions Limited ’’except on the same terms as Ibn Baud”. To this the Company are unable to agree and so xar tne question/5. question of the Political Agreement 'between His Majesty’s Government and the Company has not arisen although the Sheikh is no doubt fully aware of our requirements in tuis respect, rrima facie the deadlock at Abu Dhabi appears to be more serious than elsewhere and we should therefore be glad to know whether you think there is any real likelihood of a change of heart on the part of the Sheikh should the Company attempt to re-open negotiations with him during the coming winter, and, if not, whether there is anything that we can do to induce him to see reason. Would it do any good, for instance, to send him a further note reminding him of the ’’P.C.L. or no one” ultimatum with a hint that His Majesty’s Government really mean what they say? 8* V/e should be grateful for your views as soon as possible.

Dear G-ibson* 'iiill you ple;ase refer to your letter P.Z. 6290/38 of the 3rd October? and previous correspondence? about oil concessions on the Trucial Coast. The admiralty’s views on the various points raised may be summarised as follows (1) The ultimatum of 1937 * We agree that His Majesty’s Government should not be led by the opposition of the outstanding Sheikhs to withdraw from the ultimatum restricting the Trucial Coast to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. (2) I mprovement in fi nancial off ers. There appears to us to be considerable danger that an improved financial offer at the present juncture by Petroleum Concessions Ltd. will have undesirable reactions on the Sheikhs who have already concluded agreements with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. on the terms originally offered. They may well consider His Majesty’s Government to be responsible for the financial loss which they will consider themselves to have suffered as a result of accepting? with the approval of His Majesty’s Government? concessions at less favourable rates. Further? improvement of terms as a price for resistance may have a bad effect on our subsequent dealings with the- Sheikhs generally. Nevertheless, it appears to us that the financial terms must remain primarily a question between the Company and the Sheikh? and therefore, if the Company are prepared themselves, without pressure from the Government? to improve their offer? we would be prepared to acquiesce. we/ $ibson? Lsq. ? India office, s.v. 1 .2 Me would, however, desire that, so far as possible, improvement should be in respect of payments between which direct comparison is difficult, rather than in the rate of .royalty, and that there should be as little obvious differentiation between the Sheikhs as possible. (3) Sheikhs co-operation i n Political .igreemen t. The admiralty has felt considerable doubt as to the advisability or necessity bf relaxing, for the Sheikhs « of ^ibu Dhabi and Ras al Khaimah, and the lesser recalcitrant Sheikhs, the formalities insisted on for instance at Debai. The reasons for our doubts may be summarised as follows (a) It is true that the need for co-operation in the Political agreement did apparently deter Ras al Khaimah from signing. This consideration has not, so far as we can see, arisen at ^bu Dhabi, and there is no indication that Abu Dhabi would fall into line if this accepted procedure were dropped. Ras al Khaimah, himself, having stood out so long, may be unwilling to sign on the original terms even if we relax this condition for him. Ve may well, therefore, be no better off, but have suffered some loss of prestige, if we give way on the Political Agreement at this juncture. (b) *hLso only after considerable discussion did we give v/ay, and then only partially, to the Sultan of Muscat, over the same question. It will not help our relations with him, if? after so much difficulty with him, we now give way, more easily, and more completely, to the lesser Sheikhs. (c) The Sheikhs’ sanction does appear, in spite of arguments adduced to the contrary, to be a valuable asset in certain contingencies. The safeguards in the agreements about which the .admiralty is particularly concerned are:- (i) the provision stipulating that the concessionnaire shall remain British. (ii) the Pre-emption clause attaching to the Political Agreement. (iii) the Refinery Agreements with the Companies. Provided the Company does in fact remain British, it should be possible to take action in this country to enforce the pre-emption and refinery a g r e c me n u • /3 . agreements. Oil Companies are ? hovvever, essentially international; Petroleum Concessions Ltd. itself is only partly British., and the validity of the agreement hetween His majesty's Government and the Company that it shall not change its nationality, seems doubtful. Further, if is always possible, by means of holding Companies, etc., or simply by purchase of shares, for transfer of effective control to be made to some second country without change in the nominal character of the Company. There may well be circumstances in the future in which? apart from some clear external sanction? we would have difficulty in enforcing our agreement with the original concessionnaire Company. The Sheikhs' sanction does provide a clear right to His Majesty's Government to enforce its original agreement, whereas without it it might prove, at the least, legally and politically difficult to take strong action against the ultimate controllers of the original Company. And? apart from such considerations, there may always be found loopholes or legal difficulties in the political agreements which might make action even against a British controlled company difficult, apart from a clearly defined final sanction. The existence of such a sanction, however, would in itself make the Companies less inclined to prove difficult or attempt evasion. In view, however, of the agreement of your advisers in the Gulf in favour of dispensing with the Sheikhs co operation? we would, if the India Office and other interested Departments are satisfied that this is the best course, not stand in the way of a new attempt, on this basis, with Ras al Khaimah, and, if necessary, Abu Dhabi. v/e are not? however, in favour of releasing Debai and • Sharjah from their existing obligations. Yi/e agree with your view that, if we are to decide now to drop the Sheikhs co-operation, it would not be worth while raising difficulty over an 'ondorsement' of the commercial agreement.

Dear Starling, Would youj^ndly refer to weightmim's demi- official letter No. C/602 of the 3rd September (a copy of which was sent to the Petroleum Department with India Office printed letter No. P.Z.6290/38 of the 13th September) and connected correspondence on the subject of oil concessions on the Trucial Coast ? ' ‘ ^ In considering this matter we have assumed at the outset that we are to maintain the embargo on other competitors and do what we can to assist Petroleum Concessions Limited to obtain the outstanding concessions. to what we can do to help the Company we may, it is suggested, advise them to try again this imtumn (but without outstaying their welcome). This the Company are prepared to do (and it is probable that Longrigg himself will -undertake the tas.h), but as you will have seen from the connected correspondence the Company are anxious that we should net require the remaining Sheikhs to co-operate, as Sharjah and Debai have done, in respect of the political agreement. They think that, but for this requirement, they would have obtained a concession from Ras-al-Khaimah last Spring. fe have no reason to suppose that this is not -ohe case, and as you will see Peight man and Fowle are definitely of opinion that we should fall in with the Company’s views. If this is done we should, of course, still insist on a Political/ Starling, Esq. , Petroleum Department (Mine s Department), Dean Stanley Street, S.T.1.2 . D Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company (including the important pre-emption clauses) and if it is thought desirable we could (as was suggested in your letter No. P.D.859/4 Port I of the 25th _pril last on the subject of the Muscat Oil Agreement) require the Company to include a clause in the commercial agreement to the effect that the concession shall only be transferable to a British Company registered in Great Britain and having its principal place of business in this country. It would, however, in any case, be provided in the Political agreement that the concession cannot be transferred without the prior consent of His Majesty’s Government, etc. (Article 2 of the Political agreement). It is true that an explicit sanction is obtained for the Political .agreement by the provision in exchanges of letters with the Sheikh and the Company whereby the former’s right is recognised to terminate the concession if the latter fail to observe the terms of the Political Agreement. But we feel that this additional safeguard is hardly required because the Company would in any case be so dependent on the goodwill of His Majesty’s Government and so amenable to pressure in various forms that they would be extremely unlikely to fail to observe the terms of the agreement. Me accordingly feel that in all the circumstances any risk of such failure is one that can be safely taken and that it is outweighed by the difficulties of getting the Sheikhs to grant concessions if they are required to underwrite (as it were) the Political agreements and we trust that you will be able to agree with us on this point. If the principle is accepted that the Sheikhs may be left out of the Political agreement certain details will have to be settled. Firstly, there is heightman’s suggestion that the Rulers/3. Rulers of Sharjah and Dedal should he released forthwith from their obligations in respect of the Political Agreement* Powle’s viev/ with which we strongly agree, on this point, is that we need not at this stage release Sharjah and Debai from their obligations and that matters should be left as they are unless and until the Sheikhs themselves raise the question. Secondly, there is the point (discussed in paragraph 3 of Peel's demi-official letter to heightman No. P.Z.3684/38 of ■ ^ 25 th and paragraph 2 of height man ’ s reply of the 3nd September) regarding the necessity of having the concession agreement accompanied by an endorsement or clause, which would be binding on both parties, to the effect, that it is subject to His Majesty's Government's approval. Longrigg has again expressed his objections to this as he feels strongly that any further insistence on the rights of His Majesty's Government will almost certainly hamper his negotiations particularly in the case of Ras-al-Khaimah. When putting this point to Weightman it was assumed that^a decision in regard to the Sheikhs co-opcration in respect of the Political Agreement would not be taken untix ohe concession agreement had been signed; but if we are to take this decision now it seems to us (and Powle agrees) that the need for re-emphasising the position of His Majesty s Government no longer arises. The Company fully understands that, in accordance with the general oil undertaking signed by the Sheikhs ourepproval of the concession is required, and there is no reason to anticipate that they will be difficult in the matter of the Political agreement, which moreover could be ready for signature perhaps simultaneously with, or at any rate soon after, the concession agreement. In/In any case the point can he put in writing to the Company beiore negotiations are re-opened. \7e should he glad to learn whether you agree. I am sending a similar letter to the Foreign Office and Admiralty. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) J. p. Gi.hson.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 19-S of 1939.

Trucial Coast Oil© Cofiy / 39/24 Confidential Dubai 22nd February 1939, Dear Packer, I have not been able to report any definite progress in negotiations here as yet owing to the following circumstances After my return from Abu Dhabi I visited both Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain and received similar replies from the two Shaikhs. They both wanted to sign an agreement but wished to be the last* After explaining that they could not both he last I commenced with Umm al haiwain and gave him a rough draft of an acploration permit which he is going to show to his two brothers. He, however, wishes to have a concession and is going to try and convince his brothers. Some days ago one of his men murdered one of the Beni Kitab tribe and so Ahmed bin Rashid has had to go to Falaj Ali to arrange about the blood money with Fohamed bin Ali. Ajman was willing to talk business but suddenly went off in his pickup with ten men to Qatar. I do not think he will be able to get through as there has been very heavy rain recently in Abu Dhabi Territory and the subkha is not passable. The reason for his visit is not known and the H.A. is unable to give an explanation. So for the moment both Shaikhs are away. Has Al Fhaimah is still trying to change his agreement For the moment I am not showing any interest. Between the 2nd of February and the 15th February Has to sign a Mutual Protection Treaty. Umm Al Qaiwain, Ajman and Sharjah agreed to sign into a cone ession but is talking about 5 lacs on signature Al Khaimah was trying to get all the other Coastal Rulers At/-- 2 - / At Dubai he was given evasive replies and at Abu Dhabi he met with a blank refusal. During this period it was not possible to do any real work as all the rulers were awaiting the outcome of 'Ras A1 Khaimah^ efforts. The treaty was of course addressed chiefly against the Bani Kitab and Bank Kaab who occasionally raid Bas A1 Khaimah, Umm A1 Qaiwain, Ajman and of course Sharjah. Dubai is chiefly worried with the Awamir tribe who now and again run off with livestock and human beings. Has A1 Khaimah is worried about the Khawatir and Za^biltribes also the Shihu. The real reason for starting the treaty business was that if he signs a concession he does not want to part with any of the money to the bedu l I hope that Ahmed bin Rashid will be back in a few days with his brothers. Rashid bin Humaid of Ajman might have gone to see Sheikh Abdulla re the Na f im tribe in Qatar. Rashid is of course of that tribe. Cr he might have gone to see the Qatar Concession. I hear that Sultan bin Saqr is going to attack the Bani Kitab on the 10th ! This is not the first time he has fixed the date. I will let you know directly there is any sign of concluding with either of the two. Yours sincerely, Sd/- B.H. Lermitte. B. Packer, Esq., Bahrain.By Air Mail.
