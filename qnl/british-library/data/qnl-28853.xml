I am sending copies of this das patch to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department Jo.222. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) H.J # feymour. The Right Honourable, Ant ho ny Eden i!. C •»M. P., etc., etc., etc.. The Foreign Office, LOJBOJ.S.W.l.l. Lingulatio inaiviQuaiisni mus-c exiax. Quite so. Svery work on comparative philology says the same. 2. Incorporation and borrowing is inevitable. This is equally true. 3. Louptful wiaaoia of recent introauotion of Latin script in Turkey. A few years ago Iranians were watching tnis experiment closely and many competent observers thought that Iran would soon follow suit. The recent swing back (as evinced by the new order prohibiting tne use of foreign languages and scripts in shop signs and commercial institutions) has, of course,caused the lecturer to voice this doubt even if he does not feel it. 4. The universal desire of all Iranians to improve their mother tongue. An officially inspired utterance. Those Iranians who are not learning foreign languages in the course of business or in hopes of professional promotion are proud (and justly proudi of their own tongue. No change is desirable which would sever the connection with Iranian liter^ary or nati onal history. I am glad to he%r this. Had the 'back to Firdausi” seeuling continued to sprout with its initial rapidity the resulting crop of V»ardour Street Persian would have rendered an ode of Hafiz utterly unintelligible to any Iranian child of the next generation. Unnecessary Arabic words should be eliminated and re placed by old Persian words and new Persian words should be made out of old Persian roots. /itr\ - It is difficult to be brief in criticising this very ambitious project. Arabic is.probably,of all languages (not even exclud ing Greek or Latin) the one best suited for word building, 'rovided a verbal root exists which expresses the idea it is desire-i to convey, there is (in grammatical theory though not always in usage) almost no limit to the number of derivatives which can be formed. Such is the symmetrical perfection of this Semetic language. Persian, though a very fair specimen of an inflectional Aryan language, cannot compete. An Arabic dictionary will render ”he electrified” by most modem and widely-used Persian dictionary translates the same phrase by:- y V O/. yv However, no attempt to tell the Iranian what fun he could have had with the Arabic root will avoil and,if he has decided to do without it,we must see what material he has available for his own project. His own langua e is luckily very rich in suffixes to express the following ideas The doer, the place where something is done, the doing and the business of doing: The container, source or locality of anything: abounding in: causing, producing, displaying, similar to, made of,filled with,of the colour of etc.,etc. With these he will make shift. 7. The greatest ha rm to Persian has come ,not from imported but single Arabi c words^from whole phrases and their subjection to Arabic grammar rules even when used in Persian. Such phrases seem to me to fall into two broad categories viz*.- scriptural and lay. An example of the first category is a phrase continually on the lips of every Iranian. Though a national spirit seems to have replaced a religious spirit, /though- a thour^h the power of the clergy has been broken and thejr powers transferred to the oivil administration, though the average townsman is lax in his religious observances though,in brief, every effort has been made to reduce Islam in Iran to the position of a museum piece, old usages and phrases tmxliui die hard and it is very unlikely that any legislation will replace by An example of the second category is;- v-'Cii ^ ( on supposition) one of those unnecessary foreign importations used to 'shew off 1 by t &gt;ie would-be erudite. As regards these (of which there are many) I em in hearty agreement with the lecturer. (In this field A.P.H* would find ample scope). 8. one should try to recapture the dignity and simplicity of the period from the 4th to the 7th centuries of the Hegira and reject such Arabic words which came later. In trying to recapture some of the si iplicity and dignity of, for example, the 'Shahnameh' one can only hope the Iranians wont's recapttre its capacity to bore. The euphuistic,florid, bombastic style of Persian had a com ;&amp;ratively short existence {part of the 16th and 17th centuries under the Timurids) and simplicity and sweetness of diction has always been one of the chief eharias to the student of Persian. 9. In the absence of any correct Persian equivalent for a scientific term,such a term should borrowed direct from the forel&amp;n language in which it is current. Thit^amounts to an aphorism. It is ^ust what they have always done, e.g. (telegraph) from which, naturally, we get (a telegraphist) (a telegraph office), li(telegraphically )though,in j.act, in the above examples Arabic and Turkish suffixes and inflections have been used.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT PERSIA. f v July 1 , 1935.

ARTICLES of clothing have in recent years become more and more typical of political movements. In Europe the shirt is an essential item in many modern creeds. In Asia the hat has played a no less conspicuous part. The birth pangs of the regenerate Turkey will for ever be associated with the bowler hat. In Persia renaissance has equally had its hat, if not its head, and for better or for worse the Pahlavi hat has sheltered the awakening consciousness of those who more often than not forget to call themselves Iranians. But the Pahlavi hat has rested uneasily on its wearers’ heads. Neither becoming nor practical, it has never been popular. To devout Mahometans its protruding peak is a positive menace at prayer time, while on less solemn occasions its impeccable uniformity must have been the cause of acute distraction in gentlemen’s cloak-rooms. I have once or twice made nervous enquiries as to its permanence, and have usually been informed that it is a “ hat of transition.' This definition has now been justified. Like so many of the world’s glories, the Pahlavi hat has passed away. The good news became known to the general public on the day of the opening of the Majlis, the 6 th June last. But, if the story which reached my ears is true, certain of the inner circle seem to have been privileged with advance information. An official or junior member of the Government who was present when the decision was taken is said to have stolen from the room and made his way to the largest of the very few local emporia, where, in an unconcerned manner, he contrived to purchase almost the entire stock of European hats for 500 tomans. Shortly after the con clusion of this surprising transaction the manager was intrigued at receiving a similar bid from a second official who strolled into the premises. The story ends with the manager’s realisation of the situation and his repurchase of the hats from his first customer at double the price. Even so, I understand that demand has far exceeded supply and that the run on felt hats in the Lalezar can be compared to the gold rush of years ago. 2 . But a benign ruler has not thought only of the outer covering : he is equally concerned for the intellect within. The impurities of the Iranian language have for some time caused grave concern. There is a regrettable plethora of Arabic words (a sentiment which, for practical reasons, I fully share), there are modern tendencies and expressions which distort the ancient beauty of the language. Doubt has even been expressed as to the desirability of retaining the present Persian lettering. On the 20th May the Council of Ministers sanctioned the establishment of an academy for the Iranian language (“ Earhangestan-i- Iran ”), which is to be charged not only with the duties of the protection of the language on the lines of the Academic frangaise but is to stimulate scholarship and literary talent. In addition to purifying the language from foreign words and producing a grammar and dictionary, this institution is to “ guide thought towards the reality of literature and the nature of poetry and prose ” and to “ encourage poets and writers towards the creation of literary masterpieces.” I am sending a translation of the statute under separate cover in my despatch No. 253 of the 12th June, in case it may interest the School of Oriental Studies. 3. If the uniformity of the Pahlavi hat has disappeared, this is not to be taken as implying complete freedom in all other respects. On the 12 th June the Shah asked me if I had been present at the opening of the Majlis. When I replied in the affirmative, His Majesty expressed pleasure and remarked that if I had been there some years ago I should have noticed a great difference. Then all were attired in various garbs, there was no cohesion, no corporate feeling. On the 6 th June last the members were all dressed alike, there was uniformity and discipline; that was what a Parliament should be. Of course, in England it was [465 a—91different, but what was the use in many countries of a body of men who talked only for the sake of talking and with no knowledge of the subject, and he turned to General Hay and said “ Soldiers are much better : they are simple people and know what they have to do. ’ I reflected that on a previous occasion when I attended a debate in the Majlis I had been vividly impressed with the appropriate ness of a line from an Ancient and Modern hymn : “ We are not divided, all one body we. ” 4.

From enquiries which I have made in Tehran, it appears that in future the course of study at all the Armenian schools in Persia (that is, Tehran, Julfa, Tabriz, &amp;c.) is to^be the same. The exact details have not been settled, as the Armenian school authorities are still trying to modify the proposals of the Ministry of Education, which are that in each school month 120 hours of instruction will be given in the Persian language and 9o in the Armenian language. Apart from this, no foreign language may be taught in the elementary schools. In all secondary schools French must be taught instead of English or Russian. For the present year secondary school pupils without Government elementary certificates may remain in the schools; the point has not been settled as regards next year, but it is doubtful whether the concession will be allowed. 3. I am informed that the local Armenian school at Resht has already been closed owing to its inability to conform with the latest requirements of the Ministry of Education. n 1 . . . . , . 4 .

This order was at first communicated verbally at an interview to which the two school directors were summoned. The chief of police, who was also present, apparently attempted to moaii\ the abruptness of the order by saying that a progressive change in their curriculum should be made. , 3 The school directors appealed to their agreement made with the present Minister of Education’s predecessor, under which extra Persian lessons had been introduced.^ ^ ^ replied that any agreement made with a former Minister was superseded by the present definite instructions. P The directors replied that they must consult their boards of control. [115 i— 6 ]2 4 . The interview terminated, but next day the two schools received official letters ordaining, among other things— (a) They must entirely conform to the official schedules for education. (b) Special attention must be paid to the Persian language, history and geography. (c) No foreign language is to be taught in the elementary schools. (d) A reply to be given to these orders. 5. As the school directors understood that Armenian was being treated as a foreign language, and was therefore debarred, a meeting of the control boards and of the representatives of the various Armenian dioceses of Azerbaijan was convened under the presidency of their archbishop. A resolution was passed that the official programme was not acceptable in its entirety, and they had made all possible concessions three years ago. This reply was sent to the Tabriz Education Department on the 17th January. 6 . The decision appears to have been taken that the boards will refuse acquiescence, and that, if the Government insists, it will have to close the schools officially. 7. As the Education Department has no doubt reported the reply to Tehran, further developments may be expected before long. 8 . So far the Armenian high school (or seminary) appears to have escaped attention, but if Armenian be seriously forbidden in the elementary schools, any exception made in the case of the high school must lose almost all value.

I HAVE the honour’ to report that, no doubt following upon the drastic action of the Education Department as regards the American schools of Rezaieh and the Armenian elementary schools of Tabriz, the Russians have transferred their schools to their old consular premises. 2. These schools are “ mixed,” i.e., boys and girls are placed together, including Tartar girls and any other Mahometan girls who do not normally wear veils. 3. The local chief of the Education Department hesitated to send an inspector to inspect the school in the consulate-general precincts, and referred the matter to the Governor-General. 4. Both the Governor-General and chief of the Education Department hesitated to put a request to inspect the school in writing, and at last the chief inspector—one Muvassagi—was sent with a verbal message to ask why the Russians accepted Persian pupils— who had not finished their elementary course of study. By Persian, Persian subjects, including Armenians, are meant. 5. The actual reply made was that the Russians had closed the school temporarily, and the “ the consul-general was in touch with the Governor-General and Tehran about the matter.” r hpvp STANHOPE PALMER. Enclosure 3 in No. 1 . Consul Palmer to Sir R. Hoare. (No. 21. Confidential.) Sir, Tabriz, March 1, 1934. IN continuation of my despatches Nos. 7 and 10, I have the honour to report that the Persianisation of all elementary schools is being proceeded with most3 vigorously, while further limitations are being enforced upon the non-Persian high schools, which had been left more or less unaffected previously. 1. After the order of the Education Department to the American boys’ school that all pupils not having certificates from a Persian elementary school could not remain in that school (vide Tabriz Diary No. 1 for 1934), the American girls’ school received a similar order in the first week .of February and at once dismissed all the Armenian and Assyrian (a few) girls, thirty-two girls in all. Only a very few of these girls can pass the Persian examinations required, so that a few have asked to be allowed to enter a Persian girls’ school. But the great majority are uncertain what to do. Only Persian girls now remain in this American girls’ school. The majority of the boys who were dismissed from the American boys’ school are frequenting the Persian “ Najat ” elementary scheol with a view to passing the needed examinations, receiving certificates, and re-entering the American school at the beginning of the next scholastic year (in September). The rest have abandoned all idea of completing their education. 2. The Russian school was definitely informed that they must not take Persian pupils. To this the Russians finally agreed, and transferred their school to the old consulate-general building (as already reported). Since then the Director of Education occasionally sends someone or goes himself to find out whether they really have no more Persian pupils. The Russian school is now reduced to 43 pupils, and as each class was reduced to 4 — 6—8 pupils, and the 2 upper classes to 2 pupils each only, they have now reduced their teachers to 8 . Under these circumstances, it is not yet certain whether the Russians will open their school at all next year. 3. The question of the Armenian mixed boys’ and girls’ schools is by no means settled yet. After the refusal of the local boards to accept the Government educational plan in its entirety (as already reported), rumours reached here from Tehran that the Ministry of Education had consented to allow these schools to have three lessons in Persian and three in Armenian a day. But on the 17th February the Education Department wrote very curtly to to the Tabriz Armenian schools (and this time to the Central School also, which had so far escaped attention) to say that £C the Armenian school of Tehran had already accepted the plan in its entirety and that they had to do the same. In the case of further refusals,” the letter added, ” they would be obliged to take the necessary repressive measures, as instructed by the Ministry. , £C t Upon receipt of this ultimatum the boards of the three schools and the Assembly of the Representatives of the Azerbaijan Diocese” held a joint meeting on the 18th; and, in view of the fact that the Tehran school had accepted the plan, and that the schools at Resht, &amp;c., were forced to close following their refusals the meeting decided, after much discussion and despite a sti ong opposition element, to choose the lesser evil and accept the plan On the 20th February two members of each of the boards of the three schools called upon the Director of Education here and gave written undertakings to adopt the plan in their respective schools in the form of the engagement given by the Tehran school, viz. :— “We undertake to adopt the Government educational plan in our schools but would ask to be permitted to have a few extra lessons besides those allowed to replace lessons in the £ Koran ’ and k Shariat Law, m order to teach the Armenian language and religion. It was hoped that, as this formula of the undertaking was prepared by the Ministry of Education, they will at least allow a few lessons per week for the Arm Ue a krSs a ;^os?dI introduce the plan in September, but this does n0t Onfhe ^TthFebruMy ?hf inspector of the Education Department visited the schools asked why Armenian text-books and maps were still in evidence, and ordered their immediate introduction of the plan under pain of closure at once. As however, the Armenian Deputy telegraphed that the director should e informed that the new curriculum for the Armenian schools was being ^nt down from Tehran—and that this was to be applied forty days aftei leieipt the director finally agreed to let things stand till Novruz.o 4 No one here, however, knows the exact terms of the curriculum, which the Deputy has hinted at without definitely stating. 4. *' The Russians, following upon the return of their Vice-Consul Emidadze from Tiflis, have been approaching t neutral Armenians as well as the Opposition, and taunted the Dashnag party to them as “ cowards who abandoned all their national and linguistic aspirations to save their own skins. Emidadze is rumoured to have brought back an authority for all Armenians who desired to do so to emigrate to Soviet Armenia. The pro-Dashnag Armenians are now protesting to the Director of Public Security th^t this attitude of Emidadzd and his satellites is provocative and likely to lead to a breach of the peace. . . 5 . It will be perhaps interesting to add here that the entire Armenian population of Azerbaijan is estimated to be about 20,000 persons, concentiated chiefly in Tabriz, Rezaieh, Maragha, Ardabil, but with over sixty purely Armenian villages (chiefly in the Kara-Dagh, and around Shahpur and Rezaieh). They have seven schools in the town and twenty in different villages (last year there were about ten more village schools), with about 2,500 pupils (of both sexes), of which number 1,200 are in Tabriz. There are about seventy teachers and directors. The entive expenses of these schools are supported by the local Armenians, who are generally in poor financial circumstances. It can be said that almost all these twenty-seven schools are financed through the heavy financial sacrifices of the Tabriz Armenians, who number about 9,000 persons, and who also are mostly in poor financial circumstances. 6 . But apart from the loss of freedom to teach their mother tongue, as /desired, there is another matter which is very important for the Azerbaijan Armenians. Unlike Tehran, &amp;c., there are practically no Armenian teacheis who know much Persian; and as, according to the regulation of the Ministry of Education, all school directors and teachers must have Persian education and diplomas, none of the actual directors or teachers of these seven town and twenty village schools can be allowed to remain if the Education Department insist upon these details The many teachers and directors needed can scarcely be found among even the Armenians of Tehran, so that, in fact, many of these schools would in future be staffed by Persians. If this condition is insisted upon, it seems doubtful whether the‘schools can continue, as Armenians would scarcely send their boys, and certainly not their girls, to any Persian-staffed schools. I have, &amp;c. STANHOPE PALMER.^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT V . 7.7' 7600 PERSIA. L 1954, , November 19, 1934. Section 1. CONFIDENTIAL. [E 6964/2960/34] No. 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—(Received November 19.) (No. 482.) Sir, Tehran, November 2, 1934. WITH reference to my despatch No. 197 of the 19th April last, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a further despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Tabriz regarding the difficulties of Armenian schools in Azerbaijan.(') 2. The general attitude of the Persian Government at present is that no foreign school can be allowed to bear the name of a foreign country. Such names as “American College’’ or “English Girls’ School' will therefore no longer be tolerated. In accordance with this standpoint, the educational authorities lately issued a circular laying down that, in future, Armenian, American and Israelite Alliance schools, established in Persia for the benefit of Persian subjects, must possess suitable names, such as those of historical characters or abstract qualities. The latter category was subsequently defined as including such virtues / as “ Politeness,’’ “ Honesty ’’ and “ Truth.” These instructions were explicitly ' stated not to apply to the French schools, since these all bear such names as St. Louis or Jeanne d’Arc. 3. Remarkably enough, this order was enforced in the provinces before it was brought to the notice of the foreign schools in the capital, and the American schools at Resht and Hamadan found themselves faced with the necessity of choosing new names within about twenty-four hours. Acting quite independently, they both selected the name of “ Avicenna,” a famous Persian physician, and it is now possible that the same name will be adopted by all the American missionary institutions in Persia. While there is, however, a certain advantage in the new name having the same initial letter as the old, some of the American authorities object to the idea of their schools bearing the name of a Moslem. 4. While the above-mentioned circular omits all reference to English schools, I understand that difficulties are arising over the name “ Stuart Memorial College ” at Isfahan, though it still appears possible that the Persian authori ties there may be persuaded to agree to the retention of the name. At any rate, the matter does not appear to be urgent and the college is not worrying over i it unduly. I believe, however, that the girls’ schools at Yezd and Kerman are usually known by the name “ English School,” in which case new appellations will presumably have to be devised. j 5 .

Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received July 18.) 5480 Gulhek, June 23, il934.| g ^ ^ J 1 cf O I HAVE the honour to report that the Majlis, on the 8 th Khurdad, 1313 (the 29th May, 1934), passed a law authorising the foundation of a university at Tehran. It will be remembered that an institution known as the £k Dar-ul- Funun,” or Academy of Sciences, has long existed here, having been founded, I believe, by Mirza Taghi Khan Amir-Kabir, who was executed by Nasir-ud-Din Shah’s order in the fifties of last century. That academy engaged several foreign professors from time to time, and still survives after various modifications; it is now to be replaced by a fully-fledged university. 2. The law contains twenty-one articles, and is somewhat lengthy; I will therefore summarise its main provisions for your information; a copy of the text in translation can be sent if desired. One interesting feature of the law is that it enriches the Persian language by several new words, all of purely Persian origin, designed to replace other words, of Arabic origin, which have hitherto been in use. A university becomes a “ danish-gah ” (wisdom-place); a faculty is a “ danish-kedeh ” (wisdom-temple); a teacher’s college or “ ecole normale becomes a “ danish-sara ” (wisdom-shop or wisdom-inn); a technical school is a “ honaristan ”; a high school or “ lycee ” is a “ dabiristan ”; a £ ‘ primary school ” a “ dabistan.” The highest rank of teacher or professor is now to be called an “ ustad ”; under him are three ranks, with the less familiar names “ danish-yar ” (friend of wisdom), &lt;£ dablr ” and “ amuzgar.” 3. Article 1 of the law sanctions the foundation of a Tehran LTniversity for instruction in the higher branches of the sciences, the arts, literature and philosophy. Six faculties are named in article 2; the first is that of inductive and deductive sciences; the second, natural sciences and mathematics; the third, literature, philosophy and pedagogy; the fourth, medicine with all its branches; the fifth, law, and political and economic science; and the sixth, technical subjects. Existing schools of fine arts, and colleges, may be accepted as institutes of the Tehran University by affiliation or absorption. 4 . The principal of the university is to be appointed by Royal decree on the proposition of the Minister of Education. He will be responsible for administration and will nominate his subordinates. His appointment will be for three yeas, at the expiration of which he may be reappointed. A university council, embracing all the heads of faculties and some others, will administer the university, being charged with the preparation of conditions of entry, details of courses of studies, preparation of rules for examinations, and other duties. Each faculty will have a council of its own, on which its teachers will be represented. 5. ' The university will have a judicial status, and will be dependent solely on the Ministry of Education. It will collect fees and submit accounts to the Ministry. “ Ustads ” and “ danish-yars ” are to be selected by competitive examination in case several candidates apply for the posts, and their salaries are laid down in the law. Should no suitable candidate be available for an instructional post, persons whose competency is attested by the university council may be engaged by contract. 6 . Various regulations deal with the selection of £C dablrs ” and ££ danish-yars ” and their increments, promotion and retirement, reference being made to the Civil Service Law. 7. Article 20 states that the university is authorised to grant honorary degrees with the approval of the Minister of Education. 8 . It remains to be seen on what lines this institution will develop. The education of Persia hitherto has been developed on French lines. A number of French professors and teachers have been serving in Tehran ever since the old Dar-ul-Funun was founded, and they have naturally imparted a very French [165 s—5] .Jcharacter to the official system of public instruction here. On the other hand, a great number of the present, as well as the coming, generation in Tehran h&amp;ve been educated at the American College, the staff of which are all Americans and the organisation of which is as near to the American model as it can be made. The present Acting Minister of Education himself is one of its ‘ ‘ alumni ’ ’; and he, as well as a few other influential persons in the Ministry and the present colleges, has been heard to observe that the Anglo-Saxon system of education, with its less rigid rules and lack of centralisation, is preferable to the French model, and more suited to the Persian character. 9. I hear that Kitabji Khan has already been sent to Europe on an official mission in connexion with the university, and that he intends to visit England in the course of his mission. I have, &amp;c. R.
