Shaikh knows that British have interfered in affairs of 'Oman find t atar in two ways* (ii) Firstly, Bin Sa'ud had informed British that •Omca and ^atar were his subjects ana subjects of his fore- fathers (ctaapare ancestral claims oorresponde.ee Fowls'a letter No.594 -3 of June 28th 1934)* But as people of those countries were looked after by the British and chose to be in their -present state aM as the British were his friends he had not pressed th_ t view 'so we left the question of tne towns only, but no one (i*e* no Trucial Chief) haa ary right to claim anything or property in the desert or among the tribes nor hid ; nyone's father or grandfather claimed such a right'. Bin Sa'ud does not wish to deny to anyone any thing for which he is responsible or which he can protect but 'things which are beyond his control nd in which he h s no interests - we cannot allow theu to pass to any other person'.© (iii) Secondly, British claim to have had a treaty with the Turks and the Turks allowed tnem some lands. Bin authority or control in those lands nor did they keep order in Easa or its vicinity (b) that alleged treaty was signed only after he had occupied Hasa and (c) that it was not ratified (iv) The object and urgency of his letter are that he has heard that an oil company have applied to Shaikh for concession# Once the boundary is fixed Shaikh will be at liberty to do what he likes. Bin Sa'ud requests Shaikh to postpone matoer till boundary between him and British is settled or to ask British either (a) to let hito and Shaikh settle boundary without their mediation or (b) to settle boundary with him (Bin Sa'ud) themselves* 'I have explained this to you our brother in order that you may be aware that if the Company starts any work or drilling before the boundaries are settled, we will be compelled to protest and to stop operations and forbid anything being done until the|matter« between us and them are settled 11 • (v) In two places there|is reference to understanding between him and Shaikh apparently over boundary, but Shaikh denies having committed himself. 2. Shaikh states that he replied that anything to do . with Turkish treaty was matter for British that Qatar boundaries are well-known and that he has already granted a concession and cannot go back on it, 3, Comment follows • Sa'ud had informed British (a) that Turks did not exercise - Resident# (Copy forwarded to P.A.Bahrain under P.I».lTo.C/260 of 30/8/36.)

Walton, at which I indicated that, subject to the approval of His Majesty*s Government, my Company, Petroleum Concessions Limited, proposes to seek for oil concessions in the territory known as the Keutral Zone, the unallotted part of Bahrein Island, the Trucial Coast, and possibly along the Pirate Coast to Muscat. Petroleum Concessions Ltd, was registered as a private British Company on the l^th instant; the whole of its chares will be held by the same interests and in the same proportions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the Board will be of similar composition, excepting the appointment of an Iraqi Government Director, The concession recently obtained by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company Ltd. from the Ruler of Qatar will, at an appropriate time, be transferred to Petroleum Concessi ons Ltd., together with the Agreements relative thereto concluded with His Majesty's Government; the provisions of these Agreements are generally acceptable to petroleum Concessions Ltd. in their application to oil concessions obtained over the above named territories wherein my Company recognises, and will respect, the existence of a special sphere of influence of His Majesty's/(h) V Majesty 9 s Government• There will also be transferred to Fetroleu® ConceeeioDB Ltd. options for oil concessions recently obtained by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd# from the Hulera of Rae-el-Kliaisahi sharDubai and any other options obtained by that Company on our behalf in the Truoial Coa^t.

The terms to be offered will be baaed on the terms of the Qatar concesaion with suitable adjustment of the cash payments in relation to the respective approximate areas of the concessional the actual boundaries will be defined at a later stage as and when they are demarcated.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 163 of the 8th September, relative to the question of the attitude of Saudi Arabia to Qatar, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith the translation of the personal letter received from Sheikh Yusuf Yasin, in which he states the view taken by the Saudi Arab Government of the grant of an oil concession in Qatar by the Sheikh of Qatar. The letter covers the main points mentioned by Sheikh Yusuf in his conversation with me on the 6th September, reported in my telegram No. 161 of the 7th September, except that no mention of the word ' protest' is contained in the letter. In conversation, moreover, Sheikh Yusuf Yasin made some attempt to define the territories of the Sheikhdom of Qatar as having originally consisted of an enclave comprising Doha itself and a limited surrounding area known as Saffat. I refrained from following Sheikh Yusuf in an excursion into a subject on which I felt he was not expertly informed. 2. Copies of this despatch and enclosure are being sent to the Government of India, Bushire and Bahrein. I have, &amp;c. A. S. CAlLVERT. Enclosure. Sheikh Yusuf Yasin to Mr. Calvert. (Translation.) Jedda, Jumad-ath-Thani 9, 1354. My dear Mr. Calvert, (September 7, 1935.) I DESIRE to confirm the verbal discussion between us when I spoke to you on the evening of the 8th Jumad-ath-Thani, 1354. You are aware that the frontiers between this Kingdom and the Amirate of Qatar and the coast of Oman have never been actually delimited between those countries, and our Government is ready to delimit this frontier at any time. It has come to the knowledge of our Government that the Amir of Qatar has granted or will grant a concession for the exploitation of oil in Qatar, but as the frontier has not been drawn between us and that Amirate therefore our Government beg that such a concession be not granted, and that no work be carried out in that zone before the frontier is definitely drawn. It is not possible for our Govern ment to recognise or agree to any work referred to being undertaken, and boring and production in the places which they (Saudi Arab Government) occupy and which is under their influence at the present time. I desire to explain to you that our Government, although they have granted a concession for the production of oil in the zone which includes the lands neighbouring on the Amirate of Qatar, but our Government, up to this date, have not allowed the company to operate any work of drilling in that zone, pending the definite delimitation of the frontier.

Calvert, I have received your letter dated the 26th Septem- -ber 1935 (26th Jumad ath-'lhani 1354) and in reply I have the honour to state the following;- It was strange to our Government that the British Government disapproved of the correspondence which has taken and is taking place direct between his Majesty's the King and the Sheykh of Qatar, in respect of a matter concerning the affairs of Q^atar, and that you relied on your disapproval upon Article 6 of the ireaty of Jedda, and stated that 'His Majesty King Abdul Aziz undertook among other things to maintain friendly relations with H.S. the Sheykh of Q.atar between whom and His Britannic Majesty f s Government. ••••'♦etc#, and whereas your state- -ment and the interpretation, of Article 6 differ in text, meaning and significance from the contents of Article 6, 1 therefore write to you herein the copy of Article 6, literally arid which begins:- vthe Alrig of the nejaz and of ^ejd and its Dependencies undertake to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Kuwait and Jtiahrain and wi th the Sheykhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty* s Government ,, ends. l^ie undertaking of H^H.the King of the Hejaz and of ^ejd and its Depen- -dencies is confined to friendly and peaceful relations with the Amirs of t hose territories {lit.directions) and it does not contain any reference to any undertaking by HisHis Majesty and that he should not correspond with them or that they should not correspond with him, and therefore nothing has been changed since the xreaty of Jedda In the r41talons which had existed between His Majesty' and those Amirs, but friendly and peaceful relations remained complete and perfect and correspondence is exchanged between His Majesty and them in respect of various affairs, because this assures the friendly and peaceful relations which His itajesty undertook to main- ' -tain. treaties referred to in Article 6* con- -eluded between the British (ioverrasent and those Acjirs are the concern of the Amirs, and they (H.M.G,) may bind them with them but the (H.1UG.) cannot bind our Govern- -rnent with them. As regards your reference to (the fact^ that the .British Government in accordance w i th their desire (sic) to deprive themselves of their strict legal rights^ and offer a part of those rights to the ^audi Arab Government etc(lit.to the end of your statement on the subject), I am glad to draw your attention ih this respect to the true facts that our Government alv/ays desires that their relations with the Amirs of those territories (lit. directions) should be lasting relations of affection and friendship, and do not desire to restrict (lit.press upon) them and their affairs and they (S.A.G) showed t their readiness to grant them areas (territories) to the utmost extent which can be granted, on the under— -standing that the whole of those domains were previously subject to the fathers and forefathers of His Majesty 1 s the King Abdul Aziz. ^s regards the legal rights to which1/1 which you refer and to which the British ^overniDent pretend our uovermnent cannot recognise and accept i;hera and ca,nnot craider them as basis for any dis- -cussion i*i connection wi th those frontiers. In respect of the above our Government therefore pre- - serve their fullest righta in the territories and places which Ihey cannot agree to renounce in favour of the ^mirs of those territories and (in regard to) all privileges or rights which may be granted at those reserved places, our tioveminent cannot recognise or agree to them, and record their reservation in their regard* This is on the one hand and on the other I ara pleased to infoma you that our Government are fully prepared at any time ^o discuss the settlement of the question of the frontiers in a spirit of affection and friendship to those neighbouring Amirs whenever dis- •*cusaion may be resumed on this subject.

And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh's authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the State of Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner.

Their present letter seems to take for granted tiiat there will be other Americans and it might be sound to make it clear from the outset that employees other than British subjects will only be allowed in qatar or on the Trucial Coast in very special circumstances. In this connection it has been found necessary from time to time to draw the attention of the Bahrain Petroleum Company to the clause about employing British and Bahrain subjects (see, for example, llr # Cleuson f s letter No«Pl2 # 5382 dated the 14th August to 3B k Mr.Baliantyne) and it seems probable that Petroleum Concessions Limited will hare to be kept up to the mark in the same way. 4.

It appears that Petroleum Derelopment (Qatar) Limited is a subsidiary of Petroleum Concessions Limited, which is in turn almost identical with the Iraq Petroleum Company, There can presumably 'be no difficulty, therefore, about granting His Majesty's Government's formal approval: but before we do so perhaps you would kindly confirm that the Petroleum Department concur and that Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., is in fact a Company which we can let the Anglo-Iranian say is 'known to and approved by His Majesty's Government'. Actually we understand that the Company is in process of registration* perhaps you are in a position to make sure that the registration is going through on a satisfactory basis. As Petroleum Development (Qatar) propose to start wo^rk this Autumn, it is , of course desirable to get this question of transfer out of the way as quickly as possible.

Dear Mr. Walton, Article IS of the Qatar Concession, obtained on May 17th, 1935, by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, gives that Company the right to transfer its rights to another Company. The phrasing of the Article is somewhat obscure, but it emerges from it that the new Company must be connected with the Anglo-Persian and must receive the blessing of the Shaikh. Tie hope that these conditions will be fulfilled by Petroleum Deyelopment (Qatar) Limited, the P.C.L. subsidiary which we are at the moment in process of forming for the purpose of accepting the transfer of the Concession and thereafter operating it. In that event, the Agreement of June 5th, 1935, between K .m. G . and the Anglo-Persian, regarding the Qatar Concession, will in fact devolve upon Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., and we should be very glad to feel that we had your agreement upon our interpretation of certain points in this. Under Article 1 of the Agreement of'Jnma 5th, the consent ox H.iv_.G„ j_ s necessary to any transfer of the Concession, May we assume that no objection will be felt to the transfer now contemplated? Under Article 3 the consent of H.M.G. is required for the introduction into Qatar of Company's employees who are neither British subjects nor subjects of the Shaikh. May we assume that no objection will be felt to the occasional presence in Qatar of our Chief Geologist, Mr. Itf.A. Baker, who /who is an .American citizen. In the case of other European or American members of the Company^ superior staff p who may 'be required to visit Qatar in the course of their duties ? may we assume that notification of this 'by our Representative at Bahrain (Mr. E.V. Packer) to the Political Resident will 'be sufficient? Article 4 provides that the Company's Chief Local Representative in Qatar ('being a British subject and having been approved by H.M.G.) shall be ordinarily resident in Qatar. May we assume that no objection will be felt if he is ordinarily resident at Bahrain, but visits Qatar with sufficient frequency to ensure liaison? We should not willingly open a separate office with a British Manager in Qatar until the development of operations there should indicate it. Yours sincerely, Sgd« H.R. Longrigg. .

Abadan have further been instructed to send a copy of the draft letter forthwith to the Political Resident and to ascertain his views on the action proposed to be taken as to the wording or otherwise of the letter to the Shaikh, In accordance with Clause I of the Agreement of the 5th June, 1935, we must, of course, before transferring the Agreement to any other company, obtain the prior consent in writing of His Majesty's Government, and I should be grateful if such consent could be notified to the Comiany.

S. 31st August 1936 Dear Mr.Walton# / tA^ lusion in the Qata; Mr#Skliros promised in his letter dated May 89th to revert later to the subject of your proposed formula 'binding the Company {or, as it may 'be, Companies) to erect a refinery on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf, as part of the Political Agreement between it, or them, and the Government# He has been unwell lately and his attendance at the Office is, for the time, very irregular. He has asked me, therefore, to deal with the matter on his behalf. As he feared, the Board did not find ^ acceptable the clause which you proposed in your letter Z.3010/36, dated May 26th The formula agreed fo^in: Agreement of June 5th^ / 1.936, makes the erection of a refinery conditional upon (a) commercial production being, in the Company^s opinion, assured, and (b) commercial conditions justifying such a step# As regards (a), ycur Draft of May 26th generally meets this point. As regards (b), this is evidently the crux of the matter. If the Political Agreement, as ultimately signed, does not make the refinery conditional upon commercial considerations, it seems tint it would be tantairfcrnnt to saying 'the obligation to erect refineries is absolute, even though quite unjustified by commercial considerations, and therefore liable to involve the Company in heavy loss' 3ENTTO h It/(i It is the view of the Board that such an obligation could 'be accepted only with the greatest reluctance 'by a Company which had already made the efforts, taken the risks, and incurred the expenses necessary to the location and development of an oilfield. The Board feels that such efforts and expenses would have constituted already a very considerable service: it feels, moreover, and in more general terms, that the imposition of uneconomic 'burdens upon an industry, under the influence of Governmental rather than commercial considerations, is much to be deprecated# It might, of course, very probably happen that the erection of a refinery or refineries, upon a scale to be determined at the time, might be commercially justifiable, or at least likely to involve no serious loss. In that event, there would be no reluctance on the part of the Company to erect refineries of commercially reasonable capacity. j, ^ ^ If you find it, af^w all, difficult to accept the formula of Article O^of the Qatar Agreement as applicable to the Western and Southern shores of the Gulf in general, I suggest that we might pursue the subject by verbal discussion.

My dear Longrigg, Would you kindly reier to the last two paragraphs J &lt;• of your letter to Mr. Walton dated 13th August, P 0 C.30/51. As regards the occasional presence of Mr.N.E.Baker, an American subject, in Qatar, we presume that in the opinion of the Company this is definitely essential for the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. if you would be so good as to confirm that this is so, you may take it that His Majesty's Government will raise no objection in principle*. 1 am desired to point out in this connection that the presence of employees of the Company who are not British subjects can only be permitted in Qatar (and of course on the Trucial Coast) in very exceptional circumstances. It is hoped that the Company quite appreciate this. As regards the Trucial Coast, the position was made quite clear in Mr. Walton's letter of 12th December, 1935, to Mr.Skliros, and the same considerations apply in respect of Qatar. .Longngg, Esq., f V.- All/ petroleum Concessions, Limited, City-Gate House, Finsbury Square, E,C.2 Kprv 3 : ' ft .;R MAIL o f '5 OCTAll employees of the Company will require endorsements and v isas on their passports. Visas for Qatar (or the Trucial Coast) are not granted to persons of European race without reference to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf or the political Agent, Bahrein. 'Vi 8as Bahrein are, hov/ev er, granted to British subjects without previous reference. It will therefore be best for British employees of the Company to obtain endorsements and visas for Bahrein from the most convenient consular authority. On arrival in Bahrein they should apply to the political Agent for visas for Qatar (or the Trucial Coast). These visas can be made valid for any number of journeys. As regards non-British employees of European race the special permission of His Majesty's Government will of course have to be obtained in each case for their employment, under Article 3 of the Political Agreement. If His Majesty's Government give the necessary permission, the most convenient Consular authority will be instructed to give the requisite visa for Bahrein, and thereafter they will be in che same position as the British employees as regards visas for Qatar ( or the Trucial Coast). Apart from what I have said above, we think it would be/Ojy 3. be wise if the Company's Representative v/ould iniorm the political Agents Bahrein^ on each occasion before British or other foreign members of the company's staff (whether superior or otherwise) leave Bahrein for Qatar or the Trucial Coast, it is always possible, especially until arrangements have settled down &gt; that the Political Agent may have information or warnings to give to persons going there.

Further that if he ^the Shaikh) is still obdurate the Com pi ny who have only a limited time at their disposal will be compelled to omit qatar from their programme this winter and proceed to the Trucial Coast. 7.

Your telegram of 5th liovember and your telegram of 7th November, ^o.793. Payments to Shaikh of Qatar*3 representatives. Petroleum Concessions Limited point out that Kuwait representative is of different type entirely. he must be English-speaking and will apparently have responsible duties. two ^atar representatives will have no duties of any importance. Moreover it would be fair on jiuwait analogy to pay Rs.800/-&gt; al to ge ther and not Rs.800/- each. in any case they suggest that Debai is much better parallel than Kuwait. Shaikh of Debai has agreed with them on Hs.400/- pei/mensem as appropriate payment to his single representative and they could not without risk of serious embarassment pay much more than Rs.400/-each to Qatar representatives. They agree that it does not matter T^hether salaries are paid to individuals or to £&gt;ha ikh. On basis of above considerations they have instructed Packer not to go beyond Rs.iOOO/- altogether2. altogether in any circunistances. i accordingly suggest, if you see no objection, that Loch (no doubt after consulting ? Packer ) should write to Shaikh on ^pneral lines indicated in paragraph 6 of your telegram of 5th November but should specify iis.SOO/- as total amount to be paid by Ctompany on analogy of total amount paid in Kuwait.

NOTE FOR COOTERENOE WITH THE HONOURABLE THE POLITICAL RESIDENT ON 18TH NOV., 1936 COMPANISS IMTSRPIvETATION OF PARA.5 OE MR.MTLLES LETTER DATED 17.5.55 (1) In general the representatives duties are to represent the Sheikh in the protection of the rights of the Ruler, the Government and Qatar people in accordance with the terms of the Concession, during the Company's operations, Their duties are to the Ruler. They have no duties to the Company according to the abovementioned paragraph. (2) If the paragraphs of the Concession are taken separately the duties of many of the paragraphs can only 'be described as watching that the Sheikh's, rights are not infringed. There are several paragraphs where the duties are clear and can be defined. Article 1 . The duty of the Sheikh's representative is to ensure that the Ruler gets information on discoveries of minerals. Article 2 . The representative sees that the Company do not touch religious lands or infringe Qatar people's rights to land. Article 5 . The representative watches to see that the Company displays proper activity and progress in exploration and inspects records in the Ruler's interests. Article 4 . The representative watches that payments are in accordance with the Concessions and oil output. Article 5 . The representative has the right to inspect oil output records on behalf of the Sheikh. Article 6 . The representative would act as intermediary should the Sheikh desire to use Company's roads, W/T telephones, ports, etc. Article 7 . The representative protects private owners of land or houses in land and building transactions and the Sheikh's rights to take over buildings and lands acquired by the Company and later becoming unnecessary.■ ^ f^r Article 8 . The representative would act as intermediary should the Sheikh desire to take Company^ surplus water. Article 9 . The representative would protect the peopled claims to gravel, limestones, etc. should their be a dispute. Article 10 . The representative would ensure the Customs clause was not abused. Article 11 . It might be interpreted that one of the duties of the representative is supervision of security arrangements and guards. Article 17 . The representative will be responsible to the Sheikh that Qatar nationals are given priority of employment. Qatar Interpretation of t^iis paragraph . Saleh el Mana, one of the probable representatives, seems to hold the view which is probably taken from Hamad that : (a) Selection of all manner of employees will be in the hands of the representatives (b) That invitations to tender will be published through this representative and contractors selected by him (c) All executive work appertaining to Secuiity will be in their hands. Note. (c) Seems reasonable in accordance with para 11 of the Concession (a) Is not in accordance with the Convention and unworkable. Provision of labour only is reasonable, selection must be in the hands of the Company's own Employment Officer. (b) Is quite unworkable except in as far as advice on status and policy might be useful.&gt;V] -— / NOTE FOR COOTSKENCE WITH THE POLITICAL RESIDENT AMD POLITICAL AGENT AT BAHREIN ON 17TH N0TO3VIBER ON THE QATAR CONCESSION QUESTION OF THE SHEIKH'S T!?0 REPRESENTAT IVES L SITUATION 17TH (1) KUIERS VIBWS . (a) Tlie Sheikh wishes the appointment and salaries of the two representatives to be governed 'by the Kuwait prei£S.ent, (h) This he interprets as Rs,3500 p.m. paid through and at the discretion of the Sheaikh. (c) He does not exempt British representatives of the She&amp;kh from the comparison with Kuwait. (d) He first wished operations to be suspended pending settlement of the representative's question but later agreed to wait until November the 15thfor London 1 s views. (E) REMaRKS ON THE RULiilR'S YIKvvS . (a) No other analogy, e.g. Dubai, will be accepted by the Sheikh. (b) The Ruler has in his mind the appointment of Hamad the Heir Apparent as the senior repre sentative and probably Saleh el Mana as the second one. Sheikh Hamad, however, would probably not be nominated unless sufficient funds were made available, e.g. Rs.EOOO p.iru, for his salary alone. (c) The Sheikh under pressure might accept the Kuwait payments to Arab Representatives (said to be Rs.800 p.m. to one man only). (3) P.C.L. LONDON'S VIEWS . (a) Kuwait analogy is inadmissible as i. Kuwait Oil Company has entirely different constitutions. ii. Salaries payable to individuals direct iii. Representatives referred to as iiighly paid are English speaking and one nominally resident in London. l,&gt;) SS'MVSSL 4 ! Coast. The position ^or status of the repre sentative was never intended to be as high as the heir apparent•■2- tio (e) (d) (e) NOTES (1) (2) Tlie Company are prepared to pay Rs.1000 for the two representatives. The money should be paid direct to the representa&lt; tives and not to the Sheikh. Should the Sheikh not agree and order the present operations to stop the Company are prepared to withdraw the Staff and would consider Suspension of the Ruler's dues under Art. 4 of the convention (presumably at present the annual payment) during the period of the suspension. If the Kuwait analogy is accepted as far as the payments to the Arab representatives are concerned Rs.1000 is insufficient to cover two representatives. The figure of Rs.800 siad to be paid to the Arab representative at Kuwait presumably rules out Hamad and will result, in all probability, in his becoming obstructive in the future. The present Sheikh presumably cannot livevery much longer and it is a matter for consideration and possible presentation to London this factor should be borne in mind the present juncture. &lt;1 /a*/' I 1 11 !! (4) POINTS ON WHICH DECISIONS SEEM TO BE REOXJIRSD. (a) U) (c) (d) (e) Is the Kuwait precedent to be allowed to in fluence the decisions in whole or part. Is Sheikh Hamad to be eliminated as a possible candidate for the senior representative. If ao the figure of Rw.800 seems reasonable for any one else bearing in mind 'position &amp; duties' Is the amount decided on to be paid through the Sheikh or direct to the representatives. - • S. ♦ ^ 4~ ^ 4- V. i procedure; (f) UiXC OJ-J-C J.XVJ.J. vJm VJ. j.x ovy w WW Wi-xv -C . The ruler may take serious exception to the latter/ Salaries suggested for the senior and second representatives. May it be suggested to the Sheikh in any letter sent by Political Agent that the present water drilling operations in his own interests should not be in— terupted pending final settlement of the question of the representatives.

As regards paragraphs 4 and 5 of your telegram of 19th November their position is that the Shaikh is obliged by the first clause of Article 11 of the Concession to render assistance to the Company e.g. in collecting their local labour and that this obligation is quite distinct from the Company 1 s under- staking in the letter of 17th May 1935 to pay for representatives to look after the Shaikh*s ri^hte . I understand that they consider that the Company can only be liable for salaries in respect of protection of the Shaikh 1 s rights even though representatives might in practice also perform duties implementing his obligations. 3, Distinction is of course a fine one.

CITY-GATE HOUSE, B'lHSBURT SQUARE, LOKDON, E.G.2. 2nd November, 1936 My dear Claueon^ In confirmation of our telephone conversation this morning, the following is the text of a cable received from Packer, dated November 1st- 'Shaikh Qatar adamant representatives paid equal senior two Kuwait representatives whether .British or local for which he claims Shaikh Kuwait draws Bs.3,050 total he first proposed suspend all operations until payment arranged from date letter to Cle^g but persuaded to allow work to proceed for two weeks only pending reference you suggest necessary pay as Kuwait distrust of Pet-concess on Concession matters at this stage may have far reaching effects Haji full•agreement these views. Political not informed pending your instructions. The following is the text of our reply of to-day's date-.- 'Your telegram of November 1st Kuwait is separate Company of entirely different constitution Secondly salaries of appointments under Article 6 of Kuwait Concession are payable to individuals direct and not to Shaikh Thirdly these representatives are English- speaking and one is nominally resident in London. Company emphatically does not admit these as precedent for Qatar representatives now under discussion whose salaries 'shall be reasonable and in keeping with JB MAJU positions/ III I f I 1 [jf. 1 I 11ill(l&lt;© positions ana duties'. Report immediately and discuss i'ully v/ith Political. Work which Shaikh threatens to suspend is work solely in his interests and not ours and you should be prepared to withdraw all personnel from Qatar pending agreement.' The claim of the Shaikh ox Qatar to the appointment ^ S of two representatives of his own in connection wiji^fne Company's work is based, as you know, upon^^ragraph 3 of Mr. Mylles' letter to him dated llaj 1935. This letter specifies that the appointments are TI on condition that these salaries shall be reasonable and in keeping with their positions and duties 71 . The Company is anxious to honour this and all other obligations into which it has entered, but it does not feel that this need in the present case involve paying Hs.3,050 p.m. into the Shaikh's pocket. His quotation of the Kuwait Oil Company's Concession seems entirely irrelevant, as the Company which concluded that Concession is entirely distinct from Petroleum Development (Qatar) Ltd., while the representatives visualised in Articles 16 and S(c) of the Kuwait Concession evidently differ fundamentally from anything which the Shaikh of Qatar will be able to provide. Moreover, payment of the salaries at Kuwait is to the individual representatives, and not to the Shaikh. If the Shaikh of Qatar indicates his nominees, we are fully prepared to pay them, as from the date upon which they assume duty, salaries which will be reasonable and in keeping with their positions and duties. Our present suggestion is Rs.100 p.m. each. Cur present activities in Qatar are in the direction of honouring the obligation contained in paragraph 1 of Mr. Mylles'/mi 1M&gt; 1! Mjlles 1 letter already referred to, that is, of drilling 'two artesian wells free of charge at such place as may be selected by His I^cccllency the Shaikh'„ If.the Shaikh (as Mr. Packer ! s telegram appears to contemplate) prevents us from carrying out this obligation, it appears that he, rather than we, will be the loser. If a position should arise in which, owing to the Company's non-acceptance of demands made by the Shaikh, the Company were, in fact, prevented from exercising its rights of exploration, exploitation, etc. under the Concession, the matter would, we imagine, come within the purview of Article 15 of the Concession. We feel confident that such a position will not be allowed to arise. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) STSPHEF H.

Mr. Pecker has been instructed by the General Manager, London, to bring the situation at Qatar at the beginning of November to the notice of the Political Agent and discuss it with hi®. The situation is as follows:-- At the recent visit of Mr. Packer and Haji Williamson to Qatar in connection with the Company 1 s water drilling operations Shaikh * Abdullah requested that the matter of his two liaison representatives should be settled before any operations began. He asked that the salaries of these representatives should be similar to those of the Kuwait Oti Company and quoted a total figure of Rs. 3500 per mensem to be paid to him for disbursement at his discretion.

The Sheikh 1 s representative has no duties on behalf of the Company but his duty is to watch over the Sheikh's rights. In these circumstances the Company does not feel justified in drawing up any list of duties. With reference to the point raised by the Honourable the Political Resident that in the event of the Company adopting the abovementioned view the Company can expect no assistance from the Sheikh's representative in any difficulties, we are referred to the first lines of Article 'Si of the Conoession which state 'The Sheikh agrees that he will afford the necessary assistance to carry out this Agreement and thp.t he will use his authority to protect the Company's employees and property as far as possible'. We hare been further instructed to submit that should the Sheikh fail in this obligation the Company will be unable to drill artesian wells or carry out exploring, etc. laid down under Article in of the Concession.The Company feels that if tlie present extortionate demand is aooeded to, the Sheikh will be encouraged to repeat such extortions at every stage of operations* Our instructions are also to stress that the interpretation of the Kuwait Concession by the Kuwait Oil Company or any procedure in Kuwait cannot be accepted as a parallel or precedent for qatar• We have the honour to be.

There is no cause for difference in the rates of pay.

B. Mlrza Mohammad, Basrah. Dear Sir, I write to inquire after your health, which I trust is perfectly good. I am in good health. A long time has elapsed since I have had the pleasure of receiving a letter from you, so that I may be assured of your well-being, and I have ever been expecting news of you. I remember that I sent you a telegram when I was about to leave Kuwait, but a long time has since elapsed and the total absence of news from you has led me to write this letter and to inquire after you. You know the high position you hold with me and the confidence I repose in you. I wish to remind you of the conversation we had when I was privileged to meet you at Ashar, and I hope that your efforts will prove useful to me when you find it convenient to exercise them. I inform you now that the Anglo-Persian Oil Co., Ltd. have transferred our agreement to a Company formed in London called the Qatar Oil Development Co., Ltd., and this Company 1 I I i has sent its representative, Mr. E.V. Packer and its engineers to inspect the land covered by the agreement in a more careful manner. The said represtative has arrieved at our end and he ■ is a good gentleman of high characteristics. In short, the Company wishes to under-take preliminary actions for drilling. Seeing that there is a c lause empowering the Shaikh to select two men to represent the Shaikh with the Company and to look after his interests, and that the Company should pay theirpay their salaries, the Shaikh has now asked the Manager of the Company to pay the salaries of the two representatives before any operations are commenced. Comnumi cat ions continue |&lt;| to be exchanged on the subject. And seeing that my confidence in you is great, I write to consult you as regards someone who should represent the Shaikh. He must be a widely | m . ^ ' experienced gentleman possessing information on these matters. Can you be good enough to mention to us a competent and able man, either from your end or elsewhere. Do you advise us to get someone from Egypt, Syria or f Iraq, or someone from the West. (We want) someone whom you consider fit and recommend. We have heard that Ahmad al-Jaber has appointed Colonel Dickson to represent himj but we wish to know your opinion first of all and obtain your suggestion on the matter. I shall be glad to receive an early answer, as they might ask us to supply^them with the names of the representatives. So, I hope you will assist us by your guidance in order that we may be enlightened by your views and safeguard the interests of the Shaikh. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) SALIH AL-MANAA. iSfilMi' Ibh Basrah, 6th November, 1956. To Salih as-Sulaiman al-Manaa, D o h a h. Dear Sir, I trust that you are in perfect health. Should you be so kind as to inquire after me, I am glad to inform you that I am keeping well. I was honoured by the receipt of your kind letter of the 16th Shaban and I was indescribably delight-L ed by it, as it was the best rememberance to me in view of the ' high position you enjoy in the estimation of friends and 2 especially of uiyself. I have not forgotten the conversation we had in Ashar and I had hoped to seize an opportunity of discussing the matter with Mr. Elkington, the General Manager, when he passed through Basrah en route to London several months ago; but I was unfortunately unable to do so as he did not stop in Basrah more than a few minutes. I trust to have the privilege of meeting him when he returns and to represent to him the facts. ^ You may rest assured in this connection. It was my hope to render this small service to you without any delay; but I feel sure that you will appreciate the circumstances and understand that time did not permit of my seeing him and that I did not know his arrival here until he had left. Let us hope that circumstances will be more favourable to us in future. As regards the representatives you have mentioned. Shaikh Ahmad al-Jabir has appointed Abdullah al~Mulla Salih with a salary of Hs.800 (according to what I hear) per mensem, ..... and has also appointed Colonel Dickson. I know nothing as to the latter T s salary, but it must not be less than Hs.1200 or 2s. 1500 per mensem. I venture to think that it is desirable for H.E. the Shaikh to appoint you as the Arab representative on the same,'-1 / on the same salary as is paid to Abdullah al-Mulla Sallh, and W nil 1 .^^.^ , ^,. •yrfVM*, &lt; ^ ^ \ ' '*' v ^tv-mim to appoint another gentleman, who should be familiar with the WMMMMMMM English language and possess the necessary knowledge of the IIIIII*' 11 — m ' WWWWMWWWMI lavsTS and administrative matters, to be the second representa- tive. This man should not be of a rash temperament to strain the friendship between H.E. the Shaikh and the British Govern ment and the Company, because the friendship with the British Government and the Shaikh is the most important matter and all d possible efforts should be used to safeguard it. On the other hand, it is necessary to try to safeguard the interests of the Shaikh in a befitting manner. I do J^ot_thiink that the Egyptians or Syrians appreciate these matters as they ought to, and the same remarks apply to most of those available in v,:.^ ^, ........ ., &gt;v , r ^^ ^ 1 '* 1,1 ^^ ^ ! 1 ^ 1 v 1 Iraq. I believe that the best course is for H .E. the Shaikh to inquire from H.E. the Resident in the Persian Gulf as to a suitable man for this post; and I feel sure that H.E. (the Resident) v^rill make a suggestion consistent with the Shaikh T s interests and will not appoint anyone unless he is suitable for the position, as he is most well-informed on those who possess knowledge of such affairs. Had I known anyone competent in these countries or elsewhere, I would not have hesitated to mention him to you, but I am unable to mention anyone at present. (Usual complimentary ending.) (Sgd.)

Sir, We hove the honour to bring to your notice that we have received the Company f s policy in regard to the present Qatar controversy on the salaries of the Huler f s two representatives and other minor matters which have threatened at times to become controversial. We hpve also been informed that the India Office are in full possession of the Company^ views which may be summarized as under ; (a) It seems that the Ruler of Qatar contemplates or contemplated putting obstacles in the way of the Company♦s carrying out of the rilling of two artesian water wells and to a geological examination of his territory until the Company agree to pay some Rs.3500 p.m. for his two represent tives. He Iso contemplates (or contemplated) making unreasonable demands in the matter of guards, roads and other matters, (b) The Company^ attitude is that although it may be inconvenient to suspend or postpone operations it is not prep red to per dt this consideration to influence it in the direction of complying with demends which it regards as unreasonable. (c) If the Sheikh is unable or unwilling to provide the reason ble facilities the Company requires, operations will be shut down until such time as the Sheikh is prep red to carry out his obligations* (d) If the Sheikh refuses the offer of Es.lOOO p.m. for his representatives the matter can as far as the Company is concerned just remain in abeyance. The Sheikh can ? sk for arbitration if he likes. The Company is not concerned to do so. (e) If on the other hand other difficulties raised materially hamper the Company^ drilling operations then the Company would stop all operations and withdraw personnel &amp; materials from Qatar. g. In this connection we would point out th t to date there has been no hampering of our drilling opera tions but in the first interview with Haji filliumaon and Mr.Packer at ^tur the Ruler tt first said he would prefer no work to commence before the ?t sal ry' qumtion was settled and later reserved the right to stop the work should no satisfactory result be obtained ufter reference to I/mdon.further he made it fairly obvious th t extortionate demands on the security side eould be anticipated if the salary question was not settled to his satis faction. Other minor controversial points have been mentioned in other correspondence (Employment agents. Rotds &amp; use of Company Transport). They were raised by the Ruler•s son or Saleh and there is no certainty that the Euler is cognisant of them or would countenance or support them.

PURPOSE &amp; COMMENCEMENT OF OPERATIONS - COMPOSITION OF PARTY . ^ The Operations in Qatar which commenced in October 1937 were intended to fulfil an obligation entered into by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co., when concluding the Qatar Concession on the 17th May, 1935 to drill 2 Artesian Wells, Mr.W.St.G.Hombersley &amp; Mr.0*S.Dickson (Driller) began work in early November. A W/T Station was opened in November. The Water Drilling Party comprised:- British . Mr. Dickson - Driller Indian s. Sub-Assistant Surgeon, Clerk, W/T Operator, 2 House Servants. Iraqis . Blacksmith. Engine Attendant Bahrain and N e.1d. 2 M. T. Drivers. 2 Rigmen. Qatar . 1 Interpreter 1 Driver 15 Labourers 9 Local Houseboys 2 House Watchmen. The average strength for the season was 55 persons.H ATURE OF OPERA TIONS &amp; EQUIPMENT TO BE USED . The Company^s Geologists in conjunction with the Ruler selected the sites for the two wells, one near the Shaikh f s garden at Dohah and one near his garden at Riyan. It was onsidered by the geologists and water experts that artesian water would be got at approximately the Bah rain level and not irare than about 500 ft. but the driller was prepared to go to 1000'. For this purpose EDEC0 equipment (English Drilling Equipment Co») was to be used* The rig and derrick are of the cable tool or percussion type operated by a Blackstone engine# The possibility of finding artesian water was al ways mere conjecture with the very liiaited information on Qatar available, DESCRIPTI0M OF THE SEASON*S WORK * (a) No. 1 Well# Dohah , This was spudded in on December 8th. At a depth of 85 feet the hole caved in on the teailer burying it and the well ijas abandoned, the rig being skidded 18 feet north to drill a new hole, fa) Ho. 1A W ell. Dohah . This well was spudded in on December SSnd. Salt water was encountered at 22 feet. At 312 feet a large show of sulphur-salt water was met and the water level was S6 feet from the surface. At 370 feet water rose to 15 feet from the surgace. At 400 feet to 7 feet. At 450 feet the hole started caving. Sard was now giving serious trouble and the well was finally abandoned at 486 feet. From the surfact t» 435« limestone and shale was encountered; from 435« to 486» sandstone and sand. No/-4/- -3- Mo good water was found and the sulphur content of the water increased with ^pth. (c) Riyan No* 1 . Location - 300 f west of the Sheilch T s garden. This well was spudded in on February 18th, 1937. The first water shewed at SO 1 and it rose to 22 feet from the surface. At 55 feet a large water show was met estimated at over 1000 gallons per hour - Water level 22 feet from the surface. No good water was encountered as drilling proceeded and at 524 feet sulphur salt water was met. At 383 feet the hole began caving. Drilling proceeded to 605 feet. The sulphur content increased with depth and the well was abandoned on April 20th. The water drilling party was withdrawn for this season on 23th April. Analyses of Water by Dionic Water Tester. 2g feet - 100 parts (undissolved solids) per 100,000 48 « 140 « « tt ti 65 « 166 w ' » n 86 « 160 » « if H 102 ' over 200^ n ' m n 129 « over 200^ ' n « w ^ Tester goes to 200 parts only. NOTE:- Water over 150 parts is not considered fit for drinking purposes by usual standards but worse water is drunk in Bahrain by a large part of the community. In the vicinity of Riyan at approximately 70 feet there is plenty of water (not arte sian) at 180 parts to the 100,000 which Mr. Dickson says is much better than the average Bahrain drinking water. It will be seen by the Table attached marked Appendix A that in many parts of Watar there are wells with moderate drinking water.-4- 4. PRESENT SITUATION - FUTURE OPERATIC)MS . The situation is that the Company have notified the Ruler of Qatar that they regret that no potable water has been located at the Bahrain level and that they propose to consult Mr* Dickson and the Geologists with a view to deciding what further stops if any can be taken next season. This notification was accknowledged in courteous strain by the Ruler• 5. COM 1 ACTS WITH THE RULER AMD HIS ADVISERS. It was early apparent that the Ruler instigated probably by Saleh el Mana and Sheikh Hamad the heir apparent to a lesser degree were fully prepared to exploit to the full every possible means of extorting more money from the Company. Various means to this end had occurred to -them from a close examination of the working of the Kowait Con cession. Owing to the restricted nature of the operations the only controversial matter which could not be side tracked was that of the salaries of the two Sheikhas rep resentatives. Considerable correspondence has passed on this matter and the question is not settled to date (6th May 1957). Arbitration the last resort in such matters is not favoured by the Ruler.CONFIDENTIAL.
