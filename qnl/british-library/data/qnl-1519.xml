Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 3.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, January 3, 1911. LIEUTENANT-COLONEL COX reports the presence in Bushire of Soulet-ed- Dowleh with 400 Kashgai and of certain other khans with their escorts, making a total of 1,000 armed tribesmen in the town. Persian Government gives me to understand that these men have collected to meet the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, but Lieutenant-Colonel Cox fears that they will get out of hand if left for long without employment. - At the suggestion, therefore, of His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, I am pressing Persian Government to send orders to the Nizam, who is expected to reach Mohammerah to-morrow (4th January), to expedite his arrival at Bushire as far as he is able. _ ^ &gt; . At the same time, I have intimated to Persian Government that it would be necessary to land a force for the protection of Europeans from His Majesty’s ships now in port if disorders were to break out in Bushire. A similar warning has been transmitted to both Soulet-ed-Dowleh and to the Governor of Bushire by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire. No. 2. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 4.) (Teleo-raphic.) Tehran, January 4, 1911.

ACCORDING to an official statement published in the press here a preliminary enquiry has been addressed by the Persian Government to the Swedish Government as to how the latter would be disposed to regard a request for the loan of Swedish officers to reorganise the Persian gendarmerie. The statement adds that the Swedish Government has replied that until they are in possession of the details as to conditions of service they cannot return a definite answer.Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Spring-Bice. gf r Foreign Office, January 10, 1911. ’ THE Swedish Minister enquired to-day of Sir A. Nicolson, on behalf of his Government, whether His Majesty’s Government would view with displeasure their compliance with a request made to them by the Persian Government for the loan of some Swedish officers to organise the Persian gendarmerie. Sir A. Nicolson informed Count Wrangel that His Majesty’s Government had no objection, from a political point of view, to the supply of officers by the Swedish Government, and that the question was one for the latter themselves to decide. Sir A. Nicolson further asked whether, in Count WrangePs opinion, Swedish officers could be found who possessed a knowledge of the necessary languages and an acquaintance with eastern habits and ways. Count Wrangel replied that some Swedish officers had already been employed in the Turkish service with considerable success, and that he was sure that his Govern ment would make a careful selection. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 5. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 11, 1911.) Sir, Tehran, December 27, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit a memorandum compiled by Major Stokes from despatches and telegrams from the acting British consul at Shiraz on the negotiations between the Persian Government and Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the opening of the main route from Bushire to Shiraz, and on the state of this road and of the road from Shiraz to Ispahan during the past few w r eeks. It will be seen that since Soulet announced that the main Bushire-Shiraz route was opened his measures for its protection have not sufficed to prevent robberies or to secure the recovery of the stolen property, and that certain British traders hesitate to use the road pending assurances from me that the Persian Government will be held responsible for losses, assurances which, in the face of the official notification of last spring as to the opening of the Jirreh road, I do not see my way to give until I can obtain from the Persian Government an official announcement that the main route is now open. So far I have not been able to extract this announcement. Nevertheless it will be noticed that caravans are passing along this road and also along the road from Shiraz to Ispahan, and no robberies have been reported from any part of the road since the 5th December. This improvement is due, no doubt, more to the cold weather than to the measures taken for the security of the road. But Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor-General of Ears, if the Persian Government perseveres in its efforts to support him with troops and obtains the means of doing so by accepting the Imperial Bank of Persia’s loan, should before the end of the winter have behind him a force which should give him a fair chance of coping with the situation without Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s aid. In any case I think that while immunity from robberies on the Bushire-Ispahan road, which has now lasted for three weeks, continues it would hardly be desirable that we should begin to insist on the acceptance of our scheme for the policing of the road. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 5. Memorandum by Major Stokes. EARLY in November Soulet-ed-Dowleh arrived at Kazerun at the request of the Minister of the Interior, and negotiations by telegraph were immediately begun with him for the opening up of the Kazerun road to Bushire. While the negotiations wereproceeding, on the 14th November a very serious robbery by Boir Ahmedis (100 on foot and 10 mounted) took place at Ak-Chashmeh, the point at which the Kazerun and Firuzabad roads meet, some 12 miles from Shiraz. Over 100 mules and 100 loads were carried off, half the plundered goods being the property of British merchants. This robbery, occurring when it did, could only be harmful^ to Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s interests. In reply to telegrams from His Majesty’s acting consul and from the Shiraz merchants he stated that he had sent a force to recover the goods. So far none of the stolen property has been restored. Meanwhile negotiations for the opening of the Kazerun road continued. Soulet- ed-Dowleh was most reluctant to open the road because of the pecuniary loss entailed to him by the closing of the Jirreh road, and because once the Kazerun road is opened the central Government can gradually take over the policing of it themselves. If they do this, he loses control of the main trade route, which is the chief cause of his power. On the other hand, as his representatives at Tehran pointed out to him, the Persian Government must, in view of the British note of the 14th October, open the Kazerun road, and if, therefore, he would not agree to do it, they would be compelled to use force against him. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, well aware of his inability to hold his own if force were used against him, agreed to open the road. The Government on their part undertook to pay for any number of guards he might find necessary to keep the road open. In addition, he was promised the support of the Government and, it is said, the governorships of Kamarij and Mamasenni. The Kazerun road was accordingly opened, and of 400 guards, for which it was arranged the Government should pay, 200 were placed on the section Kazerun- Shiraz. Relying on Soulet-ed-Douleh’s declaration that the road was safe, over 3,000 mules left Shiraz for Bushire during the last week of November. On the 27th November a strong force of robbers, said to be the Boir Ahmedis and Kashgais, attacked these caravans at Pul-i-Karakach and carried off 184 loads, 260 animals, and two pilgrims (women). There were no British goods in these caravans. This robbery caused a panic among the merchants in Shiraz, and did much harm to Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s renascent popularity. Towards the end of November there was some fighting amongst the Kashgais near Kazerun as a result of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s attempts to chastise the Farsismadan tribe, which was apparently chiefly responsible for the damage done to the telegraph lines last October. Some twenty men were killed on both sides. A third robbery occurred on the 5th December some 40 miles from Shiraz, when a caravan accompanied by troops was attacked by a mixed band of Kashgais and Lurs. No details are to hand of the extent of the robbery. What seems clear is that the widespread disaffection against him in his own tribe is making the task of safeguarding the Kazerun road a difficult one for Soulet-ed-Dowleh. He has so far failed either to afford effective protection to caravans or to recover plundered goods. Caravans on the main route are, however, reaching Bushire in safety, and the majority of the local merchants are dispatching goods, though certain British firms hesitate to do so pending assurances from His Majesty’s Legation that the Persian Government will be held responsible for losses. The first results of the British note of the 14th October were to make Soulet-ed- Dowleh for the moment supreme, and to force him to open the Kazerun road. Three months were all too short a time for the Persian Government to get a new Governor- General to Shiraz and to open the road themselves. Consequently they had to offer Soulet-ed-Dowleh the choice between opening the road and being treated as a rebel. He chose the former. The Shiraz-Ispahan road is being used by caravans with safety. This safety is to be attributed in great measure to the arrival of winter, and failing the presence of a strong governor with troops, the spring, when the tribes begin to migrate, will once more be a period of danger.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia during the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 6. Summary of Events in Persia for month ending December 2/, 1910. Tehran. ALL the Bakhtiari khans arrived at Tehran at the beginning of December, and shortly afterwards called on His Majesty’s Minister. They all appear to be on friendly terms. It has been decided between them that Sardar Mohtashem (the Ilbeggi) and Sardar Bahadur (Sardar Assad’s eldest son) are to proceed to the Bakhtiari country with full powers from the other khans to settle certain outstanding questions there. They have decided to leave Tehran on the 2nd January. Sardar Assad continues to play a prominent political role at Tehran, though at present out of office. Hussein Kuli Khan resigned the post of Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 27th instant, and a reconstruction of the Cabinet seems therefore imminent. The proposed loan from the Imperial Bank of Persia was put before the Medjliss by the Minister of Finance (Sani-ed-Dowleh) on the 6th instant, and though the necessity for the loan was not disputed by the members they insisted upon being- consulted as to the programme of expenditure, and also to be assured of proper control. The question has not since been discussed in public. Meshed. The state of Khorassan is generally unsatisfactory, the conduct of the local police leaving much to be desired. Mohamed Ali, Nishapuri, still maintains his position at Gunabad. In the absence of a Governor-General, Zahir-es-Sultan has been in a very difficult position, having neither money nor troops with which to support his authority. He has, however, displayed tact and resource, and has shown genuine anxiety to avert disorders. When telegrams of a very provocative nature from Nejef were received at Meshed, urging vigorous protest against the British note of the 14th October, Zahir-es-Sultan prevented the telegrams becoming public property, and persuaded the local assembly to content itself with a telegram of protest to the foreign representatives at Tehran. Reports from Turbat speak of the complete absence of security in the district, and the roads generally are unsafe. Major Sykes telegraphed on the 13th December that disturbances were possible at Meshed, where the deputy- governor was in fear of his life. At Daragez trouble began in the middle of November, when the governor and chief of police were drWen out of the town. On the 25th, a new governor with some horsemen was dispatched from Meshed. On the 28th November a mob killed a customs official and nine horsemen, and wounded the governor. On the 2nd December, a section of the inhabitants of Daragez went to Bajgiran, where they seized the custom-house and police officials, and robbed travellers, mostly Russian subjects. Their numbers being increased to 300 they decided to attack Kuchan, hut the relief^squadron of Russian Cossacks which was on its way to Meshed was sent back to Ivuchan, and the town was probably thereby saved from being sacked. The Russian consul-general then proposed to keep fifty Cossacks at Kuchan, and to have 400 Cossacks ready at Gaudan on the frontier, to be called in if necessary. Major Sykes concurred in these proposals. On the 13th December he reported that the new Governor of Daragez wqs, on arrival there, imprisoned, and his servants killed. 300 robbers were believed to be still near Kuchan. M. Poklewski has since modified M. Gregorieff s proposals to the extent of asking for fiftv Cossacks at Kuchan and only 100 at Gaudan.Birjand. On the night of the 3rd November ten armed men attacked Mr. Howson’s caravan between Aliabad and Bandan. Fortunately, Mr. Howson and his family were some way in the rear of the caravan. On hearing shots, he, with a few Chagai horsemen, pushed forward. On hearing their approach the robbers made off with fifteen camels and their loads. Mr. Howson followed at dawn and recovered twelve camels with their loads, but though he pursued for 30 miles, the robbers got away with three camels. Seistan. The roads in Seistan are reported unsafe, and there have been several robberies of camels from caravans. It is unsafe for caravans to move without escorts, and escorts of Persian horsemen are difficult to obtain. Ispahan. The condition of the town has remained normal. The price of foodstuffs has continued to rise. Much snow has fallen, and the cold and dearness of living- are said to have caused widespread distress and much illness. The municipality has arranged to purchase large quantities of wheat from the principal holders of grain, but so far the price of bread has not fallen. During the month a number of Bakhtiaris have complained to the local assembly that they have not been paid by their chiefs for their services at Kashan. The assembly has tried to arrange the matter with the chiefs, who are now at Tehran. The condition of the province is apparently quiet, and the roads are, generally speaking, safe. Posts, carried by men to Abadeh and thence by horse to Ispahan, are coming through from Shiraz, and since the 28th November no robbery has been reported on the Shiraz road. There have been no robberies on any of the roads during December. Yezd. With the exception of the Nain road, which has lately been fairly safe, all the roads have been very disturbed and numerous robberies are reported. Large bands of marauders appear to be about, who plunder caravans and villages. M. Petroff remains at Anar, unable to continue his journey to Yezd. Salar-i-Moayyed, the late governor, left Yezd on the 17th November. Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, has assumed office as governor. His Majesty’s vice-consulate is now free of refugees, but during the past few weeks several persons have been in refuge, the danger from which they sought escape being due directly or indirectly to the late governor. Kermanshah. Nizam-es-Sultaneh left for Shiraz via Pusht-i-Ivuh on the 28th November. Pending the arrival of the new governor, Ridm-ed-Dowleh, two deputy-governors have been appointed. The leaders of the rival factions in Kermanshah have met and sworn to act together in future. The neighbourhood of Kermanshah has been somewhat disturbed, and several robberies have been reported on the roads. The road between Kasr-i-Shirin and Sar-i-Pul is rendered unsafe by the presence of robbers, said to be Kalhors. In the Kuliali tribe there has been fighting between rival sections. The acting governor has sent an emissary to make peace between them. Ramadan. Several robberies of caravans are reported quite close to Hamadan. In each of two cases four men were killed by the robbers. The post, with parcels and passengers, was robbed on the 20th November, a servant of His Majesty’s consulate at Kermanshah being amongst the robbed. At the end of November the governor resigned and left, leaving the Government in the hands of the heads of the administration. Kerman. The condition of the town has remained normal, but His Majesty’s consul describes the condition of the province in November as deplorable. [188] B 36 The road to Yezd is still closed by robbers, of whom 400 under Samsam-i-Nizam were reported, on the 24th December, to be within 4 miles of the Damalabad road. Though many rumours of the movements of Baluchi forces have been current, no further details of their actual movements have been received. Bunder Abbas. On the 21st November a caravan was plundered on the Kerman road, British goods to the value of 100Z. being included in the plunder. No. 7. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 11, 1911.) gj r Tehran, December 31, 1910. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the note which the Persian Government have addressed to me in reply to my note of the 1/th ultimo'' respecting the insecurity on the southern roads. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 7. Vazir Zadeh to Sir G. Barclay. (Translation.) Your Excellency, Tehran, 25 Zilhejjeh, 1328 (December 28, 1910). IN reply to your answering note of the 17th November, I have the honour to say regarding your idea that the effects of the stay of foreign troops on Persian soil are not relevant, that as your sense of the importance of things will testify, there can he no doubt that the presence of foreign troops in the interior of a country naturally engages the attention of the Government and causes its prestige to suffer, and for this cause the good intentions of the Government for complete good order as desirable are unproductive of result, but as this matter was fully dealt with in my note of the 21st October, I do not think it necessary to repeat myself on this occasion. Regarding communications between Bushire and Shiraz to which you referred, your Excellency is not unaware that the Persian Government, which has always borne in mind the necessity to uphold commercial relations, has appointed Soulet-ed-Dowleh to maintain order on the Bushire-Shiraz road. Besides this, the Persian Government have taken preliminary steps for the further maintenance of order, which I now communicate to your Excellency :— 1. A competent governor-general, with necessary instructions, has been appointed and sent to Ears, and will shortly arrive at his post. After his arrival he will take fundamental measures for the completion of entire order in those parts. 2. The responsibility for the protection of security on the Kazerun road has been entrusted to Soulet-ed-Dowleh. At present he has placed 380 mounted and unmounted guards on that road, and they are patrolling it, and according to reliable reports the Kazerun road is in perfect security. 3. A force composed of mounted and unmounted men as well as artillery is being sent; of these 700 men and three guns sent from Tehran have passed Kum, two regiments from Hamadan, and the Jelali regiment will join the force at Ispahan. This force is over and above the garrison at present in Ears. 4. A considerable sum out of the loan which is about to be concluded will be laid aside for the perfection of security, and the Government is engaged in elaborating a system by which the expenditure necessary for this purpose will be properly laid down and its control properly carried out. 5. Besides the appointment to Ears of one of the European military officers serving under the Persian Government, very shortly a number of men will be employed and will arrive from abroad for the prompt organisation of the gendarmerie. I have no doubt whatever that in view of these measures the project of the Persian Government Lm the perfection of order will be fully carried out, and that your Excellency’s anxieties will be dispelled. * See “Persia No. 1 (1911),” No. 206.With ^ regard to your Excellency’s statement that the increase of the customs in Takagoui-il (1909—10) concern the north and not the south, I have the honour to draw your attention to the fact that the cause of the increase in the northern customs is only due to the importation of a large quantity of silver, and has no connection with the general trade of the country. As to the statement made in your Excellency’s note that the receipts of Bushire last year were less than those of “ Pichi-il ” (1908-9), and that likewise the receipts of “ Pichi-il ” (1908-9) were much less than the year previous to that, I have the honour to inform you that although the customs receipts of “ Pichi-il ” were less, on the other hand, however, the customs receipts of the other southern ports were doubled. Therefore, the whole trade of the southern ports should be taken into consideration in their entirety in order that a proper idea should be formed of the trade of the south. In these circumstances, it is perfectly clear that, even if compared to the customs receipts of the last three years, those receipts of the five months mentioned in my note show a palpable improvement. With respect, however, to the increase in the first five months of the present year, regarding which you stated that the harvest of the present year was an exceptionally abundant one, I have the honour to say that the abundance of the harvest can only affect the receipts accruing from exports and not from imports. Regarding your statement that the receipts of the Bushire customs have increased by 12 per cent., I do not think it superfluous to remind you that although an increase of 12 per cent, is a considerable one and worthy of being taken into account, and that such an increase in the commercial statistics of other countries is a proof of a progress in trade, the increase in the customs receipts of Bushire are much in excess of 12 per cent., since the increase of “ It-il ” over “ Takagoui-il ” was 20,943 tomans, which makes a difference of 20 per cent. If we only take the customs receipts on imports into consideration the increase of “ It-il ” over “Takagoui-il” is 25,412 tomans, which gives an increase of 25 per cent. I have no doubt that in view of these facts your Excellency will agree that the general trade of the south has not suffered and has even increased and progressed during the last (few) years. Regarding the surtax of 10 per cent, on the southern customs, the Persian Government are grateful for the friendly assistance of the British Government, and, in view of the supreme importance attached by the Persian Government to the perfection of order and the consolidation of commercial relations, they will institute a scheme by which the revenue derived from this source will be effectively applied to the expen diture in view. In these circumstances, I have no doubt that the scheme which the Persian Government have in view for the effective expenditure of this money will be considered sufficient for the fulfilment of this condition. But in reply to the last paragraph of your Excellency’s note, I have the honour to refer your Excellency to my note of the 21st October. YAZIR ZADEH. No. 8. Sir G.

His Majesty has, the Minister has good reason to know, been m correspondence with certain of ids partisans in Persia, who encourage him to think that were he to appear in Persia he would find many supporters, and lie would not be surprised if His Majesty were consequently to attempt to return to his native country.

Barclay to the Persian Government dealing with the surcharge of 10 per cent, on the customs of the Persian Gulf ports, and the matter was made clear to him by Sir A. Nicolson. Count Wrangel then said that his Government had taken no steps with regard to the Swedish officers required for the reorganisation of the Persian gendarmerie, and Sir A. Nicolson replied that, so far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, there was no objection to their proceeding with the matter, hut that since the last conver sation between Count Wrangel and himself, it had been made clear that the engagement of these officers was desired for the whole of Persia and not for the province of Ears only, as had been previously understood. Count Wrangel said that he remembered that, on the last occasion when the question had been discussed between them, Sir A. Nicolson had said that the officers were required for service in the south. Sir A. Nicolson observed that as regards Northern Persia the matter was more interesting to the Russian than to His Majesty’s Government, and perhaps was being discussed by the Swedish Government with the former at St. Petersburgh.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note which, in accordance with your instructions, I have to-day addressed to the Persian Government in reply to their note of the 28th December last, respecting the re-establishment of order on the Bushire Ispahan road. I have, &amp;e. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 19. Sir G. Barclay to Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. M. le Ministre, Tehran, January 21, 1911. I DID not fail to communicate to my Government the Vazir Zadeh’s note of the 28th December, and I have been instructed to inform your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government have learned with satisfaction that the Persian Government is taking special measures to restore order on the southern roads. Reports from His Majesty T ’s consular officers show, however, that the diminution of robberies on the main route from Bushire to Shiraz which has characterised the past few weeks is due not so much to any arrangements so far made by Soulet-ed-Dowleh for the guarding of the road, as to the unusual severity of the weather. Until therefore the execution of the measures decided upon by the Persian Government has made more progress, His Majesty’s Government are unable to judge whether these measures are likely to form an acceptable substitute for the scheme outlined in my note of the 14th October. Meanwhile, however, His Majesty’s Government recognise in the Persian Govern ment’s decision to take these measures evidence that they are determined to do their utmost to restore order on the southern trade routes, and are therefore disposed to defer pressing their scheme on the Persian Government pending the results of the further development of the measures in question. I am to state, however, that it must be clearly understood that His Majesty’s Government will reconsider this expectant attitude in the event of a recrudescence of disorders on the Bushire-Ispahan road, and that they reserve the right to insist on the engagement of British-Indian officers at any moment should His Majesty^ Government perceive that the measures taken by the Persian Government are not likely to suffice for the prompt re-establishment of security. With regard to the proposed customs surcharge, I am instructed to point out to your Excellency that the surcharge would be virtually a tax on British trade. His Majesty s Government consider the imposition of this additional burden, in the circum stances, justifiable as a temporary expedient if British officers are responsible to the Persian Government for the organisation of the force, the cost of which the surcharge was designed to meet. They cannot, however, consent to it merely as a means of enabling the Persian Government to attempt to perform a duty which ought to be a •iii c ^ ar S e on f^e ordinary Persian revenues, without any guarantee that the attempt will be successful.

Teheran , le 31 decembre , 1910 (v. s.) (Translation.) BETWEEN the Government of His Majesty the Shah and the Discount Bank of Persia, it has been agreed as follows :— Article 1. All sums due from the Government of His Majesty the Shah to the Discount Bank of Persia, according to the accounts presented by the bank and accepted by the said Government, are now consolidated and unified into a total sum of 60,416,622 krans 80 centimes, repayable in fifteen years reckoned from the 1st (14th) July, 1910, to the 1st (14th) July, 1925. The interest on this debt shall be calculated at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum. In order to make the amount of the debt a round sum, a sum of 416,622 krans 80 centimes shall be deducted from the available balance of the customs revenues at the Discount Bank of Persia, in partial amortisation of the said debt on the 1st (14th) July, 1910. Article 2. The amortisation of this debt, fixed at the total sum of 60,000,000 krans, as well as the payment of interest, shall be effected by the Persian Government within a period of fifteen years from the 1st (14th) July, 1910, by equal half-yearly payments of 3,262,279 krans 90 centimes, representing a total of 6,524,559 krans 80 centimes per annum. Article 3. The present debt and its regular amortisation are secured on the revenues of all of the Persian customs except those of Fars and of the ports of the Persian Gulf, but only after payment of the following obligations :— {a.) The annuity on the two gold loans of 1900 and 1902, amounting to 1,670,194 r. 20 c. ; (5.) Certain obligatory disbursements by the Persian Government, being a charge on the northern customs, amounting in all to 5,107,000 krans per annum. Ihe Persian Government, which is already bound by previous engagements (con tracts of 1900 and 1902) to pay into the Discount Bank of Persia the whole of the above-mentioned customs revenues without any deduction, renews that engagement for the entire period of the present contract, and until the complete amortisation of its debts to the Discount Bank. By customs^ revenues are understood the revenues of all the custom-houses which now exist or which may in future be established in the same regions, after deduction of the costs of collection and administration (these costs amount approximately to the sum of 3,500,000 krans per annum).15 Article 4. During the course of every half-year, in accordance with the stipulations of article 3 above, the Discount Bank, holding the customs receipts on deposit, shall proceed in the following manner :— (a.) In the first place the Discount Bank shall pay, as is customary, the annuity on the two gold loans of 1900 and 1902. (b.) It shall retain, in the second place, a sum sufficient to cover, as they respec tively become due, the obligatory disbursements of the Persian Government mentioned in article 3 (6), the order for the paymeut of which shall be given by the Minister of Finance of His Majesty the Shah through the Customs Administration. (c.) The balance shall be assigned to the payment of the interest on and the amortisation of the debt consolidated by the present convention. Article 5. At the end of each half-year, i.e., on the 1st (14th) July and the 1st (14th) January, the Discount Bank shall place at the disposal of the Persian Government the surplus of the customs receipts paid into the said bank as security for the payments specified in article 4 of the present convention. Article 6. Whenever the customs revenues deposited in the course of one half-year are not sufficient to cover all the payments provided for in article 4 above, the Persian Government shall be bound to complete the sum, with interest at 7 per cent, per annum, from other sources, within a period of six months. If, after this^ period, the deficit is not made good, the Discount Bank shall have the right to require that the revenues of the mint shall be placed wholly at its disposal pending payment of arrears and of interest thereon calculated at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum. It follows that the Persian Government will keep the revenues of the mint free of all charges as from the 1st (14th) January, 1912. Article 7. At the expiration of each month the Discount Bank shall present to the Persian Government a statement of the payments made by the Customs Administration, as well as an extract from the current account mentioned in article 9 of the present convention. Article 8. The Persian Government retains the right to effect the total_ amortisation of the consolidated debt before the expiration of the period fixed by article 1 of the present convention. The repayment of the debt may, however, only take place at the expiration of a complete year, that is, the 1st (14th) July, and upon two months’ notice being given. Article 9. The customs revenues paid into the Discount Bank remain there on deposit until they reach the total of the half-yearly obligations mentioned under (a) and (6) of article 4. The surplus shall be placed to the credit of the Persian Government in a current account opened for the purpose, and shall carry interest at the rate of 7 per cent, per annum from the date of encashment. In the event of the total amortisation of the consolidated debt, this current account shall be closed. Article 10. In the event of disputes as regards the interpretation of the clauses of the present convention, the French text shall prevailArticle 11.

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman on the subject of the present condition of the provinces of Kerman and Baluchistan. The seriousness of the situation cannot be denied, but the arrival of the new Governor-General, the Jelal-ed-Dowleh, may very possibly have a beneficial result.

I HAVE the honour of addressing you on the subject of the condition of the provinces of Kerman and Baluchistan, with a view to its being brought to the notice of the Persian Government, should such a course commend itself to you. 2. It is not too much to say that Persian Baluchistan is, and has for some time past been, independent. This would be a matter of small importance, except to the Persian Government, if the Baluchis would settle down peaceably within their own borders, but this they show no disposition to do, and they repeatedly raid the Kerman province, robbing and murdering not only travellers, who must expect in these days of anarchy to run risks, but also peaceful villages. Even if the Persian Government acknowledged the independence of Baluchistan, which it is not likely to do, it would still be responsible for lives and property of its subjects in the province of Kerman. 3. As regards Kerman itself, the districts of Jiruft and Rudbar seem to be inclined to follow the example of their neighbours in Baluchistan. The Deputy Governor of Jiruft was murdered considerably more than a month ago, and the murderers are still at large, and the Governor of Jiruft and Rudbar now reports that he will be unable to collect any revenue unless reinforcements are sent to him. The condition of the rest of the province is far more deplorable than that of Baluchistan, for the Baluchis can protect themselves, while the Kermanis are not only unable to defend themselves, but can expect no protection from a feeble Government. On the north and east the province is subject to the depredations of the Baluchis, and on the south and west to those^ of robbers from Fars, and there is no force fit to oppose these brigands. A lecapitulation of the various raids reported from time to time in the weekly news from Kerman would be tedious, but within the last month or two the Hindus have been lobbed, between Bunder Abbas and Kerman, of property worth 16,000 tomans, and five oi six posts have been robbed and destroyed between Kerman and Tehran. I have received no post from Tehran since the 23rd November, and for more than a fortnightpast the road between Kerman and Yezd has been entirely closed to traffic, the Shims stage, which consists only of a caravanserai and a post-house, having been held by a strong force of robbers, who not only rob travellers, but have been raiding the country nearly as far as the north-western boundary of Kerman in the one direction and as far as the neighbourhood of Bahramabad in the other. M. Petroff, lately acting Pussian consul at Kerman, who left the town considerably more than a month ago, was robbed before he had travelled three stages, and was never able to proceed beyond Anar, six stages from Kerman. Within the last few days he has been compelled to retire to Bayaz, as the robbers holding Shims have begun to raid Anar. Baluchis or Sistanis are once more active between Bam and Kashit, and I have recent reports of robbery and murder committed by therm The Acting Governor, Sardar-i-Nusrat, is fully alive to his responsibilities, but is utterly unable to cope with the situation. To two demands recently made by me for satisfaction for the robbery of the property of British subjects in the direction of Shims he has replied that the local Government of Pars is responsible, as the robbers now holding Shims belong to that province—a sufficiently candid confession of his inability to maintain order. 4. I have not yet heard of the departure from Tehran of Jelal-ed-Dowleh, recently appointed Governor-General of Kerman and Baluchistan, and do not even know whether he still intends to take up his appointment, though the establishment of a strong Government in these provinces is a matter of the most pressing necessity. I am, &amp;c. T. W. HAIG, Lieutenant-Colonel, No. 27. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received February 13.) Sir, Tehran, January 23, 1911. SINCE writing toy despatch of the 27th December last, I have received reports of two or three trifling robberies on the Bushire-Tspahan road, but they did not seem of sufficient importance to warrant my reporting them by telegraph. There has certainly been a diminution of disorders on the road and caravans are passing along it. According to a telegram from the acting British consul at Shiraz received this morning, “the road is deep under phenomenal snow and robberies are now unlikely.” Mr. Smart adds “ Caravans accumulate fitfully and proceed with special guards, the post arriving every two or three weeks.” There is not much progress to report in the development of the measures which the Persian Government stated in their note of the 28th December that they were taking for the re-establishment of security on the road. Soulet-ed-Dowleh appears to have insufficient control over his tribesmen to encourage any confident hope that he will be able to cope with any recrudescence of disorders in the spring. Nizam-es-Sultaneh has not yet got beyond Bushire on his way to his post, and no troops have yet left Ispahan for Shiraz, though I understand that the 700 men and 3 guns sent from Tehran have reached Ispahan, and have been joined by some 800 more ordered to Shiraz. The Imperial Bank’s loan, on which the efficacy of the Persian Government’s measures for the policing of the road so much depends, is like all else in Government life in Tehran, hanging fire pending the arrival of the Begent, Nasr-ul-Mulk, who left Vienna on the 17th instant, and has now reached Baku. No progress has been made in the work of the commissioners appointed to study the apportionment of the proceeds of the loan amongst the different Ministries, and to elaborate a system of control, though instructions have been issued for its working. General Maletta, the foreign officer referred to in the Persian Government’s note of the 28th December as having been appointed and sent to Ears, has not yet left Tehran. He was to have left yesterday, but is still delayed awaiting written instructions. He called on me on the 19 th instant to say good-bye. Just before his visit I had seen the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on whom I had urged the importance of facilitating General Maletta’s work in every way. His Excellency told me that a sum of 80,000 tomans had been remitted to the Imperial Bank’s branch at Shiraz towards the expenses of the proposed force, and he assured me that no part of this money would be spent without General Maletta’s consent. I conveyed these assurances to General Maletta. I begged him to inform His Majesty’s consulate at Shiraz at once if he was in [ 188 ] Cmm HHBBnBnHBmHHHHHBHHnHHnHHBBHHi 18 any way obstructed by the local authorities in the execution of his duties, and promised that any complaints that he had to make on this score would receive my immediate attentaon.^ ^ f ^ favourably impressed by General Maletta, who seemed to have proper realisation of the importance and opportunities of his mission. L x 1 have, &amp;c. G. BAECLAY. P S January 27 —Since writing the above I learn that 2,000 troops, with three mins, have left Ispahan for Shiraz, and also that Nizam-es-Sultaneh has started on ins onward journey from Bushire. I also learn that General Maletta leaves Tehran to-morrow, and that he has now received adequate instructions. ^ ^ No. 28. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received February 13.) Tehran, January 24, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that Nasr-ul-Mulk landed at Enzeli yesterday. As soon as it was definitely known that Nasr-ul-Mulk had at last made up Ins mind to return to Persia, the Prime Minister, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek gave out that his Ministry was resolved to resign as soon as Nasr-ul-Mulk was installed as Regent, and Sardar Assad has since then desisted from his attempts to upset the Cabinet. ^ ^ Even before Hussein Kuli Khan’s resignation there were some indications of a detente in the relations of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the Russian Minister, and this detente has become more pronounced since the appointment of Mohtashem-es- Sultaneh. Since Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh assumed office, not only has the arrangement for the consolidation of the Persian Government s debt to the Russian Bank heen concluded, but certain Russian claims, notably that on account of the attack on M. Passek, have been settled. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 29. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.--(Received February 13.) Tehran^ January 24, 1911.

Summary of Events in Persia for four weeks ending January 24, 1911. Tehran, MOHTASHEM-ES-SULTANEH was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 3rd January. Ain-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of the Interior, resigned on the 22nd January. The Premier has announced his intention of handing in his resignation and that of his Cabinet as soon as the Regent arrives at Tehran. The Medjliss. At the sitting of the 3rd January, Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh, the new Foreign Minister, was introduced in that capacity by the Premier. In answer to an interpellation the new Foreign Minister stated that the Governmentintended to organise a force of gendarmerie in Ears under the command of foreign officers. For this purpose the Italian Government had been applied to, but had not seen their way to meet the wishes of the Persian Government. The Swedish Govern ment were then applied to and a telegram had been received from the Persian Minister in Paris giving the conditions upon which the Swedish Government were willing to supply the officers in question. The matter has been put before the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House. He concluded by declaring that the Government were determined to restore order and security in Ears. At the sitting of the 5th January, an attempt was made to bring on a vote of censure against the Cabinet, but the motion to discuss the subject of the Government's shortcomings and the alleged unpopularity of the Medjliss, was rejected by tbe majority. The Ministers who were in an adjoining room, howmver, deputed Sani-ed- Dowleh to ask the House, in view of what had occurred, to vote definitely for or against the continuance in office of Mustaufi-ul-Marnalek’s Cabinet. Sani-ed-Dowleh stated that if the Cabinet were dissolved the Regent could be asked by telegraph to appoint a new Premier. The speeches which followed revealed a great deal of party and personal prejudice, and it was hinted that the ex-Shah’s intrigues were favoured by certain high officials. Eventually Sani-ed-Dowleh left the hall without any decision having been reached. On the 21st January one of the five priests elected in accordance with article 2 of the Constitution of 1907 to “reject Bills contrary to the sacred precepts of Islam,” entered a vigorous protest against a proposed Bill introducing a new tax on opium. At the sitting of the 24th January the Minister of War submitted a project for collecting conscripts from among the tribes. He said that by taking one man from every thirty families, at least 10,000 fighting men could be raised. The matter was referred to a committee. Tabreeg. Quiet has prevailed. An agitation against the Governor-General was begun, but an attempt to find support for it from Tehran having failed, it collapsed. Meshed. Sahib-i-Ikhtiar, the new Governor-General, arrived on the 21st December. The general state of the province is much as it was, though the main road to Tehran is reported fairly safe. The trouble at Daragaz has been got over by the appointment of Masud Khan as governor. This man was the prime cause of the disturbances, and the rebels demanded that he should be made ‘governor. Mohamed Ali, Nishapuri, was surrounded in a fort near Tabbas, but, though wounded, escaped. He will probably join Naib Hussein, Kashi, who is moving towards Tabbas from the direction of Yezd. Ispahan. Quiet has prevailed in the town and the province. The roads are all reported on the whole safe, but the material condition of the Yezd and Ahwaz roads is said to be very bad. Three robberies, however, have occurred recently, two on the Ahwaz and one on the Tehran road. In two cases the post was robbed, and in the third a caravan belonging to Messrs. Lynch. These robberies are believed to be the work of malcontent Bakhtiaris. Early in January a number of these Bakhtiaris gathered at Dahku, with the avowed intention of attacking Ispahan, but began to disperse on the 8th January. Sardar-i-Mohtashem and Sardar-i-Bahadur, Bakhtiaris, arrived at Ispahan on the 19th January, and left for the Bakhtiari country on the 22nd. Since the 1st January troops for Ears have arrived at Ispahan from Tehran and Hamadan, and the Jelali regiment, in garrison at Ispahan, has also been ordered to Ears. Yezd, 2aigham-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, the new governor, arrived early in December. _He has taken over charge of the policing of the roads. He is said to be awaiting the arrival of 200 horsemen, whom he has requested the Kawamis to send him from Ears. During December the Kerman road was almost entirely blocked. A party of 400^ Ears robbers seized a building at Shams and, making it their head-quarters, pillaged the district. [188] 0 2IP 20 M. Petroii', lately Russian consul at Kerman, was delayed for a long time at Anar, but reached Yezd safely escorted by a large number of road guards on the 31st December. Kerman. Jelal-ed-Dowleh, the new governor, arrived on the 21st January from Tehran. The roads in the province continued unsafe during December. Shiraz. During December interest centred in the condition of the Kazerun load to Bushire. On the 5th December a caravan was attacked at Sineh Sefid by fifteen robbers Kashgais and Mamasennis, and thirteen mules, four donkeys, and ten loads were carried off. An escort with the caravan, consisting of thirty gunners with one field gun and thirty-six mounted men, fled at the first shot. One muleteer was severely wounded. A force of 300 mounted men with one gun was subsequently sent to recover the plundered property. Exceptionally early and heavy snow has since guaided the road and caravans continue to pass up and down. It appears that Soulet-ed-Dowleh no longer has much influence in his own tribe. He has not endeavoured to police the road with his own men, but has employed local riflemen. Meanwhile Mqhamed Ali Khan, Kashguli, who is suspected of aiming at the chieftainship of the tribe, is said to be instigating robberies on the road. Soulet-ed-Dowleh has been endeavouring to effect a reconciliation with his brother, Soulet-es-Sultaneh, and with Mohamed Ali Khan, Kashguli. The latter enjoys great influence among the Lurs of Western Ears. He recently forcibly released two Farsimadan chiefs, whom Soulet-ed-Dowleh had imprisoned on account of the damage done to the telegraph lines last October by Kashgais. The Ispahan road has been disturbed by small bands of robbers. On the 8th December, a small caravan carrying stores to Dehbid for the Indo-European Telegraph Department was robbed near Dehbid. On the 13th December the post was robbed near Sivend by Kurshuis, and at about the same time a caravan of 150 donkeys bringing to Shiraz the produce of Mervdasht was robbed ] 2 miles north of Shiraz. Later two more posts were robbed, near Khaneh Kergan and Siven respectively. Latest reports state that the country is deep under snow, which makes robberies unlikely. The Kazerun road is said to be normal, while the Ispahan road is hardly being used at all. Persfan Gulf. Bushire. Soulet-ed-Dowleh, accompanied by 400 Kashgais, arrived at Bushire on the 29th December, 1910. The Khans of Daliki and Borasjun also arrived with 175 men, and Darya Beggi brought in 300 Tangestani and Angali tribesmen. No disturbances have occurred at Bushire. No. 30. . Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edidard Grey.—-(Received February 13.) Sir, St. Petersburgh) February 6, 191L WITH reference to your despatch of the 23rd ultimo, I have the honour to report that I communicated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs this afternoon the information which you had received from His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris respecting the ex-Shah of Persia. M. Sazonow said that His Majesty had been repeatedly Warned by the Russian representatives abroad that if he engaged in intrigues with a view to returning to Persia he would forfeit the pension which he at present enjoyed. His Excellency added that he would act on your suggestion, and warn the competent authorities to increase the vigilance of their watch on His Majesty’s movements after his return to Russia.

(Telegraphic.) _ Tehran, February 13, 1911^ IN a speech of two hours, Regent opened his mind to a full meeting of Medjliss summoned to palace yesterday afternoon. His Highness impressed on members that constitutional government on lines hitherto followed with Medjliss split up into small groups by personal dissensions was impossible. A stable majority united in principle of supporting Ministry was indispensable, and he made it clear that he would not take up his post unless such a majority was formed. It is expected that there will be another meeting in a day or two, when Medjliss will reply to Regent’s terms. In alluding to foreign relations, Regent stated he had received the foreign Ministers in unofficial audience, and was entirely satisfied as to the friendly attitude ol all the Powers, and he laid particular stress on good-will expressed by Great Britain and Russia. The Medjliss therefore need feel no concern on the score of foreign relations. No. 33. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. gj r Foreign Office, February 16, 1911.

It is expected that the names of these officials will be announced shortly. Mr. Shuster has been in the United States Customs in Cuba and the Philippines, and had charge of the reorganisation of the Philippines Customs Service.

Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 10.) THE Persian Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to acknowledge the receipt of his Excellency’s communication of the 2nd instant, in which it is stated that two robberies have recently taken place to the north of Shiraz. Mirza Mehdi Khan has made enquiries on the subject, and has now received a telegram from his Government, informing him that as soon as these acts of robbery occurred a force consisting of infantry and cavalry with guns was dispatched from the Ears mobile military force to punish the culprits and recapture the stolen goods. The telegram further states that some specie belonging to the Imperial Bank of Persia, which was stolen in the neighbourhood of Ispahan, was recovered within a day. Also one hundred* and two (?) cases of opium, property of Messrs. Ziegler and Co., which had been carried away within the boundaries of the province of Fars, have been recaptured and restored to the owners. In another telegram which Mirza Mehdi Khan has received from his Government a short account is given of the various steps taken by the Nezam-es-Saltane, the Governor-General of Fars, since his arrival in that province. The Tanguestani rebels have been completely repressed and their fortresses captured. The port of Dayer, which had been occupied by them, has been taken and rendered secure. A large force has been dispatched for the chastisement of the Boirahmadi and Behbehan rebels, and other energetic measures have been taken. Sir Edward Grey will see that any lawlessness that has taken place has been promptly and efficiently put down. This in itself is a proof of the efficiency of the measures taken by the Persian Government. His Excellency will also see that these measures, and the fact that the Governor-General of Fars is personally_ visiting and attending to the most disturbed districts on his way to Shiraz, give the fairest prospect for the maintenance of order and security in the south. In conclusion, the Persian Minister desires to assure the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the preservation of order and security along the southern trade routes, and, indeed, throughout the south, is a question which engages the closest, the most earnest, and the unremitting attention of his Government, who have so far, as Sir Edward Grey well knows, spared neither trouble nor expense in this connection, Persian Legation, March 8, 1911.

He added that the responsibility for these abominable acts of terrorism really lay with those who employed Bussian outlaws, and he strongly deprecated their receiving Government employ as had been the case in the past. He stated tha.t the Bussian Minister had personally expressed his horror at the acts committed by certain Bussian subjects, and assured his hearers that they would receive adequate punishment in Bussia, where they would have to be sent in accordance with treaty.

SINCE my despatch of the 23rd ultimo, there have been only two robberies on the Bushire—Ispahan road—-one near Kumisheh on the 13th instant, and one on the 18th instant, 8 miles south of Shiraz. In the former, no British goods were involved so far as I know, and the stolen property was promptly recovered. In the latter Messrs. Ziegler have lost goods valued at 1,000 tomans, but the Deputy Governor of Shiraz is reported to be displaying some energy, and is sanguine of recovering the loot. The comparative immunity from disorders on the road has thus continued up ^ to date.

His Excellency told me that there was some delay owing to the fact that Samad Khan, Persian Minister in Paris, through whom the matter is being treated with the Swedish Government, had pointed out that it was very desirable that the commanding officer should be a young man in view of the arduous work before him. It had originally been intended to apply for a man of colonels rank, but the Persian Government were now considering Samad Khan’s recommendation, m which the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me he and others of the Cabinet concurred &amp; I have, &lt;kc. a TURCBAY.

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for January 24 to February 23, 1911, Tehran. HIS Hiohness Nasr-ul-Mulk arrived at Tehran on the 9th instant, and Received the ftwe^gn representatives on the 11th instant. The followmg day h,s ILghness28 received the members of the Medjliss, to whom he exposed his views. He subsequently received deputations of the various classes. He has so far not taken the oath as prescribed by the constitution, and is therefore not yet technically the Regent. Sani-ed-Dowleh, the Finance Minister, was assassinated by a Russian subject on the 4th instant. The assassin fired at the Minister through his carriage as he was driving into his own house, after a visit to the manager of the Imperial Bank, with whom he had been discussing the final details of the Government loan. Three shots took effect, and though Dr. Scott was at once in attendance, it was found impossible to save Sani-ed-Dowleh, who died three or four hours later. The assassin and his associates, in endeavouring to escape, wounded several policemen, some of whom have since died The assassin with one accomplice was eventually arrested, and after a preliminary investigation the two men were handea over to the Russian Legation, it having been shown that they were Russian subjects. The Medjliss .—The president, Zoka-ul-Mulk, having resigned, owing to a demon stration at the sitting of the 26th January by deputies who accused him of not being impartial, Momtaz-ed-Dowleh was elected president on the 31st January by 45 votes out of a total of 76. Morteza Kuli Khan, formerly private secretary to the Zil-es- Sultan, was elected vice-president. The new president is a younger brother of the present Persian Minister in Paris, and was educated in France. He was president of the Medjliss when it was bombarded in June 1908, when he sought “bast” at the French Legation. Since Nasr-ul-Mulk’s arrival on the 9th instant a number of secret sittings have been held to discuss the Regent’s conditions regarding the formation of a regular parliamentary majority as a preliminary to the formation of a new Cabinet. Mustaufi- ul-Mamalek, the Premier, had tendered his resignation, and that of his three remaining colleagues, to the Regent immediately after his arrival. The different parties in the House eventually announced that they had divided themselves into two main groups with a definite programme each. The minority or “ democrats ” stated on the 18th instant that they were composed of twenty-one members, and produced their programme. On the 22nd instant the majority or “ moderates ” declared that the forty-nine deputies composing the party had agreed upon a programme. The names of the members of the majority were read out by their spokesman, Morteza Kuli Khan. It is understood that their nominee for the Premiership is Sipabdar, and that their choice falls in with the views of the Regent. Tabreez. The collapse of the agitation against the Governor-General was followed by the arrest of the ringleaders, who included Amir-i-Hishmat and Seyyid Muhakekin, a former president of the local assembly. The Governor-General’s action seems to have been generally approved, and there was no excitement in the town. During January fairly good order prevailed in the province, and no robberies of caravans were reported to His Majesty s consul. Rahim Khan arrived on the 23rd January under a safe conduct from the Governor-General.j Resht. From xeports recently received, it appears that since November last Mazanderan has been at the mercy of Ismail Khan, Amir Toman, of Savad Kub, Amir-i-Mukarram, Larijam, and Reshid-es-Sultan, who with 1,000 horse and foot made Rarfrush their head-quarters. During November the governor of Mazanderan, Zahir-ed-Dowleh, endeavoured to secure the dispersal of the rebels by negotiation, but failed, one of the conditions demanded being a general amnesty for Mazanderan, guaranteed by the British and Russian Legations. I he rebels collected revenue, which was spent on the up-keep of then foices. They have more than once ordered Zahir-ed-Dowleh to leave Mazanderan, but he has not complied. They have been in negotiation with the Turkomans, who, while excusing themselves from putting a force m the field on account of the severity of the weather, dispatched a deputation to Barfrush to arrange for an attack on Astrabad when the wea.ther improved. Several requests for British protec tion from the priests and notables of Mazanderan have reached His Majesty’s vice- consul, who has replied that he cannot interfere in the internal affairs of Persia. Early m January a Russian subject at Meshdisar was murdered by the brother-in-law of Amir-i-Mukarram and Yuzbashi Gurban, at the time guests in his house. The muiderers were taken to Barfrush, but were brought back to Meshdisar at the request of the Russian consul at Astrabad. Amir-i-Mukarram is suspected of having instigated the crime.Meshed. The province has remained quiet and no robberies were reported, but this is ascribed to the severity of the weather. Masud Khan, who was appointed Governor of Daragez, advanced to Kuchan, but spent some time there, apparently afraid to go on. Early in February, however, he received a reinforcement of 100 horsemen and two guns, whereupon he advanced on Daragez. The Governor-General is reported to be displaying caution and tact in the administration of the province. have left Ispahan. The cold abated towards the end of January, since when food supplies have come in freely. The roads have generally been free from robberies, but on the 9th February at Maderi Shah, on the Tehran road, Mr. D Alton of the Imperial Bank of Persia and other travellers were robbed of all their belongings by nine mounted robbers. On the Shiraz road a caravan was robbed 12 miles north-east of Kumisheh, but the goods plundered were recovered and three of the robbers were captured. On the morning of the 1st February, the Governor-General and his nephew, Mirza Abdul Bahim Khan, were both shot, the latter mortally, by Mirza Abbas Khan, formerly chief of police at Ispahan. The murderer with three companions then took refuge in the Bussian Consulate-General, claiming to be Bussian subjects. Motamid-i- Khakan had an extraordinary escape, as one bullet entered the left lung, and, passing near the heart, penetrated the right lung. He is making a good recovery. The Governor-General appears anxious to maintain order on the roads in his district, but is handicapped by want of funds, without which he is unable to engage men of his own tribe or others capable of facing robbers. During January a hand of 200 Baharlu robbers is reported to have raided ten villages, maltreating the inhabitants and carrying off 50,000 animals. On the Nain-Yezd road robbers weie said to be lying in wait, hut precautions being taken, no robberies occurred. The south routes being practically closed, there is an increase of trade with Bussia. On the 16th February Naib Hussein, with 300 horsemen, was reported to be plundering villao’es near Gusheh, 21 miles west of Damghan. At Gusheh ^he ki od three men and took away the post horses. The post horses of the neighbouring stages had been removed as a precaution, and postal communication between Meshed and Tehran is therefore interrupted. On the 18th February 300 horsemen left Tehran to pursue Naib Hussein. The new governor, Bukn-ed-Dowleh, arrived on the 16th January with an escort of forty-five Persian Cossacks. Quiet has prevailed, and a good police force is being Organised on the town. Daoud Khan having refused to come m to see the governor the latter has refused the services of 200 Kalhur horsemen whom he had summoned and who had assembled. The Minister of the Interior instructed the governor to send Samsam-uhMamalek, Sinjabi, as governor to Kasr-nShirm, but in the face of Daoud Khan’s opposition this has not been possible. Ispahan.

Shiraz. Intense cold prevailed during January. Caravans passed normally on the Kazerun road, and the Ispahan road continued semi-abandoned. On the 18th February a robbery of thirty loads of merchandise, including 200b worth of opium belonging to Messrs. Zeigler, occurred 8 miles north of Shiraz. The postal service to Ispahan is so disorganised that letters for the north are sent by Bushire. The Governor-General is still at Borasjun, where he is dealing with certain local chiefs who have not paid revenue of late years. Soulet-ed-Dowleh is with him, and rumour says that Soulet-es-Sultaneh and Mohamed Ali Khan, Kashguli, have been reconciled to him. The Ears movable column, consisting of some 2,500 men, arrived from Ispahan on the 16th February. An affray occurred between some of these troops and some townspeople, in which one of the latter was killed. No. 55. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 13.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, March 7, 1911. IN accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your despatch of the 24th ultimo, I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that the arrangements for the loan to be made by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government were at present at a standstill pending the formation of the new Persian Cabinet, but that the Persian Government had applied to the manager of the bank for an advance of 120,000 tomans. I added that yon had informed Sir George Barclay by telegraph that you saw no objection to the proposed advance. M. Sazonow expressed his thanks for this communication, and said that now that the Russian conversion scheme had been carried through he had absolutely no objection to the Imperial Bank making this advance. In the subsequent course of our conversation, his Excellency observed that the time was approaching when we should have to consider seriously the advisability of arranging for a large loan being made to Persia under the auspices of the two Governments.

TWO attempts to break into consulate on the 25th and 26th March respectively are reported by His Majesty’s consul, Kermanshah. On the 25th March two men were arrested. On the 26th March brigands entered sowars quarters and stole two uniforms and other goods. Shots were exchanged with some thirty men who, His Majesty’s consul thinks, were seeking to avenge their two comrades arrested on the 25th March. Mr. McDouall took measures for defence and informed governor of occurrence. _ Mr. McDouall further reports that a warning that the band threaten to kill the Indian sowars has been received. Stones were thrown on the 27th March, but the brigands desisted when they saw that consulate was well garrisoned, and betook themselves to the town, where they robbed the house of a notable. In the meanwhile, I have held Persian Government responsible for the safety of His Majesty s consulate and of British subjects at Rermanshah, and have urged that culprits be punished. No. 65. Sir G.

IN accoi dance with the custom prevailing when the accused are Russian subjects the enquiry into the murder of Sani-ed-Dowleh is being held in the Foreign Office Tribunal in Tehian, that into the attempt on Motamid-i-Khakan and into the murder of his nephew in the Rarguzar’s Court at Ispahan. A Russian official is following both cases. _ Nothing indicates that there has been any lack of co-operation on the part of the Russian Legation in Tehran, or of the Russian consulate-general at Ispahan. I he accused will be sent to Russia for trial when the proceedings are terminated. I wo other murders in which the accused were Russian subjects were committedlast year. The joint enquiry in Tehran failed, in one case, to establish anything, and the accused was merely deported to Russia, at the request of the Persian Government, by my Russian colleague. The guilt of the accused in the other was proved in Tehran. He is now, I understand, undergoing his trial in Russia. No. 66. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 31.) (Telegraphic.)

Tehran, March 7, 1911. THOUGH I endeavoured to convey to you in my telegram of the 5th instant the main points of the address which Nasr-ul-Mulk delivered the previous34 day at the Medjliss before taking the oath as Regent, I venture to think it important enough to merit a fuller summary compiled by Mr. Churchill, which I now have the honour to transmit. The Regent’s visit to the Medjliss was unattended by any special ceremonial, but he was received with particular respect by all present, including some of the diplomatic corps, among whom were the Turkish Ambassador, the United States Minister, and several members of my staff. All present stood when the Regent entered the Chamber, and again when he rose to take the oath. Though the address was listened to in silence, the absence of any kind of demon strativeness on the part of his audience in no way indicated that the Regent’s words were not listened to with appreciation. Persian statesmen are not in the habit of speaking as plainly as the Regent did on this occasion, and the directness of his language did. not fail to cause a profound impression. It is to be hoped that his earnest appeal to his hearers to put aside their personal animosities will have a salutary effect. 1 have, &amp;c. Gi. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 70. The Regent's Address at the Medjliss on the Ath March, 1911. AFTER stating that be had particularly requested that his present visit to the Medjliss should not be attended by any ceremonial, the Regent went on to explain at great length the cause of his delay in coming to Persia. His election had not been properly conducted, it had been done in haste ; and though he had refused the Regency when it was offered to him at the time of the opening of the present Medjliss, he had not been consulted as to whether he would accept it on this occasion; nor had his conditions been ascertained. His telegrams to Tehran on the subject had been ignored, and his enquiries as to the manner in which his election had been conducted had remained without answer. The election of a Regent, he stated, was not a party question. The Regent was outside party politics, and yet his election had been conducted on party lines. After dwelling on this point at some length, the Regent expressed his opinion that his election should not form a precedent, and that laws should be enacted governing the election of a Regent for the future. Resuming, he stated that, as his telegrams remained unanswered, he resolved, though reluctantly, to come to Persia to discuss the matter personally with those concerned. In the meantime, both in Persia and in the European press, his delay had been attributed to fear and a refusal to take office. Moreover, when in Europe he had received threatening letters. But he desired to say that it was neither fear nor a refusal to take office which had caused him to delay. The reason was, as he had already stated, that though he was chosen as Regent, the Cabinet did not send an answer to any of his questions. He must add, however, that the personal telegrams he had received from his friends in the Cabinet, from the deputies, and the telegram signed by all the deputies, had served as a personal recompense for shortcomings in another respect. On arriving at Tehran the Premier had tendered his resignation, and he had therefore found himself confronted with a Cabinet crisis. In order not to allow this uncertain state of affairs to continue, he had come to the Medjliss to take the oath. Before continuing, however, he desired to allude to the general impression which existed at Tehran and in the provinces, namely, that he was expected personally to put everything right. This, he declared, was quite an erroneous idea, and contrary to the fundamental laws, which gave no power to the Crown. He would dispel this error, as he did not wish to he blamed if the expectations of the people were not fulfilled. The Regent then went on to discuss what he thought was expected of him, and said he would follow that by stating what he expected of the Medjliss and the people. He said: “ Regarding your expectations of me, I think the fundamental laws are sufficient on this score. The deputies know this point better than I do, and my explanations are intended for the general public. In accordance with article 12, the framing of laws is the business of the National Assembly or the two Houses; the Crown must pass them, and has no power to modify them or hold them back. In accordance with article 44, the Ministers are responsible to the Medjliss, and article 67 decrees that if the Medjliss passes a vote of censure on the Ministers, they must be dismissed. If we take these laws into consideration, we will see that, though in formthe appointment of the Premier is the prerogative of the Crown, nevertheless, seeing that the Ministers are responsible to the Medjliss and t 1 iat they can he dismissed in consequence of the want of confidence of the majority, it is the custom in all constitutional countries, in order to provide against this contingency and continual Cabinet crises, for the Crown first to find out, through the President of the House of Representatives, the views of the majority, and then to appoint a Premier. He, in his turn, is entirely independent as to the choice of the members of his Cabinet, who will naturally be persons holding the same political convictions as himself. It will therefore be obvious that both the executive and legislative bodies are independent of the will of the Crown. It is clear from this that all power and responsibility for the conduct of the affairs of State lie with the National Assembly or the two Houses and the Ministry. All that remains for the Crown is to express opinions on State affairs in general, and that only unofficially, and the Cabinet is free, in view 7 of its responsibility to the Medjliss, either to accept or refuse such suggestions from the Crown as it thinks fit. These observations on my part are not to be taken as criticism or as an appeal for extended powers. If under certain circumstances the Medjliss should think it necessary to extend the powers of the Government—and such a contingency is quite conceivable —they must give such extended powers to the Ministers who are responsible to this House. After what I have said it will be quite clear to everyone that the form of oath prescribed by the fundamental laws is not compatible with the limited authority of the Crown, and, of course, everyone who is aware of these facts will take the oath in this spirit, and it is in this spirit that I will take the oath. I will with all my power strive to serve my country, the Government and nation, and to strengthen the foundations of the constitution.” The Regent then earnestly entreated the Medjliss and the Cabinet to direct their attention to pressing current affairs, and to strive earnestly, in complete accord with one another, to bring about the reforms so urgently needed. He thought it was perhaps superfluous to state that if the reintroduction of a parliamentary form of Government had not been attended with that measure of success wdiich had been so generally expected when the principal obstacles in its way had been removed, this want of success had been due to the unfortunate conflicts between parties and persons which he so much deplored. He earnestly hoped that these conflicts would in future be put an end to, and that complete harmony and brotherly co-operation would take their place. It was only by this means that the benefits of freedom and progress, such as are enjoyed by countries with parliamentary forms of Government, could be secured. In conclusion, the Regent, who spoke with much deliberation and earnestness, delivered the following warning :— “ If there should again appear symptoms of the former enmity, and if I see that affairs do not advance, but that, on the contrary, the difficulties are increased, by this oath which I am about to take, my conscience prompts me—and every right-minded person will agree with me—not to continue to hold this office and to witness such an unfortunate state of affairs. I am sure every individual member of the nation will in his heart approve, and in such circumstances—which I hope will not supervene—they will not be astonished if 1 withdraw, because I shall have acted in accordance with my duty both from a legal point of view and in accordance with the dictates of ordinary intelligence and in the interests of the State. I hope that the w 7 ay in which I have drawn your attention to the defects of affairs will not cause anyoue to protest, since it is important for all to know of important matters concerning internal affairs, and nothing should be hidden from them. Abroad also it will cause hope if they see that we are aware of our shortcomings, for it will seem as if we are trying to correct them.” The Regent then read the oath prescribed by the fundamental law and kissed the Koran. He afterwards informed the House that the majority of the deputies having let him know their choice, he had appointed Sipahdar-i-Azain to the office of Premier, and that he was forming a Cabinet. The Premier would, in the course of the next two or three days, lay his Cabinet’s programme before them, and would in the mean time conduct the current affairs of State.36 No. 71. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 10.) Sir, Tehran, March 9, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 22nd February respecting the progress of the measures on foot for the restoration of order on the southern roads, I have the honour to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from the acting British consul at Shiraz which contains information of a not very reassuring nature. This despatch reports the miserable state of the soldiers in garrison at Shiraz, owing to the non-payment of their wages. Mr. Smart views with apprehension the approaching arrival of the additional troops dispatched to Shiraz in accordance with the Persian Government’s programme, and represents the dangers which the accumulation of such a rabble threatens unless some satisfactory arrangements are made for its more or less regular pay. I at once brought the substance of this despatch to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and emphasised the importance of paying these troops regularly, adding that the Persian Government would be incurring great risks by neglecting this elementary duty. The Mohtashem-es-Sulbaneh, while stating that the reformed troops had been paid in advance up to the end of February, promised to speak to the Minister of War on the subject. Mr. Smart also reports the deplorable state of insecurity on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, and states that he cannot iay too much stress on the fact that the Persian Government had not up to the beginning of February taken any special measures to ensure a reasonable amount of continuous security on that section of the southern trade route. That this statement still holds good is proved by telegrams recently received from Mr. Knox, who has replaced Mr. Smart as consul at Shiraz, to the effect that since the robberies mentioned in my despatch of the 22nd February two more robberies on a large scale took place on that date (as reported in my telegram of the 28th February) in the district north of Shiraz. In the one case, which took place within 12 miles of the city, 200 camels were carried off, and amongst the stolen goods were ten bales of piece-goods belonging to Messrs. Ziegler, and Mr. Acting Consul Knox fears that other British firms have suffered heavily in this robbery. A telegraph gholam carrying stores for the department also lost everything. The robbers were estimated to be in number about 400, and the caravan was accompanied by 150 tufangchis. In the other case, which took place farther north, five loads were carried off, of which one belonged to the Dehbed telegraph inspector and three are reported to be the property of Messrs. Ziegler. Later telegrams from Shiraz report further small robberies and that no caravans would venture beyond the vicinity of the town. His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan also reports that, in consequence of these robberies, the road between Ispahan and Shiraz is practically unavailable for commercial purposes. It appears that the Kawam, Deputy Governor of Shiraz, telegraphed to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh that he proposed to send a force of regulars against the robbers, but that the financial authorities refused to advance the money necessary for the hire of transport. The Nizam-es-Sultaneh delayed replying for five or six days, and then confined himself to asking for details of the estimated expenditure. By the 1st March the Nizam only appears to have reached Kazerun, where he intended to remain eight or ten days, a rate of progress which would not bring him to Shiraz before the middle of the month. Since receiving these telegraphic reports I have been unremitting in my efforts to^ impress on both the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Sipahdar, the Prime Minister and Minister of War, the urgent necessity of facilitating in every possible way the dispatch of an expedition to punish the robbers and recover the stolen goods, of sending money for the pay of the troops and the provision of transport, and of instructing the Nizam peremptorily to hasten his arrival at Shiraz. I have pointed out that the Nizam should understand that every day of unnecessary delay greatly reduces the chances he may have of establishing some degree of order and of being in time to forestall the disorders to be expected at the period of the tribal spring migrations. I have received assurances from the Persian Government that instructions have been telegraphed to the new Governor-General in the sense desired, and that, as regardsmoney, the sum of 30,000 tomans has been sent to Shiraz, though this seems but a small sum out of the 120,000 tomans which the Imperial Bank has lately advanced to the Persian Government, and the manager of the bank cannot confirm that any sum has actually been transferred to Shiraz. With regard to other sections of the main southern road, Colonel Cox reported on the 6th instant that the road from Bushire to Shiraz was fairly passable, but that the immunity from robberies might be attributed to the facts that there was still much snow in the passes and that the new Governor-General of Pars was halted half-way on the road. The section between Ispahan and Tehran, however, appears to be in a dangerous state and to be left totally unguarded. Two Englishmen travelling to Tehran, Messrs. Kay and Haycock, the former an agent of Messrs. Dixon, were held up last week at a place about 24 miles north of Ispahan, near where a similar mishap occurred to Mr. Dalton, of the Imperial Bank, a few weeks ago, and were robbed of most of their possessions. I may add that General Maletta has arrived at Ispahan, but is again delayed there for want of a suitable escort to conduct him to Shiraz. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 71. Acting Consul Smart to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, ' Shiraz, January 27, 1911. I VENTURE to bring to your notice the question of the Shiraz garrison and the dangers involved in its increase. There are now about 2,300 infantry soldiers (“ sarbaz ”) in Shiraz. These soldiers are in a state of pitiful destitution owing to the non-payment of their wages. To save themselves from starvation they are compelled to beg, to steal, to cut down for firewood the trees around Shiraz, and, on one occasion, actually to plunder a whole quarter of the town. Their wood-cutting exploits have excited much alarm among the Shirazis, who view with despair the prospect of the fairest valley in Persia being denuded of the trees which constituted its chief beauty, and are almost a necessity against the burning sun of a Shiraz summer. The local authorities have made feeble attempts to restrain the soldiers, but with 100 Cossacks and a few local sowars it is impossible to control 2,300 starving soldiers. The above is a moderate description of the position resulting from the presence of the actual garrison at Shiraz. Moreover, it must be remembered that the harmfulness of the present garrison has been to some extent mitigated by the fact that its command has been vested in Nasr-ed-Dowleh. This young man’s worst enemies cannot accuse him of lack of generosity. In the early part of his administration he paid out of his own pocket not less than 25,000 tomans to maintain the garrison entrusted to his care. It is extremely unlikely that any other commander-in-chief will make similar sacrifices. I have frequently expressed my apprehensions on the subject to the local authorities and have suggested the advisability of dismissing a part of this useless, pernicious soldiery. They have always replied that the central Government will not sanction this measure. I understand that the Persian Government are now sending to Shiraz a large force, the greater part consisting of the usual infantry regiments. I do not entirely share the view of those who maintain that the sarbaz are absolutely useless. A moderate number is, in my opinion, useful, if only to serve as a nucleus for expeditions, the main strength of which must consist in sowars. The presence of sarbaz is sometimes invaluable to convince waverers among rebellious tribes, &amp;c., that the expedition is really a Govern ment undertaking ; the sarbaz have thus often helped to form a large army on the snowball system. The sarbaz are often useful in the town against timid citizens who may at times give trouble. The present garrison, however, is more than sufficient for these purposes. I view with apprehension the prospect of further increases involving the presence of some 4,000 sarbaz at Shiraz. Kawam-ul-Mulk, in reply to an enquiry from me, said that presumably the Persian Government would not send such a large force without arranging for its pay. I wish I could share this moderate optimism. Personally, I anticipate that the whole garrison of 4,000 sarbaz will have to live in the usual hand-to-mouth manner, receiving occasional pittances on account of arrears of pay. [188] I) 338 It may be said that the troops were just as badly paid in the past without serious results. According to the local authorities, however, the recent military reforms have modified very disadvantageously the position of the sarbaz. Formerly they received regularly rations in kind from the Government and their “ khanehvari ” from their villages. Their infinitesimal wages of a few tomans yearly were rarely paid. The new Government has suppressed the rations and taken over the “ khanehvari ” for itself, fixing in return the soldiers’ pay at 1 kran a day. The villagers, knowing that the “khanehvari” would no longer go to their comrades serving with the colours, and realising the impotence of the Government to collect it for the Treasury, have generally refrained altogether from paying this tax. The result is that the unfortunate soldier has nothing to live on except occasional doles on account of his arrears of pay. All Persians with whom I have discussed the matter have always agreed that it would be much better for the Persian Government to equip properly and pay regularly 1,000 efficient troops instead of wasting money on this large and useless garrison. The Persian Government may have reasons for persisting in this curious policy of importing into Fars hordes of inefficient, unpaid soldiers. I only wish to bring to your notice the dangers which the accumulation of this rabble in Shiraz may occasion, unless some satisfactory arrangements are made for its more or less regular pay. You may perhaps think it advisable to warn the competent authorities at Tehran of the danger, so that, in the event of any future disaster, the Persian Government may not be able to plead that they were taken by surprise. I have, &amp;c. W. A. SMART. No. 72. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 10.) Sir, Tehran, March 20, 1911. I INFORMED yon by telegraph on the 11th instant that Sipahdar had succeeded in forming a Cabinet. Its composition is reported in a separate despatch. Before introducing the Ministers to the Medjliss on the 11th instant Sipahdar read to the House an address, in which he referred to the confusion and mismanage ment of affairs which had characterised the period since the meeting of the Medjliss. He spoke of the insecurity and disturbances in the provinces, and said that even in the capital there was no security, and people were murdered in broad daylight. In the Government departments there was complete disorganisation. The Ministers could not enforce discipline, as it would at once provoke complaints in the press, with which the Government lacked power to deal. What was wanted was wider powers for the Cabinet and a cessation of interference by the Medjliss with the Executive. He had accepted office, but wished to know what powers would be given him to deal with the situation, for without the necessary authority he could not undertake to serve his country. An appeal for “full powers” figures prominently in the Cabinet’s programme submitted to the Medjliss, of which I enclose a summary prepared by Mr. Churchill. This programme was discussed by the Medjliss on the 16th instant. After an animated debate on party lines, the programme was voted by a majority of 30, the votes being 47 for and 17 against, 9 members abstaining. It will be interesting to see what use the Cabinet will make of the indefinite powers now accorded them. It is satisfactory to note that the Cabinet announce their desire to maintain cordial lelations with the friendly Powers and their intention to proceed with the Imperial Bank’s loan. Much of the ^rest of the programme has done duty before, and one can only hope that the present Cabinet will be more successful than was the last in carrying out the reforms foreshadowed. They start with a strong majority, and in this respect at least they are in a more favourable position than was the Cabinet of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek, which could only count on some twenty consistent supporters in the Medjliss. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.Enclosure in No. 72. Sipahdars Programme submitted to the Medjliss, March 11, 1911. THE preamble declares that tbe actual condition of affairs calls for extensive reforms, and that for this purpose the Government must be given wider powers. The following matters are then dealt with, and are described as being the principal questions requiring immediate attention :— 1. Terrorism and sedition, which are opposed to the constitutional system and impede the proper functions of the Government. The dangers to the State arising from these causes are dwelt upon, and full powers are stated to be essential in order to deal effectively with this trouble. 2. The necessity of punishing criminal and civil offences. 3. The necessity of improving the Government administrations, and of bringing about proper discipline among the military and civil servants of the Government. 4. The necessity of carrying out the press laws. In this connection, while adhering to the principle of a free press, it is urged that abuses must be dealt with, and for this purpose wider powers are required by the Cabinet. The deputies are asked whether they agree with the above principles, in which case the programme of the Cabinet will be laid before them. In view, however, of the dangers which threaten the country, the Cabinet expects the support of the House, and will willingly resign if they do not receive it. The Programme. 1. The improvement of public security. 2. The organisation of expeditionary forces and garrisons at certain points, in accordance with the memorandum and the budgetwhich havebeen laid before theMedjliss. 3. The maintenance of cordial relations with the friendly Powers. 4. The continuation of the loan negotiations which have already been undertaken by the former Cabinet and put before the House, and have been approved by the committee for financial laws. 5. The submission of a general budget. 6. Financial reforms with the help of foreign employes. 7. The reconsideration of the tax on salt, in order to remove the difficulties which have been caused by its imposition both for the Government and for the people. 8. The formation of a special committee to draw up temporary laws in cases where laws have not yet been passed, and when it is not practicable to wait for them to be passed in the ordinary way. These temporary laws will only require the approval of a committee of the Medjliss, the sanction of the Cabinet, and the signature of the Regent. 9. The reform of the judicial administration. 10. The reform of elementary and secondary schools which now exist. As far as possible, to carry out an identic programme in all schools. To institute a college for training teachers at Tehran, in accordance with proposals which will subsequently be submitted. 11. The promotion of commerce. 12. The improvement of the municipal laws. No. 73. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—(Received April 10.) Sir, Tehran, March 21, 1911. I HAVE the honour to say that the new Cabinet presented to the Medjliss on the 11th instant is composed as follows :— Premier and Minister of War ... Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister of Interior ... Minister of Justice Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and merce Minister of Finance ... Minister of Education [188] ... Sipahdar-i-Azam. Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. ... Mnstashar-ed-Dowleh. ... Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Com- Moavin-ed-Dowleh. ... Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh. ... Ala-es-Sultaneh. D 440 The Ministers of the Interior, of Justice, and of Finance are all three taken from the Medjliss, where they have played conspicuous roles both as debaters and, in the case of Mustashar-ed-Dowleh and Mumtaz-ed-Dowleh, as speakers. They are all three men of an entirely modern type in Persia. Having been educated in Europe, they all speak French, and may be described as representatives of the Young Persian school, though they have preferred not to identify themselves with Hussein Kuli Khan’s party of extreme nationalists known locally as the Democratic party. The Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Commerce and the Minister of Education are men of a somewhat different stamp to those above described. Ala-es-Sultaneh and Moavin-ed-Dowleh have both resided in Europe as diplomatic representatives of Persia; the former was in London for many years and the latter was for some time in the Balkans. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 74. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived April 10.)* Sir, Tehran, March 22, 1911. NASR-UL-MULK’S efforts to bring about the formation of an organised majority in the Medjliss have proved so far successful, that for the first time in the history of the Persian Parliament there now exist two united parties. Except for the small party of “Democrats” or ultra-Nationalists such groups as previously existed were formed round prominent individuals such as Sipahdar, Sardar Assad, Ain-ed-Dowleh and Farman Farma, but the Regent’s efforts have brought about the grouping, for the moment at least, of one main party in support of the present Cabinet. It will be interesting to see how long this majority will hold together. It should be mentioned that the Democrats are a good deal handicapped by the loss of their most prominent members. Sani-ed-Dowleh’s death, the absence of Taki Zadeh in Europe, and the temporary effacement of Hussein Kuli Khan and Assadullah Mirza, who had to vacate their seats in July in order to join Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek’s Cabinet and have not yet been re-elected, have deprived the party of a certain measure of its strength. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 75. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Beceived April 10.) T -jj . _ . Tehran, March 22, IQll. 1 HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 75. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia from February 22 to March 22. Tehran. i j The Medjhss. At the sitting of the 23rd February, while Suleiman Mirza, the eader of the Democratic Minority, was making a speech which seemed likely to raise a good deal of party feeling, the new president, Momtaz-ed-Dowleh. brought a letter from the Regent enclosing a memorandum dealing with the principles of parliamentary government, which he caused to be read. The paper covered much the same ground as the Regent s subsequent address and was received with applause by the maioritv. On the 25th February, the Minister for Foreign Affairs made an exhaustive and very satisfactory speech respecting Persia’s foreign relations.On the 4th March the Regent took the oath and delivered an address, a summary of which was given in Sir G. Barclay’s despatch of the 7th March. Ad this sitting Sipahdar’s acceptance of the Premiership was announced by the Regent. On the 7th instant, the resignation of Momtaz-ed-Dowleh from the Presidency of the Medjliss was read, and Morteza Kuli Khan, the Deputy Speaker, took the chair. On the 9th March, Motamin-ul-Mulk was unanimously elected to the chair, and on the 11th Sipahdar introduced his Cabinet. He at the same time delivered an address and submitted his programme, both of which are dealt with in separate despatches. The sitting ol the 16th March was devoted to a debate on the new Premier’s programme, which was eventually put to the vote and agreed upon by a majority. Tabreez. The Governor-General has announced that it is intended to form a properly equipped force of 5,000 men, viz., 3,600 infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 400 artillery. The roads are reported to be safe, but the severe weather in the early part of February in some cases interrupted communications. A star a. With reference to Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 6th March, 1911, His Majesty’s vice-consul at Resht reports that he learns from reliable sources that Hussein Kuli, Shahsevan, attacked one of the Russian posts, stationed on the road for the protection of trade, and killed two soldiers and wounded an officer. Furthermore, the bodies^ of two Cossacks who had disappeared were found terribly mutilated ; 600 to 700 Russian troops crossed the frontier, part forming a cordon along it and round Persian Astara and preventing access to Russian territory, while part surrounded the hills where Hussem Kuli and his men had taken refuge. Fighting took place, in which one Russian soldier was wounded and several brigands were reported killed and wounded. According to the Russian consul-general at Tabreez, 1,500 Russian troops have been moved up to Russian Astara. Resht. Moavver-ul-Mamalek has resigned the post of Governor-General of Ghilan, and has been succeeded by Sardar-i-Motamid. At the end of February telegrams were received at Resht from Hamadan and Kashan, instructing merchants to stop all further consignments of Russian sugar. A few days later, however, the Cabinet telegraphed deprecating the adoption of unfriendly measures. A road guard who was shot by two Russian subjects died on the 3rd March and was accorded a military funeral. It is reported that in the district of Raniki the villagers, instigated by Amir-i-Assad, son of Sipahdar, deprived the tax collectors of all the money they had collected for the Government. . . On the 17th March, the Russian troops from Kazvin were reported to be leaving Resht in detachments for Russia. A consular guard of seventy-seven Cossacks has been left at Kazvin. Meshed. Juiu, the rebel leader at Darragez, and his brother fled into Russian territory, but were arrested by the Russians and are to be handed over to the Persian Government, The murderer of an Ismaili at Nishapur escaped while being brought to Meshed. Maior Sykes is of opinion that the protection of Ismailis will be much facilitated when, as has been promised by the Persian Government, Nishapur is placed under the Governor-General of Khorassan, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has promised His Maiesty’s Minister to effect the desired change. Towards the end ol February robbers from Pars were reported to be attacking the districts round labbas. Petty robberies were numerous all over the province. The Kain roads were quite unsafe owing to raids by Seistam Baluchis. Seistan. Between Baluchis was Birjand, they the middle of January and the middle of February a band of Seistam eno-ao-ed in raiding in Seistan and the Kainat. At Khur, 40 miles west of looted a number of sheep and camels, and killed the deputy governor ofWMmammmmaamm aaBBaamMammmmammmammmmmBmaammmmmmmmmmmmmm mmommoBm 42 Khur and three of his men who went out against them. They then moved north-west and plundered a caravan going from Kerman or Yezd to Meshed. They were said to have twelve to eighteen captured women with them. They also completely wrecked and looted the village of Deh Salam, 50 miles south-west of Neh, carried off several hundred camels and killed several camel men. The band was said to number 350 men. It is beyond question that Hashmat-ul-Mulk, deputy-governor of Seistan, is the instigator of these raids and receives a fifth share of the booty. His object is to cast discredit on Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Major O’Connor and his Kussian colleague invited Hashmat-ul-Mulk to an interview in order to admonish him. He declined the invitation, but has since, under instructions from Tehran, received the two consuls. Towards the middle of February the state of the roads was a little better. As a result of constant representations from Major O’Connor and Mr. Howson, Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat- ul-Mulk had placed road guards on the main trade routes used by Indian traders. Off the main road brigandage was rife. Ispahan. The town has continued quiet. The state of the province appears to be normal, except that towards the end of February robbers were reported to be infesting the district of Natanz. On the roads the following robberies were reported : On the 22nd February, bank specie to the amount of nearly 4,000L on its way to Yezd was robbed at Habibabad, 12 miles west of Ispahan. Most of this was subsequently recovered. On the 28th February, Messrs. Kay and Haycock, who left Ispahan on that day, were robbed by five men, said to be Bakhtiaris, at Bakirabad of nearly all their belongings, valued at about 120Z. Two caravans were robbed near Kum on the Sultanabad road on the 1st and 2nd March. On the night of the 26th February, fourteen camelmen and 300 camels perished in a snowstorm at Kuli Kosh, near Khanekhoreh, where the survivors arrived snow blind and badly frost bitten. Yezd, The local assembly has been active in enquiring into the expenditure of money paid to the governor for the maintenance of road guards, also in investigating charges of excessive taxation brought by various villages against tax collectors. One or two small parties of robbers were still frequenting the Nain and Kerman road in the middle of February. In Nain and Ardekan the exactions of tax collectors have caused a good deal of disturbance among the people. Kermanshah. _Haji Bustam Beg, leader of one of the factions in the town, had for some time been detained at Tehran. He managed to escape and reach Kermanshah. He has now been ostensibly reconciled to Muin-ul-Kaya, leader of the opposing faction. The new chief of police has improved the police force, but petty robberies are still numerous in the town. Kerman. Sardar-i-Nusrat with 1,500 men left Kerman on the 18th February for Bam, where he was to be joined by another 1,500 men. Supplies for the expedition, which was to re-establish order in Baluchistan, were being collected at Bam. Shiraz. The condition of the roads is reported upon in a separate despatch. Lieutenant Lang, B.N., Lieutenant Ward, Indian army, and the relieved detachment of Indian cavalry left for Bushire on the 26th February. No. 76. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 10.) Tehran, March 23, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 9th March respecting the progress of the steps being taken by the Persian Government to restore order on the southernloads, I have the honour to report that, notwithstanding my urgent representations, I have not yet heard that the new Governor-General of Fars has advanced further on his journey to Shiraz than Kazerun. His prolonged^ stay in that locality may be attributed to the fighting which is icported to be taking place for the possession of Ahmedi, a stage north of Bushire, between two factions of headmen of the immediate hinterland, m the course of which the Khan of Angali appears to have occupied a point between Ahmedi and Borasjun, and is preventing the passage of caravans. Moreover, a party of telegraph employes inspecting the line have been incidentally under fire, though fortunately without hurt. I have not yet heard whether caravan traffic has been resumed on this section of the road, and with regard to the section between Shiraz and Ispahan, though no further robberies have come to my knowledge since those mentioned in my despatch above referred to, I have no reason to believe that merchants have regained confidence. It would be, of course, premature to estimate what chance of success the Persian Government may have of themselves restoring order on the southern routes until the Nizam-es-Sultaneh arrives at Shiraz, and has had time to make his dispositions. Much will depend on his success in reconciling the rival factions of the Kawam and Soulet-ed- Dowleh. I have since heard that the Nizam has confirmed the Kawam in his headship of the Arabs, and that his intention is to confide the guardianship of the Shiraz-Bushire road to Soulet, and that from Shiraz to Ispahan to the Kawam. This would seem to be a good arrangement. In the meantime, I lose no opportunity of urging the Persian Government to expedite the Nizam’s arrival at Shiraz, and to remit him the funds necessary for effectively employing his forces on the mission specially entrusted to him. General Maletta, who had been detained at Ispahan for many days for want of an escort, left that place for the south on the 11th instant. I have, &amp;c. G. BABCLAY. No. 77. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 10.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, March 26, 1911. ON the receipt of your despatch of the 18 th March I left an aide-memoire with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informing him that the Persian Government had applied to the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia for a second advance of 120,000 tomans, and that it appeared that the conclusion of an eventual loan was part of the Sipahdar’s programme. I added that the Imperial Bank were prepared to advance this sum, and that Sir G. Barclay had been instructed to express the hope that some of it would be devoted to the payment of the troops at Shiraz. I have now the honour to report that I have received an aide-memoire from the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs informing me that the Imperial Government has taken note of the contents of my communication and thanks me for it. I have, &amp;c. GEOBGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 78. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 11, 1911. I LEARN to-day Governor-General arrived at Shiraz 6th April.

In continuation of my telegram of the 3rd April, I have the honour to report that Governor-General of Fars appears to he giving proof of energy, and has44 declared that if he is afforded effective support by the Central Government, he is confident of promptly restoring order. His Excellency has assured Mr. Knox that he will immediately take punitive measures against the lesser brigands, and has stated his intention of himself leading an expedition against the Boir Ahmedis as soon as order is established in the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz. General Maletta, however, is most pessimistic, having found neither money, men, nor arms on his arrival. He has told the acting British consul that it is worse than useless to set about the organisation of a gendarmerie if funds for a whole year’s expenditure are not sent to Shiraz. I have called the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to this state of affairs, and reproached him for having led me and my Government to believe that a sum of 80,000 tomans for the expenses of the gendarmerie had already been dispatched to Shiraz. This was now proved to be without foundation. In reply, his Excellency stated that a misunderstanding must have occurred, and gave me his assurance that the necessary funds would be sent without delay. Mr. Knox reports the abandonment of the operations against Kamarej. Two or three robberies of local caravans on either side of Shiraz have recently occurred, and it is reported that 400 Boir Ahmedis are in the field, and that they contemplate making a descent on the Bushire-Shiraz road to loot the caravans. No. 80. Sir Edward Grey to Lord Kilmarnock. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, April 15, 1911. YOU should inform Swedish Government that in view of the fact that the disorder on southern roads in Persia shows no sign of decreasing, we hope that an early decision may be taken as regards the employment of Swedish officers. You should at the same time ask Swedish Government how matter stands, and make it quite clear that we have no objection to the use of Swedish officers for the purpose of restoring order in the districts affected. No. 81. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 16.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 16, 1911. MR. KNOX telegraphs that the Nizam-es-Sultaneh yesterday afternoon arrested the two Kawami brothers. This action has been such a bombshell to the Shirazis that they have taken no action, and there is reason to hope that the town will not be the scene of any disorders. The Kawami’s^ son lias asked to take bast in the consulate, but as it does not appear that he is in danger Mr. Knox has refused his request. Mr. Knox considers it probable that other relations of the Kawami will also apply for asylum. 1 he ostensible ground for the arrest is the failure of the Nasr-ed-Dowleh to capture certain brigands. I have informed Mr. Knox that his action is approved. No. 82. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received April 17.) (Telegraphic.) ^ Tehran, April 17, 1911. THE acting British consul at Shiraz informs me that the impression produced by the arrest of the Kawami (which I had the honour to report in my telegram of yesterday) is good. Sardar Assad, however, views this action on the part of the Governor-General with displeasure. He is making representations to the Persian Government in favour of the Kawami, and has postponed his departure for Europe, which was imminent.I have urged him not to take any action which could tend to impair the Nizam’s authority, and have pointed out that the Nizam would probably resign—a contingency which would again bring affairs in Fars to a crisis—if disavowed by the Persian Government. No. 83. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 18.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 18, 1911. IN continuation of my telegram of yesterday’s date, I learn that it has been decided by the Persian Government to instruct the Nizam-es-Sultaneh to release the Kawamis. This is conditional on their leaving the province of Fars. Sardar Assad has agreed to this arrangement. No. 84. Lord Kilmarnock to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 18.) (Telegraphic.) Stockholm, April 18, 1911. SWEDISH officers for Persian gendarmerie. With reference to your telegram of the 15th April, I learn from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that agreement is almost complete, and that it is expected that the Swedish Minister in Paris will receive the draft convention to-day. If this is accepted by the Persian Minister and the latter has full powers the Swedish officers will be selected without delay, and will proceed at once to Paris to sign contract. They will then require a few weeks in which to make the necessary preparations. I have not failed to urge Swedish Government to expedite matters, and instructions in this sense will be sent by telegraph to the Swedish Minister at Paris. No. 85. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 20.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 20, 1911. SHIRAZ situation. Mr. Knox telegraphs as follows :— “ A large crowd, including sons of Mullahs who were killed by the Kawamis after their fathers’ murder, assembled yesterday afternoon and demanded summary execution of two brothers from Governor-General. In reply, his Excellency stated that their trial was fixed for the 20th April, and that their crimes will be punishable by death in accordance with law. Governor-General was enthusiastically cheered by the crowd. No. 86. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 22.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 22, 1911. SHIRAZ situation.

Nizam-es-Sultanch has informed Mr. Knox that he will leave Shiraz without further discussion if he is compelled by Persian Government to release Kawami-ul-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh, or to send them to Tehran. His Excellency stipulates that a forma] trial of the Kawamis should be held at Shiraz, and he appears resolved to resign if this is not accorded. I have communicated the above privately to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. No. 88. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 26.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, April 26, 1911. SOUTHERN roads. Reference to my telegram dated the 14th April. I have received following telegram from Mr. Knox at Shiraz :— “I gather that the Governor-General deems it advisable to postpone the question of gendarmerie for the present. His Excellency intends to employ the Government troops, Kashgai, and his own followers in making, during the summer, a series of punitive expeditions against various tribes, and maintains that the gendarmerie, however rapidly it might be organised, would not be ready to take part in these operations. Further, General Maletta has informed him that a force of 600 men, for which a sum of 80,000 tomans would be necessary, is quite useless, and that in his opinion 4,000 men are required. Although Governor-General recognises the justice of this estimate in principle if it is proposed to raise a permanent efficient force, he does not believe that the Central Government are justified in expending such a large sum. Moreover, the need for punitive action is more pressing. “Nevertheless, I think that the reasons adduced by Nizam are most plausible, and, notwithstanding the necessity for the organisation of an adequate road police, I consider that immediate punitive action should have precedence if both projects cannot be executed simultaneously. “ I have also been given to understand by his Excellency that the existing road guard might be subsidised by the 80,000 tomans.” Although I am desirous of avoiding, as far as possible, all interference with the Governor-General, still I would submit that if Mr. Knox concurs in the proposed postponement of gendarmerie organisation without demur, his Excellency may receive the impression that we approve. Subject to your approval, I would therefore propose to instruct Mr. Knox, if it appears likely that this construction will be placed on our attitude, to inform Nizam- es-Sultaneh that he must arrange the matter with the Persian Government, wffiich is responsible for the efficient execution of its engagements regarding the restoration of order on the southern roads to His Majesty’s Government.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 27.) (Telegraphic.) _ ... Tehran, April 27, 1911. I HAVE received an intimation from Sardar Assad, as has also Lynch’s agent in Tehran, that the Bakhtiari Khans decline to take any further responsibility for the safety of the Ispahan-Ahwaz road in view of the Kuhgelui situation. Only in the case of robberies committed by Bakhtiari will they accept responsibility. This step, Sardar Assad states, has been rendered necessary by the general anti- Bakhtiari policy followed by the Governor-General of Shiraz. The Eizam-es-Sultaneh has nominated one of Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s followers to the governorship of Behbehan, where the Kuhgelui tribe has its head-quarters. This man, in order to stir up trouble for the Bakhtiari, will incite the Kuhgelui to rob caravans travelling along the road, which is to them easily accessible, running, as it does, for a long distance adjacent to the country north of Behbehan. I am told by Sardar Assad that the employment of a considerable force for the purpose of safeguarding the road would be necessary. If, as has usually been the case hitherto, the governorship of Behbehan were held by a Bakhtiari, or, at least, were not under hostile control, the Bakhtiari would have no anxiety. Mr. Wilson, as a result of Sardar Assad’s communication, has telegraphed to Ahwaz instructing Lynch’s agent there to discontinue the forwardment of merchandise until instructions are received from his principals. He is at the same time informing head office. This repudiation of responsibility on the part of the khans, closing, as it does, one more highway of British commerce, is very serious. I am withholding suggestions as to what steps I should take pending the result of further enquiries. No. 91. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received April 28.) (Telegraphic.)

In reply to your telegram of the 27th April, I have the honour to report that I agree with Mr. Knox in thinking that, if the organisation of the gendarmerie and the punitive action contemplated by Nizam-es-Sultaneh cannot be undertaken simultaneously, precedence should be given to the punitive action. At the same time, I do not see why the latter should be incompatible with the beginning of gendarmerie organisation on a small scale, and I submit that we should hold the central Govern ment, at least, to this. At the present moment a force of 600 men would, without doubt, be useless, but they would form a useful nucleus out of which an adequate force for the protection of the road could be built, supposing that the punitive action materialises. Mr. Knox informs me that he has already in conversation given Nizam to understand that the policing of the road by a regular force is a question which His Majesty’s Government consider to be of the highest importance. He is of opinion48 that it might he well to postpone the further communication proposed until some solution in the present matter of the Kawamis is reached. I share his view, and am instructing Mr. Knox to defer making the communication until he judges the moment favourable. No. 93. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 29.) (Telegraphic.)

Mr. Knox telegraphs as follows in reply :— “ In reply to my advice, Nizam informed me this morning that he is fully alive to the fact that his position in Shiraz is being injured by every day’s delay in coming to a solution. His Excellency, however, is firmly determined to accept no compromise, and to leave his post irrevocably as soon as he feels that his authority is on the wane. In the event of the Kawamis being exiled to Europe, his former experiences, he states, teach him that he could have no reasonable guarantee that they will not return to the country again via the north. Even apart from this consideration, the fact that such a step would be interpreted by everyone in Shiraz as the triumph of the Kawami’s party in the capital would suffice in itself to render vain any hope of successful governorship if he yielded to the instances of the central Government. “His Excellency calls His Majesty’s Government to witness that he has done all in his power to carry out the only sane policy that can be followed in Ears, and that, should it end in failure, they must not hold him to blame. “ Energetic efforts are being made by Soulet-ed-Dowleh to have the bazaar closed to-morrow as a protest against the delay in executing Kawam-ul-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh. A protest in the same sense was made yesterday afternoon to Nizam by a large deputation of merchants and notables.” No. 94. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received April 29.) (Telegraphic.)

In view of Sardar Assad’s statement, Mr. Wilson has arranged that traffic should be temporarily resumed on the road.

AVith reference to my telegram dated the 1st May, I have the honour to report that Minister for Foreign Affairs sent for a member of my staff this morning to urge me to instruct Mr. Knox to use his influence with the Nizam with regard to the Kawami brothers. Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that he fully appreciated my disinclination to take further action in the matter, but the situation was so grave that he trusted that I would in so far reconsider my decision as to send instructions to Mr. Knox to press the Nizam to act in accordance with instructions from Tehran. Although the central Government had undertaken, in the event of the Kawamis being sent abroad, not to allow them to return to Persia during the Nizam’s tenure of office • at Shiraz, Governor- General still ignored the instructions that had been sent to him. His Excellency fears that there is truth in the reports which reach Tehran that the life of the two brothers is in danger. Such an event would, Minister for Foreign Affairs states, certainly drive the Bakhtiari to reprisals and bring about the resignation of the Prime Minister. A message has now, Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me, been sent to Nizam- es-Sultaneh stating that the Government have wished to extend to him their support but unless he obeys instructions this attitude will be reconsidered. The dismissal of the Governor-General, which is hereby hinted at, must have grave consequences, and in all the circumstances I have judged it politic to instruct Mr. Knox to impress on the Nizam that his attitude is placing the Persian Government [188] E50 in a very difficult position, and that although they are ready to support him as far as they can, the fear of Bakhtiari reprisals renders it impossible for them to consent to the execution of the Kawami, and to express the hope that he will see his way to obey instructions from Tehran. l^o. 100.

His Excellency assures me that they will leave Shiraz to-night or on the following day. Although Governor-General has refused to accept responsibility for the safety of the prisoners, the manner in which their journey has been arranged seems satisfactory. The Nizam explained the arrangements to me in detail. “ 1 asked him whether he had any guarantee that Soulet, who is at present encamped on the road, would respect the prisoners.

No. 103. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 8.) ^ ir ’ t ' Tehran, A'pril 16, 1911. I HAVE had the honour to report to you in various telegrams the principal points of progress attained since the date of my despatch of the 23rd March by the Persian authorities in their endeavour to restore order on the southern roads. They comprise the arrivals at Shiraz of General Maletta and Nizam-es-Sultaneh, the new Governor- General of Ears.With regard to the former, I was much disappointed to hear that he had expressed himself in very despondent terms to the acting British consul at Shiraz in regard to the non-success of his mission to organise a gendarmerie force. It appears that, notwith standing the assurances given me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, as reported in my despatch of the 23rd January, that the sum of 80,000 tomans had been transferred to Shiraz for gendarmerie purposes, General Maletta had found that no money, not to speak of men nor arms, had been provided for him. He had telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior that the organisation of the gendarmerie was impossible until the necessary money had been supplied, and had received a message in reply that when he had agreed with the Nizam as to what was required immediate orders would be sent. General Maletta had had two subsequent interviews with the governor, who said that the whole question depended on whether the money would be forth coming. His Excellency requested the general to submit a programme which would be forwarded to Tehran with any necessary modifications, and the general offered the same scheme which he had submitted with some persistence at Tehran before his departure. In the latter’s opinion, it was worse than useless to embark on the organisation of a gendarmerie until he was assured of funds sufficient for a year’s expenditure. On receipt of this intelligence I reproached the Minister for Foreign Affairs for having misinformed me and, through me, His Majesty’s Government, with regard to the money which he assured me had been sent to Shiraz, and I urgently represented the necessity of at once supplying these funds. His Excellency could only say that there must have been a misunderstanding, and he assured me that the money would he sent as soon as possible. With regard to the new Governor-General, the acting British consul at Shiraz reported, in a telegram dated the 10th April, that his Excellency expressed himself most sanguine of promptly restoring order in the province. The Nizam was showing considerable firmness in efficiently policing the town, and, on the robbery of a local caravan within a few miles of Shiraz being reported to him, he immediately sent out Nasr-ed-Dowleh with 300 men in pursuit of the brigands. Most of the stolen goods were recovered, but the robbers themselves escaped. Since then there have been two further robberies of local caravans near Shiraz. So far as I know, no British property was involved in these robberies, but His Majesty’s consul at Ispahan reported on the 1st April that traffic between Shiraz and Ispahan is practically at a standstill. The intention of the Nizam is to take immediate steps to suppress the robber bands of small magnitude, and he contemplates as soon as order is established in the vicinity of Shiraz placing himself at the head of a large expedition directed against the notorious tribe of Boir Ahmedis in their summer quarters. Four hundred of these marauders are reported to be on the war-path and meditating a descent on the Bushire Shiraz road. The Khan of Kamarij has ordered the headmen of his district to patrol the hills and detain caravans at Hastarjin until they can proceed in safety. The hostilities against this chief instituted by the Nizam have been abandoned owing to the sturdy resistance offered by him. This is satisfactory, as according to our consular reports he had always loyally endeavoured to maintain order on his section of the road. I had not, however, intervened in his favour, as I think it is the best policy to allow the Nizam-es-Sultaneh a free hand in the execution of his mission and to afford him no opportunity of ascribing his failure, if he fails, or his resignation, if he desires^ to escape responsibility, to the intervention of the Central Government at the prompting of His Majesty’s Legation.

Summary of Events in Persia from March 22 to A'pril 19, 1911. The Medjliss. AT the sitting of the 28th March another memorandum from the Regent was read dealing principally with the disorganisation existing in the various Government departments and the futility of continuing the existing party strife. The memorandum urged that the Government should be given full support in the work of reforming the administrations. At the sitting of the 30th March a Bill dealing with regulations for elementary education was read and discussed. The measure was opposed on religious grounds by a representative of the ulema of Nejef, but the firmness of the new president saved the Bill from being shelved. On the 1st April, at the request of the Regent, a telegram addressed to his Highness by the ulema of Nejef was read to the House. After congratulating the Regent on his arrival at Tehran and assumption of office, the ulema refers to the political discord existing in Tehran and express the fervent hope that the Regent will be able to bring about the union so necessary to the welfare of the country. At the same sitting a letter from Sardar Assad was read, in which he asked the House to grant him three months’ leave of absence for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment in Europe for his eyes. Votes were taken and the leave was granted. The Premier attended at this sitting, but took no part in the debates. On the 4th April the presidential committee having to obtain re-election according to the regulations in force, votes were taken accordingly, with the following result:— Motamin-ul-Mulk re-elected unanimously as president. Morteza Kuli Khan elected first vice-president. Matin-es-Sultaneh elected second vice-president. The following were re-elected as secretaries :— Mirza Ibrahin Khan, Haji Mirza Reza Khan, Fahim-ul-Mulk, and Moazed-ul-Mulk. With the exception of the president, who is neutral, the vice-presidents and secretaries are all nominees of the majority. In a House consisting of seventy members they received some 40 votes each, while the nominees of the minority received between 20 and 30 votes each. At the sitting of the 6th April the president, on taking the chair, thanked the deputies for their confidence in him, and stated his willingness to accept the presidency again as he felt sure that the House was determined to pass the remaining Bills before the end of the session, of which six months remain. A Bill was then introduced relating to the wheat supply for Tehran. The measure is intended to deal with the cornering of grain by large landowners. The Minister of the Interior was then interpellated with regard to the expulsion from Tehran of a notorious fedai called Yar Mohamed Khan, who had been associated with the Democratic party, now in the minority. The incident seemed likely to bring about an angry altercation between the two parties, but further discussion was stopped by the president. On the 11th April Prince Amir Azam, son of the late Amir Khan Sardar, G.C.M.G., was introduced as Under-Secretary of State for War, and was interpellated regarding an alleged purchase of arms and ammunition by the Government. He stated that 7,000 Russian rifles had been bought by the Government at a cost of 14 tomans each. He did not say how many cartridges had been purchased, but stated that they cost 4 shahis each. The Minister of Finance asked the House on the 15th instant to include in the list of questions to be discussed on the 18th April the proposed loan from the Imperial Bank, the project for which had been put before them by the former Cabinet. The motion was agreed to, but on the 18th the question was again put off until the 20th. The Provinces. Mazanderan.

In continuation of my telegram of the 8th May, I have received following details of the attack on the Kawamis from the acting British consul, Shiraz :— Circumstances of assassination of Nasr-ed-Dowleh, corroborated from many sources, are as follows: Kawami-ul-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh were accompanied for 8 miles by loO sowars and others, including six Kashgai. Some fifty guards went on wdth them from that point. After the party had proceeded about 30 miles the six Kashgai left the escort and joined a body of Kashgai who were in ambush on the road. These men belonged to the tribe of the Kashgai deputy in the Medjiiss, Mohamed Kerim Khan, whose son witnessed the proceedings. 'The Kashgai shot Nasr-ed- Dowleh at a few yards range, wounded and beat one of his companions, and looted the baggage which accompanied the caravan. On hearing the alarm escort fled without filing. In the meanwhile Kawami-ul-Mulk, who was half-a-mile ahead, discovering that the road behind him was barred, fled, and hy making a long detour succeeded in reaching Shiraz. Having gained his house, which adjoins the gate, he sent to inform the Nizam that he would attempt to take refuge in the consulate, and, if he was thwarted, he and his followeis would defend themselves to the end. He escaped in disguise a few minutes latei^ and aruved safely at the consulate. I informed the Nizam officially, and stated that Kawami-ul-Mulk would not leave consulate until I received guarantees foi the safety of his life satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government. In reply the Nizam stated that 200 aimed men had taken up their quarters at the Kawami’s house and were i ^ely to foment disorder. I have informed his Excellency that Kawami-ul-MIulk will instruct his wife to dismiss these men, who, according to my information, number about thirty, when a written assurance for the safety of his house and family is received. Late this afternoon bazaars were closed, and it is possible that Souletorthe Nizam may try to create disturbances in the town. ^ le ni 6 an time, I am reminding Governor-General officially of his responsibility i uropean lives and property suffer any harm, and in the morning I shall convey a very grave warning to him verbally.Sir G.

WITH reference to my telegram of yesterday, I learned last night by an urgent telegram from the acting British consul at Shiraz that Nasr-ed-Dowleh s steward had not been shot, but had escaped and taken refuge at the house of the Kawamis head gardener, a Belgian subject, whom, at the request of the Belgian Minister, 1 had taken under British protection at the time of the arrest of the Kawamis. ^ Mr. Knox stated in his telegram that the steward was in imminent danger, which might react upon the Belgian subject, and he asked whether he might send his consulai escort to bring in the steward to the consulate. , It did not seem to me right to run the risk of a conflict between the escort and the townspeople on behalf of a person not under British protection, and I replied that 1 could not authorise the course suggested, but, if the Belgian gardener applied for his protection, he might use his escort to conduct him to the consulate. I also instructed Mr. Knox to hold the Governor-General responsible for the safety of the Belgian oil 1)1 PQ't' In reply to a further enquiry from Mr. Knox whether he might^ give bast to the steward or to members of the Kawami family if they were in imminent danger and applied for asylum, I telegraphed to him that he should give bast to any Persian subject whom he considered in imminent danger for his life, and who actually reache the consulate, but that he must in no case use his escort to conduct anyone not under British protection to the consulate. . n . T , , , 1 have ventured to trouble you with the above m order that I may be informed for my future guidance whether my ruling as to the use to which a consular escort can be put in such cases meets with your approval. i. nave, &lt;xc.

A legation bag which he was taking to Ispahan was opened and rifled, and Kingston was subjected to indignity and ill-treatment. Failing recovery of stolen articles and punishment of culprits, I would propose, with your approval, to claim, in addition to value of stolen articles, 100Z. as compensation for violation of legation seal and for ill-treatment of a British subject.

IN reply to your telegram dated the 24th May, I have the honour to report on the condition of the southern roads : — (a.) The safety of the Kerman—Bunder Abbas road is doubtful, but caravans are passing. (b.) Comparative safety reigns on the Kerman—Yezd road. Caravans are passing. (c.) Bakhtiaii pi edict raids by the Kuhgelui on Ispahan—Ahwaz road, which is however at present safe. Bakhtiari are no longer in control of Kuhgelui, and disorders will probably occur on the road, as, notwithstanding representations of the central Government, Nizam-es-Sultaneh refuses to appoint someone friendly to the Bakhtiari to the governorship of Behbehan, which carries with it the control of the Kuhgelui. (d.) Great insecurity prevails south of Kashan on the Kum—Ispahan road. Since January last four British subjects have been robbed. (e.) On the Bushire-Ispahan road—and I presume that complaints of Manchester rms refer particularly to this route—His Majesty’s consular officers at Bushire and Shiraz report considerable improvement since last year. I can only suppose there fore that firms m question must be under a misapprehension. No robbery has been reported on the Bushire-Shiraz section for a considerable time. No robbery occasioning the loss of British goods has taken place since December last. This year the telegraph me was not damaged as is usual during the tribal migration which has taken place. I ’ h° wevei '&gt; that the scarcity of transport is causing merchants to complain, and that m consequence, the number of caravans passing is small. The Kuhgelui have been raiding a good deal recently on the Shiraz-Ispahan section near Kumisheh, but no ro j my o ntish property has occurred since the 1st April, and goods are at present passing fairly freely along the road. In view of the fact that this improvement does not arise from any increased j tU cen ^ ra ^ Government, and must be largely dependent on the good-will o feoulet-ed-Dowleh, we must, I think, consider the chance of its continuance as veryprecarious. The moment to insist on our scheme, however, has certainly not come. I should be extremely reluctant to recommend pressing for our scheme even if matters were considerably worse than they are. Persian Government’s position is already none too stable, and it would be greatly embarrassed were we to confront it with this demand. I venture to submit that in the latest published customs statistics, viz., those for the ten months ending the 21st January, an increase of 12 per cent, is shown in the southern receipts over those of the previous year ; the falling-off at Bushire being more than counterbalanced by the increase in the receipts at Bunder Abbas and Mohammerah. Beceipts at latter port are exclusive of imports of Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which are exempt from customs taxes. No. 124. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 2.) (Telegraphic.)

Situation in Azerbaijan is, His Majesty’s consul reports, giving rise to some anxiety. In addition to the defeat of the Governor of Ardebil, a section of the Karadaghis have inflicted a severe check on an expedition sent against them by the Governor of Ahar. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh is, it appears, unable to send reinforcements against these tribesmen. Following is concluding sentence of telegram from His Majesty’s consul:— “I am not alone in deeming it fortunate, in view of the disquiet prevailing at Tahreez at the present moment regarding the situation at Ardebil, that the Russian troops are still here.” No. 126. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 6.) gi r? Tehran, May 16, 1911. WITH reference to my telegrams of the 28th April and the 3rd May, as to the proceedings in the Medjliss in regard to the proposed issue by the Persian Government of a loan of 1,250,COOL on the London market, through the agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith (Enclosure 1) a copy of the contract signed on the 8th instant by the Minister of Finance and the chief manager of the Imperial Bank. The project, which had been put before the Medjliss by Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek’s Cabinet at the end of last year, was referred to the Finance Committee of the House, and came up for discussion at a public sitting on the 22nd April, when Momtaz-ed- Dowleh, the Finance Minister of Sipahdar’s Cabinet, was in^charge of it. The late Sani-ed-Dowleh, who was Finance Minister in the former Cabinet, had drawn up a list of expenditure and a scheme of control for the proper handling of the money. I enclose a translation of this document (Enclosure 2) which is interesting, as, though slightly modified by the Finance Committee of the Medjliss, it shows that the necessity for control by European officials is thoroughly appreciated, and that a serious attempt was contemplated to prevent peculation and waste. At the sitting of the 22nd April, the scheme of expenditure and control was brought up first. The list of expenditure had been modified by the^ present Cabinet in accordance with altered conditions since its preparation by Sani-ed-Dowleh (see Enclosure 3).GO The debate was resumed on the 25th April, when it was agreed to replace the project of expenditure and control by the Loan Bill itself, and to append a clause to the effect that if the loan were sanctioned its proceeds should be locked up at the Imperial Bank till the plan of expenditure and control passed through the House. The Loan Bill was accordingly read a first time on the 27th April, and a second time on the 2nd May, and was strenuously opposed by the Democrats, whose principal spokesman was Wahid-ul-Mulk. The criticisms directed against the measure by this gentleman were of a root-and-branch order, but his eloquence and persistency were of no avail against the weight of the combined supporters of the Government when a show of hands was called for by the President. The Bill was eventually passed by the majority on the 2nd May, and the contract was signed six days later. The position therefore now is as follows :— As far as the Persian Government is concerned, the amount realised by the issue of the loan is not available until the Medjliss has approved the Government’s proposals as to expenditure and control. The agreement entered into between the bank and the Persian Government on the 26th May, 1910, by which the Government’s debts to the bank were consolidated and interest thereon fixed at 7 per cent., is terminated by virtue of article 6 of the new agreement, and the bank will be paid off without waiting for further sanction by the Medjliss. This comes to a reduction of interest from 7 to 5 per cent, on 32,374,216'80 krans (or, say, 610,800L at 53 krans per £), the figure at which the amalgamation of last year will stand on the 20th May, 1911. It will be remembered that, at the urgent request of the Persian Government, the Imperial Bank made further advances to the Government during the last few months in anticipation of the sterling loan. These amount, with interest up to the 20th May, to 3,439,666‘65 krans (or, at 53 krans per £, to, say, 64,900b), which will also be paid off without further reference to the Medjliss. The net produce of the sterling loan being 1,093,750Z., from which the bank will deduct about 675,700/., the balance available to the Persian Government will be about 418,000/. I may also add that the Persian Government’s long outstanding liability in London, on account of a lottery concession granted in 1889 by the late Nasr-ed-Din Shah, is taken over by the Imperial Bank, which, in taking over the loan at 87-J-, has left itself a margin for this purpose. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 126. Loan Contract between the Persian Government and the Imperial Bank of Persia. THIS contract, made the 8th day of May, 1911, between the Imperial Government of Persia of the one part, and the Imperial Bank of Persia (hereinafter called “ the Bank ”) of the other part. Whereas the Imperial Government of Persia is desirous of issuing in London a loan to the amount of 1,250,000/., and the bank has agreed to take the said loan firm at the price of 87/. 10s. net per 100/. Now these presents witness and declare that it is agreed between the Imperial Government of Persia and the Bank as follows:— 1 2 3 1. The Bank shall take the said loan firm at the rate of 87/. 10s. net for every 100/. of the said loan. 2. The Imperial Government of Persia shall issue in London 12,500 bonds of 100/. each, such bonds to carry interest at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum, and to be framed in the usual form of Government bonds. The loan to be redeemable at par by means of a^ cumulative sinking fund of per cent, per annum, commencing in 1916 and extending over a period not exceeding fifty years. The drawings will take place in London in April in each year, and the drawn bonds will be paid off at par on the 15th May following, after which date the interest on the bonds so drawn will cease. 3. The Imperial _ Government of Persia shall duly observe and perform all the provisions contained in the said bonds as to payment of the loan and interest thereon, and otherwise.4. The Persian Government has the right to redeem the loan at any time after the year 1916 on giving six months’ notice. 5. The Imperial Government of Persia specially assigns to the service of the loan, and as a first charge thereon, subject only to prior charges amounting to 15,714Z. 1 s. 10d per annum for three years, and 30,2781. 12s. 7d. per annum from the year 1913 to the year 1928, the full net customs receipts of every description which the Government now is, or at any time hereafter may be, entitled to collect and receive at all ports or places in the Persian Gulf, including Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Lingah, Mohammerah, and Ahwaz, which receipts are hereby made payable to the Bank, and the Imperial Government of Persia hereby engages forthwith after receipt thereof to pay to the Bank all such customs receipts as aforesaid without deduction other than for actual expenses of administration of the customs of the said ports disbursed prior to the date of such payment. (a.) The Imperial Government of Persia undertakes that throughout the con tinuance of the loan all sums collected by the Customs administration shall be pakl to the Bank at the ports of collection, or at its nearest branch, week by week for meeting the prior charges referred to above and for the service of the loan, and an account of such receipts shall be submitted to the Persian Government by the Bank at the end of each month. (b.) The Bank shall, out of the moneys so collected, pay the prior charges above mentioned and the interest and sinking fund of the loan, and shall hold the surplus at the disposal of the Imperial Government of Persia. (c.) The Bank undertakes, out of the moneys so received, to pay on behalf of the Imperial Government of Persia the half-yearly coupon in London, and supervise the working of the sinking fund and service of the loan free of charges connected with the same. (d.) In the event of the customs receipts of the above-mentioned ports for any three months falling short of the amount required for the prior charges and the service of the loan, either for interest or amortisation, the Imperial Government of Persia binds itself to make good such deficiency from other sources of Government revenue, and further, should receipts from these sources fall below the amount required as above, the Persian Government hereby assigns for this purpose the revenue derived from the receipts of the telegraphs—this assignment to constitute a second charge on the said telegraph receipts up to the year 1928, after which the telegraph receipts will be free. . 6. Out of the proceeds of the loan the Bank is authorised by the Imperial Govern ment of Persia to pay off the outstanding liabilities of the Imperial Government to the Bank, and hold the remainder at the disposal of the Government within three months after the signing of the contract. 7. During the continuance of the loan, or for such less period as the Bank shall desire, the Bank shall be the sole agent and representative of the Government of Persia in England with respect to the said loan and all matters connected therewith, but undertakes no pecuniary liability whatsoever towards the bondholders. 8. The bonds of the present loan are for ever exempt from all or any Persian tax or deduction. The interest and capital, therefore, will not at any time or under any circumstances be liable to any reduction whatever on the part of the Persian Government. (Done in duplicate.)

WLL11 reference to my despatch of the 16th ultimo respecting the measures taken by the Persian Government to restore order on the southern roads, I have the honour to^ icport that the action taken by the Nizam-es-Sultaneh in regard to the Kawamis, who were strongly suspected of having instigated some of therecent robberies in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, seems to have been followed by a tendency to a return of confidence and a revival of trade in that locality. Mr. Acting Consul Knox reports under date of the 13th May that the Bushire- Shiraz road is at present very fairly safe, and that caravans are passing as freely as may be expected during the grazing season. One insignificant robbery had occurred near Kamarij and another near Dastarjin. The Khan of Kamarij, mentioned in my despatch above referred to, appears to have been eventually dispossessed by the Nizam, and to be threatening to rob, though he has not yet done so. Colonel Cox also reports, with regard to the same road, that caravans were coming into Bushire without interruption, but that transport is reported scarce and the rates high. Rahdari is being levied, but the local authorities are endeavouring to stop or reduce it. As concerns the Shiraz-Ispahan route, no robberies have been reported lately, but traffic has been virtually at a standstill and the transport rates prohibitive. I learn, however, that one or two caravans have recently left Shiraz northwards. 1 he Kuhgeluis have been raiding sheep and cattle near Kumisheh, and the Boir Ahmed is have made similar depredations in the neighbourhood of Yezdikhast. The road between Tehran and Ispahan is unsafe, and the attack on Mr. Kingston, traveller for Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome, the druggists, reported in my_telegram of the 15th instant, adds the fourth British victim to the culpable negligence of the local authorities to provide proper guards for the earlier stages out of Ispahan. I have, &amp;c. Q. BARCLAY. * I No. 128. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 6.)

Hills are still on the way. . • j rv The Cabinet. —Mustashar-ed-Dowleh, the Minister of the Interior resigned office early in May, and Sardar Assad was offered the post, but refused to accept it. Mustashar-ed-Dowleh has since resumed office. Sipahdar threatened to resign the Premiership owing to the complications in Pars and for other reasons, but was induced t0 ^The Imperial Bank Loan.—The project came before the Medjhss on the 22nd April and was hotfy contested by the Opposition. The Loan Bill was passed by the majority supporting the Cabinet on the 2nd May, and the contract was signed on the 6th May. The matter forms the subject of a separate despatch. _ _ . . A/r -,. r Bue-Elections —According to the Persian constitution, vacancies m the Medjhss are fiUed W a vote of the majority of the Houee itself. The leader of the Opposrtxon pointed ouUffiat this system was unfair, as any party m the majority ^ lY l cl ™ s that majority whenever the House elected members to fill vacancies. On the 2nd May, hoWe y^’ oAhefsth'May^kis ^lajesty’s Minister had an audience of the Shah and Resent to present His Majesty the King’s letter respecting the designation of Mohamed Hassan Mirza, the Shah’s younger brother, as heir-presumptive or yaliahd.64 The Medjliss. —Several sittings were devoted to the discussion of the loan project and the Government’s scheme for expenditure and control. Most of the Cabinet Ministers were present during the debates on this subject and found the Democratic Opposition exceedingly embarrassing. The majority, however, loyally supported the Cabinet. At the sitting of the 27th April the Minister of Finance proposed that the first and second reading of the Loan Bill should be put through the same day, as the matter was urgent. There was some technical difficulty on the point, and when the President called for a show of hands it was apparent that the motion had been negatived. The matter, however, being quite trivial, no notice was taken of it, and the second reading was put off. Tabreez. Telegraphing on the 10th May, His Majesty’s consul reported that Salar-ed-Dowleh, brother of the ex-Shah, had crossed the frontier and was stirring up the Kurds in Sulduz, declaring that the Turks had promised to assist him. His efforts had not so fai met with much success. The Governor-General had written a friendly letter to him suggesting his coming to Tabreez, where he would help him in any claim he might have against the Government, and warning him of the danger to himself of his present proceedings. Resht. Zaffer es-Sultaneh, Governor of Astrabad, with a force of 300 infantry and two guns, joined the loyal chiefs at Narinjbagh in the middle of March and some desultory fighting took place. Meanwhile the Begent telegraphed to Zaffer-es-Sultaneh to withdraw as the rebels had decided to submit. On the 26th March Amir-i- Mukarram and Ismail Khan submitted to Zaffer-es-Sultaneh at Sari, undertaking to pay the arrears of revenue. They were given charge of the province of Mazanderan, of which, however, Zaffer-es-Sultaneh has since been appointed governor. Ala-ul-Mulk has been appointed Governor of Ghilan. Some 200 horsemen arrived from Tehran in the middle of April, and proceeded to Talish to enforce the payment of taxes three years overdue. Disturbances ensued in which seven soldiers and seven villagers are reported to have been killed. Meshed. The levying of a tax on animals caused a riot on the 1 9th April. Three men, including a policeman, were killed, but order was restored, and the tax collected. The Governor-General is said to be useless, and a strong feeling is growing up against him. Naib Hussein was, towards the end of April, at Halwan, north-west of Tabbas. No action was being taken against him. His lieutenant, Mohamed Ali, had seized Amberan, north of Tabbas, and was storing supplies there. Two or three bands of robbers were reported to be in the Turbat district. Seistan. r ^ The early floods in Seistan were, at the end of March, causing much anxiety, the Helmund had been in flood for over a month, and it wms feared that when the legular spring floods added their volume to the existing rush of water serious damage to crops and buildings would result. The state of Seistan and Kam m April was not satisfactory. Owing to the unfortunate family feud between Shaukat-ul-Mulk and Hashmat-ul-Mulk, the southern and western borders of the Kamat had been much disturbed and, although a temporary truce had been arranged, the mischief had been done, the raiders being emboldened by then immunity from punishment. On the north and east of the Kainat also highway robbery was rife. Nearly all the roads were unsafe, the one exception perhaps being the Kuh-i-Malik Siah-Seistan—Neh-Birjand road. Birjand. On the 6th April*a large party of the Khusfis took refuge in His Majesty's vice consulate during the temporary absence of Mr. Howson, who, on his return persuaded them to disperse. Their object was to protest against the weakness of Shaukat-ul-Mulk in dealing with the Baluch raiders, and but for Mr. Howson’s timely arrival it seemscertain that a serious disturbance would have occurred as the police had already fired on the Khushs. Ispahan. A serious riot occurred on the 6th May, due ostensibly to the dearness of bread. The offices of the municipality were invaded by a mob of women, to whom the President gave an obscene answer. He was pursued through the streets by the crowd and killed and his body hung up in the main square. Later, several offices of the local administration were sacked and a number of prisoners released. When the crowd approached the tribunal the Governor-General ordered a volley to be fired, on which the crowd temporarily withdrew. Firing continued during the night. On the 7th the bazaars were closed, but bread was plentiful. The crowd attempted to wreck the new telephone office, but was deterred. Small bands of police and soldiers patrolled the streets. There was a panic in Julfa where some Parsees, accused of cornering grain, had taken refuge in the Jewish quarter. The bazaars remained closed until the 10th, since when quiet has prevailed. The movement appears to have been in reality reactionary, and engineered by the clergy. On the 14th May, Sardar-i-Ashja’a, Bakhtiari, was appointed Governor-General. The condition of the roads was generally satisfactory during the latter half of April. Posts were arriving from Shiraz, but no caravans were using the road and the rate of mule hire was very high. On the 14th May, Mr. Kingston, of Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome, was robbed and beaten at Khafr, some 50 miles south-east of Kashan, on his way to Ispahan. Yezd. The governor continues on bad terms with the local Assembly, which consequently transacts but little business. The deputy governor’s extortions have caused much feeling against him. The roads have all been passably safe, the only robbery reported being one on the Kerman road, near Shems, on the 11th April, when twenty-five camels and twenty-four loads were carried off 4 by Tootakis and Chaharrahis. A force of road guards pursued the robbers and recovered twenty-three camels and thirteen loads. Kerman. The expeditionary force under the command of Sardar-i-Nusrat captured the fort of Bampur early in April. It was then awaiting reinforcement before marching against Fahraj fort, which was held by Sardar Bahrain Khan. The chief of police has been dismissed by the governor for forcibly removing from the governor’s stables a fugitive from justice who had taken refuge there. Kermanshah. One Yar Mohamed Khan, a somewhat prominent Nationalist, was in April sent under escort to Kermanshah by the central Government. At Dizabad he escaped, and rode into Kermanshah on the 11th. Next day he presented himself in the local Assembly, and declared his willingness to obey that body or the National Assembly. He explained that he had left Tehran at the personal request of the Begent, but, finding that be was being sent under a guard, he had escaped from it. The commander of the Cossacks came in and showed the President a telegram from Sipahdar ordering the arrest of Yar Mohamed, but was advised by the President not to attempt this as it would cause trouble. One of Yar Mohamed’s friends then came in and announced that the Assembly had been surrounded by soldiers, but on Yar Mohamed firing a few shots from his revolver these bolted, and Yar Mohamed went home with a crowd of svmpathisers. Mr. McDouall states that Yar Mohamed is popular and that his only enemy was Muin-ur-Raya, the leader of a faction, who kept a private guard of 100 armed men. Muin-ur-Raya was shot dead on leaving the bazaar on the 1st May. He had been arranging for the dispatch to Tehran of a telegram asking for the expulsion of Yar Mohamed from Kermanshah. The bazaars were closed, and though Yar Mohamed came up with a force and attempted to reassure the people, he was not successful. The actual assassin is not known. Quiet has since prevailed. Two well- known fomenters of disorders, Kalbi and Asker Selim, who were sent to Tehran by Nizam-es-Sultaneh, have been released and are returning to Kermanshah. Their arrival is likely to lead to trouble. Samsam-es-Sultaneh, Bakhtiari, has been appointed governor m place of Rukn-ed-Dowleh,66 Ramadan. The condition of affairs was not, in April, satisfactory. Abbas Khan, Chenari, had quarrelled with the Khans of Shahrabi, and the Assadabad district was consequently disturbed. Shiraz. Immediately after his arrival at Shiraz on the 6th April, Nizam-es-Sultaneh issued orders for a general disarmament of the townspeople and forbade any one to appear in the streets after 9 p.m. Both these orders were rigorously enforced by the Governor- Generahs own men, Kurds and Lurs from Kermanshah. On the 15th April, the Governor-General arrested Kawam-ul-Mulk and his brother Nasr-ed-Dowleh, the ostensible reason being the failure of the latter, who commanded the forces at Shiraz, to capture some brigands in pursuit of whom he had been sent. The young son of Kawam- ul-Mulk applied at His Majesty’s consulate for bast, but not being apparently in imminent danger he was not admitted. On the 18th April a crowd collected to demand of the governor the summary execution of the two prisoners. Nizam-es- Sultaneh promised that they should be tried in a day or two and said that their crimes were punishable with death. The trial did not take place as the Persian Government on the insistence of Sardar Assad refused to sanction it and ordered Nizam-es-Sultaneh to deport the Kawamis. At first the idea was to send them to Tehran or some outlying Persian province, but finding Nizam-es-Sultaneh obstinately opposed to this course, the Persian Government sent him orders to send them to Europe. The acting consul, under instructions from His Majesty’s Legation, urged Nizam-es-Sultaneh to fall in with this arrangement. At first he stoutly refused, maintaining that the Kawamis would lose no time in returning to Persia, but finally he gave way and the Kawamis left Shiraz for Bushire accompanied by a guard of 150 men supplied by Nizam-es-Sultaneh. Thirty miles out they fell into an ambush at a spot near which Soulet-ed-Dowleh was encamped with a large force. Nasr-ed-Dowleh was shot; Kawam-ul-Mulk escaped, but was not heard of for thirty-six hours, when he applied to His Majesty’s consulate for bast, which, as he was in imminent danger, was given him. He is still at the consulate and it is to be feared that there will be some difficulty in getting him away from Shiraz safely. Meanwhile, Nizam- es-Sultaneh has been urging public manifestations against the asylum afforded to the Kawam-ul-Mulk, and he urges that he should be sent off’ from Shiraz without delay, to which the acting British consul has replied that so long as Nizam-es- Sultaneh cannot put an end to the agitation against the consulate it is clearly impossible to regard any guarantee from him as sufficient to warrant Kawam-ul- Mulk’s leaving. The acting consul, at the urgent request of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, visited the latter on the 13th May when, after some conversation about the recent incident, Soulet-ed-Dowleh descanted on his entire devotion to His Majesty’s Government and on his disinterested services in the cause of order on the Bushire road. Mr. Knox replied that His Majesty’s Government appreciated his successful efforts to maintain order on the southern road and to assure the safety of the telegraph line during the migration of the tribes and expressed the hope that he would continue so to act. Soulet-ed-Dowleh declared his readiness and ability to maintain order in Ears, or even in the whole of Southern Persia, but said he would not serve under Sardar Assad. Persian Gulf. Bushire. A disturbance occurred at Bushire on the 3rd April in which four persons were killed and one wounded. On hearing that the gunners, many of whom were petty traders themselves, were trying to induce the tradespeople to close their shops as a protest against the proposed taxes, the deputy governor, accompanied by the deputy head of the police, came to the bazaar and remonstrated with the 'malcontents. In the altercation which ensued the deputy head of police was insulted by a gunner, where upon he took out his revolver and fired, killing the gunner on the spot and wounding another. He then bolted to his house, but being pursued ran towards the residency with the object of taking refuge there. Finding the residency gate closed he hurried to the Turkish consulate, where he took refuge. Only a Persian gendarme was present in the consulate at the time, and when the gunners discovered where the fugitive had hidden they forcibly entered the Turkish consulate and shot him down. The gendarmewas mortally wounded and the deputy head of police was dragged out of the consulate and through the town. Bunder Abbas. A robbery of merchandise of British Indian subjects, amounting to 50L, was xepoited early in April at Giudar-i-Surkh, in Bars jurisdiction. The Kerman road appeared to be fairly safe except at Gudar-i-Surkh, where caravans were being systematically looted. Ahwaz. Traffic on the Lynch road is once more in full swing. A record caravan of 1,200 animals left Ahwaz on the 4th April. No. 129. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 6.) _ &gt; Tehran, May 19, 1911. IN continuation of my despatch of the 16th instant, I have the honour to say that at its sittings of the 16th and 18th instant the Medjliss discussed the Govern ment’s programme of expenditure of the money to be raised by the issue of a loan in London through the Imperial Bank, and that at yesterday’s sitting the Government’s programme was adopted by the Majority, in spite of the repeated opposition of the Democratic party. The following is a summary of the items of expenditure voted by the Medjliss :— 1 . Expeditionary troops (17,500 men) Arrears due to troops .. 2 . Purchase of arms 3. Arrears due to Persian representatives abroad 4. Gendarmerie.. 5. Arrears due to road guards Tomans. £ 1,375,000 (275,000) 150.000 (30,000) 220.000 (44,000) 100.000 ( 20 , 000 ) 200.000 (40,000) 125.000 (25.000) It will be observed that, with the exception of 20,000L for the Persian repre sentatives abroad, the whole amount is set aside for military purposes, and that all the money available out of the loan—something over 400,000/.—has been at once ear-marked. As regards item No. 4, the programme states that out of the 200,000 tomans allocated to the gendarmerie, 80,000 tomans is for the gendarmerie of the south of Persia, while the balance is to be kept in hand until after the arrival of the Swedish officers, when it will be available for expenditure in accordance with their recom mendations.

For the moment I was absent at telegraph office, but consulate munshi went to gate and told them they could not be admitted. They then attempted to enter by force. Munshi shouted that if they did not desist they would be fired on. They replied that they would fire also, and loaded rifles, one threatening munshi, who caught hold of barrel. They rushed, one shot went off, sepoys fired on those who passed gate. These, with companions outside, returned fire. After one minute’s fusillade, sepoys succeeded in driving out those Persian soldiers inside and closing gate. Firing ceased. “ Regrettable as incident is, I think it quite impossible guards should have acted otherwise than they did, and 1 am convinced that munshi did everything to induce soldiers to leave quietly. “ Wounded sowar has finger shattered by bullet.

Unless evidence is forthcoming to show that the Persian troops had an intention other than that of taking bast in the consulate, I presume that an expression of regret in writing from the Minister for Foreign Affairs will, with the call already paid by the commander of the forces on His Majesty’s acting consul, be sufficient reparation for incident.

In continuation of my telegram of the 12th June, I have the honour to report that the information which has so far reached me does not seem to indicate that the Persian soldiers, in breaking into the consulate, were actuated by any hostile object. Incident seems to have been due either to a genuine attempt on the part of the soldiers to draw attention to their grievances by taking bast or, at worst, to have been the work of interested persons desirous of creating a disturbance with a view to making trouble for the Governor-General. It seems at any rate proved that the local authorities endeavoured to stop the soldiers by producing the arrears of pay due to them. No. 141. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 13.)

THAT the American financial assistants, whose arrival was reported in the last monthly summary, have lost no time in getting to work, and that the Medjliss at least intends to support them is shown by the unanimous voting by the Medjliss on the 13th ultimo of a Bill, of which I enclose a copy, drafted by Mr. Morgan Shuster, the new Treasurer-General, for the control of the expenditure of the proceeds of the Imperial Bank’s loan in accordance with the programme of expenditure recently approved by the Medjliss. As you will observe, the new law abolishes the former Committee of Control established by the law of the 20th May (see my despatches of the 10th and 19th May), and pending the reorganisation of the Ministry of Finance, foreshadowed in the preamble, entrusts the control of the loan to a branch of the Ministry of Finance to be formed under the Treasurer-General’s supervision. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 151. The Medjliss, May 30, 1911. Bill for the Control of the Loan Money. The President.— u As the Ministers have come to the Medjliss, the Finance Committee’s report regarding the Control Bill will be read.” Ihe Bill, which had been submitted by the Government and approved by the committee, ran as follows :— Preamble. General and effective control in respect to the new loan from the Imperial Bank, and the expenditure specially provided for out of it, is the natural and particular duty of the Ministry of Finance. One of the greatest defects of the present financial administration of the Persian Government is the superfluous number of departments and minor sections. ^ The most obvious result of this state of affairs is the difficulty in establishing the duties of each department and the responsibility attached to what each does. Therefore,, it is obvious that to introduce a new system with undefined responsibilities, i.e., similar to the system we now have, would only increase the confusion now prevailing in our administrations. Consequently, what is now necessary is that we should have a more simplified system which will give a better result, and not to add another room to the rooms of this administration. The money produced by this loan is in no way different to the money realised bythe Customs, the direct taxes, or the general revenues of the State. On the other hand, the control and special supervision over the collection and expenditure of a large sum is the duty of a department which must necessarily possess three important qualifications, viz , honesty, experience in finance, and definite responsibility. But is it possible that a committee of fifteen persons can fulfil the two last-mentioned conditions ? Some days ago the general control of Persia’s finances was entrusted to a foreign employe who has the post of Treasurer-General, and who has come to Persia with his assistants to reform the financial administration. If we desire to render him responsible for the proper working of. our financial administration we must, on our side, give him the required authority to carry out this difficult task. The Treasurer-General has prepared a provisional scheme for the effective formation of the Ministry of Finance, and this scheme consists of the formation of three departments as follows :— 1. For the collection of Government revenue and taxes of all kinds. 2. For the control of expenditure of all kinds, and the keeping of the accounts pertaining thereto. 3. For banking affairs, the Mint, exchange relating to the loan, interest, sinking- fund, &amp;c. The duties which it was proposed to entrust to the committee already referred to included the two last-mentioned points ; but as the arrangements now proposed have not yet been put into execution, it is necessary to form a provisional branch in order to deal, during the next few months, with matters directly concerning the loan. This branch will be under the supervision of the Treasurer-General. As soon as the new arrangements for the Finance Ministry have been introduced, the accounts, papers, and reports of this provisional branch will be handed over to the new department of the Finance Ministry to which they pertain. _ , In view of the above considerations, the following Bill is laid before the Medjliss, with a request that it should be promptly approved and that its urgency should be recognised :— Article 1. The general and effective control of affairs relating to the loan of 1,250,0001. made from the Imperial Bank of Persia, according to the law of the 5th April, 1911, and the control of the expenditure which has to be effected in accordance with articles 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the law of the 20th May, 1911, is entrusted to the Ministry of Finance under the supervision of the Treasurer-General. Art. 2. Until the new system has been introduced into the Ministry of Finance, control respecting the loan and the above-mentioned expenditure will be provisionally entrusted to a branch which will be specially formed under the supervision of the Treasurer-General. # Art. 3. At the end of every month the Ministry of Finance will include m his report presented to the Government a financial statement regarding the loan. Art. 4. The branch mentioned in Article 2 of this Bill will take the place of the committee referred to in the law of the 20th May, 1911. After a short debate the Bill was passed unanimously. No. 152. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 26.) gjq, Tehran, June 8, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 18th and to my telegram of the 28th ultimo respecting the condition of the southern roads, I have the honour to report that during the past three weeks the general state^ of security continues to show a tendency to considerable improvement in comparison with the complete disorder of last year. It is true that the effects of recent anarchy make themselves felt m the scarcity of transport and a high rate of hire, and that consequently few caravans are passing, but I am glad to be able to report that those alluded to m my above- mentioned despatch as having started from Shiraz for the north have arrived unmolested at Ispahan, bearing a quantity of merchandise belonging to Messrs. ' ^ Outside the depredations of the Kuhgeluis in the neighbourhood of Kumisheh,74 in regard to which the villagers and local farmers seem the sufferers, the only locality on the road between Bushire and Ispahan which for the moment is reported dangerous is Kamarij, a little distance north of Bushire, where the dispossessed Khan Mollah Khorshid is revenging himself by burning crops, and has robbed a caravan of eleven bales of carpets, the ownership of which is as yet unknown. It is also to be noted that the spring emigration of the Kashgais, which last year was marked by an extensive destruction of telegraph material, passed this year in virtue of the special injunctions issued by Soulet-ed-Dowleh without causing any damage. Leaving, therefore, out of the question the insecurity of the Ispahan-Tehran road, which is out of the sphere of any remedy we ourselves could supply, I do not consider that the evidence of any present lack of security on the southern roads is sufficient to justify an assumption that the special measures taken by the Persian Government have broken down, though, on the other hand, it must be confessed that the improvement observed is precarious, insomuch as it cannot be attributed to any measures of the nature of an organised reform. Whether the dispositions taken by the Nizam-es-Sultaneh in co-operation with the Soulet-ed-Dowleh are of more than transient efficiency can only be tested when Soulet has moved northwards to the Kashgai summer quarters, a movement which has already commenced, and when a satisfactory conclusion of the Kawami incident has left the hands of the Nizam free to develop whatever policy he intends to follow. The situation, however, created by the vigorous action taken by his Excellency towards the Kawamis is complicated and the outlook is obscure. The Bakhtiari tribe profess themselves deeply injured by the blow levied against their friends and proteges, and will be implacable in their endeavour to obtain the overthrow of the Nizam. It is suspected that they wish to employ Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, who has just been withdrawn from the governorship of Yezd, and who is the brother and enemy of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, as their instrument for displacing the latter, and the Zaigham’s presence in Ispahan may be connected with a design to fall upon the Kashgais as they approach their summer quarters in the vicinity of the Bakhtiari country. Such a scheme could not well be successful unless favoured by the Central Government, but the influence of the Bakhtiaris at Tehran may lead the Sipahdar to lend his support to the project. I have, however, frequently pointed out to the Minister for Foreign Affairs the dangers of renewed chaos on the southern roads which might attend any upset of the existing authorities in Ears as the result of tribal intrigues. I presume we shall not be prepared to take measures ourselves until we are satisfied that the disorders on the road are killing our trade with Persia. Since I presented the note of the 14th October, apart from the improvement there has been on the Bushire- Ispahan road, customs statistics have been issued, from which it might be argued that general British trade with Persia is far from being in a desperate case. The statistics I refer to are those of the customs receipts at the different southern ports for the ten months ended the 21st January last. These show that, while it is true that the Bushire receipts have fallen off as compared with the same period in the previous year (274,000 tomans as compared with 335,000 tomans), those at Bunder Abbas and Mohammerah show an increase (161,000 tomans and 262,000 tomans respectively as compared with 117,000 tomans and 166,000 tomans). The downfall of Nizam-es-Sultaneh would doubtless be followed by a recrudescence of disorders on the latter road, but I think that, before we abandon the patient attitude we have hitherto observed, we ought, at any rate, to re-examine the position in the light of the most recent customs statistics. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 153. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received Jidy 3.) Sir, Tehran, June 13, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 6th June, I have the honour to transmit herewith an English text of a further Bill submitted to the Medjliss on the 8th instant, and passed practically with unanimity and without modification at to-day’s sitting. The twelve articles contained in the Bill were originally drafted by Mr. MorganShuster, and translated into Persian for submission to the Medjliss. The preamble, of which I enclose an English translation, was drafted by the Finance Mimstei, who introduced the measure. A glance at this law will show that it defines Mr. Shuster’s functions, and endows him with very wide powers in the domain of finance. _ The first impression which the Bill conveys is that Mr. Shuster is about to undertake the complete remodelling of the Ministry of Finance, and to commence operations by making a clean sweep of the existing machinery. The Minister of Finance, however, when questioned on the subject yesterday by Mr. Churchill, replied that this point had, in fact, already been raised by the Finance Committee of the Medjliss, which was then examining the Bill, and he had been able to explain to it that Mr. Shuster had no such intentions, at any rate, for the present. He was going first to organise the Treasury Department, on the lines laid down in the Bill, but he would not be able for some time to deal with the departments which carried on the intricate business of the Finance Ministry with the provinces, &amp;c. _ . On the Persians Mr. Shuster has apparently created a great impression, and the unanimity with which all parties have given him the full powers for which he has asked proves that they repose the utmost confidence in him. I understand that he does not expect to stop peculation and leakage at once, and that he will be quite content i he succeeds within the next six months or a year to stop the larger leakages, and to reduce wanton or foolish extravagance. He has let it be widely known that il he finds obstacles placed in his way by any person or persons he will denounce them to the Medjliss, and if he cannot remove their obstruction he will return to America. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 153. Finance Minister's Bill 'presented to the Medjliss at the Sitting of the 8th June, 1911, and passed 13th June, 1911. Preamble. THE purpose of this Bill is so clear that a cursory examination of it will at once elucidate and make manifest all its objects. At present the financial conditions of the Government are truly regrettable, and it we wish to save ourselves, the measures we take must be very effective and courageous. The Medjliss has already, by the law of the 2nd of Sefer, 1329 (A.H.) (2nd February, 1911), approved the engagement of a Treasurer-General of the State, and the Government, in accordance with this sanction, have engaged a particular American in order that he should have general and effective supervision and control over the revenue and expenditure of the State. &lt; . It is obvious that whenever we entrust an undertaking to a certain person, he will not be able to carry it out until given those full powers essential for the purpose. In the affairs of the world, whether official or personal, as a general rule, if a person undertakes a grave responsibility without previously obtaining the necessary powers, he is either a fool or a rogue. . So far the financial and monetary arrangements of the Persian Government nave been conducted without system and through different officials. Each one of these officials has, during some months, carried on his important duties, which refer to fundamental principles now recognised to concern the Persian people. _ Without criticising the work undertaken by these officials, or referring to the conflicting views held on the subject, the unfortunate consequences of these differences of opinion have become well known both to the Government and to the people. Confusion in the administrations, the absence of effective control m financial aflairs, and the impossibility of bringing about real reform, and finally the uncertainty as to those really responsible for illegal acts, will undoubtedly bring the country to a state of irreparable ruin. If we wish to save ourselves from this dangerous position we must adopt extraordinary measures to reform these conditions, because it is impossible to fell a forest with a pen-knife. The financial affairs of the State are _ oj that particular nature which cannot take into consideration personal or political interests or temporary conditions. Therefore, in order to introduce new and permanent reforms in the financial and monetary affairs of the Persian Government, the following76 measures, which, have received the most careful and attentive consideration, are submitted to the Medjliss, and their urgency is drawn attention to :— Article 1. The Treasurer-General of the Empire of Persia is entrusted with the direct and effective control of all financial and fiscal operations of the Persian Government, including the collection of all receipts of every description, and the control and accounts of all Government expenditure. Article 2. The T reasurer-General shall establish the following organisations in the Ministry of Finance:— 1. Chief office for the collection of the maliat, taxes, and Government revenues of every description, whether such maliat and taxes actually exist, or such as shall hereafter be established. 2. Chief office for the inspection and control of all receipts and approved expenditure, and the keeping of accounts in connection therewith. 3. Chief office for fiscal operations. All transactions of the Government with the bank, and operations respecting the minting of bullion, and of exchange, loans, interest, amortisation, conversion, concessions, and financial agreements, whether such agreements yield a revenue to the Government, or whether it imply a financial obligation of the Government, shall, the provisions of the terms of the laws being duly observed, be effected by this office. Article 3. In each of the three offices referred to in article 2 the Treasurer-General shall establish such sections and sub-sections as he may deem necessary. Article 4. Whenever the central organisation shall have been effected, the Treasurer-General shall, whenever appropriate, establish the services he may consider essential for the organisation of each of the different provinces. Article 5. The Treasurer-General shall be charged with the custody of the treasury of the Empire, and no Government expenditures shall, without his signature, in the case of dnect mandates, or, without his authorisation, in the case of credit orders, be made. Article 6. The Treasurer-General shall prepare such regulations as he thinks fit for the propei execution of the improvements referred to in the preceding articles, which regulations shall, after being vise and published, have the force of law.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 3.) gj r Tehran, June 14, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BAPCLAY. Enclosure in No. 154. Summary of Events in Persia for 'period May 18 to June 14, 1911. Tehran. American Financial Officials. —Mr. R. W. Hills arrived at Tehran_ shortly after Mr. Shuster and the others, but has returned to America owing to illness in his family.' Mr. Cairns has not yet arrived. Mr. Shuster has drafted two Bills dealing with his functions as Treasurer-General. They were readily accepted by the Medjliss, and have become law. The Medjliss. —At the sitting of the 18th May the Government asked for authority to pay the salaries of the French and Swedish employes who are being engaged, on the following scale :— Swedish officers for the gendarmerie— One captain Two lieutenants French officials— One for the Ministry of the Interior One for the Ministry of Justice .. The necessary authority was voted. The Government’s programme of expenditure of the sum available out of the sterling loan (some 400,0001.) was discussed at the sittings of the 16th and 18th May (see despatch of the 19th May), and agreed to by a majority. At the sitting of the 20th May a member proposed to add an article to the programme of expenditure to the effect that the sum of 100,000 tomans laid aside foi the payment of arrears due to Persian representatives abroad should be distributed pro rata, as, of course, it is not sufficient to cover all outstandings. This was agreed Fr. .. 20,000 a-year. .. 24,000 .. 30.000 .. 30,00078 to, but most of the votes in favour of the proposal were given by Opposition members. On the 23rd May the annual budget of the Medjliss for the ensuing year (March 1911 to March 1912) was read and agreed to by a majority. The principal items are:— Tomans. Salaries of the deputies (about 240Z. a-year each) .. .. .. 121,000 Salaries of the staff .. .. .. .. .. .. 13.254 Sundry expenditure .. .. .. .. .. .. 10^674 On the 25th May the Premier announced that Moavin-ed-Dowleh and Momtaz-ed- Dowleh had exchanged portfolios as follows :— Moavin-ed-Dowleh became Minister of Finance. Momtaz-ed-Dowleh became Minister of Posts, Telegraphs, and Commerce. The Prime Minister explained that the change had been made owing to the amount of work in the Ministry of Finance and Momtaz-ed-Dowleh’s ill-health. At the sitting of the 27th May Morteza Kuli Khan, the leader of the ministerial supporters, read a project for the administrative partition of Kerman from Baluchistan, and after a short debate the matter was dropped. On the 30th May a Bill was introduced defining the functions of the Treasurer- General, and placing him in control of the expenditure of the money accruing from the sterling loan. On the 6th June the budget of the court was read and passed. The total tor the ensuing year amounted to over 300,000 tomans, and the following are the principal items included :— Shah’s privy purse .. .. .. .. .. . # 14 500 Crown Prince’s expenses .. .. .. .. .. 18 000 The Regent (including his Cabinet) .. .. .. ., *, 60,’000 Ministry of the Court .. .. .. .. 20 , .000 Royal household .. .. ., ,. # # _ _ .. 135,000 ^ On the 8th June a further Bill was introduced dealing in detail with the Treasurer- General s functions and giving him full powers in the financial administration. It was referred to committee and approved by a majority at the sitting of the 13th June. Sardar Assad left Tehran for Europe on the 3rd June. ' Tabreez. Eariy in June Mukhber-es-Sultaneh resigned the post of Governor-General of Azerbaijan. Amanullah Mirza, commander of the troops in Azerbaijan, is officiating as Governor- General. G° verno1 of Ardebil, who had taken the field against the Shahsevans, was defeated by them near Miskin, towards the end of May and fled to Ahar. The Governor of Ahai was himself said to be in a serious position, as an expedition sent by him against some of the Karadaghis had been repulsed. . S^ l fj a-e d'lJowleh, Governor of Maragha, had for some time previous to the resignation of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh been acting independently of the latter, and was reported to be collecting a force, but with what object was not clear. According to Peisian reports his force was intended to deal with Salar-ed-Dowleh, who, with 200 to 300 men, was on the 7th June near Miandoab. Salar-ed-Dowleh’s object is believed to be to compel the Government to come to terms with him with regard to his confiscated estates. Resht. Yamin-ul-Mamalek has been appointed Governor-General of Ghilan, and arrived at Besht on the 26th May. A Greek trader proceeding from Besht to Enzeli was attacked and robbed of 150L by thiee Armenians on the Khommam road. His coachmen managed to escape and bring woid to Besht, whence policemen were sent out. The Armenians were arrested, and one was whipped until he disclosed where the 150Z. had been hidden.Seistan. By the end of April the Hamun had overflowed into the Shela and considerable tracts of country in Miankangi were under water. Parts of the Seistan-Koh-i-Malik Siah road were flooded, rendering considerable detours necessary for caravans. Some difficulty was experienced in getting across supplies for the Bobat column and in getting across merchandise, much of which was delayed at Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Many villages had suffered considerable damage, and in one village of Miankangi forty-six people were said to have lost their lives. The situation in Seistan was in May normal, but in Kain there was increasing discontent against the governor, Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Another serious Baluch raid was reported from Chah Dashi, 24 miles south-west of Neh, 100 armed Baluchis raiding an encampment of Tahiris and carrying off 350 camels, several thousand sheep, and every article of value the nomads possessed. Hashmat-ul-Mulk is believed to have instigated this raid. In the north Mohamed Ali, Nishapuri, was practically ruler of a considerable district near Gunabad, and the Meshed postal service was consequently very irregular. Recently a deputation of the leading men of Sunnikhana visited Major O’Connor at Bhjand with a request that the Sunnis of that district might become British subjects. They said that the new taxes imposed since the establishment of the constitution were oppressive and that the governor was apparently unable to protect the province against highway robbers. They were informed that their request could not possibly be entertained. A party of Berberis who were on their way to Meshed on _ a pilgrimage quarrelled with some villagers at Muhammadabad, 40 miles from Birjand on the Turbat road. The villagers with some nomads surrounded the caravanserai in which the Berberis were lodged and some shots were fired at it, one of which killed one Yakub Ali, a Berber!, formerly a sepoy in the 126th Baluchistan Infantry. Major O’Connor, to whom the Berberis appealed at Birjand, arranged with Shaukat-ul-Mulk for a joint investigation which resulted in the fact of the murder being proved. Major O’Connor demanded 400L indemnity for the murdered mans family, but Shaukat-ul-Mulk, though admitting the facts, refused any redress except ^ payment of 401. to 601. His Majesty’s Minister has presented a claim for the indemnity to the Persian Government. Ispahan. Sardar-i- A shja’a, Bakhtiari, the new Governor-General, arrived on the 26th May. Although there is said to he much secret discontent at the appointment of a Bakhtiari governor, the town has remained quiet. The bread question has ceased to be acute, large quantities of wheat and other food-stuffs having arrived. The local administrations, disorganised by the riot of the 6th May, are gradually resuming work. The state of the Shiraz road is dealt with in a separate despatch. Of the other roads, all, with the exception of that to Tehran, appear to have continued safe. As reported in the last summary, Mr. Kingston was robbed on the 14th May near Khalidabad. The robbery took place at about 11 p.m. The robbers, after taking Mr. Kingston's money, threw him and his servant down, binding their arms. Onn of them repeatedly struck Mr. Kingston with the butt end of his rifle and kicked him. Mr. Kingston was travelling without guards, the Governor of Kashan having promised hut failed to supply them. It is thought that the robbery was the work of villagers and not of tribesmen. Sergeant Peters, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, passed the spot some six hours later and saw no tribesmen. Since the middle of Ma_y the road between Khalidabad and Madr-i-Shah has been infested by small bands of robbers, but the only robbery actually reported was that of an Ispahan notable near Khafr on the 30th May. The posts have not been molested. During May rumours were current of impending trouble in the Bakhtiari country and the massing of troops was reported. The situation remained obscure until the 8th June, when fighting began at Pul-i-Zaman Khan, 10 miles north of Deh Kurd, between the Chaharlaug section, allied with Zergham-es-Sultaneh, and the Haftlang section. The Chaharlang numbers are variously estimated at from 1,000 to 2,500. On the 10th June it was reported that the engagement had ended in favour of the Chaharlangs, who had been joined by the Khajuis. There was said to have been heavy loss of life. Numbers of Haftlang women, fleeing before the Chaharlang, were arriving at Ispahan on the Uth and 12th. Reinforcements which the Governor- General of Ispahan proposed sending to the Haftlangs had not started, it was believed because the roads were blocked by the Chaharlangs. feardar-i-Zaffat, Haftlang, who80 is at Tehran, asserts that the Ohaharlangs will easily be dealt with. Traffic on the Ahwaz road has not been affected by the fighting. Yezd. Zaigham-ed-Dowleh, Kashgai, was dismissed from the governorship in May, and has been replaced by Eakhr-ul-Mulk, formerly Governor-General of Arabistan. Just before his dismissal he extracted 2,0001. from Mushir-ul-Mamalek, the chief tax-collector, under threat of having him bastinadoed. He has since withdrawn to Ispahan. The roads appear to have remained safe except for the depredations of Zaigham-ed-Dowleh’s men when moving to Ispahan. On the 2nd June, however, 1,000 Kuhgeluis and Boir Ahmedis were reported to be moving towards Nogumbaz with the intention of marauding. Kerman. The troops under Sardar-i-Nusrat continue to besiege Bahrain Khan’s men in Fahraj fort. Occasional sorties are made, but very little damage is done. The troops are suffering much from the heat of Baluchistan, and a,re likely to withdraw from before Fahraj with or without leave. Their retreat would greatly enhance the reputation of Bahram Khan, and destroy the little prestige still remaining to the Persian Govern ment in these parts. In the middle of April goods to the value of over 3,000L, the property o± Messrs. Castelli and Mr. Stevens, were robbed at Doulatabad, on the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road. Except for this robbery the roads in this province seem to be fairly safe. Colonel Haig in the course of his tour gathered that those concerned in the robbery, on discovering that the goods were the property of a foreign firm, rather regretted the enterprise. Kermanshah. Bukn-ed-Dowleh has been dismissed from the post of governor, to which Sardar- i-Motazid has been appointed. Pending the latter’s arrival from Tehran, Mohtisham- ed-Dowleh is officiating as governor, and has so far succeeded m preserving order. He was successful in persuading Yar Mohamed Khan to withdraw from' Kermanshah, otherwise it is probable that fighting would have taken place between Yar Mohamed’s men and those of Akbar Khan, brother of the murdered Moin-ur-Baya. Telegraphing on 12th June, His Majesty’s consul reported that Akbar Khan had left to attack the village of Rustam Beg, and that in Kermanshah the two factions had occupied forti fications, and some firing had taken place, the bazaar was closed, and general nervous ness prevailed. Daoud Khan, Kalhur, was collecting forces with the intention of attacking Samsam-ul-Mamalek, Smjabi, but he appears to have refrained from carrying out his intention on receiving telegrams from Tehran instructing him to maintain order. The Yali of Pusht-i-Kuh is reported to have made terms with his son, Amanullah Khan, who had taken the field against him, and to have conceded all the latter’s demands. Shiraz. The agitation against the asylum afforded to Kawam-ul-Mulk in His Majesty’s consulate continued for some time, but it has now died away. An unfortunate incident occurred on the 10th June, when some 500 Persian soldiers endeavoured to force their way into His Majesty’s consulate to take “ bast ” there as a protest against their pay being in arrears. Firing ensued, resulting in three Persian soldiers being killed and two wounded, while one sowar of the 25th Cavalry, of the guard of His Majesty’s consulate, had one finger shattered by a bullet. The Governor-General sent troops to guard the consulate and the commander of the troops and one of his own staft to express regret for the incident, which has been fully reported in a separate despatch. Persian Gulf. Bush ire. Owing to an outbreak o± plague in Bushire, the port was officially declared plague affected on the 23rd April,Bunder Abbas. At the end of April news was received from Minab that the Zahit of Jiruft had, by order of the Governor of Kerman, arrested Zargham-i-Nizam and Jiyand Khan after a fight m which five men were killed on each side. No. 155. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received July 3.) Sir, Tehran, June 18, 1911. WITH reference to my telegram of the 31st March last, my Russian colleague informs me that the joint enquiry into the attempt on the life of Motamid-i-Khakan, the Governor-General of Ispahan, and the killing of his nephew being concluded, Mirza Abbas Khan, the accused, has been sent to Russia for trial. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 156. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 3.) Sir, Tehran, June 21, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 16th May respecting the loan of 1,250,000k which the Persian Government is raising through the Imperial Bank of Persia, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the Act of Parliament relating thereto which was passed on the 2nd May. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 156. THE following Act empowering the Persian Government to raise a loan of 1,250,000k through the Imperial Bank of Persia was passed by the Persian Parliament on the 2nd May, 1911, and the following four clauses, comprised in the Act, are translated from the Persian Government’s official “ Gazette,” No. 14, of Thursday, the 18th May, 1911 Act dated May 2, 1911. Article 1. The Persian Government is empowered to borrow, through the Imperial Bank of Persia, 1,250,000k at the rate of 5 per cent, interest, and under a discount of 12|- per cent. Article 2. The amortisation and guarantee for this loan shall be as follows : (1.) The amortisation at the rate of J per cent, shall be paid five years after the date of this loan. (2.) Tire guarantee for this loan shall be the same as the guarantee for the former loan of the Government from the Imperial Bank of Persia, in accordance with the conditions in the agreement dated the 20th March, 1910, i.e., the first receipts of the southern customs after the deduction of the expenditure to be met from that source. (3.) In the event of the Imperial Bank of Persia making proposals regarding the non-payment of the principal of this loan, by which the Persian Government would not have the right to pay off the whole of the loan for a given period, the Government is empowered to agree to this proposal on condition that the said period is not more than five years from the date of the signature of this loan. Article 3. The bonds of this loan shall be exempt from every kind of tax or imposition which may be levied in the future. Article 4. After the payment of 3,396,697 tomans, the sum already owed to the bank, and 340,000 tomans, a sum which has lately been advanced on the loan, the balance of the loan shall remain in the bank until such time as the project of expenditure and projects of control have been approved by the Parliament.82 No. 157. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 3.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 3, 1911. SITUATION in Tehran. No successor to the Sipahdar has yet been found, and the Medjliss, with few exceptions, now realises that they must support him. Nasr-ul-Mulk summoned the deputies to the palace yesterday and spoke to them very seriously, making them realise the gravity of affairs. His Highness obtained from the majority a written undertaking to support the Sipahdar, and he has communicated this undertaking to him. No. 158. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 4.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 4, 1911. SIPAHDAR left Resht for Tehran yesterday. No. 159. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 5.) (Telegraphic.) ^ _ Tehran, Jidy 5, 1911. I REGRET to report that a dispute has arisen between MM. Mornard and Shuster. The Treasurer-General maintains that the law passed by the Medjliss on the 13th June renders the Administrator-General of Customs subordinate to him, and he has requested M. Mornard to deposit all the receipts from the customs to his account at the English and Russian banks. Up till now Administrator-General of Customs has not signified his consent to this arrangement, and Imperial Bank, in pursuance of instructions from the r I reasurer-General to recognise only his signature, have refused cheques drawn by the former on the Customs account at the Imperial Bank. Last night a resolution of the Cabinet, supporting Mr. Shuster’s demands, was communicated to M. Mornard, and administrator-general was at the same time ordered to obey the recent law. I propose nevertheless to take no part in the dispute unless I receive instructions to the contrary from you. No. 160. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 6.) (Telegiaphic.) ^ Tehran, July 6, 1911. Ii\ continuation of my telegram of yesterday’s date I have the honour to lepoit that on the 4th July the Imperial Bank of Persia refused to meet a cheque drawn by M. Mornaid on one of the customs accounts and presented to them on the ground that it did not bear Mr. Shuster s signature. I am informed by M. Poklewski that the cheque in question was drawn for the transfer of certain moneys from the northern customs which, for convenience sake, administrator-general had deposited at the Imperial Bank to the Banque nationale d’Escompte. No. 161. Sn G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 7, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that the Medjliss yesterday authorised Mr. Morgan Shuster almost unanimously to engage “ a financial assistant for the organisation of aTreasury gendarmerie. I understand that Mr. Shuster confidentially informed the Mecljliss while this proposal was under consideration that he had decided to offer the appointment to the military attache of His Majesty’s Legation. He has now done so, stating in his letter to Major Stokes that Stokes would be of great use to the Persian .TOvernment in the capacity proposed on account of his thorough knowledge of the country and its general conditions, of his military training, and of his acquaintance with the language. The duties of the Treasury gendarmerie are described as being to support and aid, especially in the southern provinces,” the financial officers, where necessary, in the collection of the direct taxes and of the maliat. Appointment would be under the orders of Mr. Shuster. An early answer is requested to enable the Treasurer-General, if it is favourable, to take immediate measures to cause His Majesty’s Government to be formally approached. . I ^ ear that it would be impossible to persuade Persian Government expressly to limit the appointment under reference to the south, as any action on our part in this direction would convince the Medjliss that we desired to give a political significance to the appointment. I would add that Mr. Shuster’s letter to the military attache is the first intimation I received of this matter. No. 162. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 9.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 9, 1911. SITUATION is again disquieting at Shiraz, where a force of some eighty riflemen from a neighbouring village have occupied a position in town, demanding from governor surrender of murderer of one of their comrades. Governor-General attributes situation to intrigues of Kawam’s followers, and Persian Government have asked me to threaten Kawam that if these continue he will be handed over to Governor-General. His Majesty’s consul denies this charge, malcontent villagers having no connection with Ivawam. I have nevertheless given .Kawam a serious warning that his followers must be kept quiet. No. 16.3. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 9.) (Telegraphic.) _ Tehran, July 9, 1911. FOLLOWING sent to His Majesty’s representative at Shiraz :— “Persian Government assure me that they are satisfied with guarantees given by Nizam respecting safety of Kawam, and they request me to instruct you to send latter to Europe according to Nizam’s arrangements. “ You should inform Kawam of Persian Government’s assuranc.es, and ask him to make arrangements with Nizam with a view to his journey to Bushire. I presume he will decline, and you should not insist on his complying ; but in that case it wmild be well that he should state exactly what further safeguards he requires.” No. 164. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 10, 1911. IN continuation of my telegram of the 5th July, I have the honour to report that the Treasurer-General and the Administrator-General of Customs appear to have come to an understanding. I will report further when I am in possession of fuller details.84 No. 165. Sir Q. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—(Received July 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 10, 1911.

Governor-General issued a proclamation on the 8th July that after twenty-four hours he would bombard quarter of town where malcontent riflemen are m position and where Kawam’s house is situated. Proclamation speaks of disorders as due o Kawam’s instigation, though I have repeatedly assured Persian Government that Kawam is allowed no communication with outside except through acting consul. Governor-General has since given twenty-four hours’ more grace. Acting consul, at Governor-General’s request, is instructing British subjects to leave threatened quarter. _ • j + -r r I have held Persian Government responsible for any losses occasioned to ontisn subjects, and I am protesting against Governor-General s allegations as to liawam s intrigues from consulate.

Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 11.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, July 11, 1911. AS instructed in your telegram of the 10th July, 1 spoke to-day to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject of the proposed creation of a Treasury gendarmerie. His Excellency said that he would raise no objections to such a gendarmerie, as he was in favour of all measures calculated to restore order in Persia, but he thought that should the necessities of the new service require that it be under the command of a single officer, it would be better to choose that officer from among the minor Powers. If it were found possible, on the other hand, to split up the command, he thought that the posts might be filled by a Russian and British officer respectively. I pointed out to his Excellency that it might be very difficult to secure the right man for the post, and that Major Stokes appeared to be eminently qualified to be m command of the force. M. Neratof rejoined that another Swedish officer would not be difficult to secure.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received July 12.) ( Tel egrapliic.) Tehran, July 12, 1911. b tilRAZ.

Persian consul at Baku reports that Sardar Arshad, a friend of Amir Bahadur, and two companions have arrived at Baku with arms and ammunition, and are giving out that ex-Shah will return to Persia in a fortnight. I understand from Russian Minister that these men have been arrested by Russian authorities. It might be well to warn ex-Shah, who is, I believe, in Vienna, against intriguing.

They dwelt upon the improved condition of the southern roads. I told them we understood that more trade was going in by these roads, but that the situation was anything but secure. We had shown bow single-minded we were in the matter by acquiescing willingly in the employment of Swedish officers, which showed that we had no political objects and nothing but the interests of British trade in view. It was necessary to organise a force which would establish security. They admitted cordially that our attitude in the matter of Swedish officers had been much appreciated. No. 177. Sir G.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 14.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 14, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 15th July:— Sir, 1 have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your telegram of the 13th instant. The proposal of the Russian Government that the command of the Treasurygendarmerie, which the Treasurer-General desires that Major Stokes should organise, should he split up so as to secure a Russian as well as a British officer, would not, I feel sure, be accepted by the Persian Government except under compulsion, and if we insisted upon it, I have little doubt that the treasurer-general would resign. As regards the alternative proposal that the command of the Treasury gendarmerie should be entrusted to a Swedish officer or to a subject of some other minor Power, I thought it well to consult Mr. Shuster, and I have now the honour to transmit a copy of his reply. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 178. Mr. Shuster to Sir G. Barclay. Dear Sir George, _ Tehran, July 14, 1911. I AM in receipt of your note of to-day’s date in which you state that your Govern ment evidently think that the appointment of Major Stokes to organise the Treasury gendarmerie might cause some international jealousy. You ask me whether the appointment of a Swedish officer or of a subject of some other minor Power might not be a way out of the difficulty. In reply, I beg to state that the Medjliss having recently authorised me to appoint a suitable person to organise, under my direct supervision and control, a force of Treasury gendarmerie, I tendered the position to Major Stokes for the sole reason that I consider him to be the best fitted man for the work whom I could possibly obtain. I am personally aware of Major Stokes’s peculiar qualifications for this task, such as his military training, his four years’ sojourn in Persia, his knowledge of the country, of the Persian language and of French (which is widely spoken here), and, in general, of the high esteem in which he is held in this community as an officer and a man. I have no hesitancy in assuring you that in seeking the most efficient financial aide whom I could find for this particular branch of my work, the question of nationality played no part whatever in making up my opinion. Had this been so, it is but natural to presume, that the matter being left entirely to my discretion, I would have sought such an assistant from my own country. I may take this occasion to repeat that the work of financial reform here, which I have undertaken in the midst of many grave difficulties, and on which I have in a manner risked my professional reputation, is in no sense political in its character. No act of mine has been guided by political considerations, either local or international, and I naturally feel that I could not in any manner accept any suggestion which would cast upon my perfectly frank and disinterested tender of a post to Major Stokes the light of political bias. With all due respect to the subjects of minor Powers, and without any disrespect to several of my own countrymen whom I have appointed to serve with Major Stokes in the Treasury gendarmerie, I believe that Major Stokes is the best qualified to give efficient service to this country in connection with my own financial mission, and I would be unwilling, under any circumstances, to appoint anyone, from any Power whatsoever, for this or any other branch of my work unless I, personally, was aware of and satisfied with the appointee’s special qualifications. We know, of course, that one of the greatest handicaps from which any foreigner suffers here is, as in my own case, a lack of knowledge of the language, habits, and modes of thought of the Persian people. This defect becomes even more serious in the case of one called upon to deal directly with a large number of such men as would go to make up an armed force. A Swedish officer, be he ever so competent, would have to spend at least a year or more here before he could possibly be of any real assistance in this line of work, whereas the necessity of getting my gendarmerie force organised and at work at once is urgent in the extreme. In conclusion, permit me to say that, as the fact of my tender of this post to Major Stokes is now generally known here, any withdrawal of that offer by me could not fail to be interpreted as being dictated by purely political considerations, which I could by no means permit. Trusting that this statement will enable you to reassure your Government upon this subject, and that I may receive an early and favourable consideration by your Government of Major Stokes’s acceptance. I am, &amp;c. W. MORGAN SHUSTER.1 1 ■ in r ■ i —— 88 No. 179. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received Jidy 14.) (Teleerapliic.) St. Petersburqh, July 14:, 1911. SIR G.

I am informed by Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that he has heard that the individuals mentioned have been arrested at Baku ; his Excellency, however, has not yet succeeded in discovering whether they came from the ex-Shah or not.

Tehran, July 15, 1911. ADMINISTRATOR-GENERAL of Customs and Treasurer-General. Belgian charge d'affaires tells me that he has stated to the Persian Government that Belgian Government would not consent to its officials being subordinated to other foreigners, and that he has received an assurance that it was never proposed to place M. Mornard under the orders of the treasurer-general. Latter, however, is a man prone to follow his own will, and in the question under notice he is expressly supported by the law of the 13th June. It remains to be seen how far in practice Mr. Shuster will find it possible to reconcile the exercise of his authority with the pretensions of the Belgian officials, and it must depend to a great extent on the forms he employs. I see nothing to indicate that the Belgian charge d’affaires is inclined unduly to press Administrator- General’s case. A second long interview on the 13th July between the two parties had, he tells me, a decidedly hopeful issue. Administrator-General of Customs has already agreed to the transfer to Mr. Shuster of the custom accounts, which have up till now stood to his account. I have informed my Russian colleague that I am prepared to assist him in endeavouring to promote an understanding, but, in view of the determination shown by treasurer-general to be independent of foreign influence, we shall be obliged to act very cautiously. M. Poklewski desires to defer taking any action for the present and to await developments. Up till now I have not succeeded in obtaining a copy of the terms of appointment of the Belgian officials, but it is therein expressly stated, Belgian charge d’affaires tells me, that the men are to be under the orders of the Grand Vizier and the Minister of Finance. This stipulation is ignored by the law of the 13th June. Persian Govern ment, it would therefore seem, would have acted more correctly if they had come to an arrangement with the officials in question and the Belgian Government before passing this law.

Si r &gt; Tehran, June 27, 1911. I HAVE the honour to forward copy of a despatch from the acting British consul at Shiraz reporting on the situation there. Throughout the events recorded in this despatch I am now forwarding Mr. Knox’s action has earned my approval. He has, I consider, acted with much tact and good judgment. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 184. Acting Consul Knox to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Shiraz, May 18, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report on recent developments of the situation in Ears. During the first days of May the differences between the central Government and Nizam-es-Sultaneh had become more marked. On the 6th May, in accordance with instructions contained in your telegram of the 5th May, I approached the Governor- General on this subject. Nizam-es-Sultaneh, on learning the object of my visit, informed me that he had now resigned himself to accepting the dictates of the Persian Govern ment and that his delay in executing them had been due to the fact that for the past three days he had been occupied in devising some means by which he could send away the Kawamis with the least possible danger to themselves. He had proposed, he said, to remove them in the course of the previous night, but refrained from doing so on discovering that news of his intention had leaked out. He added that he would undoubtedly find an opportunity to do so safely within the next two days. He explained to me in detail how he had arranged that the prisoners were to be conducted by an escort of Government troops as far as Dastarjin, where fresh horses and men were in waiting to convey them to Kazerun ; here he had ordered 100 men to be in readiness to escort them as far as the Tang-i-Turkan, the northern entrance to the Kamarij plain, where his own dependant, Nur Mohamed Khan, was stationed with 150 riflemen. From that point onwards no possibility of danger was to be anticipated. On my enquiring as to whether he had any guarantee that Soulet-ed-Dowleh w r ould respect the Kawamis, he replied that he had not, but that he believed that the Kashgai would not venture to molest them. At this interview Nizam-es-Sultaneh again took an opportunity to descant at some length on Bakhtiari dissensions and weaknesses and the short sightedness of the Cabinet in thus tying his hands,No further information on the subject of the Kawamis reached me until the following afternoon, when I learned that Nasr-ed-Dowleh had been assassinated on the road. The circumstances of the murder, so far as can be definitely ascertained, were as follows:— Kawam-ul-Mulk and Nasr-ed-Dowleh left the palace before midnight on the 6th May, escorted by about 150 horsemen, for the most part Cossacks and Shahsevan regulars; 6 Kashgais who had guarded them during their imprisonment also accompanied them. Some 6 miles out from Shiraz a large part of the escort turned back, only about fifty, including the six Kashgais, continuing with them. From this point the road lies through sharply undulating country, and Kawam-ul-Mulk, whose suspicions were by now thoroughly aroused, changed the mule on which he was mounted for a good horse ridden by one of his servants, and, leaving the track, where he might at any moment be ambushed, followed with four of his own men and four Cossacks the ridge line of the hillocks. Nasr-ed-Dowleh, who was either less apprehensive or more resigned, kept to the track still mounted on a mule. From time to time large groups of Kashgais were sighted moving parallel to their line of march, and when crossing the river bed 2 miles short of Khan-i-Zinian, Kawam-ul-Mulk saw the six tribesmen who had accompanied them join on the bank a small body of Kashkulis, of the tribe of Mohamed Kerim Khan, Kashgai, deputy in the Medjliss, whose son was present. Kawami, who was about half a mile ahead of his brother, had crossed a small intervening ridge when he heard one rifle shot followed at once by two or three others. He rode back to the crest, and, seeing that Nasr-ed-Dowleb was dead, and the road back barred, galloped on with his eight men to the caravanserai, where he at first intended to defend himself. Finally, however, realising that this was hopeless, he turned off northwards with the aim of reaching one of his own villages where he could collect enough men to convoy him to the Arab tribes. He soon learned, however, that all the roads were closed, so, having passed the night among some of his peasants, and the next day making a detour of about 80 miles, he came accompanied by ten or twelve sowars into Shiraz by the gate nearest to his house, which he reached safely. From there he sent a message to the Governor-General to the effect that if he failed in obtaining “ bast ” at His Majesty’s consulate, he and his few followers would be ready to defend them selves by force. He then set out disguised in a European coat and helmet in company of Dr. Woollatt, who had been in attendance at the moment of his arrival on Nasr-ed- Dowleh’s daughter, and arrived here before evening. Such is Kawam-ul-Mulk’s own account, which tallies generally with all other versions that I have been able to obtain. I am personally inclined to believe that the attack which actually took place was premature, and merely the unrehearsed action of a group of over-zealous tribesmen. Local gossip would indeed have it that Kawam’s salvation was due to his marriage connection with Soulet, but I think it hardly likely that such a consideration woxild counterbalance in the Kashgai chieftain’s mind the very real dangers of leaving one of the brothers at large. Moreover, within a few hours of the murder I received quite reliable news, telephoned by two “gholams” of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, to the effect that more than 600 Kashgais were in ambush on both sides of the road 4 miles beyond Khan-i-Zinian, at the same spot where the Russian consul-general was attacked in 1909. Meanwhile, the first news had reached Shiraz early in the afternoon. As soon as I was able to verify it I called on the Governor-General, having previouly asked the superintendent of the Telegraph Department to hold up any message regarding the assassination until I had reported what the Governor-General might have to say on the matter. My visit was not fruitful. Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who was very agitated, saying at first that the attack was possibly the work of Arab tribes attempting to release the Kawamis. I told him, in reply, that it was quite impossible to conceive the presence of Arab tribes in the middle of a valley at that moment occupied by some 15,000 to 20,000 Kashgais, and that I could not think of telegraphing such a story to you. He then said that he had, personally, little doubt that the murder had been arranged by Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Since the first news reaching me had stated that Kawam-ul-Mulk was supposed to be wounded, I offered the services of the medical officer to Nizam-es-Sidtaneh, who was sending out all the horsemen whom he could collect to the scene of the murder, ostensibly to investigate the facts. Dr. Woollatt left late in the afternoon accompanied by two sowars of the consulate escort. At nightfall, however, he met with some of Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s household, among them Ata-es-Sultaneh, who was returning severely wounded to town. He learned from these that Nasr-ed-Dowleh was dead, that the fateof Kawam-ul-Mulk was as yet -unkDOwn, and that the roads were infested by tribesmen. Seeing that thus, for the moment at least, there was nothing to be done, Dr. Woollatt very wisely returned to Shiraz. From the account of these survivors it appears that the party of Kashkulis, mentioned in Kawam-ul-Mulk’s account, waited on the river bank until Nasr-ed-Dowleh was within 20 yards, when they opened fire. He received two bullets through the head and one through the body, and died instantly. None of the guards fired a shot nor made any effort to interfere with the small attacking party, who severely beat Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s two stewards, Ati-i-Nizam and Ata-es-Sultaneh, and looted the entire baggage. The former of these, as soon as the aggressors had left, made for Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s garden, where he sought refuge with the Belgian gardener. After nightfall he was persuaded to leave, and reached comparative safety in Shiraz. The next morning I called on the Governor-General, and found him more confident than on the previous afternoon. He told me that he had heard that Sardar Assad was expressing righteous indignation at the murder, which he openly attributed to Nizam-es-Sultaneh himself, and that he would probably receive from the Persian Government as a peace offering the portfolio of the Interior. He went on to say that in such an event he would himself resign immediately, and that he had no doubt whatever but that Soulet-ed-Dowleh would give rein to his tribesmen in Pars and make a concerted movement on Tehran with the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh. He impressed upon me with some insistence that Sardar Assad’s appointment would incidentally provoke disorders in Pars which only foreign intervention could quell. In the course of the same morning Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s body was brought in. Contrary to general expectation it had escaped mutilation, and had even been cared for by the women of the Darashuh tribe. After Dr. Woollatt had examined the wounds, the body was buried with all ceremony in the family vault. ^ Among those Europeans who have known him Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s death will not pass unregretted. In all his dealings with them, at least, he invariably displayed a courage and frank open-handedness which, though reckoned as stupidity by his compatriots, seemed rather to indicate in him some almost Western appreciation of the exigencies of his family’s declining dignity. Thus, for instance, when any robbery could be brought home to his dependents or to the tribes under his control, he showed, in spite of his latterly very straitened means, no hesitation nor chicanery in the payment of ihe claim. There is, I am afraid, little doubt that, urged thereto by the yearly increasing depredations of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, he had been the leading spirit m most of those intrigues which have long fostered a general anarchy in lars. let this, in his case, in violent contrast to the sordid avarice of his rival, would seem to have been motived by nothing more than a natural impetuosity of character and a youthful revolt against the circumscription of his wide personal ambitions, though he leaves as yet no male heir, his wife is shortly expected to give birth to a child. Meanwhile, regarding Eawam-ul-Mulk s fate, nothing definite had yet tianspired. Shortly after midday, however, on the 7th May I was approached by his wife, who asked whether, m the event of his escape being cut off and his thus being obliged to return to Shiraz, I would give him asylum in the consulate. I replied that, as it would appear that his life was m imminent danger, he would be admitted. ^ Some hours latei he arrived in Shiraz and reached the consulate. In spite of his fatigue and emotion, coupled with a severe fever, he was able at once to vent his wrath with the Governor- General Immediately after Kawam-ul-Mulk’s arrival at His Majesty’s consulate I notified the Governor-General officially of his presence, stating ^ that after the murder of Nasr-ed-Dowdeh it appeared to me that Kawam-ul-Mulk’s life was in imminent danger, that I had consequently given him sanctuary, and that he would remain in the consulate until satisfactory assurances for his personal safety were forthcoming. Nizam-es-Sultaneh replied that there were 200 armed men in Kawam-ul-Mulk’s house who would probably create disorders in the town. I informed the Governor-General, in answer, that Kawam-ul-Mulk would instruct his wife to dismiss these men, who, according to my information, numbered about thirty, as soon as he had received full assurances tor the safety of the house and its inmates. At the same time I advised Nizam-es-Su tane i that he would be held personally responsible in the event of any danger to the lives or Earlv the next morning 1 called on Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who insisted stiongiy on the urgency of Kawam-ul-Mulk’s departure, and preferred some veiled menaces as to the danger of his remaining here for long. On this occasion, m fact, he had even gone to the length of asking me to come to the palace by a back entrance. He exposed tome the assurances which, he would propose to offer for Kawam-ul-Mulk’s safety, suggesting that Soulet-ed-Dowleh should he induced to give a bond in a considerable sum for his safe journey, and undertake responsibility for him as far as the borders of Kamarij territory, whence he himself would give the necessary guarantees up to Bushire. Kawam should further, he thought, be accompanied by two or three sowars of the consulate escort, and, on this occasion, he would send with him men from his own estates in place of Government troops. These proposals, though plausible enough, would not seem to offer any really reliable security. I told the Nizam, however, that I would at once communicate them to you. On his reverting to the urgency of a speedy solution in view of possible disorders, 1 again reminded him very seriously of his own responsibility in such an event. On the same afternoon the first of a series of demonstrations in the Anjuman took place. To give this agitation some life, 5,000 tomans were promised to the members of the Anjuman; any of the mullahs or merchants who could be induced to attend were, according to circumstances, either blackmailed or well paid ; the rank and file received 2 krans a-day. At this meeting very violent speeches were made denouncing the reputed British designs on Southern Persia, and urging the mob to attack the consulate and kill Kawam-ul-Mulk. After this demonstration Nizam-es-Sultaneh communicated privately to me a resolution passed by this rabble denouncing the asylum granted to Kawam-ul-Mulk as an unjustifiable interference in the internal affairs of Persia. I returned this document to Nizam-es-Sultaneh, requesting him that, if he wished to transmit anything of this nature to me, he w r ould do so officially. Meanwhile, a letter addressed to Kawam-ul-Mulk, in which he was assured that all his partisans were still faithful to him and would be ready to take up arms in his favour, had been sent open through me. I informed Kawam that I had received this, and warned him very gravely against embarking on any intrigue during his stay in His Majesty’s consulate ; at the same time I told him that all his correspondence must, in future, pass through my hands, and advised him to give word to his relations and friends that I was taking this precaution. I made, however, a reservation in favour of telegrams exchanged with the Regent, Premier, or Cabinet, only asking him, in order to avoid unnecessary friction, to dispatch these by the department office. About the same time, in accordance with instructions received from you, I notified Nizam-es-Sultaneh that in the event of any disorders necessitating inter vention in the interests of the lives and property of foreign subjects, his responsi bility to His Majesty’s Government would be personal and direct. Subsequently, on learning that “ tofangchis ” of Ali Akbar DehBozourgi, a bitter enemy of the Kawamis, had been placed on guard round the consulate, and having previously heard from several independent sources that Meghis-ed-Dowleh had offered a bribe of 2,000 tomans to any of these men who would enter the consulate and shoot Kawam-ul-Mulk, I informed the Governor-General privately that such news had reached me. At the same time 1 warned him officially that I could allow no one, under any circumstances, to enter the consulate grounds without my direct authorisation, and that, in the event of any infriugement of this, I should hold the Governor-General responsible for any untoward incident which might result. Nizam-es-Sultaneh has since stationed a number of his own men in the neighbourhood ; those of Ali Akbar, however, still remain. Such is the present unsatisfactory situation in Shiraz. The Governor-General has found many opportunities since the escape of Kawam-ul-Mulk to impress upon me that the townspeople may easily become out of control; that disorders, if they were to occur, w r ould be of such a nature that the Persian Government would be unable to quell them unaided, and other similar allusions. The threats of an attack on the consulate are, I think, almost negligible. Nevertheless, I am afraid it is impossible completely to dismiss the menace of some isolated attack on a European, by which one party or the other might seek to provoke intervention. In any case it would appear that for the moment the appointment of Sardar Assad or the dismissal of either Soulet-ed-Dowleh or Nizam-es-Sultaneh would in all probability lead to a most serious situation in Ears. Nizam-es-Sultaneh, if disavowed by the Central Government, would be forced to contemplate the near possibility of assassination either in Shiraz itself or on the road where he has left many redoubtable enemies. Moreover, if the Persian Government were to employ immediately any of these three methods of showing their indignation, Soulet-ed-Dowleh would, at the very least, resign his position of “ Protector of the Southern Roads ” and give his tribes the word to rob. Once, however, that Soulet-ed- Dowleh has left the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and, with his active brother, Zaigham- ed-Dowleh, undoubtedly making the most of this opportunity, his stay here cannot be eternal, things will certainly take a more favourable complexion.In the matter of the Kawam’s departure it is very difficult to see as yet any issue, since it would appear to me to he impossible that any guarantee could be accepted from him without encouraging him in the dangerous idea that these have forced our hand. Should, however, things remain in their present position until Soulet-ed-Dowleh has moved northwards, I do not think there would be any difficulty in the way of keeping Kawam here until the whole situation in the south has reshaped itself, as, in my opinion, it must shortly do after such an upheaval as has been caused bj- Nasr-ed- Dowields murder. I have no definite knowledge as yet regarding Soulet’s attitude, but I think there can be no doubt that his share in the present intrigues is at least as large, though probably not so spontaneous, as that of the Governor-General. I have, &amp;c. G. G. KNOX. No. 185. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 17.) Sir, Tehran, July 1, 1911. AS w r as perhaps to be expected, difficulties have arisen between Mr. Morgan Shuster, the American Treasurer-General, and M. Mornard, the Belgian Administrator- General of Customs. As reported in my despatch of the 13th ultimo, a Bill was drafted giving Mr. Shuster extensive powers, article 5 providing that without the Treasurer- General’s signature or sanction no Government expenditure was to be made. The Bill passed the Medjliss on the 13th ultimo, and on the 16th ultimo Mr. Shuster wrote to the Imperial Bank as follows :— “ Please take note that, in accordance with article 5 of the law voted by the Medjliss on the 13th June, 1911, no expenditure can be made by the Imperial Government without the signature or authorisation of the Treasurer-General . . . .” On the 21st ultimo two cheques drawn by M. Mornard on the customs account at the Imperial Bank for charges, I understand, which it has been customary for M. Mornard to meet from the customs revenue were presented at the bank for payment, but the bank, in accordance with Mr. Shuster’s instructions quoted above, refused to honour them, referring them to the Treasurer-General, who at once met the charges in question by cheques drawn by himself. M. Mornard wrote to the chief manager of the Imperial Bank, indignantly protesting against his action as illegal, to which Mr. Wood replied, quoting his instructions from the Treasurer-General. Meanwhile Mr. Shuster wrote to M. Mornard on the 21st June—the date on which M. Mornard’s cheques were dishonoured—drawing attention to the law defining the Treasurer-General’s powers, and stating that all the gross receipts of the customs and all balances at the Imperial Bank and the Russian Bank should be placed to his credit. At the same time he declared his readiness to pay the expenses of the customs establishment if M. Mornard would fill in certain forms giving the necessary particulars. M. Mornard replied in a letter containing little more than a mere acknowledgment, and has so far not acted as desired by Mr. Shuster. The question whether or not the customs administration is to be subordinate to the Treasurer-General is very acute at the moment of writing. The Belgian charge d’affaires states that in the contract of the Belgian Administrator-General it is expressly laid down that he is to be subject to the ordeis of the Giand Viziei and the Minister of Finance, and that this principle was confirmed by a note addressed by the Belgian Legation to the Persian Government at the time of M. Bizot’s appointment. On the other hand, Mr. Shuster is hardly likely to acquiesce in the exclusion of the customs administration from his control. Mr. Shuster and M. Mornard have not yet met, each maintaining that it is for the other to pay the first call. I understand that the Regent is endeavouring to arrange a meeting between them, when it is to be hoped that some modus vivendi will be found. I am holding aloof from the controversy, and shall continue to do so unless instructed to the contrary. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.94 No. 186. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 17.)

St- Petersburgh, July 19, 1911. CONVEYS substance of the following extract from a despatch dated the 24th July:— On the receipt of your telegram of the 18th instant, I called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and enquired whether, in view of the increasing gravity of the situation in Persia, the Imperial Government would join His Majesty’s Government in notifying the ex-Shah that under no circumstances could his return to Persia be allowed.96 M. Neratof interrupted me by saying that he bad that morning received a telegram from the Russian consul at Astrabad stating that the ex-Shah was reported to have landed at Gumesh Tepe with a few followers, and that His Majesty was preparing to march on Astrabad at the head of the tribes who had joined his standard. In reply to my enquiry as to how His Majesty had contrived to get to Gumesh Tepe, and whether he had passed through Baku with the persons supposed to be his emissaries, who had been temporarily detained by the Russian authorities, his Excellency said that he was entirely without information on the subject. He had caused enquiries to be made respecting the individuals, to whom I had alluded, but had been informed that no one had recently arrived at Baku, whose appearance had given the authorities any grounds for suspicion. I then proceeded to say that as the ex-Shah had left Persia under British and Russian protection, and as both Governments had recognised his son, you did not see how we could acquiesce in the return of the former, and I should, therefore, like to know whether his Excellency thought that it would still be advisable for us to make a communication to His Majesty of a somewhat similar character to that which you had proposed, or whether he had any other suggestion to make. His Excellency replied that, were the ex-Shah still in Europe, he would willingly join in addressing such a warning to His Majesty, but now that he had landed in Persia, we were in the presence ot an entirely new situation. His Majesty, by landing at Gumesh Tepe, had burnt his boats, and must pursue his enterprise to the bitter end. It was useless, therefore, for us to make any communication to him, as he would certainly pay no attention to anything we might say. It was perfectly true that we had recognised the present Shah, but this fact did not justify our intervening in the internal affairs of Persia any more than the fact that we had recognised the ex-Shah would have justified our inter vening to prevent his deposition.

SHIRAZ’ Acting consul reports more serious fighting Monday night and an abortive attack on Kawam’s house. Rebels have asked acting consul to give them bast. With my approval he has declined. Acting consul has urged moderation on Governor-General, who has replied that98 kind of intervention, while the “ Novoe Yremya’ , only advocates it in the event of the lives of Russian subjects being in danger. On the other hand, the Nationalist organ, the “ Sviet,” warmly welcomes Mohamed All’s return, and strongly protests against the idea of an intervention against him. The reactionary press adopts a somewhat similar attitude. It is, I think, generally felt that, as Russia abstained from intervening in order to maintain Mohamed Ali on the throne, she cannot now be expected to intervene in support of a Government which has never shown her any friendly disposition, and which has utterly failed to maintain order in the country. I would only add that the suspicions which have been cast on Russia by certain organs of the British press of having been privy to the return of the ex-Shah have made a bad impression here, and are, I believe, entirely unfounded. Whatever negligence may have been shown by the local authorities at Baku m allowing Mohamed Ali to pass unhindered, and with whatever feelings Russian public opinion may view his possible re-establishment on the throne, the news of his landing in Persia came as a complete surprise to the central Government. M. Neratof would, I am convinced, have loyally supported His Majesty’s Government in conveying the suggested warning to His Majesty, and would, moreover, have taken precautionary measures to prevent his passage through Russian territory had not the secrecy and the swiftness with which Mohamed Ali planned and carried out his return placed the Russian Government in presence of an accomplished fact.

It seems quite possible that Persian Government will desire to dismiss Nizam-es- Sultaneh from Governorship-General of Pars with a view to gaining over Bakhtiari at this critical moment. If such a step is contemplated I would not propose to oppose it. Mr. Knox does not consider that the situation in Shiraz would he adversely affected by the removal of the Nizam. Furthermore, an increase of security might be looked for on the Bakhtiari road, since the restoration to the Bakhtiari of Behbehan, governor of which can control the Kuhgeluis, would presumably be a concomitant of Nizam’s removal.

(Translation.) AS in view of the emergencies of the occasion the Council of Ministers deem the proclamation of martial law necessary, they put before the Medjliss the following articles, and demand their immediate approval: — Article 1. From the time that martial law is proclaimed, affairs which concern public security and tranquillity shall, with the approval of the Council of Ministers, be carried out through the Ministry of War. Art. 2. Temporary courts-martial must be instituted, so that they should promptly and with severity investigate offences and steps which are contrary to public security and tranquillity. Art. 3. All the judges of the courts-martial must be military men. Art. 4. Persons who take active steps against the constitutional Government and the public security and tranquillity, and whose guilt is proved, will be sentenced to death. Art. 5. The executive power has the right to arrest persons who may be suspected of being opposed to the constitutional Government and public security and order, and (such persons) having been arrested, their trial will then be held. If in the trial the suspicion (entertained) should not be totally cleared, the suspected persons will remain under arrest, and after the expiration of martial law will be surrendered to the Ministry of Justice. Art. 6. Should the members of the courts-martial think it desirable to lessen the punishment of a culprit, they will have the right to request this from the Regent through the responsible Ministers ; and excepting the said members no one whatever has the right of such intercession. Art. 7. In the event of suspicion the representatives of the Government charged with the maintenance of order in the town have the right of entrance and investigation into the houses. In the event of opposition and resistance, they can enter by force, and those showing opposition and resistance will be forcibly arrested, and in accordance with the order of the court-martial will be severely punished. Art. 8. If the newspapers and (any) publications should publish allegations against the actions of the Government they will be suppressed, and their offices will be closed.

Art. 9. Punishments affecting employes of the Government and those who have been directing the affairs will not be commuted. Art. 10. All gatherings and associations (of people) must be postponed and discontinued while martial law is in force. If a gathering is convoked it must ns«i H 3immediately, on the first warning of the police, disperse, and in the event of opposition or resistance those guilty of such will be made to appear before a court-martial and will be sentenced to punishment. If a part or the whole body of such gatherings is armed, those armed must be arrested at the time of warning and punished in accordance with the sentence of the court-martial. Art. 11. The carrying of arms of any kind is strictly forbidden to all except the representatives of the Government who are charged with the maintenance of public order and security. In the event of any other person except representatives of the Government being seen carrying arms the latter will be confiscated by the Government, and the bearer of such arms Avill be punished in accordance with the order of the court-martial. Art. 12. Government representatives who divulge the contents of Government telegrams and despatches will be made to appear before a court-martial and will be rigorously punished. Art. 13. The proclamation of martial law will be made in those parts of the country where the Government may think it to be needed. Enclosure 3 in No. 210. Sir G. Barclay to Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh.

Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, July 22, 1911. THE Persian Minister called this morning, and read to Sir A. Nicolson the draft of a protest which he was instructed to make with regard to the return of the ex-Shah. Sir A. Nicolson told Mehdi Khan that if he would kindly send in the protest a reply would be given to him. lire Minister then asked whether His Majesty’s Government would be disposed to intervene morally by informing the ex-Shah and Salar-ed-Dowleh that they would not be recognised, even should they succeed. Such “ moral ” disapproval would have a great effect in discouraging both those perturbers of the peace. Sir A. Nicolson told Mehdi Khan that he would, of course, report his suggestion to me, but that personally he considered that such messages from His Majesty’s Government would have little effect; that they could not be given without the concurrence of the Russian Government, and that they would, in fact, constitute intervention. He need not, he said, assure the Minister that His Majesty’s Government deeply deplored the prospect of renewed civil strife in Persia, and that they hadsincerely desired that the Regent shonld have been able to continue the excellent work in which he was engaged undisturbed and in peace. Either the movement, which His Majesty’s Government could not view with favour, would fail, owing to lack of popular support, or it would succeed, being backed by popular feeling. In all revolutions Great Britain always abstained from any interference so long as British lives and interests w T ere not in imminent danger. She had done so recently in Persia, and Sir A. Nicolson imagined she would do so now. This was his personal opinion, and he would report to me what had been said. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 213. Sir G.

Note reminds me of the Persian Government’s complaints respecting His Majesty’s intrigues, complains that I took no steps to comply with the Persian Government’s request that Sardar Arshad might be stopped at Baku from entering Persia, and attributes the ex Shah’s return to my indifference to the Persian Government’s representations. Article 11 of the protocol and the friendly relations of the two Powders entitled the Persian Government to expect that His Majesty’s Government would take the necessaiy steps to prevent His Majesty and his agents from fomenting agitation in the country, recent proceedings of Salar-ed-Dowleh and of Mu j allal-es - Sultan culminating in His Majesty’s return. Note draws special attention to the explicit Russian promise in article 11 of the protocol, and announces that that article and article 10 will be executed as regards treatment of basti and His Majesty’s pension. Note declines responsibility for damages consequent on His Majesty’s return from Russia on a Russian ship, and says that the Persian Government are taking the most energetic and effective steps to suppress disorders, which a more prompt intervention by His Majesty s Government would have rendered impossible, and they are confident of success. In conclusion, the Persian Government expresses confidence that in the exceptional circumstances His Majesty’s Government will lend them the necessary moral support to stop agitation in Persia caused by the adventurous ex-Shah and the filibusterers with Greater part of the note concerns the Russian Government exclusively, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has spontaneously admitted this to me, adding apologeti cally that he had felt compelled to send it to me as I was a party to the protocol, 1 am therefore not disposed to send any reply.

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received July 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, July 24, 1911. RETURN of ex-Shah. It is evident from reports received from His Majesty’s consuls that in a number of the bigger towns there exists a decided feeling in favour of Mohamed Ali Mirza. Such feeling seems to be more due to despondency at the failure of the present regime to preserve order than to any faith in the ex-Shah. It is hard as yet to estimate the power of the revolutionary movement in Tehran. Several people have been arrested. ACHING consul Shnaz leports that desultory firing continues. Number of killed is said to be thirty-six on side of Governor-General. Kashgais are arriving in increasing numbers, and continuing devastation in neighbourhood. They appear to be out of hand ; some forced entry into garden of Zieglers’ manager vesterday. Acting consul is sending with my authorisation strong warning to Soidet. I have the honour to report that, on receiving your telegram of the 22nd instant, 1 called on the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and informed him t lat, while agreeing with him as to the advisability of refraining from an armed intervention in Peisia, you considered that both Russia and England had assumed a certain degree of responsibility towards the present regime. Russia more especially had under the protocol of ^ the 25th August, 1909, engaged to take all necessary measures to prevent any political intrigues on the part of the ex-Shah, who was to . a e ^jP his residence on her territory, and it was therefore, in your opinion, incumbent on us to make it perfectly clear that we strongly disapproved his present attempt to regain his throne. We owed this to the Regent and to the Persian overmnent, and I suggested that we might accomplish this object by assuring them ol our full sympathy and moral support. M. Neratof replied that this would be going further than the Imperial Government was prepare! to go, as they could not depart from an attitude of strict non-intervention in the internal affairs of Persia. This was the attitude which thev had adopted at the time ot the ex-bhah s deposition. In their desire to meet the wishes of His Majesty’s Government and to act m close accord with them they had refrained from using their m uenee to keep Mohamed Ali on the throne, and they had even to a certain extent favoured the establishment of the new constitutional regime. This attitude had exposed them to the reproach of having subordinated the interests of Russia to those ot ngland. It they were now to openly side with the exist!no- Gm,wnmpnt in thn No. 216. Sir G.

Sir,impending conflict they would be reversing their former policy of non-interference, and would be severely taken to task by public opinion in this country. I observed that it seemed to me that, in giving their moral support to the Regent and his Government, they would be but continuing the policy which they had inaugurated when they consented to the deposition of Mohamed Ali, and would be supporting a Government which they had helped to establish. M. Neratof replied that they had equally recognised and supported Mohamed Ali so long as he occupied the throne, but that they had taken no steps whatever to maintain him in its possession. I then called his Excellency’s attention to the telegrams from Tehran which had appeared in the “ Times ” and in other British and foreign papers, and said that it seemed that the impression existed in Persia that the Imperial Government could not have been ignorant of the ex-Shah’s intentions, and that His Majesty could not have passed over Russian territory and crossed the Caspian on a Russian steamer without the knowledge and connivance of the Imperial Government. It had also, I said, been stated that in Russian circles at Tehran satisfaction had been openly expressed at the prospect of the ex-Shah’s restoration. Knowing as I did how entirely the Imperial Government had been taken by surprise by Mohamed All’s sudden return, I regretted very much that such erroneous reports should have found circulation in the British press, but I thought that it was most important that his Excellency should do something to dissipate the false impressions which were evidently entertained at Tehran of the views and attitude of the Russian Government. I should have thought, I said, that it would be easy to instruct M. Poklewsky to give such assurances to the Persian Government as would leave them in no doubt as to the sentiments of the Imperial Government. His Excellency said that it was quite possible that individual Russians at Tehran might have used the language attributed to them ; but the Persian Government knew perfectly well that the Russian Government had repeatedly warned Mohamed Ali against engaging in intrigues against them, and that they had been on the point of addressing a further serious warning to him, conjointly with His Majesty’s Govern ment, on the very eve of his unexpected departure. He could throw no light whatever on the question of how Mohamed Ali had eluded the vigilance of the Russian authorities, as the whole thing was a mystery to him. The Russian Government had, his Excellency declared, already given ample proof that they had nothing whatever to do with His Majesty’s return. They had published a statement which ought to have made it clear to everybody that they had been taken completely by surprise. They had instructed their consuls in Persia to observe an attitude of strict neutrality between the contending parties, and were adhering to a policy of non-intervention. More they could not do. I might, however, his Excellency said, assure you that he was no partisan of the ex-Shah, that he thought that it was very doubtful whether Mohamed Ali would ever reach Tehrau, and that, if he did f he would probably be assassinated before many months had elapsed. He had no desire to see a reversal of the present regime, and he would prefer to see it maintained. It was, however, quite another thing to make a demonstration in its favour. I have, &amp;c.

FROM what I can learn I believe the feeling in Tehran to be strongly opposed to Mohamed Ali Mirza. I am disposed to explain resignation of the Sipahdar more than anything else by the fact that he knew that there was a widespread feeling of indignation against him on account of his alleged inaction in connection with the preparations for resisting His Majesty.

An inspector of posts and telegraphs A chief mechanician A postmaster-general for the south A postmaster-general for Azerbaijan &gt;At 9,000 fr. a year each.

I HAVE the honour to state that the semi-official “Rossia” of the 22nd instant published a leading article on events in Persia, of which the following is a summary:— Much has appeared of late, both in Russian and foreign papers, with reference to the sudden entry into Persia of the ex-Shah, who since .1909 has resided, with the sanction of the Russian Government, in Odessa. Information obtained from a reliable source shows that the ex-Shah resided continuously in Odessa up to the'end of October107 1910, when he went abroad for a cure. He returned to Odessa on the 6th (19th) April of the present year, and, after a short stay, left on the 28th May (10th June), accom panied by his wife and children and two or three persons of his suite, with the intention of proceeding to Carlsbad. Of his further movements the Russian Govern ment has received no information from any source, and his sudden appearance in Persia came as a complete surprise to the Imperial Government. It is evident that His Majesty travelled through Russia incognito, and under a false passport. During his residence at Odessa and abroad there were repeated rumours of intrigues which he was alleged to be conducting in Persia, and the Persian Government notified the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs to this effect, without, however, producing any real evidence of the truth of the rumours in question. Never theless, the Russian Government repeatedly and most seriously drew the attention of Mohamed Ali to the necessity of abstaining from any kind of agitation; and quite recently, in view of the disorders which have arisen in Persia and the discovery of a movement in favour of the ex-Shah, it was intended, in agreement with the British Government, once more to warn His Majesty against taking part in a struggle with the present Persian Government. The proposed step could not, however, be carried out owing to the unexpected departure of Mohamed Ali from Vienna. I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 224. Sir G.

I agreed that it was undesirable that he should take part in any military operations in Persia, or that any European officers should do so. But the officers who were in command of Persian gendarmerie would no doubt take part in operations against the robbers on the southern roads, and it was a little difficult to know where to draw the line.

Count Benckendorff said that M.

Ihe salaries of the four new men are to be as follows :— An auditor to replace Mr. Hills, 4,000 dollars. An assistant to Mr. Shuster, 3,500 dollars. A clerk to Mr. Shuster, 1,800 dollars. A clerk to Mr. Shuster, 1,600 dollars. There are at present four American financial experts at Tehran, namely :— Mr. W. Morgan Shuster, the Treasurer-General, at 2,000b a-year. Mr. F. C.

Slr ’ rxr j - . Tehran, July 10, 1911. irs my despatch of the 1st instant, respecting the conflict between Mr. Shuster, tie Ameiican Treasurer-General, and M. Mornard, the Belgian Administrator- General of the Customs, I reported^ that Mr. Shuster had written to M. Mornard drawing his attention to the law defining the Treasurer-General’s powers and statingthat all the gross receipts of the 1 Customs and all balances at the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Russian Bank should be placed to his (the Treasurer-General’s) credit. On the 30th ultimo, as M. Mornard had paid no heed to the Treasurer-General’s instructions, the Council of Ministers passed a resolution approving Mr. Shuster’s letter to M. Mornard, and decided to direct the latter to obey the law in question, and these directions were communicated to M. Mornard by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 5th instant. In the meantime M. Mornard continued to draw cheques on the Customs acccount at the Imperial Bank. Matters have since taken a more favourable turn. On the 7th instant the Minister for Foreign Affairs invited Mr. Shuster to be present at a Cabinet meeting on the following day ; but, hearing that it was intended to confront him with M. Mornard, Mr. Shuster replied to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would not attend, as he could not discuss the position with a functionary who openly defied the recent law. The Minister for Foreign Affairs repeated his invitation, stating that there was no question of M. Mornard’s disobeying the law, and that there was no reason for any discussion. On this assurance, Mr. Shuster attended the meeting. M. Mornard was also present; the Minister for Foreign Affairs introduced the two gentlemen, who, after some talk together, parted apparently the best of friends, and each one has since expressed himself satisfied with the result. I trust, therefore, that the matter may be considered closed. I enclose herewith copies of the Minister for Foreign Affairs’ note to M. Mornard of the 5th July referred to above. I also enclose a copy of the assurances given by Mr. Shuster to the Imperial Bank as reported in my telegram of the 5th July ; the assurances given to the Russian Bank are similar to these.

HASSAN, Enclosure 2 in No. 238. Mr, Shuster to Imperial Bank of Persia. Dear Sir, ^ July 4, 1911. REFERRING to our previous conversations concerning the method of treating the banking accounts of the Imperial Government, under the law of the Medjliss of the 23rd Djouza, 1329, I have the honour to confirm my statements to the following effect :— The gross customs receipts of the southern ports will be deposited with the Imperial Bank to the credit of the Treasurer-General, and will be carried on my books intact, and until all liens or obligations now constituting a charge upon them shall have been fully paid, no cheques will be drawn against these revenues except for actual and necessary expenses of the Customs Administration, as provided for in the recent loan contract. In the same manner the gross customs receipts of the north will be deposited to my credit with the Banque d’Escompte de Perse, and will be carried intact on my books until all liens or obligations now constituting a charge upon them shall have been fully paid and satisfied. It is not my intention to in any manner mingle these special revenues with the general unhypothecated funds of the Imperial Government, but, on the contrary, carefully to maintain and preserve them as special security for the payment of the liens and charges which have been placed upon them. I have been, and am, both ready and anxious to have all interested parties, such as yourself, fully assured as to the integrity of the guarantees and security which the Imperial Government has pledged on various accounts, and it will be my purpose to see not only that such security is properly maintained and that all payments due shall be punctually made, but, in addition, that all the financial affairs of the Imperial Govern ment shall be so conducted as to increase these guarantees in common with the general credit of the Empire. I shall be most happy at any time to have you, or others similarly interested, send a representative to examine my books and the accounting methods by which the financial affairs of the Government will be conducted. MORGAN SHUSTER. No. 239. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received Jidy 31.) ^ Tehran, July \l, l§ll. MR. MORGAN SHUSTER has now been two months in Tehran, and his influence is already a leading factor in the situation. The Medjliss, for the moment at least, is entirely at his command, and proposals from him have only to be made to be accepted with practical unanimity. One must admire the pluck and energy with which he has at once thrown himself into the struggle foi reform, but at the same time one cannot have but some misgivings as to the results of his headlong progress. On the only occasion on which I have met Mr. Shuster he emphasised the purely financial character of the work before him, and said that he was no politician. If he meaus by this merely that he will refrain from meddling in politics one can only applaud his resolve, but the apparently light-hearted way in which he embarked on a conflict with the Belgian Customs Administration, and followed this up with the offer of the Treasury gendarmerie appointment to Major Stokes, in both of which steps he u as exposing himself to opposition from Russia, would seem to give his disclaimer ofthe politician’s r61e a more ominous significance, and point to its denoting a disregard of political considerations which it would be wiser to take into account. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 240. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 31.) Sir, Tehran, July 11, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 8th ultimo respecting the state of security prevailing on the main southern road, I have the honour to report that the locality of Kamarij described as dangerous in my last report became no longer so after the 9th June owing to the fact that Mollah Khurshid, the ex-khan, succeeded in reinstating himself at Kamarij. He accordingly abandoned his predatory intentions and gave strictest orders to his dependents not to interfere in any way with posts or caravans. The Governor-General had intended to eject Mollah Kliurshid again from Kamarij, but at the last moment, having no Kashgais to rely upon, his Excellency thought it more prudent to recognise Mollah Khurshid in his khanship. Also, the Governor-General’s own nominee appears on the 7th June to have robbed four bales of piece-goods belonging to Messrs. Livingstone, and thus the restoration of Mollah Khurshid is doubly a cause for satisfaction. Reports from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan for the weeks ended the 17th and 24th June and the 1st July show that the traffic between Shiraz and Ispahan is increasing gradually. Confidence is returning, and owing to the indefinite delays on the Bakhtiari road merchants are preferring to take the risks of the southern road. These delays are caused by the scarcity of transport animals. Some 6,000 animals are being sought for from Ahwaz to endeavour to cope with the large increase in the traffic by this route, and to replace the gaps caused by the needs of the Bakhtiaris themselves for the purpose of their internecine struggles. Acts of robbery on the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road were as follows :— On the 9th June four loads of piece-goods and one of opium about 20 miles north of Kazerun. Seven donkeys with loads mostly loaf sugar were carried off near Sivend Bridge on the 14th June, and a local caravan in the same locality was attacked on the 24th. On the same day a caravan was robbed 8 miles outside Shiraz. Sowars sent out by the Governor-General exchanged shots with the robbers and recovered part of the loot. A telegram from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan dated the 6th July stated that Messrs. Dixon reported that their caravan had been detained at a place about 30 miles south of Ispahan owing to the presence of robbers on the road. On the 5th and 6th July large caravans containing local produce were robbed in the immediate neighbourhood of Shiraz. The Nizam sent out sowars who were driven back, their commander being severely wounded and one or two men killed. On the 6th July seven mules and loads were carried off by mounted men near Kumisheh. I have not failed to bring the more important of these incidents to the notice of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who gives me the usual promise that the necessary measures will be taken. It is, however, evident, I fear, that Nizam’s authority both within and without Shiraz is weakening. The road between Ispahan and Tehran is still very insecure in the localities beyond the province of Ispahan, where the jurisdiction seems to be doubtful. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 241. Sir G.

The local authorities were inactive owing to lack of money, energy, and, above all, the moral support of the central Government. From other sources it is reported that Mujallal-es-Sultan, a confidential servant of the ex-Shah, who accompanied him into exile, is now with the Shahsevans. There are now 1,800 Russian troops at Ardebil, the troops forming the punitive expedition near Astara having joined the troops already at Ardebil. Ala-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General- Elect of Azerbaijan, is still at Tehran, apparently reluctant to proceed to Tabreez. Pesht. The Shahsevans and the people of Talish have combined and driven the governor out of lalish, disarming 100 ol his troops. Sardar-i-Afgham has been appointed Governor of Astarabad, vice Zaffer-es-Sultaneh. The Turkomans continue their depredations, and nothing seems to be done by the local or central authorities. They recently robbed the Shahrud post, carrying off 140Z. and the post-boy. They have killed foui and wounded six villagers; the villagers have killed four Turkomans. . . Sipahdar, the Prime Minister, arrived at Pesht in the middle of June and was joined there by Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan. He returned to Tehran early in July. Meshed. Nayer-ed-Dowleh has been appointed Governor-General of Khorassan, but is still at iehran, apparently reluctant to take up his duties. The state of the province, which was going from bad^ to worse under Sahib Ikhtiar, has improved somewhat. The outlaw, Mohamed Ali. of Nishapur, has been surrounded and killed by the force sent agonist him. Peshid-es-Sultan, who collected a force of 300 men, seized the telegraph office at Sabzawar and plundered the neighbourhood, has been defeated between Damghan and Shahrud by Government troops, losing twelve men. He is believed to have fled to Mazanderan. Seistan. The general condition of the province remains unchanged. The roads are said to x generally unsafe, aiM large consignments of goods are lying at Kuh-i-Malik Siah awaiting a safe opportunity for dispatch northwards. Further serious raids by Baluchis were reported from the southern part of the Kainat, near Neh, on the 7th July. On f ie same day a riot occurred at Birjand between the governor’s men and some villagers town from fear of Baluchi raiders. Two men were killed who had taken refuge in the | J 1 * 1 T a i i a; ix • JL VV v.' J 11 v_/1.1 VY A J and over thirty wounded. The riot was instigated by Hashmat-ul-Mulk’s faction.Ispahan. The general condition of the province remains unchanged. In Ispahan itself the clergy are conducting a revivalist movement which began with an alleged miracle at a shrine. Their object is to recover their lost ascendency over the public, and they appear to have had considerable success with the lower orders. The Yezd and Sultanabad roads appear to have remained safe. Robbers still frequent the Tehran road between Ispahan and Kashan. The post was robbed near Khafr on the 16th June, and ten mules with their loads were carried off between Tarkh and Natanzon the 4th July.^ The caravan road over the Kohrud pass was reported to be held by Nazar Bakhtiaris, who had killed one road guard and wounded two others ; 200 mules were detained at Kohrud. There is no further news of fighting between the Chaharlang and the Haftlang Bakhtiaris, and nothing tangible has resulted from the recent disorders. The Haftlangs state that the Ohaharlangs have submitted. Kum. On the 5th July a caravan was robbed on the Sultanabad road near Kum. There are no road guards, and the governor is unable to get funds from Tehran to enlist any. The post was robbed at Dehnar on the Kashan road on the 30th June by six mounted Bakhtiaris. Yezd. Fakhr-ul-Mulk, the new governor, arrived on the 30th May. He has not so far given proofs of possessing any capacity for his work. Robberies were reported early in June on the Nain—Ardistan, Yedz-Meshed, and Yedz—Fars roads. The governor is endeavouring to get control of the road guards, but this is attributed to his desire to handle more funds. Luristan. The governor, who has several hundred Bakhtiari horsemen with him, appears to have succeeded after some fighting with the Lurs in asserting his authority, and reinforcements he had summoned have been countermanded. Kerman. The expedition sent by the Governor-General to restore order in Baluchistan returned to Kerman on the 12th June, having failed to effect anything. The troops besieged Bahrain Khan in Fahraj fort for some time, but the arrival of Said Khan and some Mekran chiefs with 1,000 men caused them to raise the siege and return to Kerman. Such prestige as the Persian Government possessed in Baluchistan has suffered a severe blow by the failure of the expedition. Sardar-i-Mohiy, of Resht, who was implicated in the disturbances at Tehran last year, has been appointed Governor-Genera] of Kerman. Kermanshah. A reactionary emissary, Ali Kuli Khan, was arrested recently at Kermanshah. He has been sent to Tehran. Daoud Khan, Kalhur, attacked Samsam-ul-Mamalek, Sinjabi, but the latter’s men held out successfully in two forts, and Daoud Khan’s men sustained 100 casualties. After devastating a tract of country 15 miles square, Daoud Khan sent an emissary to the Sinjabis, and peace was arranged, the two chiefs meeting to confirm it. Daoud Khan has promised to give Samsam-ul-Mamalek the governorship of Kasr-i-Shirin later on. Early in June, Asker Selim, a faction leader, was murdered by Akber Khan, brother of the late Muin-ur-Raya, and his men. This led to a critical situation in Kermanshah, one faction assembling to attack the other. The acting governor, however, succeeded in maintaining order for the moment, and the bazaars, after being closed for three days, were reopened. The situation continued unsettled and several murders were committed. On the 6th July, an attempt was made to murder Seyyid Akber Shah, a priest, and several people were wounded. On the 8th the bazaars were again closed. [188] I 2116 A mob plundered and burnt the offices of the police, justice, opium, and telephone administrations. The inhabitants telegraphed to Tehran that if nothing was done they would invade one of the consulates to compel intervention. Meanwhile, Lurs were raiding the environs, and the Sultanabad and Mahidasht roads were unsafe. The road guards were reported to be making heavy exactions on all caravans. The new governor is on his way to Kermanshah with troops. Shiraz. The incident caused by Persian soldiers attempting to take refuge in His Majesty’s consulate ended in the Governor-General disarming and sending to their homes the entire regiment to which the men belonged. Persian Gulf. Bunder Abbas. At the end of May the roads to Kerman were reported safe, but the road to Lar was unsafe near Lar. Ahwaz. His Majesty’s consul reported on the 28th June that he heard on good authority that the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh had been deposed by his son, Amanullah Khan, and imprisoned at Dehbala.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 31.) Sir, Tehran, July 12, 1911. SIPAHDAR returned to Tehran from Resht last Sunday, but the crisis provoked by his abrupt departure on the 15th ultimo is not yet ended. On the 10th instant, the Regent saw the deputies of the majority and of the Opposition. He begged them to sink their differences. The majority said they wished for Sipahdar ^ as Prime Minister. His Highness asked them to choose a Cabinet, but found the majority totally unable to agree as to its composition. They finally asked his Highness to choose it for them, but this he declined to do. Yesterday the Ministers tendered their resignation. The departure of Sipahdar from Resht relieved the friends of the present regime of some anxiety, as it was felt that while in Resht, where his properties in the district give him great influence, he might be led by his resentment against the Medjliss to provoke trouble in the interest of reaction. The prolonged Cabinet crisis and the continued failure of the Government to assert its authority in the provinces have been all in favour of a reactionary movement, and there has recently been much talk of,a d some evidence of, activity amongst Mohamed Ali’s friends. It appears that recently the police discovered a secret reactionary society in Tehran, styled the “ Islamic Union.” They raided its head-qnarters and found a register of some 2,000 names,^ many of them those of well-known persons. Mujallal-es-Sultan, the great favourite of the ex-Shah, who went into exile with His Majesty, is reported to have returned to Persia, and to be now with the rebellious Shahsevans, to whom he has delivered letters from Mohamed Ali Shah. It is possible that Mujallal-es-Sultan’s mission may be connected with the proceedings of Salar-ed-Dowleh, the ex-Shah’s brother, who, as will be observed from the monthly summaries, has been seeking to provoke a rising in Kurdistan. In the circumstances, it is decidedly comforting to both Moderates and Democrats to have got Siphadar back in the capital, where they have a better hold on him. I have, &amp;c. U. BARCLAYo No. 244. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 31.) Sir, July 24, 1911. I AM instructed by my Government to draw the attention of His Britannic Majesty’s Government to the arrival at Gumush-Tappe, in Persian territory, of Mohamed Ali Mirza, the ex-Shah of Persia. I am to refer your Excellency to the events which took place in the summer of 1909, and which resulted in the ex-Shah’s taking refuge at the Russian Legation, and the drawing up of the protocol which was signed by Sir G. Barclay and the Russian representative on the 25th August of that year (i909). My Government thinks it hardly necessary to remind your Excellency of the various articles of this protocol. But they wish to draw your particular attention to article 11, by which His Britannic Majesty’s and the Russian Governments undertook to give serious injunctions to the ex-Shah to abstain, once for all, from any political agitation against Persia. The Imperial Russian Government, on the other hand, undertook in this protocol to “ take effective measures ” in order not to allow the ex-Shah to carry on any such agitation. I am to remind His Britannic Majesty’s Government of the repeated representations made during the past year by the Persian Government, both to them and to the Imperial Russian Government, regarding the movements of the ex-Shah and of the agitations carried on by him against the present regime. My Government deeply regret that all their representations were received coldly, and no step whatever was taken by His Britannic Majesty’s nor the Russian Government to assist them to put a stop to these agitations. Within the last month or so the attention of your Excellency’s Government and that of the Imperial Russian Government was drawn to the increased activity of Mohamed Ali Mirza and to the arrival of his emissaries in Persia via Russia. Again nothing was done. The result is that Mohamed Ali Mirza himself arrived in a Russian boat in Persia on the 19th instant. In view of the above facts, my Government desire me to protest to His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and to say that, in accordance with the protocol referred to above, they have stopped the pension of Mohamed Ali Mirza, and the responsibility for any loss or injury that may be caused in consequence of what has happened must rest with the two Governments. I am further directed to say that in consequence of what has happened article 10 of the protocol (which deals with the question of certain “ bastis ” refugees, who at the time of the drawing up of the protocol were at the Russian Legation, vide article 9 of the protocol) will, ipso facto, come into force.

A similar communication, mutatis mutandis, was made by my Russian colleague on the same day.

On the other hand, the British Government consider that, the ex-Shah being in Persian territory, the British Government cannot interfere.

Barclay. (Telegraphic.) _ _ Foreign Office, August 1, 1911. YOU should inform the Persian Government that Major Stokes has been required to resign his commission before taking up his appointment under the Treasurer- General. This appointment has been made irrespective of His Majesty’s Government, who would have preferred to have been first consulted in the matter. It should be pointed out to the Persian Government that the employment of Major Stokes in military service in any active operations in the north of Persia may involve political con siderations, and that His Majesty’s Government cannot deprecate objections that may be taken to it. No. 250. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Foreign Office, August 1, 1911. THE Persian Minister left with Sir A. Nicolson on the 25th ultimo a note, copy of which is enclosed herewith,* and again urged that His Majesty’s Government should accord at least their moral support to the Persian Government in connection with the return of the ex-Shah. He was told that His Majesty’s Government deplored the revival of civil war in Persia, but that Sir A. Nicolson did not see how they could effectively intervene, or indeed that they had any right to do so. Sir A. Nicolson added that His Majesty’s Government were in communication with the Russian Government on the situation. Mehdi Khan argued that as the ex-Shah had taken refuge in Russian territory and had escaped from there, and as Great Britain and Russia had both signed the protocol of 1909, they were both morally bound to dissuade him from fomenting disorders. The two Powers might, in my opinion, have done this when the ex-Shah was in Russian territory, but now that he is in Persia at the head of his followers dissuasion is not of much use. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY. No. 251. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 2.) THE Persian Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to refer his Excellency to the communications he has recently made to the Foreign Office, both verbally and in writing, regarding the return to Persia of the ex-Shah. The Minister has again received instructions from his Government to repeat to Sir Edward Grey that they fully depend on His Britannic Majesty’s Government to see to the carrying out in full of the provisions of article 11 of the protocol of the 25th August, 1909, which, among other things, stated that the representatives of Great Britain and Russia bind themselves to gi\e seiious injunctions ” to Mohammed Ali Mirza to abstain for ever from carrying on any political agitation against Persia, and the Russian Government expressly promised to take u effective measures ” not to allow such political agitation on the part of Mohammed All Mirza. The Persian Minister, in his previous communications, referred in detail to what has taken place and to the attitude his Government maintain. Sir Edward Grey has learnt that the ex-Shah has passed through Russia and has arrived m Persia m a Russian boat in spite of the repeated warnings which the Persian Government gave to the Imperial Russian Government, both of the increased activity of the ex-bHali and of the arrival of his emissaries in Persia. These facts were also made known to His Britannic Majesty’s Government both through Sir George Barclay and through the Persian Minister in London. The Russian Government paid no attention to the120 warnings and tlie representations of the Persian Government. On the contrary, the actions of the Russian authorities tend to encourage the movements of^ the ex-Shah. Instead of detaining the partisans and the emissaries of the ex-Shah while in Russian territory, as had been requested by the Persian Government, they release them forcibly after they have arrived in Persia and have been arrested by the Persian authorities. The Persian Minister is sending enclosed to Sir Edward Grey translations of telegrams received from his Government. The telegrams to which the Persian Minister has referred—first, the case of Rashid-ul-Mulk at Tabreez ; second, the attitude of the Russian consul-general in Guilan ; third, the behaviour of Russian troops in Tabreez ; and fourth, the message sent to the deputy governor and the chief of the police of Ardebil by the Russian vice-consul in that town—all these prove what an astonishing degree Russian interference in Persia has reached. It goes without saying that these acts encourage the rebels and weaken the hands of the Persian Government. With all these facts before them, is it possible for the Persian Government to dissuade the people from believing that the political agitations now carried on in Persia have not the sympathy of Russia, when they are so openlv encouraged by the Russian authorities ? The Persian Government earnestly appeal to His Britannic Majesty’s Government first, to see that article 11 of the protocol of the 25th August, 1909, be carried out in full; second, that the Russian Government be urged to put a stop to these most serious interferences on the part of their authorities in Persia. Persian Legation, London, July 31, 1911. Enclosure in No. 251. Translation of Telegrams received from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. ( 1 .) July 28, 1911. RASHID-UL-MHLK, ex-Governor of Ardebil, who was guilty of acts of treachery against the Government, had been detained by the Government of Azerbaijan. The Russian Minister verbally intimated that as Rashid-ul-Mulk possesses a Russian order he should be kept in honourable confinement and should not be subjected to any injury. We replied that Rashid-ul-Mulk would be kept in honourable confinement until he has stood a careful trial. This was done, but to-day we have received a telegram from Tabreez that the Russian consul-general in that city called on the deputy governor and asked him to release Rashid-ul-Mulk. The deputy governor replied that as Rashid-ul- Mulk had been detained by the order of the Government he could not let him go without permission. The consul-general left the deputy governor. Shortly afterwards some 300 Russian soldiers and Cossacks entered the Government House, threatened the deputy governor with their rifles, and carried away Rashi d-ul-Mulk. This [? It is] astonishing that [? the Russian Government] on the one hand at this important juncture declare themselves neutral and unwilling to interfere or intervene; on the other hand, without saying anything to us they act in Persia as they please. They commit acts which are contrary to the independence of Persia and contrary to the law of nations. Please at once inform His Britannic Majesty’s Government of this. (20 July 29, 1911. Telegraphic report received from Tabreez states that Russian soldiers and Cossacks molest people in the streets, and apparently their intention is to bring about a conflict with the inhabitants.July 30, 1911. 3lie inhabitants and the Provincial Committee of Guilan have sent a lengthy telegram of which the following is a summary “ The province of Guilan is perfectly secure and tranquil. Nevertheless the Russian consul is continually interfering and makes mischief. He has officially informed the Governor of Guilan that he will arrest and imprison any suspected person whom he considers to be a Russian subject wherever he may be and in whatever costume he may be. The object of the consul is twofold : first, to arrest and imprison without the interference of the local Government Persian subjects on the pretext that they are Russian subjects ; second, to use this as a means of entering people’s houses and cause discontent and disturbance. He has, moreover, incited one or two of the ex-Shah’s followers (who have for a long time been under his protection) to cause mischief. The whole population of Guilan expresses aversion towards Mohammed Ali Mirza. “It is very strange that outwardly Russia announces to the whole world and to all the Parliaments that her policy is not to intervene or interfere in Persia ; on the other hand, she actively interferes and her agents cause mischief in all parts of the country.” (4-) July 31,191]. According to a telegraphic report received from Ardebil the Russian vice-consul at that town has sent the chief Russian merchant to the deputy governor and the chief of the police with a message that Mohammed Ali Mirza with an army of 12,000 men has arrived at a distance of one stage from Tehran ; that he has 20 millions of money with him; that he has proclaimed general amnesty ; that he has entrusted the Sipahdar Azam with the maintenance of order in Tehran, and that the latter has agreed to this. The message went on to say that, as the vice-consul himself has received instructions to look after the order of the town, he therefore wishes to urge the deputy governor and the chief of the police not to do various acts, as the results will [? be] detrimental to them. In view of the neutrality which they (the Russian Government) profess to maintain, one does not know how to interpret these acts. Please bring these facts at once to the notice of Sir Edward Grey and make an earnest request that His Britannic Majesty’s Government may urge the Russian Government to restrain their agents from acting in this manner. No. 2'52. Note communicated by M. Sevastopoulo, August 3, 1911. LES communications que nous faisait le Gouvernement persan concernant des intrigues an profit de Mohamed Ali Schah ont toujours ete traitees par nous avec attention, et de serieuses representations ont ete faites au Schah quant a la necessite de s’abstenir de toute action dirigee contre le regime actuel en Perse. Ces representa tions ont ete faites non seulement pendant le sejour du Schah en Russie, mais aussi pendant qu’il etait a 1’etranger, quoique, d’apres le sens du protocole de 1909, ceci ne constituait pas une obligation pour le Gouvernement Imperial. D’ailleurs, le Gouvernement persan n’a jamais fourni de preuves k 1’appui de ses communications, et Mohamed Ali Schah a toujours affirme 6tre etranger a toute agita tion. II paraissait par consequent etabli que celle-ci etait conduite en dehors de Sa Majeste par d’autres personnes agissant dans son interet. De toute fa§on, c’est avant tout au Gouvernement local, et non a un autre, qu’il appartient de lutter contre toute agitation. Or, le Gouvernement persan s’est born&lt;3 a adresser des plaintes au Gouvernement Imperial, sans prendre de son cote aucune mesure dans les limites de 1’Empire. C’est du moins ainsi qu’il en a ete pour 1 agitation parmi les Turkmans, et si cette derniere a pris des proportions telles qu’elle a rendu possible la tentative de I’ex-Schah de reconquerir son trone, la faute en est au Gouvernement persan lui-mAme. En particulier, les communications de ce dernier au sujet de la presence a Bakou d’agents de Mahomed Ali ont provoque des mesures immediates de la part dn Gouvernement Imperial. Les indications du Gouvernement persan sur une pretendue arrestation de ces agents par les autorites locales ne se sont pas trouvees confirmees, etles recherches entreprises par la police n’ont pas amend la decouverte des agitateurs en question. Pour ce qui est du voyage par la Russie du Schah, qui les derniers temps avait sejourne pendant longtemps a 1’etranger, ou il se trouvait en dehors de la surveillance du Gouvernement Imperial, il est evident qu’il n’etaib pas au pouvoir du Gouvernement Imperial de prevenir ce voyage, entrepris incognito et tout a fait a fimproviste. Il est egalement a remarquer que le Gouvernement persan n’avait pris aucune mesure pour prevenir farrivee du Schah sur le territoire Persan, quoique c’est justement dans la steppe Turkmane qu’on redoutait, semble-t-il, son apparition. Le Gouvernement Imperial ne saurait s’abstenir d’observer que pendant les deux ans qui se sont passes depuis le depart de Mahomed Ali, il n’a ete presque rien fait par le Gouvernement persan pour le retablissement de la paix et de fordre dans le pays. De constantes crises Ministerielles, une deplorable lutte des partis et le travail generalement improductif du Medjliss qui caracterisent cette periode de deux ans, out incontestablement contribue a preparer le terrain pour les intrigues de fex-Schah et pour son retour. Dans ces conditions le Gouvernement Imperial ne trouve pas possible de decharger le Gouvernement persan des responsabilites pour les dommages qui peuvent etre causes aux sujets russes par suite de fapparition de Mahomed Ali Schah et continuera a le tenir pour responsible pour tout dommage que les desordres interieurs de la Perse auront causes aux inter6ts russes, tant publics que prives. (Translation.) WE have always considered with attention the communications made to us by the Persian Government on the subject of intrigues in favour of Mohamed Ali Shah, and vve have made serious representations to the Shah as to the necessity of abstaining from all action directed against the present regime in Persia. These representations have been made not only during the Shah’s stay in Russia but also while he was abroad, although the protocol of 1909 placed the Imperial Government under no obligation to do so in the latter case. The Persian Government have never furnished proofs in support of their communications, and Mohamed Ali Shah has always asserted that he was not connected with any agitation. It appeared, therefore, to be established that the agitation was conducted independently of His Majesty by other persons acting in his interest. In any case it is essentially the duty of the local Government and not of another Government to contend against any agitation. Now the Persian Government confined themselves to addressing complaints to the Imperial Government without on their part taking any steps within the boundaries of the Empire. At least this has been the case as regai ds the agitation among the Turkomans, and if this agitation has assumed proportions which have made the attempt of the ex-Shah to regain the throne possible, the fault lies with the Persian Government themselves. In particular the Persian Government’s communications respecting the presence •, a t . a § ea ^ s Mohamed Ali have resulted in immediate steps on the part 0 t c Imperial Government. The statements of the Persian Government respecting t re alleged arrest of these agents by the local authorities have not been confirmed, and t re search made by the police has not led to the discovery of the agitators in question. i i S ^ ie •l ourne y through Russia of the Shah, who latterly had lived a long time a road where he could not be watched by the Imperial Government, it is evident that 1 was not m the power of the Imperial Government to guard against this journey, undertaken, as it was, incognito and quite without warning. It is likewise to be remarked that the Persian Government had taken no steps to guaic against the anival of the Shah on Persian territory, although it was precisely on the I urkoman steppes where his appearance would seem to have been feared. i • n i ^ m P ena l Government cannot refrain from observing that during the two years Y 11C Y 'T y a P s ® c ^ s ^ nce the departure of Mohamed Ali hardly anything has been ( one y the Persian Government to re-establish peace and order in the country. The constant ministerial crises, a deplorable party struggle, and the generally unproductive wen £ of the Medjliss which characterise this period of two years have incontestably contributed to preparing the ground for the intrigues of the ex-Shah and his return. r T) 11 . ese cllcums ^ ances fhe Imperial Government find it impossible to exonerate the leisian Government from responsibility for losses which may be caused toRussian subjects as the result of the appearance of Mohamed Ali Shah and will continue to hold them responsible for any damage to Russian interests, public and private, caused by internal disorders in Persia. No. 253. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 3.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, August 3, 1911, CONVEYS substance of the following despatch, dated the 3rd August:— Sir, I have the honour to report that to-day’s “ Novoe Vremya ” publishes an article on the proposed appointment of Major Stokes to command the new Persian Treasury gendarmerie. The article is entitled “An undesirable complication.” The article begins by sketching Mr. Shuster’s proposal, and goes on to compare the position of the commander of the gendarmerie to that of Russian officers who have been in the service of the Persian Government. The “Novoe Vremya” considers that the adoption of Major Stokes of the role of commander of the forces being dispatched against the ex-Shah is incomparably more dangerous for the maintenance of good Anglo-Russian relations than was the participation of Russian officers in the events which took place at Tehran two years ago. The Russian officers were not specially invited to take the field against political opponents. The outbreak of trouble found them at posts which duty and honour forbade them to vacate apart from all considerations of party politics ; but Major Stokes is being engaged specially for the purpose of leading the troops of one party against those of another. The part which he is playing is not one which should be played by a British officer, for he is acting like a “hired condottiere.” Moreover, the Russian officers’ activities were limited to a sphere placed by the Anglo-Russian agreement under Russian influence, while Major Stokes is acting outside the sphere assigned by that agreement to British influence. While the Angio-Russian agreement of 1907 remains in force Russia would not permit herself to mix in events which were taking place in the British sphere. Equally it cannot be considered legal or tolerable that British officers should take part in military operations in northern Persia. Russia does not wish to prevent the Persian Government from taking into its service any roving adventurers ; but she does object to the participation, indirect though it may be, of a friendly Government in such an appointment. The “ Novoe Vremya” continues: “Major Stokes is not a ‘nobody.’ He is a British military attache in Tehran. He cannot leave British service unless he has received the assent of the British War Office to his retirement Thus, the entry of Major Stokes into the Persian service is without a doubt entirely dependent on the wishes of the British Government. If it does not approve of the decision of a military attache in its service to embark on adventures which threaten to cast a shadow on the good relations existing between England and Russia, then Major Stokes will withdraw his resignation. If, on the other hand, his resignation is accepted, the British Government will show that it interprets its obligation of political non-intervention in the Russian sphere in Persia very conditionally.” The article points out that it is only Major Stokes’s official position and the assent of the British Government to his new appointment to which Russia takes exception ; to the personal side of the question she is entirely indifferent. The “ Novoe Vremya ” concludes by emphasising the immense importance of the Anglo-Russian entente and the necessity of carrying out its provisions with especial scrupulousness. The last sentence of the article runs : “ The incident with Major Stokes may introduce into Anglo-Russian relations, as far as they are connected with the 1907 agreement, substantial limitations equally disadvantageous to both parties.” I have, &amp;c.

If Major Stokes resigns his commission, it is difficult, if not impossible, for us to prevent him from taking service under the Persian Government. But his employment in northern sphere of Persia is a matter to which I agree that Russian Government are entitled to object. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran will be instructed, should the Russian Government wish to present objection to Persian Government against such employment, to inform Persian Government that the objection is one which they should take into account, as it is reasonable and was to be expected, and that His Majesty’s Government can take no exception to it.

I HAVE the honour to make the following observations in connection with Major Stokes’s appointment and the possible intervention of Russia in Persia :— If Mohamed Ali Mirza comes to Tehran he will probably be accompanied by a body of Turkomans or other lawless tribesmen, who will constitute a danger of a very different nature from that offered by the Bakhtiari at the time of the last revolution. Should the Russian Government in such circumstances urge the necessity for sending their troops to the capital, I submit that, whether a gendarmerie force were then in existence or not, we would find it difficult to affirm that the lives and properties of Europeans would be secure without them. No. 263. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic). Foreign Office, August 7, 1911. IT is clear that a serious political question will arise if Major Stokes is appointed to control gendarmerie in North Persia. Warning should be given to Persian Government that they ought to drop the question of his appointment unless they intend not to employ him in North Persia, and that His Majesty’s Government will recognise Russia’s right to safeguard her North Persian interests as she thinks necessary if they persist in appointing him under such conditions. No. 264. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, August 7, 1911. PLEASE inform Major Stokes of the terms of warning you were instructed to give to Persian Government in my telegram of to-day. ^ Persian Government could not possibly uphold Major Stokes’s appointment if Russia intervened, and, unless his appointment is restricted to South Persia, we cannot deprecate their intervening^ to prevent it. The Russian Government have as good a right to protest against his being placed in control of gendarmerie in North Persia as we should have to protest against a control of the southern trade routes by Russians.126 No. 265. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 8.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, August 4, 1911. WITH reference to my telegram of yesterday’s date, I have the honour to report that the “ Novoe Vremya ” publishes a further article on the subject of Major Stokes in its issue of to-day. The article begins by reminding its readers that in May last year the Persian prince, Sharukh Darab Mirza, who was in the Russian service and commanded a sotnia in a Cossack regiment, decided to enter the arena of Persian politics. He obtained leave of absence, left his sotnia at Kazvin, sent in his resignation, and raised the standard of revolt against the Tehran Govern ment. But the Russian Government, in pursuance of a policy of non-interference in Persian affairs, refused to accept his resignation, and even sent troops after him to compel him to return. Not until he was escorted into Russian territory (where he still is) was his resignation accepted. In this manner did Russia deal with an attempt by a Persian prince in her service to interfere in Persian party politics. But Major Stokes, ex-military attache at Tehran, is a British officer and not a Persian prince, and it is therefore much simpler and easier to know how to treat him. If the British Govern ment regard the agreement of 1907 half so seriously as does the Russian Government, then the end of the major’s escapade could be accurately foretold. He would not be allowed to retire, and would be informed that he must not interfere in a matter which did not concern him. If, in spite of everything, he should desert, the Indian troops at the British Legation at Tehran should treat him as the Cossacks did the Persian prince. He would be arrested. But, of course, the matter would never go as far as this. One word from the British Minister would be enough to stop the officer from entering the Persian service in a capacity which would contravene the spirit and the letter of the Anglo-Russian convention. The u Novoe Vremya ” expresses the hope that His Majesty’s Government will do all in its power to prevent this “ridiculous adventure.” The article concludes with the words : “ By the way, what will the British Government do if Mohamed Ali Shah takes Major Stokes prisoner and orders him to be impaled ? They would probably remember then that Major Stokes was a British subject. But would it not be better to remember this now ? ” I have, &amp;c. GEORGE W. BUCHANAN. No. 266. Sir G.

You may say that, if not, we will support a demand by Russia for employment in Northern Persia of gendarmerie under a Russian officer or the subject of a minor Powder suggested by her, though the appointment of an officer, the subject of a neutral Power, to command the whole revenue gendarmerie would, in my opinion, offer the best solution.127 I Wot! e s %i| ^ rea| ft | l J Was ii| l^enferi at Were^j r ^ter liiui; Were ie t| II attempt i; Major Ik 'irrcejaiditi ■’itisli 6o?ei [ Goraitt, rroiili not! matter ?i| dian troops i 'ersianpr®, as is, If i entering | ie letter i! i be impalei! subject, It No. 268. bir G.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 12.) (Telegraphic.) _ &gt; Tehran, August 12, 1911. 1OLLO WING is substance of the Persian Government’s reply to my aide-memoire mentioned in my telegram of 9th August:—- Persian Government cannot understand the attitude of His Majesty’s Government in regard to the appointment of Major Stokes. Even supposing that they desired to base their objection on Anglo-Russian agreement, the Persian Government’s attitude towards which w r as defined in their note of 2nd November, 1907, not one word could be found in it to justify their contention. On the contrary, the preamble, in that it respects in categorical terms the independence and integrity of Persia, supports the Persian point of view. The preamble also declares that the two Governments desire the preservation of order in Persia, and the Persian Government’s desire is to take the necessary steps for the collection of taxes, without which the maintenance of order would be in any country a difficult task. The Persian Government are confident that His Majesty’s Government will lend them their good offices to solve this question consistently with the dignity of Persia and with her most vital interests. In handing me this communication, the Minister for Foreign Affairs suggested, as a way out of the difficulty, that the appointment of Stokes might be limited only to three years, vdth the stipulation that it was not to be a precedent. At the end of that period the Treasury gendarmerie would be entrusted to Persians or subjects of minor Powers. He said that if this did not satisfy Russia he thought that, if the Russian Government replied favourably to his recent advances, he might be able to declare that, provided the appointment of Stokes was not made the pretext for any Russian demand, he would not be sent personally on any active mission in the north as distinct from organisation work in Tehran. No. 276. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 13.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 13, 1911. AT a dinner last night arranged for the purpose my Russian colleague and 1 had for the first time an opportunity of free discussion with Shuster. United States Minister was present. My Russian colleague and I urged upon Shuster the necessity of acting with due regard to the spirit and letter of the Anglo-Russian agreement. And we assured him of our full support on those lines. We endeavoured to persuade him that the [ 188 ] KISO 9 appointment of Major Stokes to the command of a national fiscal gendarmerie was contrary to the spirit of the agreement, and reminded him of our warnings to the Persian Government as to the engagement of assistants from subjects of European Great Powers. ' ' Shuster assured us that in offering post to Stokes he had had no idea that the appointment would be umvelcome. He gave us the most ample assurances as to working within the lines of the agreement, but pleaded with extreme persistence for the employment of Stokes without restriction of his duties to the south. He said he could assure us that he would not be actively employed in the north except for organisation in Tehran, and declared that his assistance for this work for a time in Tehran was indispensable. There was no one else immediately available for his purpose. Moreover, if he waived his demand for Stokes’s services, his position with the Medjliss, which he solemnly assured us should be used in the interests of smooth relations with the two Powers on the lines of the agreement, would be seriously shaken. He promised that while Stokes was under his orders the latter’s Russophobe proclivities would be completely controlled, and he pressed the Russian Minister repeatedly and earnestly to endeavour to overcome the Russian Government’s opposition. The Russian Minister tried in vain to convince Shuster that any such endeavour wordd be useless, and most courteously but firmly refused to advise his Government to change their attitude. Shuster made it evident that he -was so dependent on Stokes that he would support any reasonable counter-demand from Russia, but Russian Minister pointed out the friction that would result from Russia’s pressing for a counter-demand would react in favour of Mohamed Ali. The most sensible course was therefore to abandon the appointment of Stokes. Our conversation, while it was unsatisfactory in that it was inconclusive and left us in doubt as to what course Shuster would adopt in regard to Stokes’s appointment, served at least to put our relations with Shuster on a rational footing, and also some what to relieve the anxiety which his go-ahead methods had caused us. No. 277. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 13.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 13, 1911. YESTERDAY a message from the Regent wns read to the Medjliss and adopted unanimously. In it the Regent points out that hitherto dissensions, Utopian aspirations, and lack of practical sense have made all government impossible, so that Cabinet has succeeded Cabinet, and ephemeral Ministries have been unable to do anything for the country. Present situation is the result of this instability. If experience of the recent past is not taken to heart, the country will have cause to repent it in the near future. As regards foreign relations, the Regent regrets that nothing has been done to improve these, notwithstanding his repeated counsels, or to profit by the friendly disposition manifested by the foreign representatives at the time of his arrival. He urges the importance of a serious attempt to repair the consequences of this neglect, and leaves it to the Cabinet to propose a detailed programme calculated to achieve this object. Regent concludes with warning that should the situation and the importance of wdiat he has said not be taken into serious consideration his position would become totally untenable, and on no condition ■would he continue to remain an idle spectator of the deplorable state in which the country is plunged.

St. Petersburgh, August 9, 1911. -d • VJi m P revious despatches had the honour to report on'the language held by the llussian press on the subject of the appointment of Major Stokes to command the gendarmerie which the Persian Government propose to organise for Treasury purposes, hiven the Novoe \remya has taken His Majesty’s Government severely to task loi allowing a former military attache to resign his commission in order to assume i 6 c ^ mman d a force whose operations will extend over the northern zone, especially placed under Kussian influence by the 1907 agreement, or to take an active part in an internal conflict that is^ being waged outside the sphere of British influence. Such an appointment, constituting as it would an infraction of the aforesaid agreement, would, the Novoe Vremya apprehends, seriously prejudice the harmonious working of the Anglo-Bussian understanding. Other papers, representing the views of reactionary and Germanophil circles, have openly declared that now that England has shown her cards Bussia has acquired a free hand, and is at liberty to intervene by force in Northern Persia for the protection of her interests. In official circles the appointment has been no^ less strongly condemned on its merits, though it is perfectly understood that His Majesty s Government are innocent of the Machiavellian designs imputed to them in other quarters of stealing a march on the Bussian Government and gaining a foothold in the Bussian sphere in Northern Persia. When Mr. Shuster early in July decided to entrust to Major Stokes the task of organising a Treasury gendarmerie, whose operations would embrace the whole of Persia, I explained to M. Neratof the great beuefits likely to be derived from the creation of such a force, as well as the special qualifications possessed by Major Stokes for organising and commanding it. M. Neratof, in reply, expressed himself favourable to the idea of a gendarmerie of this description, but took exception to its being placed under the command of a British officer. He suggested that the command should either be split up and shared by a British and a Bussian officer or that it should be entrusted to a subject of one of the minor Powers, such as Sweden. The fact, moreover, that the appointment was being offered to Major Stokes by Mr. Shuster, who had already incurred his serious displeasure by the attitude which he had taken up towards the customs administrator without previous consultation with the Bussian and British Governments, did not predispose his Excellency in its favour. The unexpected turn which Persian affairs took in consequence of Mohamed Ali’s sudden return distracted M. Neratofs attention for a time to other matters, and his Excellency was at first under the impression that the grave internal crisis with which the Persian Government was confronted would cause the two questions of the Mornard-Shuster dispute respecting the customs administration and of the projected Treasury^ gendarmerie to fall temporarily into abeyance. When, however, it became evident from the decision taken by the Medjliss respecting the salary to be allotted to Major Stokes on his appointment that the Persian Government were determined to avail themselves of his services in some form or another, and that they would in all probability employ him to direct the military operations about to be taken against the ex-Shah in Northern Persia, his Excellency caused representations to be made on the subject to His Majesty’s Government through the Bussian Ambassador in London. It was not, however, till the 2nd of this month that M. Neratof again referred to the matter in conversation with me. After enquiring if I could tell him how the question stood at that moment, his Excellency told me that the Bussian Minister at Tehran had already informed the Persian Government that, in the event of Major Stokes being entrusted with the organisation of the projected gendarmerie, Bussia would demand something of an analogous nature for herself. Having received that morning your telegram of the 1st instant to Sir George Barclay, I explained to M. Neratof that Major Stokes’s appointment had been made irrespective of His Majesty’s Government, and that they would have preferred that the Persian Govern ment should have first consulted them in the matter. Sir George Barclay, I said, had now been instructed to inform the Persian Government that Major Stokes had been required to resign his commission before taking up his appointment, and to point out to them that, as his employment in any active operations in Northern Persia might involve political considerations, His Majesty’s Government &lt;?ould not deprecate the objections that might be taken to it. I added that, when once Major Stokes had resigned [188] K 2his commission, His Majesty’s Government could exercise no control over his action. These explanations by no means satisfied M. Neratof, who expressed himself in a manner which showed that he regarded Major Stokes’s appointment as most inopportune at the present moment. Iteferring to the possibility of that officer being employed in active operations against the ex-Shah, his Excellency drew my attention to the action taken by Russia last year in the case of the Persian prince, Darab Mirza, who was then serving in the Russian army, and commanding a sotnia of Cossacks at Kazvin. Having expressed a desire to resign his commission, and having subsequently attempted to raise a revolt against the present Government, Darab Mirza had been placed under arrest and sent to Russia; and his Excellency evidently wished to convey to me that the proper course for His Majesty’s Government to pursue in Major Stokes’s case was to refuse to accept his resignation and to recall him to England. After the publication of the article in the “ Novoe Vremya,” of which I had the honour to forward a translation in my despatch of the 3rd instant, I again called on M. Neratof, and, in accordance with the instructions conveyed to me in your telegram of the 3rd instant, explained that it was very difficult, if not impossible, for His Majesty’s Government to prevent Major Stokes taking service under the Persian Government if once he resigned his commission. You considered, however, that the Russian Government were entitled to object to his being employed in North Persia, and that, should they wish you to do so, you would instruct Sir George Barclay to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government could not take exception to such an objection, and that the Persian Government would do well to take it into account. While expressing his thanks for this communication, M. Neratof said that he feared that a protest of this kind on the part of the Russian Government would expose them to the retort that the Persian Government were in no way concerned with the Anglo-Russian agreement, under which Persia had been divided into a British and a Russian sphere of influence. He would, however, think over the matter, and see whether it was possible to find a formula which would get over this difficulty and which would at the same time command the support of His Majesty’s Government. M. Neratof sent for me on the following day, and again spoke of the grave anxiety which this incident was causing him. He regretted it because such an appointment was a contravention of the principle on which the two Governments had hitherto acted, namely, that no subject of a European Great Power should be allowed to occupy any important post in the Persian service. He pointed out that at a moment when the Persian Government were engaged in a struggle for their very existence they would not give a thought to the projected Treasury gendarmerie, and would employ Stokes and any other forces that he might organise to fight the ex-Shah in Northern Persia. I his, he thought, ought to be prevented at all costs, and he repeated the suggestion which he had made to me on the previous day, that His Majesty’s Govern ment should, recall Major Stokes temporarily to London. There must, he imagined, be some formalities to be gone through before Major Stokes could leave the army that would serve as a pretext for such a step. If, however, His Majesty’s Government were unable to act on this suggestion, it would be absolutely necessary that the two Governments should take some step that, while giving satisfaction to public opinion in this country, would demonstrate the solidarity of their interests in Persia. His Excellency then read to me the draft of the two accompanying notes, which he suggested that the British and Russian Ministers at Tehran should respectively address to the Persian Government. Ihe Russian note would enter a protest against Major Stokes s appointment and would state that Russia would regard it as an unfriendly act and would reserve to herself the right of taking such measures as she might deem necessary to safeguard her interests in Persia. The British note would express entire concurrence m the terms of the Russian note and would recognise Russia’s right to take the necessary steps to protect her interests. . ported out that it might be difficult for His Majesty’s Government to express entne concurrence in a note which virtually threatened armed intervention and suggested tliat^ the^ Russian Government might protest against the employment of Major Stokes in Northern Persia, and at the same time express their readiness to place at the disposal of the Persian Government the services of a Russian officer to organise a gendarmerie for the maintenance of order in those provinces. M. Neratof, however, adhered to the general tenor of his draft note, remarking that if Russian interests were threatened the Imperial Government would be obliged to intervene. On the receipt of your telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran of the 7thinstant, I informed M. Neratof that Sir George Barclay had been instructed to warn the Persian Government that they ought not to persist in engaging Major Stokes, except on the understanding that he was not to be employed in Northern Persia, and that, if they did so persist, His Majesty’s Government would recognise the right of Russia to take what steps she thinks necessary to safeguard her interests. I added that, in view of the pressure which we had brought to bear on the Persian Government last year to organise a force under British officers for the purpose of protecting the southern trade routes, we could not deprecate the employment of Major Stokes in those provinces, but that you recognised that it would be contrary to the spirit of the Anglo-Russian Convention for His Majesty’s Government to support that officer’s employment in Northern Persia or to deprecate any objections which Russia might take to it. In the course of the conversation which ensued, M. Neratof said that he feared that the Persian Government would insist on adhering to the terms of the original contract which they had made with Major Stokes. What, however, he was most anxious to obtain from His Majesty’s Government at the present moment was some statement that would give a moral satisfaction to Russian public opinion and that would counteract the very unfavourable impression which this incident had created. Supposing that the Persian Government did agree not to avail themselves of Major Stokes’s services outside the southern provinces, there was no guarantee that the gendarmerie which he was going to organise in those provinces might not eventually be dispatched on service to the north. Would His Majesty’s Government, he asked, make a state ment to the effect that this would not be allowed? I said that they might possibly give an assurance that Major Stokes would not be employed in the north, but that they could not take any engagement as regarded the gendarmerie force which he might have organised. M. Neratof replied that this would not be sufficient, and that what he wanted was an assurance that the gendarmerie, which was a purely local force, should not be moved from the south to the north. I pointed out that it would be impossible for you to defend in Parliament an assurance that the Persian Government would not be allowed to dispose of the forces, of which it might dispose in the south, for service in the north, should the situation require it. His Excellency admitted that this would no doubt be difficult, and then suggested that, in the event of the command of the southern gendarmerie being entrusted to Major Stokes, you should declare your readiness to support Russia, should she eventually demand that the organisation of a northern gendarmerie should be given either to a Russian officer or to the subject of some minor Power, whom the Russian Government might put forward as a candidate. I said that I personally much preferred this suggestion to the one which his Excellency had previously made, but that I could not answer for His Majesty’s Government. M. Neratof then proceeded to say, that should, as he expected, the Persian Government persist in placing Major Stokes in command of a national gendarmerie for the whole of Persia, he hoped that you would promise to support any eventual demand which Russia might put forward for some appointment of an analogous character being given to a Russian officer. I asked whether he had any particular appointment in his mind’s eye. His Excellency replied that the appointment of a Russian officer as chief of the staff might perhaps answer the purpose. I observed that I thought that there was but very little likelihood of the Persian Government complying with such a demand under the present circumstances. M. Ndratof, therefore, explained that the Russian Government had no intention of putting forward any such request at this moment. He was not just now thinking so much of the Persian Government as of His Majesty’s Government. M/Rat he desired was that yo^- should, eithei by a statement in Parliament or by a communique in the press, make a declaration of the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to support any demand for compensation that the Russian Govern ment might eventually put forward in order that Russian public opinion might receive some moral satisfaction, I n Q TTO C* GEORGE W.

If the British Government cannot prevent one of its own subjects from flouting it and engaging in independent ventures on his own account contrary to its own expressed wish, of what value is the agreement of 1907 ? If it be true, moreover, that Great Britain has expressed her readiness to support the Russian protest at Tehran, what becomes of British prestige ? Is it really necessary for the Government of the British Empire, in its struggle with an insubordinate subject, to call in the help of the rulers of a small and impotent Asiatic Power ? If this be so, then in future, when signing any agreement with England, we must make a mental reservation as to the consent of various Mulks, Dowlehs, and Sultanehs. Italian officers in the Persian service, there is not one British officer, and inferring that Major Stokes’s appointment merely restores the balance in favour of England. It describes this telegram as an insult to Sir Arthur Nicolson, who, in August 1907, signed the Anglo-Russian agreement, by article 3 of which all existing concessions are to remain in force, while Russia binds herself not to interfere in the English sphere of influence, and England, gives a similar bond with regard to the Russian sphere. The article concludes : “ Reference to the Russian, German, and Italian officers is beside the question. These officers occupied their posts previous to the agreement, and still occupy them in virtue of it and not in defiance of it. Major Stokes has accepted his appointment to a political post in defiance of the direct and indisputable conditions set forth in article 3 of the agreement. It seems to us that Sir Arthur Nicolson would be justified in reminding British diplomatic circles in Tehran of the substance of article 3 of the agreement, which he, as British Ambassador at St. Petersburgh, signed with M. Isyolsky,” INFORM Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs of Persian reply reported in Sir G.

He had already received a report on the subject from M. Poklewski. After emphasising the serious character of the incident which had so unfortunately arisen^ his Excellency proceeded to dwell on the prejudicial manner in which Major Stokes s appointment would react on the effective working of the Anglo-Russian under standing. What, he asked, would have been said in England had our respective positions been reversed and had if been a Russian officer who had accepted a post m the Persian Government which conferred on him the right to organise and control a gendarmerie force in South Persia ? I replied that his Excellency seemed to have forgotten the various statements w ich you had made m Parliament, in one of which you had touched on this very point as well as the promise which you had given to support Russia in the matter of ttie northern gendarmerie and the serious warningwhich you had addressed to the Persian Government. Major Stokes’s resignation, moreover, had not yet been accepted nor would it be accepted pending further developments. I did not therefore see what more you could do, nor did I believe that, after all that you had said and done, the Anaio- Kussian understanding could in any way be impaired. M. Neratof said that the question raised by Major Stokes’s appointment was such a serious one that he could not assume the responsibility of dealing with it by himself, and that he would have to submit it to the Council of Ministers. Before hlT^bn?

I have received a telegram from the acting British consul at Shiraz, expressing the opinion that an increase in the consular guard will soon become desirable to enable him to protect the houses of Europeans at Shiraz without unduly depleting the consulate guard. Mr. Knox gives the following reasons in support of his opinion : — The growing number of tribesmen in the town, the approaching arrival of Soulet-ed-Dowleh, the unlikelihood that the Nizam will be willing or able properly to restrain these elements of disorder. In addition to the houses in the immediate vicinity of the consulate there are two dwelling-houses outside the town and four British business houses inside Shiraz. I understand also that there is one German subject who would probably ask for the protection of His Majesty’s consulate. To undertake the guarding of these houses a considerable reinforcement, probable some 150 men, would be necessary; and His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire points out that the dispatch of such a force would be tantamount to a declaration against the Governor-General and Soulet-ed-Dowleh. It seems to be unlikely that any deliberate attempt will be made on Europeans, but, of course, indiscriminate looting may occur at any time. Still, I hardly think that this possibility warrants so serious a step as the dispatch of a force of the magnitude necessary to ensure against it. On the other hand it has been necessary since Kawam-ul-Mulk’s arrival in the consulate to institute such guard duty as I am given to understand is excessive for the small force at present in Shiraz, and as there appears to be no sure prospect of Kawam’s leaving the consulate, I consider that it would be desirable to send a small reinforcement to Shiraz. In these circumstances I would beg to recommend, with a view to relieving this strain, that the Government of India be asked to dispatch an additional twenty-two non-commissioned officers and men to Shiraz- The present detachment numbers forty-two men, and sixleen men have day and night to be on guard.

Conveys substance of the following 22nd August St. Petersburgh, August 19, 1911. extract from a despatch dated the As M. Neratof was too busy to receive me when I asked for an interview after the receipt of your telegram of the 16th instant, I embodied the main points of that telegram in a private letter which I sent to his Excellency on the 17th instant. In a conversation which I had with him two days later I supplemented what I had said in it by once more impressing on him the fact that His Majesty’s Government had had nothing whatever to do with Major Stokes’s appointment, and by reminding him of the attitude which you had consistently adopted when unfavourable comments had been made in Parliament respecting the proceedings of Colonel Liakhoff and the retention of the Russian garrison in Persia. I trusted, I said, that his Excellency would on his part exercise the same moderating influence on Russian public opinion whenever, as had recently been the case, the conduct of His Majesty’s Government was subjected to unreasonable criticisms. His Excellency replied that we might count upon his doing so, as there was nothing that he desired more than that the two Governments should always work together, more especially at a moment like the present when affairs in Persia were in such a critical state. He had already instructed M. Poklewski to address a communica tion to the Persian Government in the terms of the note which had been submitted to you by Count Benckendorff, and to associate himself with Sir George Barclay in urging that Government to entrust the organisation of the revenue gendarmerie to one of the Swedish officers. He would only ask me to convey to you his warmest thanks for having instructed Sir George Barclay to state that His Majesty’s Government cannot accept Major Stokes’s resignation. I have, &amp;c.

MY Russian colleague and 1 advised Persian Government on the 20th August to appoint Swedish officers to organise the Treasury gendarmerie in the place of Major Stokes. This course appeared to us to offer a possible solution of the present deadlock. The essential is that gendarmerie organisation in some form should be started. I believe, moreover, that the Treasury gendarmerie, as Mr. Shuster lias identified himself with it, is more likely to progress than another force organised simultaneously, even if funds were forthcoming for both bodies. I think that, as the work of organisation advanced, we could always, if it became necessary to insist, demand that a portion of the gendarmerie should be diverted from Treasury purposes to a more general use in the country. The senior Swedish officer is, however, reported to have stated that he will need twelve months before being able to do anything effective. If this is true he can be of no service to Treasurer-General, who considers the formation of his gendarmerie to he an immediate necessity. No. 299. Sir G.

Persian Government have lately been endeavouring to induce Nizam-es-Sultaneh to make terms with the Kawami, but their efforts have proved unavailing. Mr. Knox reports that the situation is growing more serious. There has been incessant fighting during the last three days. Looting proceeds unchecked, all business is arrested, and the outlying districts are in a more disturbed condition than ever. Kashgai are posted in a cordon at the approaches to consulate. Mr. Knox adds:— “ Ispahan road unsafe, and, though condition of Bushire road is at present good enough, it does not inspire confidence among native merchants, who have stopped all forwardings.” I have communicated substance of acting consul’s telegram to the Persian Government demanding that the Kashgai cordon should be withdrawn from the approaches to His Majesty’s consulate, and reminding them of their responsibility with regard to British lives and property.

YOUR telegram of the 21st August: Swedish officers. It is clear that something must be done at once to avoid withdrawal of trade from Persian Gulf by more important British firms, which would mean a heavy loss to Persia, and of which there seems real danger. How are the roads in southern provinces to be guarded if Persians employ all the Swedish officers on the Treasury gendarmerie? If one were employed instead of Major Stokes the others might be instructed to proceed at once, if they can, to Bushire, and organise temporary escorts pending the constitution of a regular force, which will only be possible when order has been established in the finances. Would this do ? And would not co-operation between the Swedish officers and merchants make some arrangement possible for route between Bushire and Shiraz, like use of armed muleteers, which enables Lynch to resume transport on this road ?

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 24.) (Telegraphic.) _ Tehran, August 24, 1911. I HAVE received the following telegram from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, dated the 21st August “ I am informed by His Majesty’s consul at Ahwaz that the Luristan road is quite safe for traffic, and that the merchants of Khoremabad are desirous of inducing the muleteers to pass by this route. “ This is the first time since the acquisition of the concession by Lynch that such favourable conditions have prevailed, and I submit that Lynch be urged to send an agent over the road as soon as possible with a view to taking steps towards the completion of the road before the period of delay already granted expires.” I have brought the above to the notice of Lynch’s agent in Tehran, who has instructed the company’s engineer to proceed to Sultanabad. Engineer will, if142 conditions remain favourable, survey the road in question, but it is uncertain whether the security on the Luristan route will continue, as Persian Government are pressincr Amir Mufakham Bakhtiari, to whose governorship improvement is due, to take the field against Salar-ed-Dowleh in the Kermahshah district. No. 305. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received August 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, August 25, 1911. I HAVE the honour to report that the Persian Government have brought to my notice the complaints referred to in your telegram of the 23rd August, together with many others which tend to show that Russian consuls in Persia are favouring cause of Mohamed Ali Mirza, and that intrigues are being carried on by the many reactionaries who have taken up their quarters in Zerguendeh. With regard to the alleged intrigues on the part of the Russian consulate-general, and to the collection of money for Mohamed Ali Mirza, I can hardly believe that these charges could be substantiated, as the Persian Government have not made them to Russian Minister. In connection with the charge of disobedience brought against the Cossack brigade, I have frequently heard complaints made that Colonel Vadbolsky would not furnish guns and ammunition, nor send his men to the provinces, but I am disposed to consider that these complaints are unreasonable, and that colonel had already before the ex-Shah’s return, denuded himself for Government purposes outside Tehran of such Cossacks, guns, and ammunition as could be spared without destroying the cadres of the brigade. There are not more than 400 men in Tehran, apart from the various legation guards—just a sufficient number to preserve a nucleus of the three branches : artillery, cavalry, and- infantry. When I mentioned it to him my Russian colleague ridiculed the idea that ex-Shah had been accompanied by Russian naval officers, and that he was being assisted by a Russian staff officer. That His Majesty crossed the Caspian on board a Russian tramp steamer from Petrowsk is generally admitted. The report of an interview with the captain of a disabled schooner rescued by the tramp in question appears in the “ Caspian,” a Baku newspaper. Captain says that it was observed that the tramp carried passengers—Persian notables and well-dressed Europeans. His Majesty’s vice- consul at Resht further states that it is reported that seventy packages, mostly containing arms and ammunition, were landed with Mohamed Ali Mirza. No. 306. Sir G.

I HAVE the honour to report that I repeated to His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire the last two paragraphs of my telegram of the 28th May last, respecting the situation on the southern road and the bearing of the southern customs statistics upon it. I have now received a despatch from Colonel Cox, forwarding a memorandum which shows that the customs receipts cited by me in the above-mentioned telegram do not really indicate that the outlook for British trade generally has improved. But even were the statistics, which I quoted, less misleading as regards British trade than Mr. Chick shows them to be, my argument, that the increase of imports through Mohammerah has more than compensated the decrease through Bushire, loses its force now that the disorders which have recently broken out on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road—see my telegrams of the 13th and 19th instant—preclude its being used as an alternative channel for our trade to Ispahan, and with the recent recrudescence of144 robberies on tbe Shiraz-Ispahan section of tlie other road the outlook cannot be said to be hopeful. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 313. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 10.) Sir, Tehran, July 28, 1911. IN my despatch of the 12th instant I reported that there had recently been much talk of, and some evidence of, activity amongst Mohamed Ali Mirza’s friends. I had hardly drafted that despatch when I received a visit from Muin-el-Vezireh, “ chef de cabinet ” of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who came with a message from his Excellency to inform me that a favourite of the ex-Shah, Mujallal-es-Sultan, who had been in bast with His Majesty at the Russian Legation, and had accompanied His Majesty into exile, was visiting the Shahsevans on behalf of Mohamed Ali Mirza, and that another favourite of His Majesty, Sardar Arshad, and two companions had arrived at Baku, and were giving out that Mohamed Ali Mirza would return to Persia within a fortnight. A similar message having been conveyed to my Russian colleague, we decided to telegraph recommending our Governments to warn the ex-Shah, who, the Persian Government had informed us, was at Vienna, against intriguing in Persia. Unfortunately the information given us by the Persian Government came too late to be of any use, for on the day it was given the ex-Shah must have already left Vienna. On the 17th instant the ex-Shah landed at Gumesh Tepe with a few followers, amongst whom were his brother Shoa-es-Sultaneh, Amir Bahadur, and Saad-ed-Dowleh. I have little information regarding his proceedings since his landing, but the Russian Minister tells me that his consid has reported that His Majesty entered Astrabad on the 20th instant, where he was received with enthusiasm. At the moment of writing news reaches me through the Persian Government that a force of his Turkoman adherents had seized and looted Shahrud. From reports received from the provinces it is clear that the ex-Shah’s return is by no means generally unwelcome. In the north the Turkoman tribes and the Shahsevans may be counted on to support Mohamed Ali. Mazanderan, which, since the revolt mentioned in the last annual report, has been almost wholly out of the control of the central Government, is reported to be entirely for His Majesty, with whom Amir Mukarram and his co-rebels, Reshid-es-Sultan and Ismail Khan, are said to be in communication. From the west news has reached the Government that the Kalhurs and other tribes, as well as the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh, have declared for Salar-ed- Dowleh. The Kashgais have not yet declared themselves, but a loyal telegram to the central Government from Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who might perhaps be thought to voice Soulet-ed-Dowleh’s views, does not entirely remove the uneasiness as to the attitude of this tribe, nor, as regards their rivals, the Bakhtians, although Sardar Assad’s branch are supporting the Government and have promised forces to aid in resisting the ex-Shah, is there any certainty that the other branch of the tribe who fought on Mohamed All’s side at the time of the revolution will be with them. In the larger towns the feeling seems to be “anything for a change.” The disorders which marked the late reign are no longer a lively memory, and the state of things in the provinces is to-day by no means better than when Mohamed Ali was on the throne. Even in Tabreez, the birthplace of the revolution of 1909, the acting-consul predicts a feeling of relief amongst the better classes when His Majesty’s landing, which has not been made public in the town, becomes generally known. In the capital, as far as I can judge, the feeling is very different. Mohamed Ali has, I believe, few adherents outside of the class from which were drawn the higher officials of the late corrupt regime. The state of public order and security in the capital, at any rate, has been incomparably better under the constitutional regime than under that of the ex-Shah, and it is hard to believe that any but those who profited from the wholesale corruption of Mohamed Ali’s reign and the disreputable elements which throve under His Majesty’s favour would view his return to power with anything but dismay. At any rate, the feeling of the Medjliss is entirely against him. There is every reason to think that if Sipahdar had not taken time by the forelock and resigned on the morning of the 23rd instant he would that day have been the object of a vote of censure.r '.

All appear to be supporting the newly formed Democrat 1 r Th Q ere 1 is ™ UC J 1 talk ? fan expedition against Salar-ed-Dowleh under the Bakhtiari khans, bardar Zaffar and Sardar Jang, and of one under Yeprim against Mohamed All, but 1 do not venture to record any details until there are more tangible signs of these expeditions materialising. I have, &amp;c. a. BARCLAY. No. 314. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 28.) ^ r ’ Tehran, August h, 1^11. . / HAVL the honour to report that I have received a despatch from the acting British consul at Shiraz, from which it is evident that no progress has been made in the organisation of a gendarmerie under General Maletta. General Maletta has been ill, and apart from this the total dislocation of affairs which has marked the past three months ^ has been altogether unfavourable to any constructive work such as the institution of an ^ efficient gendarmerie. This consideration has deterred me from pressing the Persian Government to hasten General Maletta’s work by remitting the 80,000 tomans^ earmarked for the Pars gendarmerie, which would doubtless, if sent to Shiraz at this juncture, have been squandered. In the obscurity of the situation to-day, it is difficult to gauge the prospects of the formation of a proper gendarmerie by the Persian Government, but if the present regime holds, I do_ not despair of the Governments being able to establish an effective force. The Swedish officers are about to arrive in Persia, and with adequate financial backing they should be able to do good service. 1 have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 315. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 28.) Sir, Tehran, August 5, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 12th ultimo, I have the honour to report that on receipt of your telegram of the 21st ultimo I informed the Treasurer-General that Major Stokes would have to resign his commission in the Indian army before accepting the appointment as commander of the Treasury gendarmerie. When informing Major Stokes in the same sense I strongly deprecated his resigning his commission, pointing out to him that his appointment to the post which had been offered to him, the duties of which were not confined to the south of Persia, would be sure to provoke the objections of Russia, and that these objections, which we might not be able to oppose, might lead to the cancelling of his contract, in which case he would be in a most unfortunate position. I found him, however, firmly resolved to resign, provided that satisfactory provision were made as regards a pension on the expiry or the cancelling of his engagement. No provision for a pension had been made by the Medjliss at the time that the Treasurer-General had been empowered by that body to engage Major Stokes, and further reference to the Medjliss was therefore necessary. There was some hesitation on the part of the Cabinet in taking this step. The Russian Minister had intimated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that the proposed appointment of Major Stokes would be most unwelcome to Russia, a fact of which his Excellency must have been already aware, and his Excellency had felt it necessary to disclaim any responsibility for the appointment, which, he declared, had been proposed without the knowledge of the Cabinet. Mr. Shuster pressed the Cabinet to pass the pension arrangements through the Medjliss, but his insistance was of no avail until the advent [ 188 ] L146 to power of the new Democrat Cabinet. That Cabinet took office on the 25th ultimo and provision for Major Stokes’s pension was voted on the 29th ultimo. Major Stokes tendered his resignation from the Indian army on the following day. In obedience to your instructions I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 29th ultimo that I had heard that if Major Stokes accepted the post which had been offered to him he might be employed in a military capacity against the ex-Shah, and I pointed out to his Excel]ency that if he were so employed it might afford an excuse for Russian officers to take an active part on the other side. On the 2nd instant, on receipt of your telegram of the previous day, I delivered a more formal warning. I informed the Minister for Foreign Affairs—leaving an aide-memoire with his Excellency—that Major Stokes had been required to resign his commission before taking up his appointment under the Persian Government. 1 reminded his Excellency that the appointment had been made irrespective of His Majesty’s Government, who would have preferred to have been first consulted in the matter, and I warned his Excellency that the employment of Major Stokes in military service in any active operations in the north of Persia might involve political considerations, and that His Majesty’s Government could not oppose any objections which might be taken to it. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 316. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 28.) Sir, Tehran, August 8, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith an extract from a despatch which I have just received from His Majesty’s vice-consul at Resht, giving certain information regarding the landing of Mohamed Ali Shah and particularly respecting the Turkomans, which bear on the question how far the ex-Shah is likely to receive support from these tribesmen. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 316. Vice-Consul Rabino to Sir G. Barclay. (Extract.) ^ Resht, August 1, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herein what information I have been able to obtain about the ex-Shah’s return to Persia, and the chiefs, tribesmen, and mountaineers on whose support he no doubt relies in his bid for the throne. (a.) —Departure of the ex-Shah for Gumesh Tepe. Mohamed Ali Mirza landed at Gumesh Tepe on the 17th July. He is said to have suddenly left Vienna for Petrovsk under an assumed name, and to have chartered at that port a steamer to take him and some twelve attendants direct to Gumesh Tepe, the Turkoman port of the province of Astrabad. He is said to have shipped on this steamer seventy packages, most of these containing arms and ammunition. (b.) — Turkomans. The Turkoman tribesmen have always been in favour of autocratic rule; their ideal governor is the Ala-ed-Dowleh who, while in their very midst, had two of them blown off from the mouths of his guns, notwithstanding their protestations that they were Russian subjects. When I visited the Turkomans in December 1909 they expressed to me their surprise at Mohamed Ali Mirza not having sought refuge amongst them after the events of the 13th July. Some of the younger tribesmen exclaimed: “We would lay waste the whole country from here to the capital.” It was evident also that being Sunnis they did not readily submit to a Parliament which, according to their views, is subservient to the dictates of a few Shiah mujteheds,Tlieii sentiments soon became known to Mohamed Ali Mirza, who entei’ed into legulai correspondence with their chiefs, to whom he sent his portrait and various presents. Ihe Anjuman of Astrabad and the various governors appointed to that province since the accession of Sultan Ahmad Khan have done nothing either to conciliate the Turkomans or to put a stop to their depredations. The latter waxed so bold as to enter the city at night and steal from the Govern ment stables the governors own saddle horses. It was openly rumoured that they had done this at the invitation of the Anjuman. The dafarbai and the Attabai Yamuts are the wealthiest and best mounted Yamuts, and although the Kan-YYikhmaz are the greatest ruffians, yet the boldest freebooters are to be found amongst the young fellows of the two former sections, who, having no means of their own, are compelled to obtain by raids in the neighbourhood the funds necessary to their future happiness, i.e., the acquisition of an alachik (tent) and the purchase of a wife. The Jafarbai and Attabai have, however, no longer that freedom of action which afforded them immunity from reprisals. Since the last thirty years their fixed settle ments have increased in number and in size. Gumesh Tepe, Khojeh Nefes, Umchali, Bash-Yuzkheh, are all settlements of importance, in which “ tains,” or wooden villas, and stores crowded with merchandise are everywhere to be seen. It is, therefore, no longer possible for the wealthier sections of the Yamut to remove their camps to the southern banks of the Atrek before entering upon an expedition of any importance. I consider, therefore, that a great number of them will refuse to leave the Gurgan plain, and that 1,500 is the maximum force which Mohamed Ali Mirza may expect to obtain from the Turkomans ; and although at the start these auxiliaries may be of help to the ex-Shah in awing the people into submission, 3 ^et in the end their depredations are bound to cause an uprising of the down-trodden peasantry. Should this happen, Mohamed Ali Mirza will find it difficult to obtain food supplies for his men, and this will be the beginning of the breaking up of his force. Another point of weakness amongst the Turkomans when in the field is their tribal constitution. They still preserve the patriarchal system in its most ancient form, which we may assimilate to the most advanced socialism. No Turkoman is superior to his brother tribesmen. This principle is carried so far that there is no real redress for any offence (unless the offended party be stronger than the offender), as the elders of the tribe have no power to enforce their decision unless it be by mutual agreement of the parties concerned. No. 317. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received August 28.) Sir, Tehran, August 9, 1911. SINCE my despatch of the 28th ultimo, the ex-Shah has advanced to Sari, the capital of Mazanderan, where his brother Shoa-es-Sultaneh, who had been left behind at Astrabad to raise funds and collect all the arms and ammunition to be found in the town, has rejoined him. The ex-Shah is said to have with him some 1,000 men, mostly Turcomans, and three mountain guns. A further force of 600 men and three guns under Sardar Assad had been advancing along the Meshed-Tehran road and has now occupied Damghan, which it captured after some fighting. A Government force, said to be 1,400 strong, under Sardar Mohi, one of the Sipahdar’s lieutenants at the time of the revolution, has been dispatched from Tehran to seize the passes into Mazanderan, in the Firuzkuh neighbourhood, some 70 miles east of Tehran, and it is said to have forestalled Reshid-es-Sultan, who was sent from the north to occupy the passes for the ex-Shah. I understand that the Government do not rely so much on this force for dealing with Mohamed Ali as on one which Yeprim, the chief of police, is now organising in Tehran, and which he will command in conjunction with Sardar Bahadur. It is confidently hoped that when this force is ready its leaders will meet with the same success as in their campaign against Rahim Khan in Azerbaijan the winter before last. Salar-ed-Dowleh is in possession of Kermanshah. He has with him some 6,000 men. Amir Mufakham, Bakhtiari Governor of Burujird, has been ordered to proceed [ 188 ] ‘ 2148 against him. He must have a respectable force, as he has recently been occupied in quelling the Lurs and is reported to have met with some success, but so far there are no signs of his moving on Kermanshah. He is a member of the Haji Ilkhani branch of the Bakhtiari, and fought on Mohamed Ali’s side at the time of the revolution so it would not be surprising if he refused to fight against Salar-ed-Dowleh. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 318. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 28.) Sir, Tehran, August 9, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 11th duty, respecting the state of security on the southern roads, I have the honour to report that not only is the Shiraz-Ispahan road still unsafe, but the Bakhtiari road has been subjected to so many robberies that Messrs. Lynch have suspended the forwarding of merchandise. The muleteers, wdio are already insufficient to deal with the accumulation of goods on that road, which the agent tells me would take about two years to work off, refuse to expose themselves and their animals to the attacks of the Kuhgeluis and Bahmai tribes. The officials of the Indo-European Telegraph Department at Shiraz also find it impossible to induce muleteers to face the risks of inspection journeys unless an indemnity is guaranteed beforehand for their losses. His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan reported on the 8th July that the temporary amelioration noted in my above-mentioned despatch had not been maintained. Reports of robberies on almost all roads in Ispahan territory had been received during the preceding week. On the 15th July Mr. Consul-General Graharae reported that the “ Shiraz postal road was practically deserted, and that any caravans arriving were coming by circuitous routes.” This, however, does not ensure safety, as a telegram from Shiraz dated the 29th July states that a caravan of bank specie arriving from Ispahan by the Sarhad road had suffered loss by the theft of cases of 1,500 tomans, at Khosrow Shirin, the summer quarters of Soulet-ed-Dowleh Finally, writing under date of the 29th July, Mr. Grahame states that, “ with the exception of the Yezd road, there is now no trade route considered safe for merchandise.” The losses suffered by Messrs. Ziegler and the action taken by me in regard thereto have been duly reported to you by telegraph, but I have the honour to transmit herewith copies of despatches from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan,* giving further particulars relating _ to recent robberies both on the Bakhtiari and southern roads, and certain observations received from Messrs. Ziegler’s agent in that town, pointing out the detriment to British trade arising from the insecurity of the roads by which Ispahan is furnished with supplies from the south. In conclusion, I would mention that the safety of the Ispahan-Tehran road is further threatened by the presence of Naib Hussein’s men, and that Messrs. Lynch have also suspended the transport of goods on that road. They have, however, dispatched merchandise by special caravans which will attempt to reach Tehran by a circuitous route. I have, &amp;c.

Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for the four weeks from July 13 to August 9, 1911. Tehran. The Cabinet. —On the 19th July the Sipahdar formed a Cabinet which was composed as follows :— Prime Minister Minister of Interior .. Minister of War Minister of Foreign Affairs Minister of Justice .. * Minister of Finance .. Minister of Posts, &amp;c. Minister of Education Sipahdar. Vossuk-ed-Dowleh. Samsam-es-Sultaneh. Mohtashem-es-Sultaneh. Kavam-es-Sultaneh. Moavin-ed-Do wleh. Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Hakim-ul-Mulk. This Cabinet did not last more than five days and on the 24th July Sipahdar tendered his resignation, which was accepted by the Kegent, and on the 26th July Samsam-es-Sultaneh, the ilkhani of the Bakhtiari tribe, became Premier and presented the following Cabinet to the Medjliss :— Prime Minister and Minister of War Minister for Foreign Affairs Minister of Interior .. Minister of Finance .. Minister of J ustice .. Minister of Posts, &amp;c. Minister of Education Samsam-es-Sultaneh. V ossuk-ed- Dowleh. Kavam-es-Sultaneh. Hakim-ul-Mulk. Mush ir-ed-D o wle h. Dabir-ul-Mulk. Ala-es- Sultaneh. On the 1st instant Dabir-ul-Mulk resigned and left for Europe. He was succeeded on the 3rd instant by a deputy called Moazed-es-Sultaneh, who had until then never held ministerial office. Political Arrests. —Shortly after the Medjliss had approved the proclamation of martial law, several political arrests were made, including that of Haji Majd-ed-Dowleh, K.C.M.G., Amin-ed-Dowleh, and Zahir-ul-Islam. The arrest of Majd-ed-Dowleh was attended with some bloodshed. The Medjliss. —At an extraordinary sitting convoked on the 19th July the Medjliss was asked by the Cabinet to approve the proclamation of martial law in Tehran and in the provinces, if necessary. The measure was agreed to unanimously. The arrival of the ex-Shah Mohamed Ali in Persia on the 17th July, which was the cause of the proclamation of martial law in Tehran, resulted in a temporary coalition of the two principal parties in the Medjliss, namely, the “ Moderates ” and the “ Democrats.” At the sitting of the 29th July the Medjliss unanimously agreed to a motion that 100,000 tomans should be offered to anyone who killed the ex-Shah or arrested him, and 25,000 tomans each with the same object in regard to the ex-Shah’s brothers Salar-ed-Dowleh and Shoa-es-Sultaneh. At the same sitting the House unanimously agreed to grant Major Stokes a pension of 250L a-year in case his contract was not renewed after a lapse of three years at which it was fixed. The Medjliss has lately been occupied chiefly in debating the new electoral law, which is on the basis of direct elections instead of elections through electoral colleges, as was the case at the last general election two years ago. The Press.—The “ Iran-i-Nau,” one of the principal Tehran daily papers, was suppressed for about ten days owing to a violent attack on Sipahdar and his^ Cabinet. It reappeared on the 8th instant with an article dealing with the return of the ex-Shah to Persia, in which England and Bussia are accused of complicity with Mohamed Ali. Tabreez. The Government of Tabreez is for the time under Prince Amanullah Mirza, and so far no Governor-General has left Tehran, though Prince Ain-ed-Dowleh has been designated for the post. [188] L 3i50 Resht. The town is quiet, though there is some excitement owing to the arrival in Persia of the ex-Shah. The Governor of Ghilan, Yamin-ul-Mamalek, is said to have resigned. Meshed. Sahib Ekhtiar, the Governor-General of Khorassan, left Meshed for Tehran at the end of June. So far no successor to him has been chosen. Reshid-es-Sultan has left Sabzevar, and is now in Mazanderan apparently operating in the interests of the ex-Shah. Ispahan. In transmitting his weekly report on the 8th July His Majesty’s consul-general drew attention to the recrudescence of road robberies on almost all the roads in the Ispahan governorship, as also to the maladministration which prevailed throughout the province. On the 23rd July Muin-i-Homayun, brother of Sardar Mohtashem Bakhtiari, left Ispahan for Tehran with about 135 Bakhtiaris and some other horsemen. Sardar Mohtashem and Sardar Bahadur are said to be about to leave for Tehran with all the available Bakhtiaris. The Governor of Ispahan estimates the number of men under the two khans at 2,000, but this is thought to be an exaggeration. Bobberies are reported by Messrs. Lynch Brothers on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road, which has in consequence been temporarily closed to traffic. Yezd. The new governor, Fakhr-ul-Mulk, left for the hills soon after his arrival, and placed Haji Kavam Divan in charge. The latter has fled to Tehran, and Yezd appears to be without a governor again. The notorious outlaw Naib Hussein is reported to be in the direction of Ardistan with some 250 horsemen. Shiraz. Jhe unsatisfactory condition of affairs in the town of Shiraz, reported upon fully in the last summary, has continued without intermission up to the present. Nizam-es- Sultaneh continues to be Governor-General, though when Samsam-es-Sultaneh became Premier it was generally thought that the intention was to dismiss the Nizam at once. The Bulvardis continue to defy the governor, who persists in his attempts to dislodge them from the quarter they have occupied, but so far without success. Firing has been going on intermittently, since the 8th July, and on two occasions the Nizam threatened to bombard the rebels. On the 30th July Bahadur-ul-Mulk, one of the Kawam’s principal retainers, was murdered by Ata-ed-Dowleh’s men. The Kashgais have been coming into Shiraz in small detachments, and have plundered villages and houses with impunity. The Kawam-ul-Mulk remains in the consulate. Seistan. Major O Connor writes from Birjand that the Baluchis have been raiding the Kainat, at the instigation of Hashmat-ul-Mulk. The Arab population of the district streamed into Birjand, and camped round about in their black tents. The leading merchants opened a relief fund for them. A small party of three or four Bussian Cossacks, who were returning to Turbat from the borders of the Kainat, whither they had escorted a Bussian lady, were attacked by Baluch robbers, and robbed of everything they possessed, including rifles and horses. The roads in the whole province remain unsafe. Kerman. Sardar Moby, who was reported in the last summary to have been appointed Governor-General of Kerman, has now been sent in command of troops against theex-Shah, and Prince Amir Azam has been appointed Governor-General of Kerman in his place. On the 12th July, in consequence of the persecution of the Parsees, about 100 of them took refuge in His Majesty’s consulate. On the 15th July, the weaving establish ments having been threatened by the mob, the weavers joined the Parsees in bast at His Majesty’s consulate. On the 17th July, a Parsee refugee who left the con sulate to buy food in the town, was shot dead, and his murderer has not yet been apprehended. Kermanshdh. Salar-ed-Dowleh left Kurdistan on the 24th July for Kermanshah where he arrived on the 30th July. In the meantime all the Tehran officials had been expelled from tbe town which made no resistance whatever to the Prince. A number of persons who took bast at His Majesty’s consulate left on the 29th July, on a guarantee of safety from Daoud Khan, the chief of the Kalhur tribe who is supporting Salar-ed-Dowleh. Hamadan. His Majesty’s consul at Kermanshah telegraphed on the 1st instant that the Hamadan agent reported grave disorders in the town. He said that killing and plundering was going on and that his colleagues were protecting foreign subjects and flying flags. The agent was instructed by His Majesty’s consul to protect British subjects to the best of his ability, and a flag was sent to him by post. Bushire. The district appears to be in a normal condition and there is no news of interest to report. No. 320. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 30.) (Telegraphic.) Gulaheh, August 30, 1911. EN-SHAH movement. I learn that a force of the ex-Shah has been defeated at Firuzkuh by the Government troops. Former reported to have had 100 casualties.

FOLLOWING- telegram has been received from Kerman :— “ Roads between Kerman and Bunder Abbas extremely insecure ; large consign ments carpets in Kerman ready for dispatch. Acting governor offers escorts, but declines responsibility. Some twelve Europeans purpose leaving Kerman for Bunder Abbas this autumn ; their departure m many cases matter of necessity, but 1 cannot assure them any prospect change for better, nor obtain assurance from governor that they will be adequately protected. Danger not only from Ears but from Baluchs said to be preparing send in Narmashir and Jiruft, and tribes in Kerman province likely profit by opportunity offered by general disorders in countiy.152 No. 322.

It is further reported that Amir Mufakham, the Bakhtiari Governor of Luristan has now started from Burujird for Hamadan.

YOUR telegram of the 31st August. » jj &gt; r e + sta + bllshl ^ ent of gendarmerie, what temporary measures can you suggest for protection of southern roads ? JSir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 5.) (Telegraphic.) EX-SHAH movement. Tehran, September 5, 1911. Reference to my telegram of the 27th August. I am informed that an engagement was fought yesterday in the Khar district west of Aradan. Bakhtiaris, who are reported to have had no casualties, defeated Arshad-ed-Dowleh with heavy loss. No. 328. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 7, 1911. SOUTHERN roads. In reply to your telegram of the 4th September, I have the honour to report that I am consulting with His Majesty’s consular officers. The following telegram has, however, just reached me from Kerman “ I regret to report that the condition of the Kerman province is now very grave. Robberies are reported from all sides, and the transport of merchandise is practically suspended on the trade routes Kerman-Bunder Abbas. In the town itself stocks of carpets are accumulating, and payments to weavers have been suspended by one of the two larger European houses. In four days’ time some 5,000 or 6,000 hands will be out of work. In existing conditions the other firm will not be able to issue orders much longer for goods which cannot be disposed of, and 4,000 more weavers will be idle. The price of bread and meat is high, and both commodities are scarce ; populace is apprehensive. Persian authorities are entirely unable to deal with the situation, and I gather from the attitude they are taking up that they believe matters to be without remedy, and that the only course worth pursuing is to make what they can before the end comes.” On receipt of this telegram, I urged Central Government to send instructions to the Kerman authorities to provide escorts for the carpets, and thus enable Messrs. Castelli to continue business and provide work for their employes. No. 329. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received September 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 8, 1911. MY telegram of 21st August. Suja-ed-Dowleh is now threatening Tabreez from Basminch. No. 330. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 8.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 8, 1911. AFTER some fighting in neighbourhood of Shiraz, number of Arab and Baharlu chiefs have entered town. They have a considerable following, bulk of which remains outside town engaged in desultory fighting with Kashgais. They declare they have come to avenge Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s death and to protect his family, and announce intention of seizing Governor-General if he is not surrendered to them, but declare they wish to maintain order.154 No. 331. Consul Stevens to Sh' Edward Grey.—(Received September 9.) (Telegraphic.) Batoum, September Q, 1911. ACTING vice-consul at Baku informs me that it is rumoured ex-Shah of Persia arrived and left there 7th September. He could not ascertain destination. No. 332. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 10.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 10, 1911. MY telegram of 8th September. Minister for Foreign Affairs informs me that Russian consul-general has notified Tabreez authorities that, as Russian military force has taken upon itself to protect foreign subjects, and was entrusted with maintenance of order, Persian authorities and the population must not construct barricades or fight within the walls. If they wish to fight they must do so outside town. Russian Minister tells me that standing orders of Russian military authorities in Persia are to prevent pillaging and fighting where troops are quartered. No. 333. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 11, 1911. MY telegram of 10th September. &gt; Russian consul-general at Tabreez reports that he has made to Suja-ed-Dowleh notification similar to that made to Tabreez authorities. No. 334. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 11.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 11, 1911. MY telegram of the 4th September. Vice-consul at Sultanabad reports Salar-ed-Dowleh’s forces have defeated Amir Mufakham who has retreated towards Sultanabad, where his cousin Sardar Zaffar has 500 Bakhtiari reinforcement. No. 335. India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received September 12.) THE Under-Secretary of State for India presents his compliments to the Under secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwards herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State, copy of a telegram from the Viceroy, dated the 9th September, regarding the state of affairs at Bunder Abbas. India Office, September 11, 1911. Enclosure in No. 335. Government of India to the Marquess of Crewe. (Telegraphic.) September 9, 1911. VILLAGES were recently looted by Baharlu raiders to the number of some 400, who appeared unexpectedly in Bunder Abbas district. As a protest against chronic155 state of lawlessness on the trade route and failure to obtain compensation for continued robberies of merchandise, seventeen Hindu merchants at Bunder Abbas closed their shops and proceeded to the consulate. Increase to fifty men under one officer from Jask has been effected in Bunder Abbas consular guard. Two hundred Persian troops will shortly proceed from Bushire to Bunder Abbas, and there are now no raiders in neighbourhood of latter place. Pending arrival of troops, His Majesty’s ship “ Espiegle ” will stand by ; after their arrival, she will go back with extra consular guard to Jask. No. 336. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey.—{Received September 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 12, 1911. EX-SHAH movement. It would seem that the insurrection in M'azanderan is in a bad plight. From Astrabad the Russian consul reports Mohamed Ali Mirza’s reappearance at Gumesh Tepe with seven followers. At Barf rush Amir Mukarram has taken bast at the Russian vice-consulate. No. 337. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 12, 1911. MY telegram of 8th September. Following from acting consul at Tabreez :— “ During past week merchants twice visited Suja-ed-Dowleh to prevent him attacking the town. He demands permission to enter Tabreez, failing which he declares he will stop supplies. All roads, except Julfa road, are closed. Price of food is rising rapidly. ' “ The nationalists are preparing a supreme effort to oppose Suja-ed-Dowleh; have erected barricades in outskirts of the town and distributed 4,000 rifles. No. 338. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 13.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 13, 1911. MY telegram of 8th September. Following fro m His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire : “ Our interests are enormously prejudiced by continued retention of Kawam in consulate, and the action of his household in introducing and harbouring these conspirators (Arab and Baharlu chiefs are reported to be staying in the house of Kawam i seems to me to afford every justification for getting rid of him, if we can do so without undue risk to his life. Could we not say to Governor-General,^ If you and Soulet will telegraph to Persian Government a solemn undertaking to remain quiet and respect his safety, we will send Kawam in charge of consular escort to a point agreed to and there hand him over to Khamseh chiefs, provided that Kawam on that date telegraphs to Persian Government that he will remain quietly with tribes outside striking distance of Shiraz, and there await orders of Central Government as to his future ’ ? ” I concur in above proposal, and am endeavouring to reach settlement on these lines, but I need your sanction for proposed employment of part of consular escort.156 No. 339. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received September 13.) Tehran, September 13, 1911. (Telegraphic.) SHIRAZ. Governor-General is bombarding eastern quarter, where Kawam’s house is situated. No. 340. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 13.) (Telegraphic.) ^ ^ Tehran, September 13, 1911. FOLLOWING is substance of a message from Minister for Foreign Affairs :— Government force from Firuzkuh has totally dispersed ex Shah’s forces in Savadkuh. Ex-Shah reached Gumesh Tepe by boat from Kara Tepe, near Ashraf. His Majesty’s only chance now of avoiding capture is that he should take refuge on Russian soil or on Russian ship. Either form of asylum would be a violation not only of article 10 of protocol, but also of the declaration of non-interference. Article 10 precludes further asylum being given to former bastis and should a fortiori apply to ex-Shah. Principle of non-intervention is clearly violated if whenever ex-Shah is in difficulties he is given asylum in Russia, with opportunity of making Russian territory a base from which he can safely resume fomenting of troubles and of bloodshed, which have occasioned Persian Government ruinous expense and for which he has been twice expelled. Persian Government are appealing on these grounds to Russian Government in confidence that ex-Shah will not be allowed access to Russian territory, and, if by chance he succeeds in eluding vigilance of Russian authorities, that he and his companions wdll be arrested and handed back to Persian Government. Tehran, September 14, 1911. No. 341. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—(Received September 14.) (Telegraphic.) SITUATION at Shiraz. Reference to my telegram dated the 13th September. Nizam-es-Sultaneh informs acting consul that he would rather that Kawam remained at the consulate than that he should be delivered into the hands of his tribes, as he is unable to trust Kawam’s assurances. ^. or P resen L therefore, I fear that retention of Kawam in the consulate is unavoidable. No. 342. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 14.) Tehran, September 14, 191L (Telegraphic.) SOUTHERN roads. re ply to your telegram of the 4th September, I have the honour to report a none Gox makes the following suggestions for action, which the existing anarcny would, I consider, thoroughly justify, and which would bring about an mime la e amelioration in the state of affairs without constituting intervention. le sc erne pioposed w r ould at the same time avoid the prospect of those far-reaching consequences which an occupation of the roads by British troops would entail, r olio wing is a resume of Colonel Cox’s proposals :— 1 he addition of 100 men to the mounted escorts at Ispahan, Bushire, Kerman, an undei Abbas ; the addition of 200 men to the Shiraz escort, and the establish-raent of a vice-consulate with an escort of 200 men at Bam. Colonel Cox further suggests that suitable officers should he placed in command of these escorts, which he proposes should be used in detachments of up to fifty men for escorting organised British caravans dispatched at occasional intervals. A warning would be given to the khans and tribesmen who dwell along the roads that the continued insecurity of the routes for purposes of trade had driven us to take these precautions, and they might further be informed that we hoped for their friendly co-operation. Our arrangements would, on the other hand, be made more comprehensive if they showed hostility or withheld their co-operation. The guards would be reduced as soon as the gendarmerie developed into an effective body. No. 343. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 14, 1911. EX-SHAH is reported to be on the Caspian Sea ready to land at any centres of fresh disorder should the opportunity occur. We presume that, if the report is true, Bussian Government will do what is necessary to prevent his committing any abuse of Russian asylum. You should ask them whether they have any information as to Mohamed Ali’s present whereabouts. No. 344. Sir G. Buchanan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 15.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, September 15, 1911. I SAW M. Neratof to-day, and addressed to him an enquiry as instructed in your telegram of the 14th September. His Excellency said that Mohamed Ali would not be received on board any of the steamers plying regularly on the Caspian under the Russian flag unless instructions to take him were given to them or unless he should contrive to make his way on board in disguise. It was impossible, however, for the Russian Government to prevent the ex-Shah escaping on any boat which a private individual might place at his disposal. From the language used by M. Neratof I gathered that if Mohamed Ali were to succeed in making his way to Baku the Russian Government would certainly not hand him over to the Persian Government, while his Excellency further intimated that bast could not be refused to His Majesty. I reminded M. Neratof of our declaration as to non-intervention and of the terms of article 10 of the protocol. He said that his Government were anxious to act up to their engagements, and promised to look up the article of the protocol to which I had referred. No. 345. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Buchanan. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 16, 1911. PERSIAN Government have informed us that the ex-Shah is at Gumesh Tepe, and they fear he may seek asylum on a Russian vessel. They express the hope that such asylum will be refused. Please ascertain whether a similar communication has been made to the Russian Government, and what steps they propose to take. No. 346. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 17.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 17, 1911. MY telegram of 12th September. Acting consul at Tabreez reports that Suja-ed-Dowleh surprised camp of Government troops, capturing one gun and some prisoners ; fighting was continuing.158 No. 347. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 17.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 17, 1911. MY telegram of 13th September. Acting consul-general at Shiraz reports bombardment ceased 15th September apparently owing to want of ammunition. There was fighting at close quarters during the night without apparently decisive result. No. 348. Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 17.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 17, 1911. MY telegram of 11th September. British vice-consul reports that Salar-ed-Dowleh’s forces took Sultanabad 14th September. Bakhtiaris have fallen back on Kum. Salar has telegraphed Kermanshah that he will proceed to Tehran via Sultanabad. No. 349. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 18.) THE Persian Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to enclose herewith translation of a telegram he has received from his Government regarding the action of the Russian consular agent in Ban dare Gez. The Persian Minister is directed to draw the attention of Sir Edward Grey to. these very serious violations of the independence and the integrity of Persia. Mirza Mehdi Khan most earnestly hopes that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs will do what he thinks advisable to put a stop to these acts, which are inexplicable, and can only result in disturbing the country. Bandare Gez is only a short distance from Gumish-teppe, whither the ex-Shah has fled. It is most regrettable that at a time when the sarhaddar was most needed at Bandare Gez in order to keep watch he should have been thus forcibly removed! It cannot be denied that reparation and a full explanation is due to the Persian Government. Persian Legation, London, September 16, 1911. Enclosure in No. 349. Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mirza Mehdi Khan. (Translation.) (Telegraphic.) 1 HE Russian consular agent at Bandare Gez has with the help of some Cossacks arrested the sarhaddar (the official who is entrusted with the keeping of the frontier) of Bandare Gez, and has sent him to Astrabad. Furthermore, sixteen soldiers have been sent to Bandare Gez and have arrested several of the leading merchants, including the manager of Messrs. Toumaniantz’s office, and have taken them on board a Russian war-ship. I have asked the Russian Minister for an explanation of this extraordinary action. The Russian consular agent in question should be removed from his post. No. 350. Mirza Mehdi Khan to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 18.) I HE Persian Minister presents his compliments to the Secretary of State for foreign Affairs, and has the honour to refer his Excellency to his calls at the ForeignOffice on the 13th and 15th instant regarding - the flight of the ex-Shah to Garnish Tappe and to the conversation the Minister has had with Sir Arthur Nicolson. Mirza Mehdi Khan would like to leave no doubt as to the great importance which his Government attach to this question. On the occasion of his visits to the Foreign Office he has put forward in detail the views of his Government. Now he wishes merely to emphasize certain points. The Persian Government do not for a single moment suppose that in view of the nature of the case the ex-Shah will be allowed by the Russian Government to enter their territory. Should he be allowed to do so, or should he be afforded refuge in Russia or on board a Russian vessel, this will he considered, in the first place, as a direct violation of the protocol of 1909, and, in the second place, as an act contrary to the assurances given by Great Britain and Russia (in answer to the protests of the Persian Government when Mohamed Ali Mirza returned to Persia), that, seeing that the ex-Shah had returned to Persia in contravention of the protocol of 1909, they would no longer give him any protection. After the events which have taken place, should the ex-Shah be afforded an asylum either in Russia or on board a Russian vessel, this will produce the very worst impression throughout Persia. Moreover, it will encourage the rebels and weaken the hands of the Govern ment, and it will enable the ex-Shah to recommence his intrigues against the Persian Government with the assurance that he will always, when hard pressed, find a refuge in Russia. Persian Legation, London, September 16, 1911. No. 351 Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 19.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 19, 1911. PERSIAN Government have again recalled Nizam. There seems to he for the moment no one in authority in Shiraz, for the karguzar has replied to acting consul’s request for protection of British houses that Nizam refuses to take any action in regard to Fars affairs, and that man appointed deputy governor pending arrival of new governor has apparently left the town, and that he himself is unable to negotiate with tribes. I have asked Persian Government for an immediate pronouncement as to who is the authority locally responsible for order with whom acting consul should deal. Acting consul reports situation is altogether most disquieting, and recommends the immediate dismissal of Kashgai chief, Soulet. I am not prepared to advise this course, which is one which a Government with Bakhtiari Prime Minister would of their own motion have adopted had they felt strong enough. I prefer at this juncture altogether to refrain from advice to Persian Government with regard to quarrels in Fars. No. 352. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edicard Grey.—(Received September 19.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 19, 1911. IT appears that Salar-ed-Dowleh is now a pretender to the throne. He has addressed telegrams to the Cabinet and to the Medjliss in which he uses the expression “ Our Majesty?” He announces his arrival at Kum in three days. * 1 No. 353. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.— (Received September 19.) (Telegraphic ) Tehran, September 19, 1911 ' ACTING consul at Shiraz to-day reports that Soulet has arrived with about 1 000 men at garden, 1 mile from consulate. One consulate servant has already been assaulted and beaten by his men, Deputy governor apparently was abducted by one160 of Soulets dependents^ Acting consul states his conviction, unless Soulet can be induced either by Persia or ourselves to quit neighbourhood, situation, already verv disquieting, will become immediately worse. Telegram concludes :— “ It is now two and a-half months our interests have been most gravely suffering from complete anarchy, which has now reached such a point that, on confession Government’s representative, there is no authority in Shiraz capable of taking any steps to protect lives of British subjects and property. In this intolerable state of affairs I can see no other course but to write Soulet that, if he does not forthwith remove himself with his men from the neighbourhood, leaving Government of Persia free hand for restoration of order as they think fit, His Majesty’s Government will immediately take steps to protect our interests.” I have replied as follows :— “ You should inform Soulet his presence with tribesmen in Shiraz only makes for disoidei, and, should any harm to British life property render intervention necessarv consequences will be visited on him.” ino.

YOUR telegram of 19th September : Shiraz. . Message which you have sent to Soulet through acting consul seems sufficient loi “ Soulet has published notice that he has come to Shiraz to support Nizam to restore order and punish Arabs, declaring he will soon attack these, and if any house holder through whose premises Kashgais wish to pass does not open doors to them, they will be forced, and householder would be responsible for ensuing trouble. “I think now indubitable situation holds no alternative to Soulet’s removal, and if that is not immediately effected, crisis can only become more acute. “ It is difficult to over-estimate immense damage which will result to. our interests from oeneral pillage of bazaars, since, apart from very large quantities of British G'oods accumulated here, we cannot lose sight of the fact that e\eiy loss suffered by local dealers reacts directly on our own merchants, by whom they are almost entirely supplied, and with every day Kashgais remain such contingency becomes “Karguzar offers local troops for protection of British subjects, and this will have to be accepted as the only available guards ; such starving vagabonds are, however, entirely useless, and will never resist tribesmen, even if they do not themselves set “ In my opinion, therefore, if Kashgais cannot immediately be withdrawn, it will be incumbent on us to take direct steps for protection of_ our interests, since while they continue here there is no possibility any Persian authority doing so effectually. t-f i from Persian Government to Soulet to leave Shiraz would be No. 358.

Neratof thinks he would probably return to that town. If he should do so, all proper precautions would be taken, and he would be kept under surveillance, but it was not possible for the kussian Government to give a guarantee that his recent attempt would never be lenewed. Ihe ex-Shah had been greatly disillusioned, for he had returned to Persia with the full conviction that he would be received everywhere with open arms. He had had his lesson, and M. Neratof said he felt sure that he would not renew the attempt. pH asking M.

En ce qui concerne les services que le Gouvernement persan attend du Major Stokes, cet officier ddmissionnaire de I’armee britannique ayant ete engage pour organiser la gendarmerie de la Tresorerie, le Gouvernement Imperial n’a pas rintention de femployer dans aucune operation de guerre. Le 6 aout, 1911. (Translation.) IT is necessary to levy taxes both in the north and in the south of Persia, and in the eyes of the Persian Government there is no distinction to be made between the two regions. As regards the services which the Persian Government expect from Major Stokes, this officer, who has retired from the British army, having been engaged to organise the Treasury gendarmerie, the Imperial Government have no intention of employing him in any military operations. August 6, 19] 1. Enclosure 2 in No. 365. Aide-memoire communicated to Persian Government by Sir G. Barclay. SIR G. BARCLAY is instructed by His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to warn the Persian Government that they ought not to persist in the appointment of Major Stokes unless he is not to be employed in Northern Persia. If the Persian Government do persist, His Majesty’s Government will recognise Russia’s right to take such steps as she thinks are necessary in order that her interests in Northern Persia may be safeguarded. August 8, 1911. Enclosure 3 in No. 365. Note verbale received from Persian Government. IL ressort de 1’aide-nffimoire de la Legation de Sa Majeste britannique, en date du 8 courant que dans le cas oil le Gouvernement persan persistait k engager le Major Stokes [188] N164 a son service et a 1’employer dans toutes les regions de la Perse indistinctement, il se heurterait a certains inconvdnients. Le Gouvernement Imperial, n’etant pas a meme de s’expliquer sur quelle base reposerait cette maniere de voir du Gouvernement anglais, qui ne decoule daucun engagement, ne peut s’empdcher d’exprimer la surprise que lui a cause I’aide-memoire precite. Supposant m6me qu’en elevant certaines objections la Legation de Sa Majeste britannique voulait s’appuyer sur les termes de Tarrangement anglo-russe du 31 aout, 1907 (au sujet duquel le Gouvernement persan n’a pas manque de signaler son attitude dans la note de son Excellence Muchir-ed-Dowleh en date du 25 Pamazan, 1325), on ne pourrait trouver dans ladite convention un seul mot de nature a soutenir la th&amp;se tormulee par Taide-memoire susmentionne. Au contraire, le preambule de cet arrangement, qui respecte, dans les termes les plus categoriques, Tindependance et Tintegrite de la Perse, constituerait un argument de plus pour prouver le point de vue du Gouvernement Imperial. Ce mbme preambule constate, en outre, que les Gouvernements anglais et russe ont eu principalement it coeur la preservation de 1’ordre et le developpement pacifique de la Perse; cette phrase ne pourrait dtre interprdtee que de maniere a favoriser le but du Gouvernement Imperial, qui desire prendre les dispositions propres a faire rentrer les impots, sans lesquels le maintien de I’ordre, dans tout pays, serait une tache des plus difliciles. Vossough-ed-Dowleh est done persuade que le Gouvernement de Sa Majesty britannique, reconnaissant le bien-fonde des arguments precites, voudra bien prater au Gouvernement persan ses bons offices a I’effet de donner 5, cette question une solution conforme k la dignite de la Perse et h son interdt le plus vital. Le 11 aout, 1911. (Translation.) IT appears from the memorandum communicated by His Britannic Majesty’s Legation on the 8th instant that in the event of the Persian Government persisting in taking Major Stokes into their service and in employing him in all parts of Persia without distinction they would find themselves confronted with certain disagreeable consequences. I he Imperial Government, being unable to understand on what the British Government base their point of view, which does not result from any engagement, cannot refrain from expressing their surprise at receiving the memorandum in question. Even supposing that in raising certain objections His Britannic Majesty’s Legation intended to Base their action on the terms of the Anglo-Bussian arrangement of the 31st August, 1907 (on the subject of which the Persian Government did not fail to state their attitude in his Excellency Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note of Bamazan 25, 1325), it would be impossible to find in that convention a single word to support the thesis formulated in the above-mentioned memorandum. Oil the contrary, the preamble of this arrangement, which expresses in the most categorical terms respect for the independence and integrity of Persia, would seem to constitute a further argument in support of the point of view of the Imperial Government. I his same preamble states, moreover, that the British and Bussian Governments have had principally at heart the preservation of order and the pacific development of Persia; this phrase could only be interpreted as favouring the aims of the Imperial Government, who desire to take steps to collect the taxes, for without taxes the maintenance of order in any country would be a most difficult task. ^ Vossuk-ed-Dowleh is therefore confident that His Britannic Majesty’s Go\ eminent will recognise the soundness of the above arguments and will be good enough to lend the Persian Government their good offices so that this question may be solved in conformity with the dignity of Persia and her most vital interests.

A nm r ^|® ran ^ a ^ a declaration faite par moi au Ministre des Affaires Etrangeres le (2 J) juillet, annde courante, j ai 1’honneur, d’ordre de mon Gouvernement, de porter ala connaissance du Gouvernenient persan que le Gouvernement Imperial de Russie, pour des raisons expliquees en son temps au Gouvernement persan, considere 1 engagement par ce dernier du Major Stokes comme chef des forces armees—dites gendarmerie pour la perception des impots comme incompatible avec ses interdts, et je suis charge de protester centre cette nomination.

(Translation.) REFERRING to the declaration which I made to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 16th (29th) July of this year, I have the honour, by order of my Government, to bring to the knowledge of the Persian Government that the Imperial Russian Government, for reasons explained at the time to the Persian Government, consider that the engagement of Major Stokes by the latter as head of the armed forces—called gendarmerie—for the collection of the taxes is incompatible with their interests, and I am instructed to protest against this appointment. Should occasion arise, the Imperial Government will reserve to themselves the right to take such steps as they may consider necessary to safeguard their interests in the north of Persia, August 6 (19), 1911. Enclosure 5 in No. 365. Note communicated to the Persian Government by Sir G. Barclay. HIS Britannic Majesty’s Legation is instructed by His Majesty’s Government to repeat the warning given on the 8th instant, to the effect that unless Major Stokes is not to be employed in Northern Persia, the Persian Government ought not to persist in the appointment, and if they do persist His Majesty’s Government will recognise the right of Russia to take what steps she thinks necessary to safeguard her interests in Northern Persia. In reminding the Persian Government of the above communication, His Majesty’s Legation is to urge on the Persian Government the appointment of some subject of a minor Power in the place of Major Stokes, and to state that His Majesty’s Government cannot accept Major Stokes’s resignation in view of the well-founded Russian objections to his appointment. August 19, 1911. No. 366. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 25.) Sir, Tehran, September 4, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 366. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia for period August 10 to September 4. Tehran. European Officials.—Luring the past four weeks the following officials have arrived at Tehran :— Colonel Hjalmarson, Major Skjoldebrand, Major Petersen, Swedish gendarmerie officers. T 0 [188] N 2166 M. Dumorgny, attached to the Ministry of the Interior. M. Perny, attached to the Ministry of Justice. Mr. Merrill (United States) attached to Mr. Shuster. M. Privet (France), Mr. Shuster’s private secretary. Military Operations. —The Government force, which left Tehran at the beginning of August under Sardar Mohy, and was joined by Muin-i-Homayun Bakhtiari and about 300 of his men, defeated Beshid-es-Sultan near Firuzkuh on or about the 9th August. Sardar Arshad, one of Mohamed Ali’s lieutenants, proceeded with a force, estimated at between 2,000 and 3,000 men, along the Meshed road from Shahrud to Damghan, Semnan, and Aradan. A force of Bakhtiari, under Zaigham-es-Sultaneh opposed his advance at the latter place, and was defeated on or about the 25th August! Amir-i-Mujahid Bakhtiari was sent to the front soon afterwards with reinforcements. Sardar Mohtashem and Sardar Bahadur arrived at Tehran from the Bakhtiari country on the 31st August with about 1,200 men. The latter left with Yeprem and a large force on the 3rd instant to operate against Sardar Arshad. On the 26th ultimo the Government troops at Firuzkuh defeated a royalist force and captured a number of prisoners, fifty-four of whom have since been sent to Tehran. Some horses and rifles were taken at the same time. The Medjliss. —The Cabinet’s programme, which included the revision of the constitution and improved foreign relations, was submitted for inclusion in the order oi the day at the sitting of the 26th August. On a division the motion was rejected, but it was decided to refer the programme to a select committee. This action on the part of^ the Medjliss nearly caused the fall of Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s Cabinet. The Foreign Minister and the Minister of the Interior actually tendered their resignations. The Begent, however, intervened, with the result that on the 2nd instant the programme was approved by the majority with a few unimportant modifications. The Press .—The “ Iran-i-Nau ” is again suppressed, and the “ Isteklal-i-Iran ” has ceased to appear owing to want of funds. The only important paper now appearing is the “ Medjliss.” Tabreez. Samad Khan, Shuja-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Maragha, mentioned in the summary of June, has announced that he has been appointed Governor of Azerbaijan by the ex-Shah. Ain-ed-Dowleh, the new governor appointed by the Government, is still at Tehran making preparations for his departure. The province seems to be in a normal condition. Resht. ^ Saidar Motamid, a native landowner of Resht, succeeded Yemin-ul-Mamalek as Governor of Ghilau at the beginning of August, but declared soon after that he was unable to carry on. Though there have been rumours of the arrival of Shoa-es-Sultaneh and others in tie inteiest of the ex-Shah, so far there has been no move of the kind, and the province remains comparatively quiet. Kazvin. Sardai Homayun, another Resht landowner, has resigned the governorship of Kazvm and returned to Resht. Meshed. The distui bailees which occurred at Meshed at the end of Julv, as reported in last summary, were brought about by the police attempting to capture an official of the shrine who was accused of embezzlement. Major Sykes writes that if the rioters had gamed the upper hand there is no doubt that they would have declared for the ex-Shah. He thinks that the large majority of people are so tired of the tyranny of t e Young Peisians that they will welcome the ex-Shah should he regain the throne. j 25th July telegrams were received from the ex-Shah by various officials at Meshed. I heir purport was to express grief for Persia’s troubles, to promise pardon for past offences, to declare that all future hostility would be punished with severity, to maintain the constitution, and to create an Upper House. I he high loads m Khorassan are reported infested by robbers.Ispahan. The condition oi Ispahan, where Sardar Ashja Bakhtiari is governor, is unchanged. The town and province have been fairly quiet, though there have been some complaints of Bakhtian excesses On the 16th August Sardar Mohtashem and Sardar Bahadur arrived with over 1,000 Bakhtians on their way to Tehran. They exchanged visits with His Majesty s consul-general. On their way to Tehran news was received of Naib ussem s advance on Kashan, and the two sardars sent back from Kmn about 250 Bakhtiaris under Zia-es-Sultan and Shahab-es-Sultaneh. On the 22nd August Naib Hussein captured Ardistan and advanced towards Kasban. On the 1st and 2nd beptember Naib Hussein was attacked by a Bakhtiari force at Khalidabad and later at r. , a r v 0 , 11 . e carnage road vi&amp; Natanz between Kashan and Ispahan) and defeated forty of his men being killed. The Bakhtiaris did not pursue the retreating enemy, as they were apparently too busy dealing with the large quantity of loot he had left behind. Yezd. There have been several robberies in the province lately. On the 23rd Autrust seventy pilgrims were robbed of all their belongings by eighteen mounted robbers at Gudar Jogand. Shortly afterwards Mr. Fenn, of the Telegraph Department, was waylaid and robbed in the direction of Ardekan. Mr. Fenn was searched by the robbers, who even struck him with the butts of their rifles. His Majesty’s Minister has addressed the Persian Government on the subject. Three hundred and fifty Baharlus and Ainalus raided and plundered villages in the Bafsinjan district towards the end of August, carrying away property estimated at 50,000 tomans. Shiraz. The situation in Shiraz on the 21st August became very much worse though there had been continued negotiations for peace. 1 he Kashgais, of whom there were a considerable number in the town, pillaged the houses and openly took the loot to the Palace square. A large cordon of Kashgais was drawn round the British consulate and firing went on at night. The surrounding district was more disturbed than ever and the peasants were being robbed unmercifully. The road to Ispahan was closed, and though the Bushire road, was open merchants had not sufficient confidence to send their goods over it and trade was at a complete standstill. Towards the end of the month further attempts were being made to bring about a truce between the Soulet and the Kawam, who still remained at His Majesty’s consulate. Seistan. All is quiet in the Kainat, but in Seistan the governor, Hashmat-ul-Mulk, was displaying considerable military activity at the beginning of August though his objective was not known. His Majesty’s consul reports that the roads all round Seistan were unsafe at the beginning of August. Kerman. Prince Amir Azam, the newly appointed governor, left Tehran for his post on the 12th August. The province and town are reported quiet, though the roads are as usual unsafe. Kermanshah. Prince Salar-ed-Dowleh left Kermanshah on his way to Hamadan on the 23rd August accompanied by Daoud Khan, Sardar-i-Muzafiar, the head of the Kalhur tribe. The mixed force of Kalhur and other Kurdish tribesmen accompanying the Prince are said to number about 10,000 men. The Prince appointed his younger brother, Azad-es-Sultan, Governor of Kermanshah with Mohtashem-ed-Dowleh as his vice-governor, and confirmed Ferid-ul-Mulk as karguzar or Foreign Office agent. Luristan and Irak. Amir Mufakham Bakhtiari who has been in Luristan for some months and succeeded in restoring tolerable order there, was ordered to proceed with the Bakhtiari force [188] N 3168 under him against Salar-ed-Dowleh. He is said to have 2,000 men and reinforcements were sent from the Bakhtiari country under Morteza Kuli Khan, Samsam-es-Sultaneh’s son, and Sardar Zaffar who left Tehran at the beginning of August for Sultanabad the capital of Irak. Some doubt is felt as to the loyalty of Amir Mufakham and Sardar Zaffar. The former is said to have reached Malayir, but precise information is not available at present as to his movements. Bushire. The governor, Muvakar-ed-Dowleb, has abolished the post of kalantar, which brought in an annual income of 15,000 tomans to the governors of Bushire. He stated that this item was not included in the schedule of Government taxes and that he did not consider it right that he should pocket unauthorised and illegal exactions of the kind. Bunder Abbas. A large raiding force of Baharlu tribesmen, said to have with them two captured field guns, reached Bunder Abbas district at the end of August and were reported to intend raiding the town. His Majesty’s ship “Perseus” was ordered to the spot and was expected to arrive on the 31st August and to reinforce the consular guard by thirty men for the protection in case of need of British and foreign lives and property. No. 367. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 25.) Sir, Tehran, September 4, 1911. SINCE my despatch of the 9th ultimo there has been no development in the present struggle of anything like a decisive character. Amongst the many reported engagements between the Government forces and the rebels, I have confined myself to telegraphing regarding those which were fairly authenticated; they may be recapitulated as follows :— The victory of the Government troops at Firuzkuh on or about the 9th ultimo, which cost the ex-Shah’s force the life of one of his most prominent supporters, Beshid- es-Sultan, who, it will be remembered, assisted Amir Mukarram in his revolt in Mazanderan last year. The conflict a few days later at Deh Namah, just off the Meshed road, between Arshad-ed-Dowleh’s force and some Bakhtiaris under Zaigham es-Sultaneh, resulting in the defeat of the latter and the entry of Arshad-ed-Dowleh’s men into Aradan. The victorjr at Firuzkuh on the 22nd ultimo of Sardar Muhiy’s troops combined with a force of Bakhtiaris under Muin-i-Humayun, who beat off an attack of Turkomans and others, inflicting severe loss and capturing 54 prisoners, 300 rifles, and 100 horses. The further success last week of a force of 300 organised by Yeprim and composed mostly of Armenians, who inflicted a severe defeat at Baladah in Mazanderan on a force of the ex-Shah, said to have numbered 1,500 men. The present position seems to be as follows :— The ex-Shah is in the district of Savad Kuh, but his advance from this quarter on the capital is blocked by Sardar Muhiy and Muin-i-Humayun Bakhtiari at Firuzkuh. His Majesty himself is said to have been loca.ted in a hill fortress, by name Div-i-Safid. Arshad-ed-Dowleh’s force, which had been advancing along the Meshed road, is now reported to be a little off the road west of Aradan, and not more than 45 miles from Tehran. After Zaigham-es-Sultaneh’s defeat, Amir Mujahid, Sardar Assad’s brother, was sent in command of some Bakhtiaris to attack Arsbad-ed-Dowleh, but he has now telegraphed that he is not strong enough, Arshad-ed-Dowleh’s force numbering 3,000 men, and his own not being more than 1,000 strong. Sardar Bahadur, Sardar Assad’s son, in whom, together with Yeprim, the hopes of the constitutionalists chiefly centre, and whose arrival from i Bakhtiari country has been impatiently awaited, has now reached Tehran with a following of 1,200 Bakhtiaris, and they are to start at once with Yeprim to reinforce Zaigham-es-Sultaneh and deal with Arshad-ed-Dowleh.The Aimenian force in Mazanderan, after its success at Baladeh last week, has entered Amul, and, it is hoped, will be able to take the ex-Shah in the Savad Kuh district in the rear. I have little news from Azerbaijan, where Shnja-ed-Dowleh, Governor of Marasdia, is reported to have collected a considerable force of Shahsevans and Karadaghis to ficdit for Mohamed Ah, who has appointed him governor of the province. In the west, Salar-ed-Dowleh left Kermanshah on the 23rd ultimo with nine guns and 10,000 men, mostly Kurds, of the Jaff, Kalhur, and Sinjabi tribes. Before leaving he appointed his brother, Azad-es-Sultan, Governor of Kermanshah. He also before leaving sent from Kermanshah a telegram to the Medjliss, of which, as it is of some interest, I forward a translation. He is now reported to be in the neighbourhood of Daulatabad, where he should be within striking distance of Amir Mnfakham, who has at last moved out of Burujird, but whether the latter intends to oppose Salar-ed-Dowleh or not is still in doubt. It was thought when Salar-ed-Dowleh left Kermanshah that he was going to Hamadan, which is already in the hands of his adherents. He has, however, turned southwards. The Government are apparently relying on Amir Mufakham to deal with him. Should he fail them, there is now only a force of 500 Bakhtiaris under Sardar Zaffar at Sultanabad between Salar-ed-Dowleh and the capital, but it is hard to believe that his force of nomad tribesmen will hold together should he decide to march on the capital. At the moment of writing I learn that my Russian colleague has received a report from his consul at Kermanshah to the effect that since Amir Mufakham’s departure from Burujird the Lurs have declared for Salar-ed-Dowleh, who has appointed the great Lur chieftain, Sardar-i-Akram, his own father-in-law, Governor of Luristan. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure in No. 367. Salar-ed-Dowleh to Medjliss. (Translation.) To the Honourable Medjliss, FROM Kurdistan I telegraphed to you, but you have sent no reply. In place of understanding that telegram and examining the state of the country and curing the diseases you have caused, you made plans to assassinate me and gave bribes to kill me. I myself have come to this country to be killed, and you do not understand that honest God-fearing Persians will not forget the 150 years of the Kajar’s kindness, and especially in regard to the sons of the late Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah ; they will have no evil intentions therefore. The Persians are my brothers and the children of the Shah, who is the shadow and the elect of God, and we will not act against each other, I think. This permission (to kill me) you have given to those of your own kind ; it does not matter; the prayers of 15,000,000 Persians were and are our protection. Would my death cure the ills of the country ? Your duty as God-fearing people is to put aside personal quarrels and seeking your own interests and devise something for the benefit of the country and its unfortunate subjects. As in the first Medjliss, they did not attend to the wishes and advice of Mohamed Ali Shah ; the deputies of that time acted in their own interests and were caught in difficulties, and for two years ali Persia was in trouble, and many killed and houses destroyed, till finally Mohamed Ali Shah abdicated. After his abdication it was thought that all defects would be removed; but to-day not only Europe, Asia, and America are witness, perhaps even the African savages will not deny, that affairs are a hundred times worse than before. Now I write directly; some Bakhtiari sowars and some Tehran riff-raff will not restore order in Persia. For the last three months some 2,000 Bakhtiari sowars have failed to reduce a section of the Bairanawand tribe, and finally have fled to Burujird. Further, the Bakhtiari them selves know that if they took Tehran it was because we were all discontented with Mohamed Ali Shah ; otherwise Persia would not have accepted such a thing. Gentlemen deputies, by God, you are responsible and will be for bloodshed. At the end what wdl be the result ? In these days Mohamed Ah Shah will arrive in Tehran. I too, believe it or not, will come with 30,000 men all the way from the gates of Kermanshah to Nobaran ; troops are on the march. In Azerbaijan the Shahsevan, and in Garrus Shuja-ed-Dowleh with 3,000 sowars and as many foot; it has been ordered that they go to Tehran via Zinjan. Consider up to Tehran what destruction this crowd and [188] N 4170 sowars will cause, and what will happen to the people. Grieve for the state of the people, whom you sacrifice to your interests, which, by God, will not profit you. Do not listen to the nonsense of the evil disposed ; plan how to extricate Persia from this state of ruin; let the country have one Shah, one Medjliss, and a sound organisation. Your conduct has no profit; afiairs grow worse day by day till ten days ; if this last it will come to an end. The Lord of the country will come to his throne, and will give a proper organisation to the State and the Medjliss. It is good if this should happen through yourselves. This force, which for ten days is on the march, till now were in their own homes; that good or bad is past. I have not got Persia or customs or bank to pay expenses continually. The expenses of this army will fall on the people. Why are you willing that these poor people should suffer? If you wish, come to the telegraph office, and I will come and talk to you, and then with 1,000 or 2,000 sowars I will go to Mohamed Ali Shah and arrange matters satisfactorily. The Shah has sworn to show paternal kindness to all Persians ; after he comes to the capital he will carry this out. If you do not reply you do not accept me; you think you send some one to kill me or appoint Shuja-es-Sultaneh or Sardar Muhiy to fight. God knows this is only your play and the ruin of Persia, because you fight against the designs of God. What I write is with my whole heart ; if you put aside enmity all of you will acknowledge the justice of what I say. Therefore I send this telegram to try you, and have sent a copy to the consuls at Kermanshah ; if no reply received by this afternoon I march to-morrow morning. Now the choice is with you. My wish is that the newspapers of the world should see this telegram, and know that I am not a cause of bloodshed, but that you are. I have also sent a copy to the Mullahs of Kerbela. SALAR-EB-DOWLEH KAJAR. No. 368. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey,—(Received September 25.) Sir, Tehran, September 5, 1911. I HAVE the honour to transmit a translation of the Regent’s message to the Medjliss, which, as I reported in my telegram of the 13th ultimo, was read and unanimously adopted on the preceding day. I also transmit a translation of the Cabinet’s programme foreshadowed in the Regent’s message. This programme was to have been submitted to the Medjliss on the 26th August, but when the president announced that he wished it to he placed on the order of the day, and requested those who were in favour of the motion to rise, only two deputies rose. The president urged the importance of supporting the Cabinet, and again put the motion to the vote, but it was negatived as before. The Cabinet was of course greatly annoyed. The Prime Minister threatened to resign and, I believe, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of the Interior actually tendered their resignation, but on the' following day a number of deputies visited the Prime Minister and urged him to remain in office, promising to “ arrange the matter.” On the 28th ultimo the Regent summoned the leading deputies to the palace and gave them a severe lecturing, with the result that when the programme was again submitted to the Medjliss on the 2nd instant it was passed by a large majority. As regards article 1, I may mention that the Medjliss have drawn up a new electoral law prescribing direct elections in the place of the present elections through electoral colleges. Before the new law is passed the question is to be submitted to a council appointed ad hoc, in which Ministers and other extra-Medjliss notables are to participate. It will be seen that article 2 of the programme looks to the deputies of the next Medjliss being given a mandate by the country for the revision of the constitution. It has frequently been complained that the constitution, as framed in 1906 and 1907, being specially directed against the Shah, left the Sovereign without sufficient power, and gave complete supremacy to the Medjliss, which the Sovereign had no power even to dissolve. Articles 3, 4, 5, and 9 voice with more than the usual precision the cry of ali recent Persian Cabinets for greater powers. It will be remembered that Sipahdar’s Cabinet was granted “ plenary powers,” and only recently the Medjliss approved the declaration of a state of siege in the capital. There has been so far little sign of the exercise of those powers, and it will be interesting to see whether the present Cabinetwill make more use of them than did its predecessors now that what Government requires has been stated with more precision than in previous programmes. Article 8 has done duty in programmes in the past, but now that M. Perny, the Frenchman engaged by the Persian Government to assist the Ministry of Justice, has arrived, ^ it may be^ perhaps that something will be done to remedy the lamentable detects in the administration of justice in Persia, which are the despair of foreigners residing m the country no less than of Persian subjects. Article 10 deals with foreign relations, and voices the Cabinet’s desire to act in a manner to win the assistance and confidence of the foreign Powers, and tacitly recognises that the assistance and confidence of Great Britain and .Russia are essential. So far as I can at pi esent judge, Vossuk-ed-Dowleh seems to be sincerely anxious to carry out this policy, and he is perhaps as likely as any other possible Minister for Foreign Affairs to obtain for it the support of the Medjliss. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 368. Regent’s Message to the Mediliss. (Translation.) I HAVE just received a memorandum, to which I attach the greatest importance, from the Council of Ministers setting forth their views on the present situation of the * country, both internal and external. I must remind you that I have on many occasions addressed you in the same sense when speaking to you of the fundamental principles which ought to guide our political action. And so, on the present occasion, I am in perfect agreement with the points of view which the Ministers have just laid before me, and I feel that I am fulfilling an urgent duty in recommending them to your most special attention. I wish to remind you of all I have said to you since the beginning of the new regime, and more especially since my arrival, respecting the adoption of a wise and salutary line of conduct as well in internal affairs as in our foreign relations. I have always hoped that the constitutional Government, acting in accordance with these same principles, w r ould have obtained for the country the enjoyment of all the advantages of a liberal regime. I regret greatly to have to say that my efforts have produced no tangible result, and that our failure to take account of the real needs of the country has brought us into this painful situation. The facts are too evident for any commentary to be needed. You will agree with me that in the present state of affairs it is no time for tergiversation or for misunderstanding the facts, and even less for embarking upon discussions with a view to discover the causes which have brought about this state of affairs. Your duty at this moment is to unite with the Ministers in adopting a line of conduct which, in internal affairs, would make possible a stable, strong, and equitable Government, and which would enable the Ministers to safeguard the interests of the country and work for the public good. It must not be forgotten that during all this time dissensions, theoretical Utopias, and the lack of practical sense, have made all government impossible, so that crisis has followed crisis, and successive Cabinets, during their ephemeral existences, deprived of all authority, have been unable to undertake anything for the country. The present state of matters is thus the natural consequence of this instability, and if we continue in this same path without taking to heart the lesson of the immediate past, and without following better advice, it is certain that we shall have cause to repent in the near future. As regards our foreign relations, which are so closely connected with our home policy, I also regret to have to state that, contrary to the advice I have given again and again, nothing has been done in the way of improving and developing our relations with the friendly Powers. No serious effort has been made to profit by the kindly disposition shown by the foreign representatives at Tehran since my arrival, the great value of which I recognised and emphasised at the time. I declare, then, that it is all-important for us to devote our efforts to repairing the fatal effects of this negligence in the past, and to attempt to re-establish confidence and good understanding in our foreign relations. In all that I have said I have merely called your attention to the principles which we ought to follow. I leave it to the Cabinet of Ministers to propose to the Assembly a detailed programme calculated to attain the desired end. I hope that the honourable deputies will not lose sight of the gravity of the circumstances and will make up for lost time. I repeat once more that at the present time no country, and least of all our own in its present condition, can prosper except by cultivating good foreign relations. I have to state that in the event of your failing to take into serious172 consideration the gravity of the position and the importance of what I have j ust put before you my position would become quite untenable, and on no conditions could I continue to remain an idle spectator of the deplorable condition into which the country has been plunged. Enclosure 2 in No. 368. Ministerial Programme. (Translation.) IN view of the necessity of the Government taking part in the debates on the electoral law which is to be voted by Parliament, the Ministers will study its dispositions and will inform the Chamber of their final views. 2. Since the laws of the constitution, at present in force, contain no clause dealing with the mechanism for their eventual revision, and since, on the other hand, the Government consider revision necessary, the Executive will, on the occasion of the next elections, issue a proclamation to the effect that in the event of the nation concurring in the views of the Government on this subject the mandate of the newly elected members will authorise them to proceed to the revision of the organic laws. In order that the Government may be in a position to ascertain the wishes of the nation in the matter, they will, as soon as tw'O-thirds of the total number of members have assembled, consider that number sufficient to pronounce on the desirability of revision, and they will appeal to the affirmative or negative vote of this quorum on the question of the necessity or otherwise of revision. In the event of a majority of the two-thirds of the deputies thus assembled (two-thirds of the total number) pronouncing in favour of this revision, it will be deduced that the nation itself has agreed and the discussion on the subject will proceed. 3. Considering that the Government ought to be given sufficient authority and should enjoy powers commensurate with the responsibility assumed, and such as to allow them to be guided solely by the interests of the country, they ought in no way to be subjected to the interference of individuals or of irresponsible bodies. In the event of such interference developing into action without the knowledge of the competent authorities or taking the form of false reports, or of secret meetings tending to mislead the public or to discredit the Government, the latter would be empowered to stop such intrigues and to punish the guilty. 4. The Government will take immediate steps to strengthen the central authority and prevent ill-advised decentralisation and administrative anarchy. It would be necessary in order to attain this object to revise the laws governing the provincial and municipal councils, taking into consideration the opinions of the European advisers in the service of the Government, and until this revision has been effected and taken the form of law, in view of the fact that the laws respecting the organisation of municipal councils do not confer on the Government the power of dissolving them, the Government will be empowered to exercise this right if necessary. 5. The Government will be empowered to prosecute persons who, profiting by the fact that the laws complementary to the organic laws have not yet been enacted and taking advantage of the ambiguity of these same laws, endanger public order and security, or relying on the letter of vague laws obstruct the measures of the Government, or persons who in pursuit of their personal interests even appeal to foreign laws. The Government must be empowered to put an end to all abuses arising from the false interpretation of the laws. 6. In order to re-establish order and security in the country, which is the essential object of every Government, the creation of an adequate disciplined force and, mean while, the formation of a corps of gendarmerie under the direction of Swedish officers are required. It will be the duty of the Government to take all the steps necessary for this purpose, and to introduce for the approval of the Chamber schemes which they consider useful to hasten and complete the carrying out of their measures. 7. The Government propose the simplification and if necessary the suppression of administrative services which have been created unnecessarily through inexperience and which do not meet real needs, whilst their suppression is demanded both in the interests of economy and of efficiency. 8. The Government are examining the question of a fundamental reorganisation of the Ministry of Justice and will not fail to introduce a Bill on the subject in the Chamber. Pending such time as this Bill shall acquire force of law, the Government must be empowered to take such steps as they may judge proper for the administration of justice.9. Until the Penal Code has passed the Legislature in legal form the Govern ment must have full power to repress crime according to the provisions of a provisional law approved by the Council of Ministers.. 10. It^ is evident that the domestic policy of a country depends to a certain extent on its foreign policy and its international relations, and unless a frank and far-sighted line of conduct is adopted the Government will encounter difficulties even in their domestic policy. ^ The Government must therefore, in their relations with friendly Powers, and especially with those the relations with whom are more important, adopt a policy calculated to secure the co-operation and confidence of these Powers. The essential condition of the success of the measures taken by the Government is the support and approval of public opinion. No. 369. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 25.) ST, ^ Tehran, September 5, 1911. WITH reference to my despatch of the 9th August respecting the state of the southern roads, I have the honour to report that His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan reported under date of the 5th August that the condition of the Shiraz- Ispahan road continued to be unsatisfactory, the Shiraz down-post being robbed at Mahyar where a similar robbery had occurred a few days previously, and the up-post had been attacked in another locality. Mr. Grahame added that though recent robberies had been petty, the effect produced by them on the muleteers was almost as disastrous as if the robberies had been large. A long-delayed caravan, however, of 150 animals ah bearing piece-goods belonging to Messrs. Ziegler arrived at Ispahan from Shiraz on the 5th August. Though they had been subjected to no robbery, the muleteers complained of the exactions of the road guards. Later reports from Mr. Grahame, dated the 12th and 19th, state that the Shiraz road is overrun with robbers between Ispahan and Kumisheh, and that caravans with British goods were held up for want of guards, a reinforcement of whom were being dispatched at the request of the consul-general. Other caravans managed to reach Ispahan by the circuitous Sarhad route. As regards the Bushire-Shiraz road, caravan traffic between Kamarij and Kazerun has been practically suspended owing to fighting between the Kamarjis and Kashgais. The Ispahan-Tehran road seems in a worse state than ever. The principal cause of disturbance is the presence in the neighbourhood of Kashan of the notorious brigand Naib Hussein, who is, however, being actively dealt with by Bakhtiaris from Ispahan. Traffic on the Ahwaz route continues to be suspended, and the sacking of caravanserais has been reported to you by telegraph. It is hoped that arrangements now being negotiated for the protection of caravans, either by extra guards supplied by the Bakhtiari khans or by arming the muleteers themselves, will bring about an ameliora tion of the condition of this road. Becent reports from His Majesty’s consul at Kerman of the alarming condition of the Kerman-Bunder Abbas road, and of the robberies which have taken place there, have been repeated to you by telegraph. I have received a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire reporting the continued levy of illegal exactions, such as rahdari, &amp;c., along the southern trade routes. I have brought the matter verbally to the notice of the Persian Government, who promise to take the necessary measures. It is, however, useless to disguise' the fact that both the Central Government and the local authorities are at present powerless in the matter. I have refrained from addressing a formal protest to the Persian Government lest my doing so should be construed as an admission that, apart from the question of rahdari, we had no further complaint with regard to the condition of the trade routes. I have, &amp;c. G. BABCLAY.174 No. 370. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey —(Received September 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 25, 1911. MY telegram of 23rd September. Naib Hussein has taken Kashan. No. 371. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, September 25, 1911. MINISTER for Foreign Affairs informs me that Farman Farma has been appointed Governor of Fars, and that a local committee is to be appointed to govern pending Governor-General’s arrival. Meanwhile there is still no authority at Shiraz, and there are no signs of Soulet and Nizam acquiescing in Government’s decision. Conflicts between rival tribesmen occur daily, and Kashgais are committing excesses in town and outskirts. Kawam’s tribesmen and other armed dependents in the town number 2,000; other party number 1,300. No. 372. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. (Telegraphic.) Foreign Office, September 25, 1911. IT has been suggested by His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire that, among other measures, we should establish a vice-consulate at Bam with an adequate escort, and that the escorts at five other posts, including Ispahan, which is in the Russian sphere, should be increased. Inform Russian Government as soon as possible that these steps may be necessary, and that we hope they will offer no objection to the increase of the escort at Ispahan, which is requisite for the efficacy of the scheme. There would be 200 additional men at Bam and Shiraz and 100 at the rest. His Majesty s Government are anxious to avoid any military occupation in the southern provinces entailing use of large force, and the above is the least measure possible. Our only object is to protect British trade, which has suffered such heavy losses. No. 373. Sir Edward Grey to Mr. O'Beirne. Foreign Office, September 25, 1911. WITH reference to my telegram of to-day’s date, I have to inform you that I told Count Benckendorff to-day that there were most serious complaints of the way British trade was blocked in South Persia. Russia had sent troops into Northern Persia and kept the roads open there, and presumably Russian trade gained something of what we lost by the fact that southern trade routes were blocked. I w r as nevertheless reluctant to send a military force into Persia ; we could not do it so easily as Russia had done our force must go by sea. But I was proposing to increase our consular escorts in the south, and we might do this also at Ispahan, which was just in the Russian sphere of interest. I was telegraphing to explain the position at St. Peters- buigh. Count Benckendorff said he supposed it was the increase of an existing guard at Ispahan that was contemplated, and I said this was so.
