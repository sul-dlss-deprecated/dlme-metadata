Arrangements were made with stamp printing firms and publishers to provide the required stamps and other postal stationery. Bradbury, Wilkinson and Company, Limited was responsible to the monthly supply of the overprinted stamps, and Harrison and Sons Limited was to supply the overprinted Ottoman Government envelopes and reply letter cards/postal stationery.Bradbury, Wilkinson and Company, Limited provided lists of the stamps and their values and later it provided lists of the increased charges on printing stamps and currency. The company communicated with the Under Secretary of State for India, regarding the enquiry raised by the Turkish Postal Administration in Constantinople in relation to the supply of the overprinted stamps.This part also includes correspondence related to the new design to be adopted for the stamps during the British Mandate. Two main issues were discussed regarding the new design. These are whether to use the word Mesopotamia or Iraq on the stamps, and whether to replace the present issue of surcharged Turkish stamps by a regular issue which does not include pictorial representations of places in Constantinople or other Turkish possessions.The main correspondents in this part are: the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad; the Under-Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office; Bradbury, Wilkinson and Company, Limited; and Harrison and Sons Limited.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100081172910.0x000003#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100081172910.0x000003#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100081172910.0x000003#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
