Sir I have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 5S7 dated ‘13rd April 1910 reporting overtures on the part of Jowasim representatives of Khor Fakan and the Jasmi Dibba to His Highness the Sultan. °• There has been no change of the attitude of Government towards the question ot the Jasmi enclave on the Oman Coast&gt; and it will oe advisable that you make the visits of Abdullah bin Simui and Saeed bin Hamud an occasion for reiterating the warning which has been periodically administered to His Highness, against encouraging the disloyal intrigues of these dependents of the Sheikk. of Shargah or interfering in their affairs. o. As regards the Sheikh of Kumzar, the information given you by khan Saheb Mohamed bin Saeed probably arises from some misconcep tion on his part. As you suggest in paragraph 4 of your letter we specifically stated in the counterdraft presented to the Hague Tribunal in French Flag Arbitration that the Sultan of Muscat claimed jurisdiction over kd® tract between Dibba and Tibba, and in the course of subsequent correspondence in connection with the ran oval of the flagstaff on Telegraph Island in the Elphinstone' the secretary of State p or India, on the ground that we had admit ted these claims, expressed the opinion that the flagstaff should not be maintained, though it need not be removed, as to do so might attract unnecessary attention. His Majesty’s Foreign Office then in their despatch No. 36810/07 dated 9th-May 1908 to the India(5) India Office accepted the view that the flagstaff should not bo maintained. There the matter rests as far as my record is concerned and n ■■ as I think Kumzar. treated as under iihasab where the oultan keeps a A Wali, there can be no uncertainty for present purposes as to the status of the Kumzar Sheikh or the Dibba - Tibba Coast line. 4. I agree that it would be more convenient from the Blockade point of view if the Musandum promontory were not under Muscat, but the operations of His Majesty's dhipa are not seriously hamp ered in practice by niceties of jurisdiction, and the record does not leave the question sufficiently in doubt for me to reopen it with uovernment at the present juncture.
