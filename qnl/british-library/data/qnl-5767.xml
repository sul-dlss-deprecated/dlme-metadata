Dear Loch This afternoon, I received a wire from Political Baghdad to say that I was released f^ora the Mission and that they would support an application from me for leave. Hence there will he no more for me to do with Philby. I quite agree that it would be best fwr him to get on to Bahrein and see Ibn Saoud in the Hasa. . I have brought his kit round here, but T doubt if he w nts what there is just to go in and see Ibn Saoud, and he could pick it up on his return . However he will probably want to decide this himself. As you say you are wiring yourself, would you mind '/ w adding on the following following from Cunlif^e- Owen begins Am at ^uwait but have Just been released from further work with the Mission and shall leave as soon as possible AAA Have brought your kit roundand will see that you get a full statement of all moneys \ expendedand other details ends. * am so very much obliged for your kind invitation to stop, please thank Mrs -^och from me.

M 102 of July 11th,1918, regarding your kit, firstly I should like to say that I quite understand and sympathize with your feelings at the continued non-receipt of your things - and further that, as bavin? assisted in the compilation of the Indian General Staff hooks on Arabia, no one could regret more than I do anything which should have lessened the value of your recent journey. At the same time, while I very much regret the matter so far as this Agency is concerned, I feel that it is due to myself and to my Staff to explain that the responsibility does not lie by any means wholly with us as your letter implies. To begin with, no list of your stuff was given to me and all I knew was that some kit of yours had been left in the old Agency in one godown; U was not, however, handed over to any one’s charge and no one of the Agency Staff was present when it was put in. Before the receipt about April 24th of your letter of April 5th (presumably your note from Hafar dated 4-3-18) I had sent a Clerk to the old Agency to bring all your kit out to the new house at Shuwaikh as Basrah -had telegraphed about it. brought out a large number of boxes of foodstuffs, oil etc, most of which had come here viS Bahrain but none of the other things mentioned by you. I sent in again to make certain that there was nothing more and also made enquiries at Gray, Paul’s house where Colonel uunliffe-Owen had been staying, but no one knew anything ahout*any kit except that ha had taken away but little. As both you and Basrah had specially stated that I was not to send out foodstuffs and nothing else was traceable and as I had understood that all the stuff was in one godown, I concluded that what 1 had got hold of must be the whole of the kit referred to by you and Colonel uunliffe-Owen and that the rest roust have been left somewhere in Najd after all. On April 27th I wrote telling you that your kit was ■ i ]r&lt;*5 -2- % was not here except for oil of which I was sending you a case and that I feared methylated was quite unobtainable - later, May 6th, I wrote again sending some msthylated and saying that T thought the kit must have been left in Najd etc. The ot.^er kit was overlooked by the men who went down to cat it because it had been placed in a separate and practically disused godown where there were only old packing oases and when it was put in no one of the Agency Staff was,✓as far as i could discover, present or told about it, while all the kit was supposed to be in the one place. Under the circumstances the omission to look in this particular godown is perfectly understandable, though that is naturally no comfort to you. The things we„refound because Kelly, the Assistant Surgeon, passing along the road saw that a window appeared to have been tampered with and reported to me when I had the place broken open. The next day I wrote to you about it, and the yakhdans etc. were handed to Nafisi but the first caravan for Hajd did not start till June 16th and Hafisi has con sistently maintained, and I think with reason, that it is not safe nowadays to send boxes etc. through except by caravan even if accompanied by three or four men. I am extremely sorry for all the hardship and inconvenience to which you have been put, but had the kit been handed over to a responsible person this could never have happened and, though the circumstances were exthemely aggravating for you.I cannot but ' . the f ' consider' terms of your letter are unjustified. The further kit for which you have asked is being sent with -Shaikh Ahmad bin Jabir - I asked Shaikh Salim if he could not send it on with a small party at once but, although now very ready to do anything for us, he said it was not safe and advised waiting for Shaikh Ahmad. . / To Yours sincerely, Captain., Political Agent., Kuwait. yl H.St.J.

It is therefore with pardonable satisfaction that I can assure him- and a reference to p. 128 Vol. I of “The Heart of .irabia' 1 and other passages therein bear me out in that assurance - that in point of fact the sum total of spirituous liquor consumed by the Mission during twelve months was only half a bottle of brandy. I would ask him nevertheless to condone the supply of liquor laid in at the inception of the Mission on the ground that the latter was originally desigiei to comprise a British personnel of five or six members including Lr. (after.’aria Brigadier (leneral and now oir Holand) Storrs. Ly solicitude for the health of my colleagues amid the rigours of an Arabian climate is the sole ground on which I can seek to justify so generous a provision of comforts at the expense of His Majesty’s Government and my only regret is that I am unable to throw light on the ultimate fate of that cargo except that it was accidentally , discovered some time in 1918 in the cellars of the British Agency at Kuwait. For all I know to the contrary it may still be there. The amount covered by this item is not Rs. 157/1/6 as suggested in the Colonial Office comments but, I regret to say, as much as Rs. 199/12/- and I may add that the charge would of course have been set off against travelling allowances had the latter Deen claimed. \&lt;^£p Extract from Colonial Office letter 1^0.22699/25, dated tde 27th June 1925, to the Under Secretary of State for India, Accountant (ieneraPs Department, India Office. &amp; JL A A X X X X ^ With regard to the spirituous liquors purchased by Mr. Philby in 1917 for the use of the Mission, which he now states were subsequently discovered at Kuweit in 1918, it is requests that if possible it may be ascertained whether the liquors are still on hand at that station; if not, whether any information is available as to their disposal, together with particulars of any credit which may have appeared in the Kuweit Accounts in respect of the sale of the liquors in question.Mo. 364/^/16 Political Agency, Kuwait, 'Oated, the £nd Noveraoer 19^5 Prom To Major J.C.
