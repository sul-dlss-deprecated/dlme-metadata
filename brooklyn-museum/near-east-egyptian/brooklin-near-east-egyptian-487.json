{"id": 118451, "title": "Cat Coffin with Mummy", "accession_number": "37.1947E", "accession_date": "1948-09-01 00:00:00", "object_date": "664-332 B.C.E.", "object_date_begin": -664, "object_date_end": -332, "period": "Late Period", "dynasty": "Dynasty 26 to Dynasty 30", "description": "The object is a wooden coffin of a cat containing mummified cat bones and unknown debris wrapped in linen textile.  The coffin depicts a cat sitting on its hind legs with its front paws extended.  The two sides of the coffin join in the center forming a join that runs down the center of the cat\u2019s face and body.  The proper left side appears to be carved out of two pieces of wood while the proper right side is made of at least three pieces.  The halves are no longer attached to each other and the coffin rests on one side.  A white ground was applied over the wood ( thickly in places to account for the shape of the wood underneath) and this was painted with a geometric design on the body and front legs of the cat using red, Egyptian blue, and a light yellow pigment.  Any design on the cat\u2019s face is less clear though gold gilding is discernible on the top of the nose. The head and face are dark in color which could be pigment or dirt. The interior of the coffin holds a large linen textile wrapped oblong mummy that is very dark gray/black in color.  \r\nThe mummy is incomplete. It is wrapped in multiple layers of rough woven textile.The contents of the mummy are visible in holes near the foot and the head of the mummy (located in the base and head of the coffin respectively).  One long thin bone is visible within the foot hole.  It appears to be femur or humerus bone.  Within the hole near the coffin\u2019s head, a wide flat bone resembling a scapula is visible.  One vertebra lies on top of mummy near a small hole close to the tail end.  \r\nCondition: The coffin and its contents are in poor and unstable condition.  The base of the coffin is missing as is the proper right front paw and part of the arm.  The edge of the missing arm is flat suggesting the lower arm and paw were made of a separate piece of wood attached when the coffin was made.  Other cracks on the surface appear to be saturated with a material that has darkened the surface.\r\n", "medium": "Wood, pigment, animal remains (Felis sylvestris), linen", "dimensions": "23 5/8 x 5 1/4 x 6 5/16 in.
