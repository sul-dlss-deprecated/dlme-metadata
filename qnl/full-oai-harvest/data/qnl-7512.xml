These complaints concern allegations of violations of Afghan territory by aircraft of the Royal Air Force (RAF) based along the North West Frontier. These complaints are then either upheld or rejected by the Government of India – as a result of internal investigation – and a response issued via the British Legation. In some cases copies of the reports compiled at Peshawar, Headquarters of No 1 RAF (Indian) Group, can be found alongside the correspondence. In addition, the file also contains a relatively small number of counter complaints made by the Government of India, concerning violations of British Indian territory by Afghan aircraft, which are mainly found towards the front of the file.It also contains material related to an allegation that an RAF aircraft dropped a bomb on the Afghan village of Lwarah (also spelt Lawarah) on 31 March 1939; see folios 68-94. A detailed breakdown of the compensation claim made by the Government of Afghanistan can be found on folios 68-69.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Afghanistan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Royal Air Force</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>North-West Frontier Province</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Aerial navigation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Airspace (law)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
