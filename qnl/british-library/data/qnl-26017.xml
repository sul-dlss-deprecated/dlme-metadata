I informed the Prime Minister last night that I proposed to write to him about the change of name of the Levies to Royal Air Force Levies and said that I hoped he would reply that there was no objection on the part of the Iraqi Government. 2. He begged me to put nothing in writing. We had arranged everything verbally so far and he had, he thought, helped the Air Officer Commanding whole-heartedly to expand his force. He would continue to do so but if a matter such as the change of title were raised officially^ questions might be asked and he would be placed in an embarrassing position. He regarded the present_expansion as purely a war-time measure and if the Air Officer Commanding were to change the title of the Force, he would not raise any objection. 3. The title of Iraq Levies has no treaty authority and when it v/as originally given, the Iraqi Government were not consulted. We are therefore under no treaty obligation to consult them regarding a # change of title. Furthermore even if this Government did agree in writing to its change, some future Government which wished to be annoying would not necessarily be If- 14(‘. bound by such an agreement! mi to let the matter lie I therefore think it better &amp;t&lt;o.

Up to date I am not aware that Persians have any strong v^ws on this^matter. His Majesty's Minister pointed out that 'levies' has with regard to this special force, a long tradition of over 20 years behind it, and it would be most disappointing to all old officers and soldiers to lose their identity under a new and inappropriate name.

His Excellency saw no difficulty in raising such a force on the lines explained in my telegram No. 533 to you. ( 2 ) I am inclined to agree with you'lhat the proposed force would not be very reliable and on reflection I am rather doubtful whether the expenditure of say £ 20,000 a month could be justified though the economic benefits in the northern [gp.undec ?boundaries] (where conditions are difficult due to crop failures etc.) would be marked. But the essential point is, I believe, the impossibility of guaranteeing that, if the war situation deteriorated to such an extent as to involve a direct attack against this country, the morale of any irregular force would remain sufficiently high to result in any effective resistance.. In that case all our expenditure and effort would be wasted. For this and other reasons it might perhaps be preferable - and cheaper - if and when an emergency threatens to employ selected British officers to subsidize reliable sheikhs and to lead their gangs to harass the enemy v/herever and however possible.

How about a little reciprocity? Iraq army was now at the stage when provision of say 4 to 6 tanks and a similar number of armoured cars would give much encouragement without in any way affecting the British strength. If this equipment could be issued it would have an extremely good effect on Iraq army whose morale generally had greatly improved. 2, In his view this is the moment when it will pay us to strengthen the army* s present spirit of co-operation by tangible evidence of our desire to help it to participate effectively in the defence of the country. 3.. Both General Officer Commanding and I sympathise with this view which is undoubtedly that of many Iraqi officers.

The original proposal dealt with in these papers was to recruit for mainly non-canbatant service with the British forces. The extension of this proposal to the Persian Gulf States was suggested by the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, (see paragraph 4 of the Minister of State’s telegram No. 542 of May 5th); and it was upon this that we consulted the Government of India and the Political Resident in our telegram No. 8415 of May 10th. Although this proposal is still being pursued (it is proposal (c) in Foreign Office telegram No. 1092), there is no recent mention of applying it in the Gulf States. The first paragraph of Baghdad telegram No. 5 0 9 of May 15 th describes a different project (which appears as proposal (a) in Foreign Office telegram No. 1092) - i.e. the raising of the Iraq levies to a total of 1175° officers and men, of whom 2185 men would be enlisted from the Persian Gulf. These men would be under the control of the A.O.C. Iraq and would be employed on aerodrome defence. This telegram does not make it clear in what area the Gulf recruits would be required to serve, but Baghdad telegram No. 53&amp; May 23 rd (last sentence of paragraph 2) and the Political Resident’s telegram No. 958 of May 26 th, seem to indicate that they would be employed solely in the defence of the Gulf aerodromes. k&gt;. v\ ^ ',1^ « ■ ^ ^ U l^c^X I a ™-~ 1 t^/, ^ ~ ^ Yl* &amp;*e.o file copy With the Compliments of tbl under* r h F dp''' ^ J ■ 2 ^0^1 l«0^ ! kS LQyiiacJ 1 FROM TEHRAN r i\»-ja •y o i a**' 1 ? ,2816 r j DBPARTICTTA L NO. 2.

The fact that minorities are Iraqi nationals invalidates this argument and I fear that there is no hope, at any rate while this country is not belligerent, of my being able to persuade Iraqi Government to agree to employ levies outside Iraq even if this was agreeable to the Persian Government. Position was fully cxolained to .dr Officer Commanding who reluctantly accepted the final conclusion that solution must be sought through recruitment in Persia of force similar to Iraqi levies which under a different name would be administered iby Air Officer Commanding.

Companies, Pioneer Companies; (b) dilution within British static artillery, lines of communication, base units in relief of white personnel. As far as possible their employment would be limited to non combatant units. 2 . _ Recruiting would be spread over all races concerned and though it would include the minorities such os the Annenians, and Kurds it would not be specifically confined to them. Arrange ments by which Royal Air Force have for many years drawn on Iraq for personnel for aerodrome defence units would of course continue. ,3. I^appreciate that we have to obtain permission of Persian, Iraqi, Syrian and Lebanese Governments. As regards Syrians and Lebanese we shall also have to obtain agreement of Free French. Under Ly.... de Gaulle agreements of July 1941 we did not specifically bind ourselves not to carry out any recruiting in Syria and Lebanon, but Free French view is that any additional forces raised there should be under their command, and this is the general sense of agreements (see your telegram No. 4027 to Cairo November 18th 1941). 4.

I appreciate the grounds of Nuri s opposition and for this reason suggest that (b) n iy be the more practicable course. It would entail no new principle or unnecessary publicity since it would be simply extension of the system in force in Iraq for many years, Iraqis would enlist as individuals in the same way that, for example,' Nejdis enlist iirArab Legion.

Paragraph 5 of your telegram under reference^indicates that considerable numbers would be likely to come forward for service inside Iraq on these terms, 5. The need for additional man-power is particularly urgent in Iraq as large quantities of transport are shortly arriving in the country and sufficient personnel 'are not available to handle them. Commander-in-Chief and I would be grateful if you would reconsider the question as matter of urgency on the above lines.

My views on these proposals with which General Officer Commanding agreed, have already been telegraphed to the Middle East through the 10th army. 2 . I share your objections to the policy of recruiting minorities for service in British forces. As regards iissyrians, available manpower is being absorbed into levies under expansion scheme (and we have already incurred onerous obliga tions to which you refer in paragraph 2 of your telegram under reference). We assume that introduction of able Armenians /in Iraq, are too few to be worth bothering about. 3. Kurds and irrabs in considerablu numbers would probably be willing to enlist in British forces for service in Iraq if permitted but I fear not many would 'Come forward for service outside. 4 . A chance remark by the Prime Minister some time ago gave me an opening to discuss the problem in very general torus, I found him opposed to the idea. He feels that it would expose him to much adverse criticism if he were to agree to open recruitment in Iraq for British forces (whether lighting or ancillary) and : ;i do not think he could be persuaded to sponsor such a scheme. 5 He is nevertheless always ready to co-operate so.far as is practicable and if Commander-ih-Chief Middle Hast wisnes me to try I might be able to obtain the Prime Minister s agreement/• agreement to the raising of special Iraqi army units (e.g, transport or pioneer, cojupaaies) at the expense of His Majesty’s Government to'Te placed under the command of the General' Officer Commanding. 7e could not of course stipulate that recruiting should be restricted to any particular racial elements.

I am advised that His Majesty's Goverrment have no treaty right to recruit military units in Iraq (apart xrom aerodrome guards) and I see strong political oDjections to anj policy based on recruitments ot minorities, even -0- - outside Iraq. .aiy such action would in my view be !ikely further to antagonise majority elements ana would place his Majesty’s Government under obligations to the minorities whicn it would be difficult or even impossible to fuliil after the war. We could not of course hold out any hope of finding ne\ permanent homes for these people in some other part oi mie pf proposal to recruit mainly or exclusively from tr minorities were dropped, same disadvantages would not arise. I realise that even so proposal is likely to oe unwelcome oo the Iraqi Government, and we should be asking tor something which we could not claim as of right. rut I should be glad if you would consult General Officer Commanding and telegra.. your views as soon as possible.
