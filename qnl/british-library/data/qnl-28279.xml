Ever since the Japanese entered the war, we have been anxious to induce the Persian Government to break off relations with Japan and close the Japanese Legation. Although their cypher and bag facilities have been withdrawn, we have reason to suppose that the Japanese Legation have a secrex wireless transmitter with which they may be able to pass on military and other important information to Tokyo and thence to Berlin and Rome 0 They are also a potential source of communication between the Persian Government and the Axis. 2. When the Persians broke off relations with the other Axis Powers last September it was as the result of joint Anglo- Soviet pressure, but as the Soviet Government are anxious not to embroil themselves with the Japanese at the moment, we cannot hope for their support in this case. Moreover, even if the proposed Treaty wixh Persia were in force, the Persians would be under no obligation to break off relations with Japan. The Treaty only states that Persia will not maintain diplomatic relations with any State which is in relations with neither the United Kingdom nor the Soviet Union. 3. His Majesty’s Minister at 'Tehran has asked the^Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs to close the Japanese Legation but, although he has a grudge against the Legation for having harboured the ex-Mufti, Minister for Foreign Affairs pretended to believe that it offers no danger at present.^ It therefore seems unlikely that the Legation will be closed unless we can bring strong pressure to bear. Our only weapons are military and economic. We do not want to send troops back to Tehran merely in order to secure the closing of the Japanese Legation and the Soviet Government might well object to our doing so. We could tell the Persian Government that we shall not send them any^ further supplies of wheat or sugar until the Japanese Legation is closed. But the resultant shortage of foodstuffs would increase anti-British feeling, might lead to civil disturbances, and might in the long run do us more harm than the Persians. 4. According to Sir R. Bullard, the American Minister at Tehran would be very glad if the Japanese Legation were closed, but feels unable to press for this without instructions from Washington, for which he lias promised^to telegraph. The Persian Government are very anxious to conciliate the United States at present and Sir R. Bullard considers that pressure frpm the^United States Minister would be very helpful. Please explain position to State Department and say that we should be very grateful for any assistance which they may be able to give us in this matter. (E.294/98/34).

The new German Minister is shoy/ing great anti-British and pro-Russian activity and if the Pole did not appear alt dinner it would be so great a blow to the Allied prestige that I recommend that you authorise me to inform i the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the last resort that unless the Pole is present I cannot attend. The fact that the Poles and Iranians a.re bo ch members of the League of Nations justifies Iranians in resisting German and, uussian pressure. 2. My French colleague is taking a similar action.

WITH reference to my despatch No. ^ 448 E. of the 18th October, 1935, regarding Irano-Japanese trade relations, I have the honour to inform you that the -situation with regard to the Qishm salt mines would appear to be as follows :— 2. According to the Bulletin of the Banque Mellie Iran dated October last, the Societe d’Exportation de Sel with a capital of 500,000 rials (£5,550), of which half subscribed by the Agricultural Bank, was “ Fondee pour 1’exploitation des gisements de sel de Hamahdan, lie de Chechme, et 1’extraction et exportation des derives du sel.” I understand that the other half interest in the company was in the hands of an Iranian group, the managing director of which is Mohamed Ali Daneshwar, of the Irano-Japanese Trading Company. It appears that this group had the right to let or sell its share to a third party, and it was the Japanese who acquired the interest. The terms are not known, but a price of about Ss. a ton has been mentioned in this connexion. 3. The Japanese have imported explosives and equipment for the exploita tion of the mine; a Japanese salt-mining engineer arrived at Bandar Abbas from Bombay on the 5th December last, his arrival coinciding with that of Mr. Daneshwar with a Japanese clerk of the Irano-Japanese Trading Company of Tehran. 4. Extraction from the mine is said to be pure rock salt and of unlimited quantity; the estimated yearly output is said to be about 100,000 tons. 5.

I HAVE the honour to report that, as a result of lengthy negotiations between the Polish and the Soviet Governments, an agreement has been reached under the provisions of which the Soviet Government allow the Polish Government to send from Poland to Persia, in transit through the territory of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics, 72,000 tons of goods in the course of the current year. 2. It will be remembered that according to article 22 of the treaty between Poland and the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics signed at Riga on the 18th March, 1921, the Soviet Government undertook in principle not to impede tiansit traffic, but that, in spite of this clause in the treaty, no goods were allowed to be sent to Persia. 3. I attach a certain importance to this agreement, as before the war the exports to Persia from those parts of the Russian Empire which are now included in the Polish State, were considerable and covered at that time, more particularly, textiles, sugar, enamelware, &amp;c., and it is hoped here that Poland will be able gradually to recapture the Persian markets. 4. I understand that the quantity of 72,000 tons named above will be increased shortly as a result of further negotiations which are now proceeding. I have, &amp;c. WILLIAM ERSKINE.

Perso-Polish Treaty of Friendship and Commercial Convention. Notes of Committee (k interpretation. Protocol substituting new Article 6 in Commercial Convention. Under Secretary Secretary of State... Copy to SEEN °OLmCAL COMMITTED 1 ^ SEP 1928 FOR INFORMATION. The note explaining the interpretation of certain points in the Treaty of Friendship appears to call for no coinment. The Commercial Convention had to he modified to some extent in view of the imminence of an autonomous tariff. The new Article 6 provides for the application of the minimum tariff on the Polish frontier, and of the minimum tariff in vigour on the frontier of entry into or exit from Persia. But if an autonomous tariff is set up, the application of minimum tariffs is to he limited to 2 years’ duration, i.e. until the 29th May,1930, and during that time each party is to he given the benefit of any reductions. Since the autonomous tariff has now been introduced, the article appears to he similar in effect to the provisionalprovisional agreements made with most of the , v ... . iJ. v, - 1 ; European countries, except that its lease of life is two years instead of one. The only point in the Warsaw Despatch of the 14th March, P.1503, which does not seem to he cleared up hy the subsequent papers is that in paragraph 3. Section 2 in the note dated 14.4.28, explaining the Commercial Convention is not very explicit on the subject, but it appears from paragraphs 1 and 2 of the new Article 6 that most-favoured-nation treatment will be received in respect of any regulations applied to imported goods after payment of customs dues. suspected that the phrase M les lois en vigueur” might carry the implication that on certain goods a further excise duty would be levied beyond the ordinary customs duty, but the suspicion may have beeen based on papers we have not received. It looks however, as you suggest, as if the point may be satisfactorily met by paragraphs 1 and 2 of the new Article 6. But the point does not appear to be one with which we need concern ourselves. 1 have no other observations to offer. Seen. SEEM „ POUHCAL COMNOnee 18 SEP 1928c&lt;M% (B 1455/145S/M), SiO. 103.

Hempel in Tehran and signed there on 19th kareh 1927♦ ^* ^he chief point at issue concerns the application of article 6 oi the convention under which the partiee to it grant each other meet*favoured-nation treatment* It has not yet been «*de clear whether this clause grante Poland the right to the special tari s granted to Huaeian geode under an agreement of 1927 (which I unieret&amp;ad to come extent secures for Soviet ftueeia the application of more favourable rates than the 39BO tariffs) only if her K©ede aye imported over the Soviet frontier. I;o»t Polish goods exported to Persia are transported through Soviet missis, though there is also a email quantity which is sent via Treblsond. Exports from Poland consist chiefly of textiles and hardware goods, but also include am*13 quantities of sugar and petroleum oil. In the last two cases Husola can always undersell Poland and it is there'ore ©f less importance to Poland to obtain favourable customs treatment for these con odities than for textiles and hardware. The Polish Government do not appear yet to have «uide up their mind whether they are better advised to secure The R1 £ht Honourable, ir Austen Chamberlain, !t,G. t etc., etc., etc*.on th« 'baol 9 at Sovitt or on the 1 20 ba®ie. 5, The «ocon&lt;! point at i»j?u« i® tho appUootion of tho phra«« *1«* loi» en viguour’ 1 (ooe Articlo 2).

It will be seen from article XX that'it i® to hold good for a pro?!si ;nal period of two year®. but it i® understood that tho Persian Government are anxiou# to put into force before 1 ng a aystem of autonomous tariffs* and it therefore remind to be made clear whether the provisions of the eorvention lapse in that event or whether Poland is entitled to miniiium duties under the new autonomou* tariff a. it seem® doubtful whether the Persian Government Intended by the present convention to assure to JPolaM the right to mo8t~favoure&amp;-n&amp;tion treatment under th© pro used autanomou® tariffs ae a clause to thi a affect was purposely omitted from th# 1 ^ 37 agreement with Soviet Ku* «ia. In thi a latter case I understand that by an exchange of not#® m do at the time of the agreement it wee however recognised that Russia should receive mort-favoured-nation treatment if autonomous tarif « came into force. 5 .

WITH reference to my despatch No: 224 of the 19th May last, I now learn from Mr. Uchiyama, the Japanese diplomatic representative, that the Japanese Govern ment have given up all idea of concluding a treaty with Persia for the present. They originally tried to obtain capitulatory rights. When that became obviously impossible, they tried to obtain the inclusion in a treaty of the most-favoured-nation clause. Here again I gather the Persian Government have been unwilling to meet their wishes. They have therefore decided, according to what Mr. Uchiyama told me, to make a provisional arrangement and to await the results of the treaty which they believe His Majesty’s Government will make with Persia in the course of the next year. t am forwarding a copy of this despatch to the Government of India.

(No. 224.) gj r Jr 01 Tehran, May 19, 1927. ’ WITH reference to my despatch No. 139 of the 24th March, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the French texts of the Treaty of Friendship and the Commercial Convention signed on the 19th March, 1927, between Persia and Poland, which have been obtained from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 2. They can doubtless be regarded as the type of treaties which the Persian Government will seek to make with the Powers whose treaties have recently been denounced. 3. The Treaty of Friendship is based on complete equality and reciprocity. Otherwise it appears to call for no special comment except that under article 4 Polish consular representatives will presumably be debarred from the exemption from the payment of customs dues, which the consuls of other nations at present enjoy. 1 4. In the Commercial Convention, it will be noted that, by article 4, Polish citizens, like those of other nations, will enjoy the right to acquire and dispose of houses and buildings in Persia for their habitation or for business purposes. The clause in the treaty regarding the right to possess other real property is far from clear. I understand, however, from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs that this right does not, in fact, accrue to Poles in Persia owing to an order made in the year 1305 a.h. (1887-88), and communicated at the time to all foreign Legations, which has the force of law, to'the effect that no foreigners had the right to acquire real property in Persia (houses and buildings for habitation or business purposes being excepted). The practical effect of the clause is therefore, I am informed, that, on condition of reciprocity, Polish nationals would acquire this right were this law at any time rescinded. 5. Article 7 of the Commercial Convention appears to define and extend the right of restricting imports and exports reserved by Persia under article 3 of the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1903. The phrase “a sauvegarder Factivite economi- que de la nation,” in particular, seems capable of very wide interpretation. 6 Under article 6, it would presumably be possible for Poland to claim that the 1903 tariff, rather than the 1920 tariff, was applicable to their goods, since the former is still applied to Russian goods; and as I understand the chief Polish article of export to Persia is cotton goods, which pay twice as much under the 1920 as under the 1903 tariff, it would certainly pay them to do so. I will endeavour to obtain further information on this point. I have, &amp;c. R. H. CLIVE. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Traite d'Amitie entre VEmpire de Perse et la serenissime Republique de Pologne.
