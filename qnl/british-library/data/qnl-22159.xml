Wakelin, Educational Adviser, Bahrain ^ Kuwait: Apart from the need for educated youths in Hovernment Departments the work of the oil companies in Bahrain, Kuwait and Eastern Saudi Arabia will absorb all whom we can produce for several years to come. Clerical and technical trainees are already being sought and the demand will increase as the new production programme come into action. This expansion of the oil industry will mean also a general development of trade and the creation of new opportunities for private KBierpxixie.business. In both Bahrain and Kuwait the demand for education is not yet being fully met. Any new buildings or extensions added in the past four years have been utilised for pupils already at school rather than for new entrants, in the process of reducing the number of children per room to a workable limit. Only in the Lower Schools are more than 30 children found in one group. New infant Schools are required at once in both states to reduce this figure still further and to accommodate the 200 or so who are turned away each year through lack of accommodation. This will entail the engagement of additional trained teachers. The work that has been begun in Bahrain and Kuwait is merely the prelude to the development of a co-ordinated educational system throughout the Gulf and Eastern Saudi Arabia. Within this area there is nothing to compare with the schools of Bahrain or Kuwait except in the Hejjaz, which province is so remote that it can scarcely be included in our sphere. in rapidly increasing numbers boys from Saudi Arabia and other neighbouring states are joining our schools.At present we are able to provide a sound primary course of seven years and an introduction to a secondary education of three years. provided our schools are expanded and our secondary schools well equipped and staffed Saudi Arabians will send their sons to Bahrain or Kuwait rather than to Cairo or Beirut as the environment in these small Arab states is more suited to their needs. Bahrain already has an excellent hostel which can be extended when necessary. Steps taken in Kuwait to meet this need . The Kuwait Education Committee is fully aware of the position and is making preparations for development and expansion. The new infant schools will be opened in Sep tember 1946 and 15 more Egyptian masters and mistresses engaged. The Committee intends to set up a hostel in Cairo to house 50 students from Kuwait, the initial cost being £2000 and the running expenses £700 per mensem. These youths will attend schools and colleges in that city. The intention is that most of them will take short courses of one or two years of training as teachers. This will bring about a rapid improvement of the local teachers who form the majority of the staff. Foreign teachers will be employed chiefly in the secondary schools and upper classes of the primary schools 4 These, will be gradually replaced by graduates of the Kuwait Secondary School and those already at secondary schools abroad when they have taken a course at a training college either abroad or possibly in Kuwait. /StepsSteps to be taken In Bahrain * Similar action must be taken in Bahrain. A start has been made in that nine students were sent to T ^gypt in the summer of 1944, three of whom are at a secondary school, three at a-teachers training college and three at a technical school. This number should be increased to at least 30 this year. If the Government will set up a hostel many parents will be prepared to send their sons at their own expense. If Bahrain is to attract suitable foreign teachers and to retain their services better conditions must be provided. The terms of service compare most unfavourably with those of the '&lt;uwait Government. Except for a house allowance of rather less than £2 per mensem, which is only a fraction of the rent of a small house, no provision is made. As is done in Kuwait, special quarters must be set aside, or if necessary built. These should be suitable for a' married couple as most teachers are married. Salaries should be paid from the date of leaving Egypt and adequate detention allowances should the man be held up on his way to or from Bahrain, passages for wives are also paid to Kuwait employees. Thus their teachers are encouraged to continue their services with the Government over a period of years. All those who have completed their first contract are signing on for another, it is doubtful whether the Egyptians in Bahrain will stay for a second year even. The Director of Education should have a first class Arab Assistant and as soon as the man power problem eases a British Head Master for the Secondary School should be appointed. Under present conditions the Director is, among other things, Chief Clerk, Confidential Typist, Inspector General, Supervisor of English Studies and Adviser to the Kuwait Government. Only in his spare moments can he devote thought to administration and policy, which should be his prime concern. The salary of such an assistant would be about £1000. per annum plus allowances, half of which would be paid by the Egyptian Government were he seconded by the Ministry of Education. (The salary of the Director of ( Education, Kuwait is £1000 plus £400 p.a, allowances, paid ' half by Kuwait and half by Egypt) British Council Aid . The time is not yet ripe to appoint a British Director to Kuwait. The position of the Educational Adviser is now satisfactorily established. The only complaint ofthe Committee is that he is able to devote so little time and attention to Tr uwait affairs and can visit them only when his duties in Bahrain permit. They fully appreciate that the engagement of foreign staff and the placing of students abroad would be extremely difficult without the help of the British Council. That we were able to find so suitable a director of Education for them was indeed a feather in our cap. It has completely convinced them of our honourable intentions; They know too that they cannot open the Cairo Hostel unless the council undertakes a major part of the work. What they ask for is an Adviser resident in Cairo, where most of their students will be, who can keep in close touch with their boys, engage their teachers and visit them regularly; someone whom they have the right to call upon for advice and assistance rather than a casual visitor who does what he can in the limited time at his disposal. In conclusion I give below a summary of the part the /British1. Delegate an official in Cairo to continue the work of Educational Adviser to the Kuwait Government and to supervise the Kuwait and Bahrain (?) Hostel in Cairo. 2. Continue the grant tojbhe Bahrain Government and perhaps increas it to cover the Director's full salary when he is enabled, through the appointment of an Arab Assistant, to devotemore of his time to administration and policy, ' . , 3. Second an official as Director of Education for another period of four years. 4. In a year or so increase the grant to cover the salary of a British Head Master for the Secondary School. 5. Nominate a suitable man for this post.Cop/ of Express Letter No. 345-S dated 9th April, 1945, from the Hon'ble the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Reference your Express Letter No. 345-S dated the 9th April, 1945. The proposals in paragraph 2 and 6 to provide more accommodation and to better the terms of service of the Egyptian teachers are obviously desirable - provided the desirability of having Egyptian teachers is admitted. 2. T do not think there is any alternative to Egypt being regarded as the fountain-head from whiclv our educational efforts here must be supplied; and when it is combined with strong infusions from the British council I think that as little danger as possible to our interests is risked. T approve, therefore, of the proposals in paragraph 5 to set up a hostel in Cairo. 3. The proposals in paragraph 7 seem reasonable parti cularly as they are in keeping with the universal demand (and need) for extra staff here. 4. It will follow from the above that I agree with the Director of Education's summary in paragraph 9 of his noteCONFIDENTIAL Persian Gulf Residency, Bushire, To J w / /Lir The Political Agent, 'Vi o' &lt; BAHRAIN. ^ v ^ ^ n .-=&gt; MEMORANDUM NO.472- S Dated the 11th May, 1945 i3 Reference^correspondence ending with your Express Letter Ho.

The provision of a hostel in Cairo for students from Bahrain, similar to that being set up by the Kuwait Government, appears to be a measure that could be taken up without delay.

With reference to your D.O.No. C/603 dated 30th Ivlay 1945, regarding a hostel for Bahrain students in Cairo. The estimate of the cost in 7/akelin T s report was £2,000/- for the initial cost and £700/- per mensem for running expenses, this to provide for 50 students. Yesterday V/akelin sent me a letter from Ilighwood which was dated 12th April but has only now reached him, which gives an estimate for setting up the hostel. The figures he says are low, the standard of equipment is not high and only includes minimum requirements. Highwood f s estimate is for a hostel for 40 boys which will cost £10,000/- for initial outlay and one yea^s running expenses, but rent is not included and he says rent is a high item. We calculated that it would cost us about £6,500/- to start the hostel and run it for one year vvith 30 boys living there. It now seems that it will cost at least £7,500/- without rent and there is no indication of how much the rent will be, except that it is likely to be high. I will discuss the matter with His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla again and with Wakelin and Willey. C. Z. Pelly, Ssquire, O.B.E., I.C.S., H. B.

It is the desire of both governments to establish in Cairo hostels for students frosa these two countries, so that those boys who are already studying at Egyptian Schools by the iHnd arrangement of Your Sscellency's Ministry, can live under proper care with their conpatriots* This will also relieve the I^yptian Schools which so far have 2iad the courtesy to accept these boys as boarders. I should greatly appreciate them if the attention of the Military Governor could be directed to our need for houses for this purpose, one for the Bahrain Hostel capable of accomm odating 26 students and one for the Kuwait Hostel for about 50 stuaents# Without the assistance of Your Excellency and the co-operation of the Military Governor, I a* well aware that are unlikely to find suitable houses. Ahmed Hamdi bey, the Egyptian who is Director of Education in Kuwait, expects to be in Cairo in the early part of Julyj I myself expect to be there towards the end of July and with your permission shall give myself the pleasure of calling on you at that time. Uhtil then, I hope 1 may rely on the assistance of the Ministry of Bttucation.

'ft This is just to confirm what I told you yesterday that I had a letter from Willey from Cairo saying that on medical grounds he is not to be allowed to return to Bahrain but is being sent to England on sick leave. Harding had a letter from him giving more details and I gather from him that it was found that Willey's heart was in a very bad way and that if he did not have a complete rest at once he was in danger of dying. He had several 'black outs' while he was here, after coming out of hospital. I am sorry that he is not coming back. Losing him at the moment is extremely awkward as he went to Cairo to arrange about the hostel and I do not suppose he was able to do anything about it.

Although the Ministry of Sducation had agreed with Mr, V /akelin to mak e all arrangeinents for them, they arrived to find theicbelvee horaelees and their schooling unprovided for, the officials of the Ministry refusing any responsibility. Although they were in no way responsible, I'X Highwood, director of the Britiah Institute, and his staff took charge of the party, housed, fed and clothed them and arranged with the Ministry for them to be placed in boarding schools in Cairo and Tanta. jxt the request of Mr. Wakelin, who was then iducational -adviser to the Kuwait Government, Mr. Higjiwood continued to keep in touch with the boys. Ten went to the Saidieh Secondary School, five to the Tanta second ary School, one to the crman Primary and one to the ■Alexandria Uhiversity. ^ a similar situation a rose in October 1944 when 6 students from Bahrain arrived, ^'1 though Mr, v /akelin had made the preliminary arrangement'with the Ministry it feil to Mr Highwood to find accommodation and to arrange schooling for the boys, '^ree v/ere placed at the Abdul *.zlz Training School, three at the Boulaq TechAical School and three at the Siedieh Secondary School. The last three, among whom were Sheiltfi Ehalid Mohammed and Fahad Dhain, were boarders at the school, ¥he other six were accommodated at Africa House a pension not far from the Institute. although the British Oouncil could not accept responsibility for these boys it was agreed that Mr Highwood, as far as his duties would permit, should keep in touch with them. !i his he and his staff did thgoughout the year. It was while he was on leave that Khalid became difficult. It was unfortunate that Baffar Bey Nafrawi, the HeadmuatBi of the Saidieh School who did so much for the welfare of the Gulf Students, wat replaced during the school year and was succeeded by two others in turn. It was with the second of these that Khalid Mohammed quarrelled. He then determined to return to Bahrain. His influence over Fahad Dhain - the only other pure ^irab of the j^arty - was considerable. Fahad insisted on returning with Khalid. Sheikh Mohammed bin «&lt;sa el Khalifeh, Khalid^ uncle, was in Cairo at the time. He made every effort to make Khalid see reason but failed to persuade him to stay. 5 Both Mr Higfrwood and Mr wakelin were fully aware of the undesirability of bringing boys from the Gulf to Cairo as long as they were not strictly supervised and wei:e insistent on the establishment of Hostels here. In September 1945, by the help of the British Council, two houses were found, furniture was bought and staff engaged. There are now 55 students in the Fuwait Hostel and 20 in that of Bahrain. Abdel -aziz Hussain of Kuwait is Warden of the first and Mohammed Habbashi, an Igy^tian, warded of the se c ond. L &gt; Since the establishment of the Hostels all students qmst submit to strict discipline and are carefully watched over . /.illA*7&gt; a11 accountB are handled by jex Micallif, the Institute Accountant, who does this very competently. He makes regular inspections and takes great interest in the work. Ittr Wakelin, who is now Deputy Director of the Institute, is in charge and he too visits the hostels regular ly. ^ Mr ,/akelin is equally interested in both hostels but the Bahrain Warden is more dependent on him than the other. The Kuwait Government co-operates with us but not to the same extent in that from time to time instructions are sent direct to the warden without reference to the Institute leading to some confusion. It is hoped that these difficulties will/overcome as Sadik Hamdi, the Director of fliducfrtion in Kuwait, is expected shortly in Cairo.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000119_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/842</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000119</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/842</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 34/4 (4/23) Hostel for Bahrain Students in Cairo'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1945/1945</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-18T00:05:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (35 folios)</extent><extent>File is arranged in chronological order, from earliest at beginning of the file to most recent at end.</extent><extent>Condition: The file was previously bound with treasury tags but these have since been removed and its pages are now loose.Foliation: The file's foliation sequence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
