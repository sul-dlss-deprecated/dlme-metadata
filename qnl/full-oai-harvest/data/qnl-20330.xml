However, it explains that the Resident cannot envisage a scenario — excepting a Wahabee move against Muscat — in which British troops would need to be deployed on the Arabian Coast, as naval power alone should be enough to achieve British objectives.It also states that the extent the Chief of Bahrein [Bahrain] should be permitted to take measures to defend himself against Ameer Fysul should also be considered; this might include defensive action against his exiled relatives at Demaun [Ad-Dammān], or accepting a protectorate from the Ottoman Empire.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051548.0x000041#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
