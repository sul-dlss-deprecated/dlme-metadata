A pay bill may, if desired, be enfaced for payment to a Banker or Agent and submitted for collection through such Banker or Agent; this will obviate the necessity of the Government servant's attendance in person or by messenger, as payment may then be made direct to the Barker or Agent. r 3. The period for which a subscription to a Fund is due should be specified when it differs from the period for which pay is drawn. 4. In the case of Government servants entitled to Sterling Overseas Pay, fund deductions are based on the Rupee Pay the rupee equivalent of, the pterlyig Overseas Payr N ote 1.—Treasury Officers should see that all compulsory deductions including those for Indian Civil {Jecvice Provident Ftfncl are duly made and that the schedules showing particulars of Fund deductions, are attached to the pay bills. N ote 2.—Subscribers to the Sterling Branch of a Provident Fund should note on the bill and in thp Fund Schedule attached to the bill that the recoveries relate to the Sterling Branch.
