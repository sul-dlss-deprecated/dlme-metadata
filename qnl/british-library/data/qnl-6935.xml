Mesopotamia: Questions in regard to recaptured Rivercraft. Note m Political Department, India Office. 1. The main question to be settled is whether, and, if so, on what terms the authorities m Mesopotamia should now return to their original (British) owners a numhei ot rivercraft that were captured in the first instance by the Turks and Mesopotamia 7 British forces in tlle course of the operations in 2^. 1 he information available in this Office is not altogether clear as to the smaller boats, and may possibly not De complete; but so far as can be gathered the following aie the vessels coming within the above description :— Originally owned hy Messrs. Lynch Bros. Reported Approximate Value. Kemarks. Motor-boat Mosca - 1 Steam-launch Asp Pour barges, known as L, M, N and P or as Nos. 12, 3, 4 and 5. Barge 13 (old ISTo.), 44 (new No.).

Recaptured apparently in 1915 during advance on Amara. Barge N reported in 1917 to have changed hands for fourth time. Captured by lurks at Kut, April 1916. Recaptured Pebruary 1917 (described as 'armed launch'). Not placed in Prize Court, apparently. Messrs. Lynch have no legal claim as the vessel had been used as a sliip of war (Admiralty letter L 1770 of the 24th January 1918).

The papers relating to tlic recap r . uu j erst00( j tliat the vessels mentioned, the Admiralty and W ar Othce, an ^ Co|]rt ^ U)ndon Definite except the Sum,ma, have been ' ' , available in this Office, nor is it known ^Tv£ 0n course^he&amp; CourtproceeUiug;. where instituted, have taken. 4. The general position in regard to recapturedjrizes is laid down by section 40 of +1, Voval Priyp Act 1864, which, runs as follcms . , . - 'When any ship or goods belonging to any of Her Majesty's subjects, after W hen anj snip h „ 1 ^ rnv ; s or are retaken from the enemy by any of 'SterMajesTv 's ships of war, the same shall bo restored by decree of a crize court to the owner, on his paying as prize salvage one-eighth part of the value of the prize, to be decreed and ascertained by the court, or such sum, not exceediiig one-eighth part of the estimated value of the prize as riav'be agreed on between tlie owner and the recaptors, and approved by order of the court: Provided, that where the recapture is made under circumstances of special difficulty or danger, the prize court may, it it thinks fit award to the recaptors as prize salvage a larger part than one-eighth part but not exceeding in any case one-fourth part of the value ot the prize Provided also, that where a ship after being so taken is set forth or used bv any of Her Majesty's enemies as a ship of war, this provision for restitution shall not apply, and 'the ship shall be adjudicated on as m other cases of prize.' 5. As regards the last proviso, it does not at present appear that any of the vessels (other than the Sinnana) Avere used by the Turks as ships of war. 1 he General Officer Commanding, Basra, reported in July 1915, with relerence to the eailiei recaptures, that ' they w'ere used for transport of troops and supplies and for other military purposes, and hew Turkish flags, but no fixed guns were carried on board.' The Admiralty commented on this that as the vessels were not armed they ' were not presumably, to be regarded as ships of war (letter N.L. 1/30219, -1st June 1916). 6. The first question that arises, therefore, is whether the circumstances are such that the vessels are returnable to the original owners on payment by them of prize salvage. 7. Two other questions as to payments by Government to the owners also arise in certain cases ;— (i) Where vessels have been used for Government purposes there is the question of the payment of hire. (ii) In the case of the Khalifah, Ishtar, and four barges, the Euphrates and Tigris S.N. Co. have claimed the value of the vessels from His Majesty's Govern ment on the ground that they would not have been captured by the Turks if the Company had not, against their own inclinations, kept them on the Tigris in deference to the wishes of Government. [The claim included also the Bulbul, subsequently sunk by British gunfire, while in possession of the Turks, in June i915.J It appears that this claim has been the subject of correspondence between Messrs. Slaughter and May (on behalf of the Company) and the Treasury, who in a letter of the 10th December last (No. 294(39) rejected the claim so far as the Bulhul (and apparently the barges) were concerned, and deferred their decision as to the Khalijah and Ishtar. 6 ^ ave no ^ information as to the details of all the cases in the list. But the liability to pay prize salvage on the one side and hire on the other would appear to turn on questions of principle ; while the question as to compensation is a special one arising only in the cases mentioned under (ii) above. A general decision as to the action to be taken can prbbably be taken on grounds of principle; but it will be imlivirl 0 11 re . ca P ltu ^ briefly the lacts of the cases which have been discussed four barges^ L. ViZ - th0Se 0f the the aud thf - « aDiL?from 6 tfm7 tiff rS ' ^ &amp; Ca 8,916,1 in Au g ust la st that they had thisf boat without resuU Tl ^ p f par , entl y to ,, the local authorities) for the return of 0 ^ W ' t,10Ut result - llleir iu 'her application of August was referred home by^ 0 ZfZ ent0f Iud r' ^.^''^tyaetter L. 71 of the 19th January 1919) ted that pnze proceedings had been instituted in respect of this vessel but had been discontinued, without prejudice to any claim that might be made by the naval ch mditary authority for pn. 0 salvage, on Messrs. Strick, Scott &amp; Co. proving that they had originally owned the vessel. The Admiralty letter mentioned that a da m for prize salvage had m fact been put forward by the naval forces concerned and suggested that the vessel might be returned to Messrs. Strick, Scott if ' thev gave an undertaking to pay any pnze^ salvage that might be due. This suo-^estion wis passed on to the local authorities in Mesopotamia. On the 28th April the Inspector-Genera of Communications telegraphed from Basra that he had already ered to return the boat under the same conditions as were authorised by General Headquarters in a precisely similar case here, that is, that no claim for compensation or hire payment should be made.' Messrs. Strick, Scott, it was stated, had Accepted this offer and now confirmed their acceptance. If the alternative proposed bv the ^ miralty was to be adopted, Messrs. Strick, Scott would not accept the proposal &lt;&lt; ^ I1 ® ss Principle is accepted that if they pay salvage the vessel automatically reverts o em from date of salvage, and thus hire would be due to them from that date ' ine Admiralty on this telegram expressed the views that 44 the claim for prize s , v ^ e 18 a substantive right of the captors and cannot be disposed of to their detnment by a waiver by the owners of a claim for hire,' and that the military authonties should accept liability to make reasonable compensation for the use of the boat since the date on which she would otherwise have been handed back, i .e. the date of recapture or as soon as practicable thereafter. The case is at present under reference to the War Office. 1°. The Khalifah.—The Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Co. reported on the lj 1st March last that they had been notified of the arrival of the Khalifah at Baghdad on the 15th March in charge of officers of the Inland Water Transport Department They proposed that they should take over the vessel at once, at a 'valuation, deducting the \alue from the amount of their claim against Government (referred to above) ; and that Government should pay any claims under the head of salvage. On the 28th March the Inspector-General of Communications. Basra telegraphed to the War Office suggesting that if the Company's claims to compensation lor the loss ol' the vessel weie admitted, she became Government property, to be disposed of eventually in the same way as the rest of the fleet; and that' in the alternative, if the claim to compensation were rejected, the vessel should be reconditioned and returned to Messrs. Lynch on their giving a guarantee to waive any claims for compensation. (Ihe question of hire by Government does not arise in this case as the vessel has not been used by Government; but, in the meantime pending settlement of the case, the General Officer Commanding -in-Chief has agreed to let Messrs. Lynch have the use of the vessel at a reasonable rate of hire (telegram No. 8410 of 28th July 1919 from Civil Commissioner, Baghdad). The Treasury and Admiralty have pointed out that the owners are entitled to the return of the vessel on payment of prize salvage, provided that they are British subjects and that the vessel was not used as a ship of war by the enemy. The views of the War Office have also been invited. 11. Barges L, M, N and P. —The Euphrates and Tigris S.N. Co., in a letter of the 2nd May 1917, said : ' The British authorities at Basra claim that this Company is ' not entitled to receive payment of hire of the recaptured barges. We are advised ' that, as they have legally remained British property, they would revert to the owners on recapture, subject to any prize claim. If 'this advice be admitted, this ( ompany is entitled to charge hire from the dates they came under requisition u to Government.' In October 1917 the Government of India reported : ' We have ' authorised the Financial Adviser, Indian Expeditionary Force D, to admit pro- ' visionally the hire for the barges L, M, N and P, without prejudice to any decision ' that may hereafter be arrived at regarding them by the Imperial Government.' In April last the Government of India asked by telegram for an early decision as to the ultimate disposal of these barges. The question has been referred to the War Office. 12. The six particular cases of which details are given above are, so far as is known at this Office, the only cases in regard to which the questions arising have so far actually been taken up in correspondence; but the same questions must presumably arise, or perhaps may already have arisen locally, in regard to some or all of the other vessels mentioned in the above list.- —— i 1 f (leal in f with all cases of this kind 13. It would appear that » in Individual cases if necessary ^ght be bid down. the ^len.ent of iudivnlnal cases .1 U were first The way would be cieaieu decided generallygeneral rule that (subject to proof of (i) whether it should be ^ having been used as ships of war by British ownership, •' 1 sll0||M be r eu,rned as soon as practicable to the enemy) recapturert vms ... undertaking to pay any amount the original owners th ^ ^ ' g be award ed by the Prize Court, and StS any^ther condTdons (e.cpt possibly as to payment for repairs- m **■ ~*g to S del'v'd by Government use or other cause ; veesel to her owneis . -i-.f r rP r)airs.

A si.mlar question may perhaps arise (but can hardly be very important) as to the place of del .very o the vessel to the owne/ Is the obligation to hand over the vessel as at the r ) to'teadopted in regard to the payment of hire in cases in which ( ) the vessels have been used after recapture for Government purposes ; (v) what is to be done as to the special claim for compensation against His Majesty's Government made in the case of the and certain other vessels. 14 The answers to these questions will probably enable the six cases of which details are given above to be disposed of without further discussion except as to de ads, ft night also be useful, in view of possible future cases, to decide what line is to be taken up in regard to cases like that of the Snmana where vessels have been used as ships of war by the enemy. Is there any question ot admitting claims on the bount} of the Crown from the original owners in such cases ? 15. The question may also be raised whether owners can base an} claim on mcic delay on the part of Government in handing back to them recaptuied \cssels. 22nd July 1919.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00031f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B325</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00031f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B325</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Mesopotamia: Questions in regard to recaptured Rivercraft'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1919/1919</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-12T15:31:28</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (2 folios)</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation for this sequence commences at folio 58, and terminates at folio 60, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
