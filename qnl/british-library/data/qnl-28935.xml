Xcxi Oil Co• P.O. Box 919, Bombay. Dear Sirs, In continuation of our letter PC*26/101 dated September 11th. We should be greatly obliged if you could recruit, in addition, one Indian Wireless Mechanic, capable of maintaining, transmitting from, and receiving ©t, a small wireless set in a very detached location, and secondly, one Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon, capable of acting on his own and looking after the needs of isolated parties under desert conditions. Conditions of recruitment and employment would be, in general, as detailed in our previous letter under reference, and personnel should similarly be either Christians or Sunni Mohammedans. Engagement would be for a minimi® of six months, subject to termination by either side of one month* s notice. It is quite probable, however, that the appointments would be extended in the case of satisfactory men. We shall have to asfc you to fix the pay of the Wire less Mechanic in accordance with the local supply oi this type of personnel, since there is no precedent, as far as we fcnow, upon which we can rely. We should expect to pay the Sub-Assistant Surgeon between Ks.220 and JOO per month.PETROLEUM CONCEsilONS LIMITED. The Wireless Mechanic will probably be asked to serve at Dohah, on the Qatar Peninsula (Persian Gulf, South Coast), and the Sub-Assistant Surgeon, partly on that Peninsula, ana partly on the Trucial Coast, and possibly also at Bahrain.

The subject matter is self-explanatory. I wondered whether you would think it worth while sending a copy of this to the Political Agent, Bahrain, (and, just possibly, showing it to Colonel Fowle if he happens to be in your office) so that the Bahrain authorities will be prepared for the demand for no objection certificates which Bombay will be making in due course. If any Questions arise, or are likely to arise, out of this importation of Indian personnel — which seems to be practised very freely in Bahrain — we should naturally like to know about them from the proper authority at the earliest stage possible, so as to square our procedure with all the regulations in force. Ends. 3 9 A'* WAIL ■ - 19 SEP W36 Yours sincerely. FROM SECRETARY, PC'-i AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA C, ; Fi#c M.J.

Be&amp;r Sirs, We attach copy of letter No. PBQ /55 dated September 7th from A.I.O.C. London, in which the latter kindly instruct us that we may use your serrices on the same terms as the I.P.C. have done for some time pest. Ire suggest that expenditure should be met in the same manner as at present. We are concerned immediately with the recruitment of certain labour for work (a) on Bahrain Island, (b) on the Qatar Peninsula (Persian Gulf, South Coast), and (c) in Trucial Oman (Persian Gulf, fouth-west Coast). Personnel for all these three locations would be required in Bahrain in the first instance, where the Manager of this Company will allocate them to their duties. The staff required is (1) A senior or semi-senior Indian Accounts Clerk, able to handle records as well as simple accounts, and mteintain the office during tem porary absences of the Manager. ( 2 ) An Inaim Clerk-typist(3) 6 M.T. drivers, to handle Chevrolet trucks or cars, probably under difficult conditions. 2 of these should be reliable mechanics as well as drivers. p* ( 4 ) 2 cooks. (5) cess-boys or personal servants. For the senior clerk we should expect to have to pay Ba .225 or upwards, but normally not exceeding Rs. 275 * Ex perience outside India, and especially a tcnowledge of Persian or Arabic, would be valuable. Junior clerk-typist*s pay would be Es.200 to Rs.220. Drivers* pay Rs .90 to Rs.120 per mensem, and slightly more in the case of driver mechanics. Cooks* pay R &amp;.60 p.m., and mess-boys Rs .45 to Rs.55« Tcs should provide quarters (probably tentcge,' or, failing th£t, an allowance in lieu based on the custom of the place. Free food would be supplied to personnel working on the main land, i.e. not on Bahrain Island. The two clerks are definitely for our office on Bahrain Island, end would therefore receive a house allowance (since there are ct present no Company quarters available). They would feed themselves. Of the other personnel, one driver, one cook and one boy would be for Bahrain Island, the re mainder at least intermittently for the mainland. Saagagement would be for a minimum of six months, subject to termination by either side of one month*s notice. Per sonnel who are satisfactory could, however, expect a longish term of employment* This applies particularly to the clerks and to a proportion of the other personnel. We understand that vaccination against small-pox and T.A.B. inoculation would be necessary as well as a medical examination, which is no doubt your routine. The personnel detailed above should, if and when re cruited and despatched by you, proceed to Bahrain by B.I. mall and report there to the Manager of this Compcny, Mr. E.*. Packer, who will be there on anu from October 20th. Should they arrive at Bahrain in advance of him, our temporary Acting Agent is the A.I.O.C* Agent, Haji Yusif Kanu. It Is undesirable, however, that they kW.r 0 %hVF»&amp; 1 &amp; re o f ^mfi ml nn n •1 PETROLEUM CONCESSIONS LIMITED. f \ The Company guarantees the return passage of ali P®^' sonnel thus recruited, in accordance with Government regula tion. Vie suggest that, as soon as you have selected the per sonnel, you should address the P ® 11 ? 1 - 0 * 1 * gent } * y le-ter (or by cable If time presses), asking rum to I 83 ?® il-obj.cuo/certificates, to enrble this personnel to lend in Bahrain. Wa understand that in special c*se- the Political Agent will cable his agreement. If you hawe sny immediate queries in connection with this, will you kindly cable us in order to avoid delay.
