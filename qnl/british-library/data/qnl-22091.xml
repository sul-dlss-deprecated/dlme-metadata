Daly, C.S.X., C.I.E., National Savings Commissioner, Government of India Finance Department, National Savings Central Bureau, Simla, to the Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ===== : I have the honour to enclose herewith a copy of memo randum No. F.22(25)-IA/43 dated the 29th October, 1943, from the Secretary to His Excellency the Crown Representative to Residents in connection with the introduction of the Small Savings Scheme in Indian States, with literature to explain what this scheme is. The Government of India have now decided in consultation with the External Affairs Department, that the scheme may now be introduced in the Arab Principalities in the Persian Gulf. The Scheme aims at the appointment of a large number of Agents known as the Authorized Agents who would approach the general public and sell National Savings Certificates to them, earning a commission of 2£ $ on all sales secured by them. In the Arab Principalities these Agents would be appointed by the Principalities concerned and the Government of India would refund to the Principalities all commission earned by Agents appointed by them. In addition to the refund of the 2£ f for sales through Agents appointed by the Principalities the Government of India will pay 1 ^ on total sale of National Savings Certificates within the principalities irrespective of the fact whether they are sold through an Agent or direct from the Post Offices. If the Scheme is energetically worked, this 1 % may amount to a considerable sum. In case any of these Principalities agree to adopt the Scheme, the required books and forms will be supplied from the Centre in Arabic. Extra copies of this letter are enclosed herewith, in case you need them for supply to the Political Agents at Bahrain, Kuwait and Muscat, when addressing them in the matter. % If you agree to Bahrain, Muscat and Kuwait behlg approached, will ypu please instruct the Political Agents accordingly. In India Residens have found it convenient to permit me to correspond direct with Political Agents in regard to the routine of starting and working the Scheme, and it would save time if you agree to my doing so. In this case, will you please ask Political Agents to write to me direct in any matter which requires further elucidation.Copy of memorandum No. F.22(25)-I.A/43 dated the 29th October, 1943, from the Secretary to His Excellency the Crown Representative, New Delhi, to the Residents, Hyderabad Mysore, Central India, Rajputana, Western India, Punjab States, Baroda, Kashmir, Gwalior, Madras States, Kolhapur, Eastern States, and Secretary to H.E. the Governor of Assam. Sale of National Savings Certificates in Indian States and proposed 'Small Savings Scheme'. ( Continuation of Political Department Memorandum No. F.22(25)-I.A/43 dated the 11th October, 1943.) The Government of India have preapred for use in British Iiidia a 'Small Savings Scheme' for the sale of National Savings Certificates which will replace and supersede the existing Defence Saving Certificates, proposals for the sale of which in convention and non convention States have been the subject of correspondence, and are desirous that a similar scheme should be introduced in the Indian States as soon as possible. Lt. Col. C.K. Daly, C.S.I., C.I.E., has been appointed National Savings commissioner, and has prepared a modified scheme for operation in Indian States. He has been authorised to forward the scheme to you and conduct all future correspond- ence, except matters of policy with you direct. Copy forwarded to Finance Department ( National Savings Central Bureau - Col. Daly ) for information with reference to their letter No. 2265/A/5 dated the 21st October, 1943.

V L Xt N. fc&gt;. 0. H. Circular No. A|2. FINANCE DEPARTMENT. NATIONAL SAVINGS CENTRAL BUREAU. NOTE ON THE SMALL SAVINGS SCHEME. HOW TO PUT THE SCHEME QUICKLY INTO OPERATION. Action by the Provincial Governmentjor Government of an Indian State. (1) (i) To put in hand the immediate printing of (a) Certificates of Authority (for the appointment of Authorised Agents). . ' x . „ . (b) The Receipt Books for Authorised Agents in the required vernaculars and English. (ii) Either to take action as above, if the State will produce these docu ments or :— (iii) To inform the National Savings Commissioner. Finance Department, Simla, of , (a) The number of Certificates of Authority required. (b) The number of Receipt Books of each denomination required, e.g., Books of Receipts for 10 Rs. Books of Receipts for 50 Rs. (c) Mixed Books of Receipts for higher denominations, and to say clearly how many of each is required and tit what langu^Qes. v (2) While the action outlined in para. 1 is being taken, to issue instructions ££ ^0 » -— # (a) Which authorities in the Province!State are empowered to appoint , Authorised Agents and issue to them Certificates of Authority. (b) Which authorities in the Province [State are to act as “ issuing and checking authorities ”, e.g., to hold stocks of Receipt Books and issue them to Authorised Agents and check them 0 n their return by the Agents. (c) What classes of persons may be employed as Authorised Agents, e.g., (i) Which minor government officials, such as Revenue Staff. School masters, Agricultural Department employees, etc., etc. (ii) Headmen of villages or other quasi-officials. (iii) Non-officials—and to instruct Appointing Authorities as to the precautions considered necessary to ensure that such non-officials are persons of integrity, e.g., owners of immovable property, or guaranteed by owners of immovable property or by persons of substance known to the Authorities, &lt;n* whatever other precautions the Provincial Govern ment! State Government consider desirable. (d) If the Provincial Government!State Government desire that “ Certi ficates of Authority ” should be valid only for a limited period, and then require renewal by the “ Appointing Authority ”, to issue instructions necessary. (3) Concurrently with the issue of Instructions suggested in para. (2) it is suggested that, to save time instructions be issued to the District Authorities to proceed with tbe enrolment of Authorised Agents, pending receipt of the neces sary Forms and Books. (4) Prepare local publicity for the Small Savings Scheme. If it is anti- cipated that there will be any difficulty in finding an adequate number of Autho rised Agents, advertising might be resorted to •Provincial Government. , f Indian State. tApplicable to Provincial Governmente only (not States) i2 (a; Explaining the qualifications necessary for appointment as an Authorised Agent. (b) Explaining that employment may be full-time or part-time. (c) Explaining the commission that can be earned. (d) Giving the designation and address of the “ Appointing Autho rity ”-to whom applications for appointment as Authorised Agents, should be sent in each District. Action by Distrct Authorities in a Province|State. (5) On receipt from the Provincial Government [State Government of the instructions outlined in para. (2). (i) Proceed to enrol suitable Authorised Agents :— Jfe (a) Rural Areas. —When the Provincial Government!State Govern ment has authorised the employment as Authorised Agents of Govern ment] Stale officials—to nominate them. If. they are insufficient in num bers adequately to cover the whole rural area to proceed to prepare lists of suitable non-officials- —if their employment has been authorised by the ProvincialjState Government. d (b) Towns. —In towns Government)State officials may not be available' to act as Authorised Agents, or w'ould be in insufficient numbers. It follow’s that non-officials must be recruited. In recruiting these the assistance of any existing bodies such as (1) Defence Loan Committees. .(2) War Boardsj Committees. (3) Municipal Authorities. can be sought with advantage. (6) The object is to ensure that every part of a town is canvassed by an Authorised Agent. Large Concerns such as Government Offices, Business Concerns, Mills, Factories, Banks, Hos pitals, Clubs, Railway Stations, can be asked to suggest a name or names from among their employees for appointment as Authorised Agenta to can vass unthin their own establishments. Shopkeepers can be appointed as Authorised Agents to canvass clients in their shops and in addition, if will ing, to canvass in their spare time a portion of their residential area. School-masters chn be appointed both to canvass in their school or college and if required and willing to do so, to canvass in their residential area. Retired Government Officials, often past the age for active work, can sup plement their pensions by acting as Authorised Agents. (7) In cases where large business concerns, mills, factories, etc., give a * Bonus ’ to employees, it may be suggested that this be given in the form of National Savings Certificates. The commission earned on the sales of these ‘ Bonus ’ certificates can very suitably be devoted to the concerns’ welfare Funds, or if desired the employers can deduct the commission earned from the cost of the National Savings Certificates to the employee, e.g., if the Bonus to any individual employee were Rs. 10, the Authorised Agent (member of the staff of «im concern) would receive As. 4. This could be deducted from the cost o^^ the Certificate, the employee concerned then obtaining a Rs. 10 certificate for Rs. 9 As. 12—or a combination of these methods could be used, e.g., Part of the commission to the Authorised Agent for his trouble in purchasing the ‘ Bonus ' certificates, and part to the staff “ Welfare Fund ”—or be returned to the mem bers on whose behalf the certificates are purchased. The method to be used is clearly for the firms concerned to determine with the agreement of their employees, but this form of “ Bonus ” is not only a very good investment for the employees interested, but enables the employers to earn commission for the benefit of staff Welfare Funds, etc. Charitable Institutions can be induced to apply for a member to be appoint ed as Authorised Agent to canvass and such member could devote his earnings to the charity concerned, or split it with the Charity’s Funds—the arrangement oeing one for the organisers of the charity themselves to determine.(8) If units)formations of Indian Army Troops are stationed in the Dis trict, acquaint the stationjunit Commander of the fact that the Small Savings Scheme is ready to function, referring him to Indian. Army Order No. 2346|43, dated 3rd January 1944, in which the military procedure is laid down, also inform him (1) of the designation and address of the nearest “ Appointing Officer ”, (2) name and addreas of the nearest Issuing and Checking Authority. The Military Commander, if he desires to work the scheme will acquaint the District Officer of the names of Military personnel he wishes to be appointed as Authorised Agents and the unit (Formation [Station in which they will canvass ^^litary personnel only. Civilian Authorised Agents will not be allowed to can vass in Military Barracks or premises. If local advertising for Authorised Agents is necessary [see para. 2 (4)]— it is presumed that the Provincial Government, to which a publicity grant has been allotted by the Government of India, would meet the cost. (9) Once the preliminaries outlined in paras. 1—7 have been fulfilled the ^mall Savings Scheme will run automatically—Agents will canvass and sell certificates, returning their completed Receipt Books to the ” Issuing and Check ing Authority ” to check, and drawing their commission from Treasuries. For British India the necessary instructions have been issued to' Treasuries. All that will be necessary is to continue to recruit Authorised Agents until every area is adequately covered, and to replace inefficient Agents, or any who may resign. When an Agent’s Certificate of Authority becomes inoperative through (i) Cancellation by the authorities or :— (ii) Resignation of the agent the appropriate Post Master (to whom the Counterfoil of the agent’s Certificate of Authority was sent when he was first appointed) should be informed. Points applicable to Indian States only. (10) The action outlined in paras. 1 to 9 apply equally to Indian States with the following exceptions :— States have been offered a percentage (based on the total sales by Authorised Agents working in the State—Statistics in this connection will be furnished by the Posts and Telegraphs Department to the Government of India, to enable the percentage payments to be computed) for expenses of the Scheme. It follows therefore that advertising for ‘ Authorised Agents ’, if necessary, will be done at the cost of the State. Advertising material to encourage investment in National Savings Certificates will, however, be supplied free to State by the Government of India as stated in the Small Savings Scheme. Para. 9. In States the responsibility for payment of the commission to Autho rised Agents rests with the State. The Government of India will refund to the State in bulk, the commission so earned by Agents on their sales of National Savings Certificates in the State (necessary statistics in respect of such Sales are being provided by the Posts and Telegraphs Department to the Government India). It follows that any instructions necessary in regard to the payment of com mission and accounting for the same, should be issued to State Treasuries]Officials by the Government of the State. (11) In States where an adequate number of Imperial Post Offices exist, the Authorised Agents will obtain National Savings Certificates from such Post Offices exactly as in British India. If Sub-Post Offices are insufficient in a State, the State Authorities should furnish to the National Savings Commissioner, Finance Department, Simla, the following information (a) Names of Branch Post Offices, at which facilities for the purchase of National Savings Certificates is desirable or •Applicable to District officials of provinces only (not States).V (bj-Names of places in which the IState would like Savings Bureaux to» be opened (see Small Savings Scheme for States), These Savings Bureaux are in fact small auxiliary Post Offices set up temporarily by the Imperial Posts and Telegraphs Department, solely for the Sale of National Savings Certificates and National Savings Stamps, and, will not transact any other Post Office business. The necessary qualification for (b) above is that the weekly sales of National Savings Certificates should average 100 per week ; if sales are consistently below this figure the cost of operating such a Bureau would not be justified. It follows that States should not propose (b) unless it is estimated that the Authorised Agents who will purchase National Savings Certificates from suelK Savings Bureaux, will be able to sell at least 100 certificates (of any denomin. tion) per week. (12) In certain States there are very few Imperial Post Offices and no State Postal Service. Such States should, if desired, apply for Savings Bureaux to be opened as described in para. 11—otherwise the Scheme is operated exactly as in British India. (13) In some States there are few Imperial Post Offices, but State Pc Offices also exist. In such Stal^, either :— (a) The action outlined in para. 11 may be taken or :— (b) The action outlined in para. 14 be taken in respect of the State Post Offices—the Imperial Post Offices in this case would also continue to sell National Savings Certificates. Otherwise the Scheme is operated exactly as in British India. (14) In certain States no Imperial Post Offices exist but State Post Offices are functioning. In these States the Scheme is worked exactly the same as for British India and other States, except that special arrangements have to be made for the supply of National Savings Certificates and Savings Stamps to Authorised Agents. There arrangements are :— (i) National Savings Certificates are supplied by the Imperial Posts and Telegraphs Department in bulk to the State. These certificates are. sur charged with the name of the State. The State assumes full responsibility for selling the Certificates to the Authorised Agents through its own Post Offices and for so doing receives from the Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment a fixed payment per transaction. The State Postal Service remits the money received from sales to the Imperial Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment. Similarly when the State subsequently discharges the Certificates, it will receive the appropriate refund from the Imperial Posts and Tele graphs Department. The precise arrangements for accounting for these transactions will be separately communicated to any States adopting this arrangement. States accepting this arrangement are requested to inform the National Savings Commissioner, ^ Finance Department, Simla. (1) of their probable requirements of surcharged National Savings Certificates of each denomination (Rs. 10, 50, 100, 500 and 1,000) for months. (2) Probable requirements for six months of Form NC (1)—the form of application for purchase of National Savings Certificates for use at their State Post Offices. The scheme otherwise operates in these States exactly as elsewhere. ' ' / (15) State Authorities of States which agree to work the Small Savings Scheme are requested not to apply to the Imperial Postal Authorities in the first instance in respect of the^Postal arrangements outlined in paras. 11—14 ; but to the National Saving^ Commissioner, Finance Department, Simla, who will make the necessary arrangements through the Posts and Telegraphs Depart ment, at the same time informing the State concerned of the arrangements being made to meet their requirements.

(1) Proposed arrangements for the sale of National Savings Certificates in the States in conjunction with the small Savings Scheme. (a) In ‘ Unity ’ States— e.g. those in which Imperial Post Offices function ea behalf of the State, no difficulty arises, since Certificates are available at these Post Offices. ** (6) In the ‘ Convention ’ States in which no Imperial Post Offices exist, and - in ‘ Non-Convention ’ States, where such Post Offices are few, and serve only limited areas, the arrangement in para. 2 is suggested. This proposal, it is anticipated, would relieve the State Postal Service of the expense and labour involved in dealing with the sale of Certificates, and the resultant complication of accounting with the Imperial Posts and Telegraphs Department — defects from which the Hyderabad and Gwalior Schemes, hitherto under consideration, were not free. (2) Establishment of Temporary Savings Bureaux in Convention and Non-Convention States. Jt is proposed that in towns and rural areas in which it is anticipated that the volume of work would justify, Saving Bureaux be set up. A clerk would be supplied to each such Bureau, by the Imperial Posts and Telegraphs Department, for the sole purpose of issuing National Savings Certificates and Savings Stamps. The clerk would maintain his accounts with, and make necessary £ Returns ’ to, an Imperial Post Office (probably that from which he has been deputed, either within the State in Non-Convention States, or without the State but near the borders, in a Convention State). The State Postal Service would thus be in no way involved. (3) Savings Bureaux—Assistance required from the State. States would be requested to— (i) supply suitable accommodation for the Bureaux— e.g. an office for the clerk to work in, and either living accommodation or facilitate his obtaining such at reasonable rent; (it) provide the clerk with the means of keeping his stock of certificates and petty cash in safety ; (iii) provide facilities for the transfer of the clerk’s cash takings to the “ parent ” Post Office (e.g. Imperial Post Office with which the clerk deals). The exact procedure can be worked out between the State Authorities and the Posts and Telegraphs Department, as best suits their mutual convenience. It might be through the medium of State Treasuries, or perhaps through accounts which already exist between the two services. (4) The Small Savings Scheme. The above paragraphs describe the proposed arrangements for the actual issue of the Certificates. The ‘ Small Savings Scheme ’, introduced in conjunction, supplies the machinery for popularising sales. (4-A) Object of Small Savings, Scheme. The Scheme provides for an organization for the recruitment and continuous employment of Authorized Agents, who by personal contact with the inhabitants of the areas in which they work, will encourage the SAVING HABIT, and the in vestment of savings in Natioanl Savings Certificates. The Agents will collect money from subscribers, obtain Certificates from the Post Office (or a Savings Bureau, where such exists) and dehver them to the owners. The work is of great national importance — of permanent importance to India, being a social movement to encourage thrift among the masses, at a time when high wages and agricultural earnings offer, perhaps for the first time, opportunities for saving to many to whom such opportunity has not hitherto been a possibility.]t is also oi impoitance at the present time as an anti-inflationary measure, to remove surplus money from circulation and diminish unnecessary spending. The procedure under the British-India Scheme is that the Provincial Government determines which of their officers shall be empowered to appoint “Authorized Agents”. (See para. 5). A suitable 4 Form for the appointment of an Authorized Agent is shown at Appendix I. (6) Authorized Agents- Ajypmniment of. . As will be seen from the specimen “ Certificate of Authority (Appendix I)^&gt; each Agent is given a specified area within which he canvasses purchasers of National Savings Certificates—e.g. a group of villages in rural areas—a ward in a town, etc., as convenient. This is to prevent overlapping and the confusion which would arise therefrom. It may be convenient in case of State government offices, large commercial concerns, girls and other colleges, etc., to appoint an Agent from mihin such a unit . In this case the space for determination of the area (APPENDIX 1) in whicl^ an Agent should work, will, if such unit falls within the area, be used to insert ' excluding the X Y Z College ’ or other similar entry. The Agents are also directed to obtain Certificates from one Post Office exclu- • sively (that nearest to the area in which they work). In Convention States he would be directed to deal with the nearest Savings Bureau, and in Non-Convention States, with the Imperial Post Office, or Savings Bureau, nearest his area. The specimen 4 Certificate of Authority ’ has a counterfoil, to be completed by the Appointing Authority and sent to the appropriate Post Office or Savings Bureau in order that the Postal Officials may identify the Agent when he wishes tb purchase Savings Certificates. The specimen Certificate of Authority requires modification, if the Agent is to be directed to a Savings Bureau. For 44 to the Post master at j . .Post Office” the words “To the Postal Clerk at Savings Bureau ” would be substituted. (5-A) Authorized Agents—Classes from which Recruited. It will be for the State Authorities to decide from what classes Agents may be recruited. In British India they include— (c) The minor officials of Government excluding Police and Postal Employees ; (b) Public servants, such as Lambardars, Patels, Mukhias, Sarpanches* Municipal Employees, etc. (c) Non-Officials. The obvious qualifications necessary are :— (t) That they be persons of integrity and known to the authorities &gt; (w) Preferably owning some immovable property, or guaranteed by such an owner; ^ (tw) Of sufficient education to be able to complete the necessary forms, and receipt books legibly ; (u?) Otherwise approved by the State Authorities. (5-B) Authorized Agtnls—How Rermmerated. In the British India Scheme Agents are remunerated by Commission of Annas four for each Re. 10 certificate sold through them— 'pro rata for the higher denomina tions of Savings Certificates. ♦ This ccmmission they draw from Treasuries, after their Receipt Books have been checked [See para. 7 (it) E.J. In the case of the States it is proposed that the Government of India shall pay the commission in l um p sums to the State, in respect of the total value of Savings Certificates sold withm the State (either at * Imperial Post Office or Savings Bureaux) and that the State should make its own arrangements to pay ccmmission to the Agents as most convenient. [For duties of Auhtorized Agents see the specimen ‘ cover ’ of Receipt Book (APPENDIX II).] .05 (6) Issuing and Checking Officers. Tbe&amp;c are the officers authorized to hold stocks of Agents 5 Receipt Books [des cribed in para.. 7 (i) and (m)] for issue, and who check the same, when the counter foils are returned by the Agents. For their duties see specimen ‘ Cover ’ for a Receipt Book (APPENDIX II). It is for the State Authorities to decide which officers shall act in this capacity. They may be the same officials as the ‘ Appointing Authorities 5 if desired, but it is 4gtfssential they should reside at a distance not too great from the areas in which -he Agents have to work. ^ impossible for Agents to travel great distances to obtain fresh supplies of Receipt Books or to return counterfoils. In British India it is the Tehsil- dar, or Naib Tehsildar, who would normally be ‘ Issuing Officer \ This is convenient because a Post Office generally exists at such Headquarters, where the Agent can porchase Savings Certificates, and a Treasury or Sub-Treasury from which he can 4^iw his commission when he has sold a complete Book of Receipts. Where *- vmgs ureaux need to be opened in rural areas (in Convention or Non-Conven tion States), they should, therefore, normally be at the place of residence an sailing and Checking ” Officer. If it be decided that such officials should not be entrusted with the first appointment of “ Authorized Agents ” the Appointing Authority may be of higher status, and may require lower officials, supp y im with satisfactory information as to the qualifications of proposed Agents, before he issues a “ Certificate of Authority ”. Receipt Books for the use of Authorized Agents. A specimen Receipt Book is shown at Appendix II. ^T&gt;^ eSe ,. need to be printed under ‘ security ’ arrangements, to prevent use of Books fraudulently, ^.^., all such Books must be accounted for. (B) They are printed in the local languages. (C) The actual Receipt Forms in the Books are printed in coloured ink, similar to that used on the Savings Certificates to which they relate, e.g., D 3 ' 1? ' ‘ • • ^ row n- Rs. 500 .. .. Dark blue-green. ^ .. Blue. Rs. 1,000.. .. Green. Rs. 100 .. .. Reddish-purple. (D) The object of this is to prevent fraud in dealings with illiterate persons. Republic would be informed that for a subscription of Rs. 10, they should get a Mrown Receipt and subsequently a Brown Savings Certificate for Rs.' 10. Whether true method, or some other method devised by the authorities is used, is clearly a rSfr ^ S ^ at ? Authontie8 t0 d »cide, in the interests of the State’s subjects. (A) Each Book should bear a Book Serial Number which should appear on every ijage and every counterfoil. Every Receipt Form in b, book should have its Serial No. in the Bookie a iwpung from 1 to 50 in a Book of 50 Receipts. Scheme typeS ° f Book8 are P rovi ded for in the British India Small Savings («) Books &lt;&gt;t 50 receipts for Rs. 10 Savings Certificates. (n) Books of 20 receipts for Rs. 50 Savings Certificates.

This obviates the necessity of issuing separate instructions. The Post Office Form D.C. I (or N.C. I) referred to, is the ' Application Form ’ for purchase of National Savings Certificates. These can either be obtained from Post Offices (or Savings Bureaux Postal Clerks) or as in the British India Scheme, (B) First Page. —provides for the Authorized Agents’ receipt for the book the Issuing Authority. Counterfoil —provides for particulars of the Agent, in cftse of loss of the Book and a warning to unauthorized persons not to use the Book. (C) Receipt pages —provide for the temporary receipt to the investor, and at the foot of the page for the investor’s receipt for the Certificate, which will constitute the Agent’s quittance. On the reverse is a notice to the purchaser. Counterfoil Face —provides for necessary particulars of the investor. T. Reverse provides for the entries by the postal clerk, who issues the Certificate and for a duplicate receipt for Certificate from the purchaser. This remains in the Book and is ‘ checked ’ by the Checking Authority (see Last Page Counterfoil). The receipt given by the Investor at the foot of a Receipt Page, remains with the Agent as his personal quittance. (D) Last Page —provides for the Receipt to the Agent when he returns a book of completed counterfoils to the Issuing Authority. It also provides for the cases which will sometimes occur, when an Agent resigns and returns a book before all the forms have been completed. Last Page Counterfoil —provides for the check by the ‘ Checking Authority . (E) In the British India Scheme the Checking Authority sends the completed Book, after check to the Treasury—the Agent accompanies the messenger and draws his commission. The reverse of Counterfoil last page provides for his receipt for the commission. The Book then remains in the Treasury : (1) In support of the Treasury payment; (2) As a valuable record in case of— (а) loss of Certificates by investors, (б) as useful evidence should cases of fraud arise. (F) Treasury officers are required to send a monthly Schedule showing tota^ value of Certificates sold and the total commission paid (at annas 4 per Rs. 10) in respect thereof, and to certify that “ I have in my possession a formal quittance for each individual payment of commission included in this Schedule (G) A check of such receipts against Schedules can be made periodically by^ Treasury Inspecting Officers. The British India method above is quoted for the convenience of States, although since the commission would be paid in bulk to the State by the Government of Indu, it is for the State concerned to adopt this, or any other method preferred in respect of payment of commissoin and final disposal of the Receipt Books. (8) Staff .—In the British India Scheme one ‘ National Savings Circle Officer ’ is provided for each Posts and Telegraphs Circle. These officers will be directed to contact States situated within their circles and, if desired by the States, to advise on the working of the Scheme. Under the Circle Officers a certain number of Assistant Circle Officers are pro vided in the British India Scheme. In the States it is proposed to leave the matter of provision of special staff to the discretion of the State Authorities. (9) Advertising. —Advertising material in support of the Scheme will be provided free and the National Savings Commissioner will consult the States as to their require ments in this respect. M149NSC—2,000—15-11-43—GIPS arrangements will be made for supply of these to “ Issuing Authorities ”, so that they can conveniently be provided to Agents together with Receipt Books.n n APPENDIX ID.

Small Savings Scheme. 2. Government of India do not appear to appreciate position in Gulf, where despite tremendous increase in work and responsibility we have fewer Political Officers than at beginning of war. Repeated efforts to obtain adequate number have been met/reply that officers are not available owing to the shortage in the cadre or are more urgently required else where to fill new posts which the Government of India apparently consider more important. Situation in Bahrain is that Agency is very heavily over-worked, that office is most unpleasantly over-crowded, that the staff are inadequate and finally that the bulk of them are temporary Government servants over whom we have no hold whatever. Government of India have not hitherto been able even to accept proposal to establish the Assistant Political Agent on a permanent basis though post has been in existence for twelve years and it is inconceivable that it should ever be reduced. 3. It is clear from your second paragraph that in special circumstances of Bahrain a great deal of work will be involved much of which will inevitably fall upon the Agency. No comparison can be made between the position of Bahrain and an Indian State. In both India and Indian States the official language is English whereas in Bahrain the official language is Arabic, and unlike India clerks are hard to find and harder still to keep. Nor, I regret to say, can I recommend that the Adviser to the Bahrain Government should be saddled with these duties. Whereas in 1930 the State had three executive officers it has now, with vastly heavier burdens, but two. Further the financial administration of the Bahrain Government in itself appears to require more time than the Adviser is at present able to spare. 4. Unless and until the Government of India are able to staff the Gulf adequately with trained Political Officers and a sufficient number of permanant($n|±ft$d clerks together with sufficient accommodation for them ro Work in, I regret it is quite impossible for us to accept any fresh burdens of any kind whatsoever. y BRITAIN S. 44.
