Dear Baggallay, In your letter of the 22nd December (E 7371/985/34) on the subject of British claims against lereia, you suggest that we should propose to the lersian Government an arrange ment under which each Government would compensate its own nationals, and that we should then compensate the British claimants against that Government to the extent to which they could be shown to be valid. 2. This is an arrangement which is likely to be more acceptable to the Persian Government than to the Treasury. Even if you are prepared to admit - and the course you propose seems to us to imply such an admission - that P. Atychidee was wrongfully used by the Indian authorities before war broke out with Turkey'and/or that he received something less than justice from the Courts in India and from the Privy Council, the claim does not seem to us to be one that could be accepted as a genuinely Persian claim. It would surely be intolerable if a foreign Government could get British claims against it satisfied out of the British taxpayer’s pocket by raking up some claim of highly dubious nationality .- Li - 1 Lnationality against the British Government end then making an agreement that each Government should deal with the claims of its own nationals. The practical certainty which I think we all feel that this Graeco-Turkish claimant and his French associates would fail to recover a penny from the Persian Government shows how very inequitable to the British taxpayer the whole proceeding would be. 3. For these reasons it would be difficult to justify what you propose even if it could be shown that nothing but the Atychides claim lay between the British claimants and success. But do you really think that if the Atychides claim were non-existent or could somehow be eliminated the Persian Government would pay up? Is it not a reasonable assumption that they would oppose some other obstacle? For example, we note that the British claimants have failed to exhaust their legal remedies in Persia, and though we do not suggest that an appeal to the courts in that country would be anything but a waste of time and money, this fact alone gives the Persians an answer which they would probably not be slow to exploit. WhileWhile we ao not aiBeent from the view that the Atychides claim is an obstacle to the eueceeB of the British claimants against Persia&gt; we should not accept the view that if the Atychides claim did not exist the claims would probably be met; and the course you propose could only be supported on the latter hypothesis. 4. If we refrain from suggesting that your proposal should be made to the Government of India, we must repeat the caveat contained in paragraph 3 of our official letter of the 19th March last. 5. In short, your proposal seems to us to involve acceptance of the following propositions:- (1) that M. Atychides was wrongfully used by the Indian authorities before war broke out with Turkey and/oi that he received less than justice from the Courts in India and from the Privy Council; (2) that his claim is a genuinely Persian claim; (3) that if his claim did not exist, the Persians would pay up; and (4) that the Atychides claim lies against H.M. Government and not against the Government of India. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Gibson, at the India Office.

Notwithstanding the opinions expressed in your letter and the letters from the Admiralty and Treasury of the 15th February and 19th March respectively, Mr. Eden feels bound to adhere to his own opinion that the inability of His Majesty’s Government to submit the 'Atychides' claim to arbitration is likely to be an effective obstacle to any attempt to secure the submission of the British claims to arbitration and consequently to any useful action on behalf of the British claimants. 3. But he agrees for the reasons given in the Procurator—General’s letter No. T and M 20879 of the 21st December, 1936, (namely the undesirability of submitting a prize decision to arbitration) and in paragraph 5 of the Admiralty letter (namely that the interests of the State and the ordinary taxpayer should over-ride the interests of the individual claimants against the Persian Government) that His Majesty’s Government must make it clear at the outset, if The Under-Secretary of State, K —V India Office.if any kind of a claims commission is proposed in the future, either by His Majesty’s Government themselves or by the Persian Government, that the 'Atychides” claim cannot be submitted to the Commission, This will probably have to be done by insisting from the start that all claims on either side arising out of the Great War must be excluded from the scope of the commission. 4.

Please see Foreign Office letter of the 7th Lecember, 1936, at P.Z. 8772/36 (Flag A) in which certain questions are raised regarding the claims of British subjects and Corporations against the Iranian Government. 2. Some of the claims in question date from as much as 40 years ago, but a recent examination conducted on behalf of the Foreign Office has shown that a great many of them are either supported by insufficient evidence cr else reier to events for which the Iranian Government cannot be held liable according to international law. At an approximate estimate, it is thought that the face value of the claims for which the Iranian Government could reasonably be held to be liable amount to no more tiuin £.36 C, c C 0 . Of these tenable claims, the Government of India are interested to the extent of £5000 only. 3. It has been so far proved impossible, in spite of repeated representations through diplomatic channls, to induce the Iranian Government to examine or settle any of the outstanding claims on their own merits, and it vvould appear that the only hope of inducing them to do so now is to set up some kind of a Claims Commission or Arbitration Tribunal for the examination of Iranian claims agamst His Majesty's Government (or the Government of India) as well as British claims against the Iranian Government. The Foreign Office consider that it is not impossible that the Iranian Government would agree to such a Commission, provided no attempt was made to exclude from consideration ab initio their war claims against His Majesty's Government, and in particular one such claim known as the ' Atychides ' claim. 4. This claim relates to a steamship known as the Hamad an' / 5353 5000 3/37'Hamaden” or 'Kara Deniz' (the property of a naturalised Persian subject of Ottoman origin named Socrates Atychides) which was detained at Bombay prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914 on the ground that notwithstanding a projected transfer to the Persian flag it was really an Ottoman vessel. The ship was subsequently condemned as a prize by the High Court of Bombay, whose judgment was later confirmed by the Privy Council. The owner has ever since had a claim (which has been supported by the Iranian Government) against His Majesty’s Government on the ground that the ship was illegally detained at Bombay prior to the outbreak of the war with Turkey and was therefore wrongly condemned as a prize. While for present purposes it is unnecessary to discuss the legality or otherwise of the action taken in regard to the 'Kara Deniz', it is relevant to point out that subsequent examination has shown that the owner’s allegations may not be entirely without foundation, and His Majesty’s Procurator General has expressed the * opinion that if the claim were to be brought before any kind of arbitral tribunal His Majesty’s Government (or the Government ol India) might be placed in the position Jtc V. 2i(/i/u of having to pay damages to the extent of £900.000 . the figure at which Monsieur Atychides places his losses including losses of earnings. 5. It will be seen from the foregoing brief explanation that a difficult question of principle arises, viz. are His Majesty’s Government justified in depriving British claimants generally of their last and, in fact, only hope of repayment, however slender that may be, because of the existence of an Iranian counter-claim which in no way concerns the claimants in question, and which might be found by an Impartial Commission, notwithstanding the decisions of the Prize Courts^viidifct /• have considerable justification. It is on this pointWi n I Minute Paper. Department. 5853 5000 3 / 3 ; 3. that the Foreign Office have sought the observations of interested Departments, including this Office. The views of the Admiralty are given in the letter of the 15th February at P.Z. 1095/37 (Flag C) and of the Treasury in the letter of the 19th March at P.Z.1870/37 (Flag D) . Those of the Government of India are given in detail in the Air Mail letter of the 11th May at F.Z. 3387/37 (Flag S). The principal, if not the only, argument in favour of arbitration is that no other line of action seems likely to secure satisfaction of the claims of British subjects from the Iranian Government, and that His Majesty's Government are therefore under a moral obligation to agree to submit the ''Atychides' claim to an Impartial Commission. This argument is dealt with in the Admiralty and Treasury letters referred to above, and it is submitted that we can agree with the Government of India in endorsing the views expressed therein as to the moral aspect. /.e can similarly, it is suggested, have no hesitation in agreeing with the views expressed by the Procurator General, the Admiralty and the Treasury, that it would be most objectionable to submit to review by an International Court or Tribunal a case which has been decided by the Prize Courts of Great Britain. The Government of India have perhaps the strongest grounds for- opposing arbitration since the Treasury have made it clear that they would expect any deja^r* arising therefrom to be paid by India.

N ' Vv^ Sir^ I am directed to acknowledge Mr, Clauson f s letter P.Z.9088/36 of the 28th December 1936 asking for the observa tions of the Government of India upon the Foreign Office letter dated the 7th December 1936, in which certain questions are raised regarding the claims of British subjects and corporations against the Iranian Government, 2, The proposal put forward by the Foreign Office appears to be that, in order to induce the Iranian Government to agree to set up an impartial Commission to investigate the claims of British subjects against that Government. His Majesty’s Government should on their part agree to allow the Atychides' claim to come before the same Commission and oppose the claim on its merits. The principal if not the only argument put forward in favour of this course is that no other line of action seems likely to secure satisfaction of the claims of British subjects from the Iranian Government and that His Majesty’s Government are therefore under a moral obligation to agree to submit the 'Atychides' claim to an impartial .•. / jimpartial Commission. This argument has in the opinion of the Government of India been effectively traversed in the marginally noted letters containing the views of the Lord Commissioners of the Admiralty and the Treasury respectively and it is perhaps sufficient to say that the Government of India entirely agree with the views there expressed as to the moral aspect. 2* It remains to state the practical arguments which may be urged both from the general point of view and from the particular point of view of the Government of India against the course proposed: (1) It has been agreed by the Procurator-General, the Admiralty and the Treasury that it would be most objectionable to submit to review by an International Court or Tribunal a case, which has been decided by the Prize Courts of Great Britain. The Government of India agree with this view and also with the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty in thinking that it would be impossible to restrict the issues within the narrow limits suggested by the Foreign Office in paragraph 11 (&lt;i) of their letter of 7th December, if the case is referred to any kind of international tribunal or impartial commission; (2) The Procurator-General has expressed the opinion that, if the 'Kara Deniz' case is referred to an International Court, a judgrent generally adverse to His Majesty's Government is probable. As the Foreign Office point out in paragraph 8 of their letter quoted above such a decision, even if the issue before the Tribunal were restricted, might result in His Majesty's Government being called upon to pay damages to any 7rom~23miralty to the Foreign Office No.M05590/36, dated the 15tK February 1937. J From His Majesty's Treasury to the Foreign Office No.S.34672/01, dated the 19th March 1937. amount • • •I amount up to £.900^00 /- and the Treasury have made it clear that they would expect these damages to be paid by the Government of India - a claim which this Government would strongly resist; (3) Mr. Atychides' claim has been generally regarded by the authorities, who have examined it, to be in essence speculative and founded upon misrepresentation of the facts. If therefore the Procurator-General's opinion as to the probable outcome of a reference to an international tribunal is accepted as correct, His Majesty's Government, or the Government of India, would by allowing the claim to go to arbitration be running a very grave risk of having to pay a very large sum on an unsound claim. In return for this risk the Government of India could expect no financial or other advantage for themselves or for British Indian subjects for the following reasons. Of the British claims referred to in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter of the 7th December 1936, a list of which is given in Appendix 3 to Mr. Ritchie's general review, the Government of India appear to be interested only in claims Nos.75, 89 and 96. Of these neither f 75 nor 89 appear likely to succeed for want of evidence and No.96 has formed the subject of recent correspondence between His Majesty's Minister and the Government of India, which shows that the Iranian Government have accepted liability for j! this claim in principle and are prepared to discharge it as soon as budget provision can be made. A reference of this item to a Claims Commission is therefore superfluous. The only other claims which the Government of India could put forward on behalf of themselves and their subjects would appear to be wartime claims, for which the Iranian Government would disclaim all responsibility or which they would meet by bringirg forward far larger claims against His Majesty's Government and the Government of India apart from the 'Kara Deniz' claim*4* I am therefore to say that after giving the most careful consideration to the position as set forth above the Government of India wish to protest most emphatically against any attempt to induce the Iranian Government to agree to accept a Claims Commission by offering to allow the Atychides claim to come before that Commission* They trust that they will receive the full support of the Secretary of State in resisting such a proposal.

They appreciate that the unwillingness of Hi* Kajeaty's Qovernaent to arbitrate upon the Atyohloes claim lervea the* without means of inducing the Persian aoTeinment to arbitrate on the British claims, nut e^uallj if the Atyohides claim did not exist at all, the means to induce the rereian Oovernment to arbitrate u on the Brit 1 st claims would apparently be lacking. The possibility that if iiis Majesty’s Government were to agree to arbitrate upon the ..tychldes claim, some satisfaction might be obtained for British claims against the Persian Govern ,eat, does n ,t ap ear to Their boruahlpe to provide sufficient Justification for treating the Atyohidea claim more favourably than the facts of that claim would otherwise warrant. 3e am to ado that this expression of opinion should mt De regarded as implying acceptance of the view that the Atychides claim lies against His Majesty's Government rather than against the Government of India. 4,4 Copies of this letter have been seat to the ladia Office, the Admiralty and Hie Majesty's procurator General. X am. Sir, Your obedient Oexnrant, R.V.N 1 ND HQPK 1 NW«4.06690/S6. 5 1 1 1 ^ 1937 | [uiILHuhumr 7 ADkI : , S.tV.I. 15th February, 1937. Dear Rendel, We are to-day sending an official letter to you in reply to your letter No.£.37^6/3725/34 of the ?th December, regarding the claims of British subjects against Germany end the Persian counter-claim on behalf of Mr. Atychides, but there are one or two additional points which we would like to put in a semi-official letter. •’he Admiralty, of course, feel very strongly that on principle it is roost undesirable that any Prize Court judgment should become subject to review by an International Court or Tribunal, but we think, also, though this is perhaps more a Treasury matter, that there is a further objection to allowing any such cases which occurred during the Great ar to be re-opened in this way, because of the re-action on the many other claims from neutrals which we refused to consider. in particular, I oelieve that we came to an agreement with the United States under which that Government undertook to deal itself with any claims by its own nationals. This agreement was not altogether popular in the United States, end if such a case as the present one comes before an International Court, it is bound to cause some embarrassment to the United States Government, and give rise to a feeling of irritation on their pert. There may be other agreements of this kind, but j am not sure about this. But the point \*e particularly wanted to mention was that it seemed to us that the matter has hitherto been looked at entirely from the one point of view, namely, whether the action taken can be defended under International Law, and not from the other angle of whether the Persian Mendel i-sq. , C.M.G foreign offics,, S. I.I. Government/Government can make out a good Cf se for sa,ying that one of their nationals has a reason? ole claim for compensation* The effect has been to oring into undue prominence the weakneBses of our own case. If the matter is looked at in the other way, the first point that arises is that of Mr. Atychidee* bona fides as a Persian subject* If he war really a Turkish subject, his claim appears to be entirely ruled out by the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne. hat we have on this point is largely his own story, given before the Bombay Prize Court in 1914-15. He is an Orthodox Greek, born in Constantinople, has always resided end carried on business there, and has owned ships in partnership with Turks i nd Germans* He was formerly a Turkish subject, but became a Persian subject By years of before the date/giving evidence, but he had never been in Persia and did not know the language, lie was naturalised by permission of the Turkish Govern ent, to free his children from serving in the Turkish Army* He went to Piraeus on the 21st October 1914, and was apparently there when war with Turkey was declared* His wife and family arrived there on the 13th or 14th November* lie did not intend to go back to Constantinople so long as the present Government was in power, but in cross examination he admitted that all his property was there, and that he would go back as soon as the Dardanelles was opened in order to look after his business. Despite his release from Turkish nationality, he had been permitted to remain and carry on his shipping business at Constantinople on condition of bein* treatedrnamam dP ee a Turkish subject 9 and his vessels were, both before and after the outbreak of war, engaged in the transport of troops for the Turkish Government# In 1917 he was arrested in Bombay and put into prison (for what reason is not stated, but possibly es an undesirable alien), end interned at bankure. in 1919, his case came again before the Bombay Frize Court, but it is not clear whether Mr# Atyohides appeared before the Court in person, though there is some indication that he did# he appealed to the Privy Council, and judgment disfaissin* the appeal was delivered on the 5th .July 192S2# he petitioned the Xing in 1923, and apparently, sent copies of the petition to all Members of Parliament# The case is stated to have been taken up on various occasions by the Persian Minister in London. A reply was given to the latter in 1928, but it is not clear when the first enquiry was made# Mr# Atychidee again petitioned H.M# The Xing in 1931, when he was living in laris. He here mentioned that ho had an English wife and two children horn in London, but gives no particulars of his residence in this country. except that, despite the efforts of the authorities to prevent him, he left Constantinople without permission to come to London for his appeal. I n 1933, when still resident in x anb, ha aaaad fox an ir.tei’Vxe* with the British Amoa»sador, out it was thought undesirable to allow this, and it was pointed out that some time ago he addressed a petition to the win*, in somewhat threatening terns, when it was considered advisable to issue instructions that he should not oe given a visa for this country without special authority. In/In the eanie year, H.M.Minister at Tehran reported that he had come to Tehran (apparently his first visit to Persia) at the expense of a French finanoial group, who wurt to take 7Q per cent, of the profits of the claim, out ol which they would provide the Persian Government free with eight freight steamers, to he used in developing the *rede of Persia through the port of bander bhahpur. Where he is now is not stated. The wiiole affair is very suspicious, and Ml*« Atychides is clearly a person whose evidence no Cpurt should accept without corroboration. Apparently, under Article 5 ol the Ottoman Nationality Law of 1869, change ol nationality requires some form of authorisation, and there is only his own word that he got this. 1911 (the year in which his change of nationality is said to have taken place) was the year of the Turko-Italian war, and it seems unlikely that the Turks *ouid have allowed him to change his nationality for the reasons stated, though no doubt he may have greased the wheels liberally# The nationality laws are admittedly rather anomolous, and the Persians may have been within their legal rights in naturalising him. If such a long time had not elapsed, one would suggest that careful enquiries should be made about his antecedents, and even as it is, ittnight be worth seeing whether any light can be thrown upon the question of his nationality. io far as the Prise Courts were concerned, the nationality of the ship was conclusive, and they did not, therefore, examine closely the question of Mr. Atychides* nationality But even assuming that the Persians naturalised him, could we not, seeing that there is no legal obligation on us to grant him compensation, ignore the strictly legal/legfil pgpect oi the fitter, and look at it from the commonsense point of view that he was only in name a Persian subject and remained in reality a Turkish subject and should be treated as such? our view is* as stated in our official letter. that there are ouch strong reasons of public policy in this case that it is iiapossible to agree to take it to arbitration, even if it means sacrificing the interests of British claimants against the Persian Government. If, however, it is felt that some other alternative must be found, and that it is not possible ti take the line that he must be regarded as a Turkish *nd not a Persian subject, tjid therefore, debarred from makii a claim, X can only suggest that some arrangement could be tried under which each Government agrees itself to settle the claims of its own Nationals. It would be interesting to see what the I ersian Government would consider adequate compensation to tA r. Atychidee under such an arrangement. As a very last resort, I suppose it would be possible to compound with him (this is presumably what Brown means in the last paragraph but one of his letter), f nu we might very possibly, seeing the weaknesses of our position, get off more lightly this way than if the case were taken to arbitration. The French Syndicate would no doubt have to whistle for their money, end the Persian Government for the freight ships, but that need not unduly worry us. All t^iese are matters, however, which do not directly affect the Admiralty, as the ship, being condemned as b droit of Admiralty, the proceeds would go to the fixechequer, and it rests with alt er the Treasury or the(*N.) 8 . », f mmam Government of India to aay whetner they would agree to pay compensation in any circumstances. I notice that in 1933 mention was made of the possibility of Persia bringing the case before the Council of the League of Nations, though I assume that, as she has made no move in this direction, such action is now very unlikely. The prestige of the League is not now so high as it was, but surely the members of the Council would not so far debase it as to agree to matters of this sort being considered. It requires some stretch of the imagination to suppose that Mr. Atychidea* case can disturb International peace or tne good understanding between nations upon which peace depends (Article 11 of the Covenant) or that the dispute is one which is likely to lead to a rupture (Articles 12 and 15/• I am sending a copy of this letter to Hale at the Treasury and to Turnbull at the India Office.

In the first place there is no necessary connection between the claims which British subjects have against the Persian Government and the claim which a nominally naturalised Persian subject has apparently persuaded the &gt; ersian Government to take up. It is material to ooserve that Monsieur Atychides has been afforded a legal remedy as against the British Crown in respect of ell his complaints arising out of the KARA j whereas, so far as Their Lordships are aware, no corresponding opportunities have been afforded to t British claimants against the Persian Goverzuaent. 6 . Moreover, Their Lordships dealre to point out that we should only be sacrificing the interests of individual claimants to the interests of the general taxpayer if it were decided not to pursue the claims of the individuals in order to avoid a costly claim against the crown, in this case Their Lordships feel that there are strong reaeons of public policy which make it impossible to agrerf to ar i ration upon this claim against the Crown. If the result is that the Persian Government for their part will not agree to arbitration upon the claims of British subjects, the position seems to be that His Majesty's Government are prevented from following a course which might benefit individual British Nationals by oo neiderationa/mmmmmm. consideration® of the gencrel well-being of the State. 6 , Their Lordships are therefore of the opinion that any proposal to suuailt the case of the KARA DKN1Z, or any aspects thereof f to International arbitration should be resisted, and that the claims of British nationals against the Persian QoTemment should be regarded as an entirely separate question. 7 * Copies of this letter are being sent to India Office, h.M* Treasury and His majesty’s procurator General. 1 am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,August 88th.

Mr. Eden is av/are that it might be more convenient for Lord Zetland to furnish such observations if the views of His Majesty’s Procurator-General upon the two points on which his advice is sought in paragraph 11 of the letter were first available, but for the reasons given in paragraph 12 he is anxious that a decision as to the future policy of His Majesty’s Government towards this question shall be reached as soon as possible. He therefore hopes that Lord Zetland will at least be able to give the question his preliminary consideration. 3. A similar letter is being addressed to the Treasury and Admiralty and a copy is being sent to His Majesty’s Procurator-General. I am, Sir, ur obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office.E 3725/3725/34 FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. 7th December, 1936. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to inform you that he would be glad of your advice in regard to certain difficulties which stand in the way of any serious attempt lo secure a settlement of the outstanding claims of British subjects and corporations against the Persian Government. The claims in question, some of which date from as much as forty years ago, were recently the subject of a detailed examination by Mr* Hugh Ritchie, a retired official of the Foreign Office with much experience in th.is hind of wor e, who in addition to preparing a brief history of each individual claim, also wrote a memorandum or general review analysing the different categories of claims and the principles which might be held to govern the degree of support which His Majesty’s Government couia properly accord them* A copy of this memorandum (Confidential 11683) is enclosed for your convenience, bul a perusal of its contents is not essential to an understanding of the questions discussed below. 3 . / His Majesty’s Procurator-General.* ■ &lt;*■ I3 . An examination of the information collected 'by *vir. Ritchie has shown that a great many of the claims which have 'been presented to the Persian G-overnment in the past are either supported by insufficient evidence to warrant the expectation that they could be successfully sustained before an impartial tribunal or else relate to events for which the Pei oicm Government cannot be held to be liable according to the accepted principles of international lav/ and practice. This examination is not yet complete, but at an approximate estimate it may be said that the face value of the claims lor which, taking all the circumstances into account, the Persian Government - or any other Government - could reasonably oe held to be liable, for v/hich adequate evidence is available or is likely to be forthcoming if required, and for v/hich at least an even chance of success can reasonably be anticipated before an impartial tribunal amounts to no more than about £500,000. of these tenable claims the most important are those of the Persian Railway Syndicate (for expenses incurred in making surveys for the Persian Government ‘ . -r £^00,000), the Persian Transport Company (for losses arising from the aroitrary cancellation of a concession for the building o± a road ~ £50,000) and the Government of India (for sums owing on account of the salaries of officers lent to the Persian Government for quarantine service in the Persian Gulf - about £5,000, this being strictly speaking, however, a debt rather than a claim).■HHB—W— 4. It has so far proved impossible, in spite of repeated representations tlirough the diplomatic channel, to induce the Persian Government to examine or settle any of these claims on their own merits, and it can safely be said that the only hope of ever inducing them to do so now is to set up some kind of a claims commission or arbitral tribunal for the examination of Persian claims against His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India as well as British claims against the Persian Government. In the course of certain negotiations, which lasted from 1923 to 1934, for a general Treaty with the Persian Government to cover a variety of outstanding Anglo-Persian issues, it was contemplated that arrangements should be made to set up a claims commission; and it is not impossible that the Persian Government would agree without much difficulty to such a commission to-day, even in the absence of a general treaty, provided no attempt was made to exclude from consideration ab initi o their war claims against His Majesty’s Government \ and in particular one such claim known as the Atychides claim. 5. This claim relates to a steamship known as the ’’Hamadan” or 'Kara Dcniz”, the property of a naturalised Persian subject, of Ottoman origin, named Socrates Atychidcs. This vessel was detained at Bombay, prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey in 1914, on the ground that, notwithstanding a purported transfer to the Persian flag, it was really an Ottoman vessel. The ship was subsequently condemned /condemned as a prize by the High Court of Bombay. This case has formed the subject of examination in your office in the past, in 1913, when an opinion dated 21st December, 1913 was written by Dr. Pearce Higgins, and also in 1932 and 1933, when the merits of the claim were discussed among various Government departments, in connexion with the expressed intention of the Persian Government to bring the claim before the League of Nations raid in connexion with a request from M* Atychides for an interview with His Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris (see your letter of 2nd May, 1933). A copy of Dr. Pearce Higgins’ opinion is enclosed for convenience of reference, together with a memorandum of 21st September, 1934 by Mr. Ritchie, and a diary ( prepared in this department) of the events, as far as at present known, which led up to the vessel’s condemnation as a prize in 1914. To this diary is attached as an annex a list of six points in regard to which the course of events is somewhat obscure and about which the India Office have recently been asked semi officially to endeavour to obtain further information. It will be seen from these documents that two principal points arise: (a) whether the Bombay authorities were justified in detaining the vessel prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey and (b) whether the vessel was thereafter rightly condemned as a prize. 6. With regard to (a) the following opinion was expressed by your office in 1933 (see Admiralty letter M. 659/33 of 25th February, 193:5, of which a copy was sent to your department by the Foreign Office): ’’The /'The Bombay Government do not suggest any peculiar provision of the local municipal law justifying the action of their port officer. The general position in international lav; appears, to be fairly plain. A ship sailing the High Seas and visiting foreign territorial waters must possess a nationality, and her nationality is that of the flag she properly carries. The conditions on which States admit ships to their Register are not the concern of international law. It suffices that - for whatever reasons ~ a State accepts the authority and responsibility which result from the ohip s nationality. The ship T s right to carry her flag should be vouched by some public official document on board her. :, In this case, therefore, the port officer was justified in detaining the n Kura Deniz ,f until satisfied of her right to carry the Persian flag, but I do not thinl: he was acting correctly in saying that he would not recognise the alleged change of nationality from Turkish to Persian until che ship s register had been produced. I think ho should have been satisfied as to her nationality &gt;..’0 soon as tne Turkish Consul-General’s statement had been confirmed by the statement of the Persian Consul and a certificate of Persian nationality had been issued by the latter official'.On tho strength of this and similar expressions of opinion, the legal advisers of this department have long inclined to the opinion that if the claim v/ore to be submitted to an impartial tribunal, tho tribunal would probably decide that so far as the administrative actions of the Bombay • authorities were concerned the vessel had been improperly or at any rate unreasonably detained. Against this, however, may be set the fact that M. Atychides, or alternatively his agent or the master of the vessel, might have applied to the High Court under Section 45 of the Indian Specific Relief Act of 1877 for a declaration that the detention of the vessel was illegal, and that he failed to do so. 7. With regard to (b) the question is fully discussed in the Judgments of 11th March, 1915 and 9th June, 1919 of the Prize Division of the High Court at Bombay, and in the Judgment delivered by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council on 5th July, 1928. But Mr. Eden is impressed by the difficulty which arises from the fact that at the time when the vessel was seized His Majesty’s Government had voluntarily accepted and were applying the provisions of Articles 55 and 57 of the Declaration of London, and that under Article 55 it is at the least extremely doubtful whether the vessel could have been condemned* It is true that the time when the case was heard in Bombay His Majesty’s Government had ceased to apply these provisions, but it is at any rate a possibility that an international tribunal would hold that the validity of the capture must be determined according to • the lav/ which was in force at the time when the capture to oh place./JM place. Moreover, apart from this point, the principle under which the vessel was ultimately condemned was a principle of prize lav/ only as understood in this country and the United States, and at variance with the continental rule. Unless it were expressly provided that the case was to be determined according to Anglo-Saxon prize law it is at any rate possible ? that the tribunal would apply the continental rule. 8 * Tt is therefore apparent that if this claim were to be brought before any kind of arbitral tribunal, His Majesty’s Government might, as the result of this one case alone and leaving aside the remaining Persian claims, about which little, if anything, is known, except that they exist, be placed in the position of having to pay damages to the extent of anything up to £900,000, the figure at which M. Atychides places his losses, including losses of earningsj and it is unlikely that the damages v/ould be reduced even if His Majesty’s Government were to decline on principle to submit the Prize decision to arbitration and were to restrict the issue before the tribunal to that of the detention of the vessel at Bombay prior to the outbreak of war. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government can obviously not agree to the submission of this claim to arbitration without ^ the most serious consideration. . 9. During the treaty negotiations referred to in paragraph 4 above, His Majesty’s Government hoped to be able i lo becure ohe exclusion of the Atychidcs claim from the scope j of any Anglo-Persian claims commission by proposing, when the time came for a detailed discussion of the categories of I claims/10. / claims of which the commission should take cognisance, that all claims arising out of events which took place during the world war should be excluded. But it must be admitted that there was never much prospect that these tactics would have succeeded. If in the course of the treaty negotiations the stage had been reached of discussing the scope of the commission with the Persian Government, the Persian Government might well have been willing to exclude war claims in general, since they have always maintained that they are in no way responsible for events occurring during the occupation of the country by foreign troops. But had they done so they would certainly have wished to define the term ''war claims' in such a way as to ensure that the Atychides claim was not thus excluded, and any attempt by His Majesty’s Government to insist on its exclusion on this or any other ground would merely have ended in the abandonment of the whole idea of a claims commission. There is no reason to anticipate that they would take a different line to-day and Mr. Uden sees no prospect of inducing them to accept a claims commission unless His Majesty’s Government are prepared to allow the Atychides claim to come before the commission or tribunal and to oppose it on its merits. In the absence of a clear understanding that His Majesty’s Government are prepared to take this line it seems preferable to avoid even suggesting a general claims commission, since the negotiations for its establishment could otherwise only end in failure.■I 10, it will be seen from the foregoing explanations that a difficult question of principle arises. Are His Majesty’s Government justified in depriving British claimant generally of their last, and in fact their only, hope of repayment, however slender that may be, because of the existence of a Persian counter-claim against His Majesty’s Government (or at any rate against the Government of India) which in no way concerns the claimants in question and which might be found by an impartial commission, notwithstanding the decisions of the prize Courts, to have considerable justification? 1 • l-* 1 vie ■/ of this difficulty it would be of great assistance to Mr* Eden in considering the question further if he might be informed of your opinion as to : (1) whether the objections of principle to submitting prize court .judgments to review by any kind of international court or tribunal must be held to apply without qualification to the present case, notwithstanding any si^ecial circumstances connected therewith. (2) If so, whether the same objections would apsly to the review by some international court or tribunal, not of the prize court judgments as such, i.e. the condemnation of the 'Kara Deniz' as a prize on the ground that she was an enemy vessel seized in Indian waters on the outbreak of war, but of the decision, which is expressed or inherent in /\ A (^) in the judgments, that the detention of the vessel at Bombay during the weeks preceding the outbreak of war was either justified, or irrelevant to the issue before the court. (3) If His Majesty’s Government were to agree to submit the case to some international court or tribunal, whether a judgment adverse to His Majesty’s Government would be likely to be given. 12. I am to add that, although the question of British claims against the Persian Government is one of many years 1 standing and is in a sense not urgent, yet nevertheless, owing to the fact that, since the suspension of the negotiations for a General Treaty setting up inter alia a claims commission, it has become increasingly difficult to meet the enquiries of those claimants who ask what steps are being taken by His Majesty’s Government on their behalf, Mr. Eden would be grateful if he might receive your observations on this letter at as early a date as you can conveniently furnish them. 13.

THE dossiers relating to British claims against the Persian Government which were transmitted to the Foreign Office by Sir Reginald Hoare in 1933 (see his despatches No. 69 of the 18th February, 1933, and No. 162 of the 7th April, 1933) have now Teen examined by Mr. Hugh Ritchie, C.M.G. 2. Ihe results of this examination are embodied in four volumes, entitled respectively :— (1) Persia Claims (General Review). (2) Persia (Legation Claims). (3) Persia : Consulate Claims (Peace Time). (4) Persia : Consulate Claims (War Time). No. (1) consists of the “ General Review,” which is a summary of the historical aspects of the question, and copies of Sir R. Hoare’s despatches Nos. 69 and 162 of 1933, while Nos. (2), (3) and (4) consist of memoranda on the individual claims, preceded in each case by an index and a brief introduction. 3. The ‘ ‘ General Review ’ ’ and the three volumes of memoranda have been prepared by Mr. Ritchie in single copies only. I do not propose to have further copies of the memoranda made at present, but I have caused the “ General Review ” to be printed and now enclose six copies for retention in His Majesty’s Legation. Ihe index and introduction to each of the three supplementarv volumes have also been printed as appendices to the “General Review.” A further appendix is a list showing in tabular form the sums involved in the various classes of claims, as quoted by Mr. Ritchie in the relevant paragraphs of his “ General Review.” The object of printing each index is to render exactly apparent the form in which the information regarding these claims is available in the Foreign Office and thus to facilitate the submission of any requests for further information respecting particular claims which you or your successors may wish to make in future years. 4. I am now considering what steps can be taken in the hope of eventually securing a settlement of such of the claims as it is possible for His Majesty’s Government to support and I shall address you upon this question in a later despatch.

Hoare enclosed (Appendix i.) comprehensive lists of all our claims preferred in the past against the Persian authorities and still outstanding, so far as these could be traced in the Legation and in our consulates in the outlying districts of Persia. In a further despatch. No. 162 of the 7th April, 1933, he enclosed a short supplementary list, mainly relating to losses incurred by the staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia during the war. These lists had been in course of preparation for some ten years, and they were accompanied by files of the Legation correspondence, so far as this could be furnished, and by statements and documents supplied by the fourteen consulates, so far as their existing archives, which had suffered depletion during the war, permitted. 2. In his despatch No. 69, Sir R. Hoare disposed these claims in five groups :— (A) The Legation Claims, i.e., a main body of claims dealt with at Tehran— set out in a schedule. (B) The Consulate Claims, i.e., those returned by the various consulates, under instructions sent by the Legation in 1924—set out in separate lists. (C) Denials of Justice, i.e., those in which proceedings in the local courts in the past had failed to procure justice—set out in Annex III to the despatch. (D) Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for the looting of their branches during the war—summarised in Annex IV. (E) Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia for their private losses, mainly during the war—set out in the supplementary list. 3. The distinction between (A) the Legation claims and (B) the consulate claims results from the procedure followed in Persia (in all but a few instances) that a claimant lodged his claim with the British consul in whose district it arose. In his annual report for 1911, Sir G. Barclay, our former Minister (referring to highway robberies), said the practice was that, as soon as a claim was presented to His Majesty’s consular officer (in the district concerned), it was notified by him to the (Persian) Foreign Office Agent and the Governor, and every effort was made to induce the local authorities to take immediate steps for the recapture and restitution of the stolen property; when no further prospect of settlement in this direction appeared, the more important cases were referred to His Majesty’s Legation; a statement was then submitted to the Persian Government, who were warned that, failing a settlement locally, the value of the losses would be claimed from the Central Government. The annual reports of the time show that a tabular statement of British claims filed at the Legation was forwarded annually towards the close of the year to the Persian Govern ment, setting out the amounts claimed in respect of Tehran and each of the other British consulates; in 1913, e.g., the amount thus claimed was £119,022. This practice was maintained until 1918, after which it was dropped. It follows that, while we may expect from our Legation evidence as regards claims lodged at Tehran, we are mainly dependent on returns furnished by our consulates else where as regards claims originally lodged with them. 4. The claims comprised in the five groups range from 1892 to 1930— nearly forty years; a period that saw many changes in Persia, and a develop ment from semi-barbarous conditions under which but a loose control was exercised over the component tribes, to the somewhat more stable conditions of the present day. Originally, the Government was an absolute monarchy, resembling in temporal matters that of the former Ottoman Empire, the country being divided into satrapies or provinces, with Governors who were appointed by, and responsible to, the Crown; in 1906 a Constitution was granted by the * The original of this memorandum is bound together with Appendices 1 and 2 below in a volume entitled Persia Claims (General Review) (Persia 36). [115411 b 24 Shah, which was confirmed by his successors; recently foreign capitulatory rights have lapsed. During the greater part of this period the local conditions appear to have afforded but a scanty security to life and property; brigandage was rife; disturbances among the tribes owing allegiance to the Shah often led to more serious outrages. From these causes the great majority of our claims arose; others originated during the war from incidents fostered by the intrigues of enemy agents and the irruption of enemy troops; others, again, from the non- w fulfilment by the Persian Government of certain alleged contractual obligations. In the following paragraphs the claims are dealt with under the headings ( (A), (B), (C), (D), (E)) assigned to them in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch; later they are examined in the light of general questions to which they give rise; and later still in the light of the attitude of the Persian Government towards them. II. (A)— The Legation Claims. 5. The main schedule of the Legation claims sets out a list of ninety-seven claims (really ninety-eight), with short details about each. Some of them are marked as settled. Files of original correspondence about many of them are sent. This correspondence is at best incomplete; in many instances it is wholly wanting, either because it cannot now be traced, or is in old archives sent to this Office, or relates to matters already within the knowledge of this Department. It has been necessary therefore to reconstruct from available sources the outstanding Legation claims to see how they stand, and this has been done in a series of memoranda, which, with an index, are bound consecutively in a separate volume entitled Legation Claims, detailing each, tabulating the facts and analysing as far as possible the issues involved. Claims which arose during the war period (taken to be from the 4th August, 1914, to the 22nd February, 1921) are headed in each case “ War.” 6. This investigation eliminates a few of the Legation claims as having no good foundation. The others, with the values claimed, may be classified as follows :— (1) Highway robberies and outrages. Peace-time : 281,430 -23 krans, £971 2s. Id., and 450 rupees. War-time: 775,535-65 krans, £47,024 7s. 5d. Total: 1,056,965 -88 krans, £47,995 10s. Qd., and 450 rupees. (2) Outrages on British officials and others. War-time: 680,931-22 krans and £38,640. (3) Losses on evacuations of Persian towns. War-time: 967,406-95 krans and £563 13s. §d. (4) Losses in Meshed riots (1905). Messrs. Richards : 6,962 -40 dollars, with 12 per cent, compound interest. (5) Losses in revolution (1909). T. Casey and Mrs. Rizzo : £1,200 and 1,000 krans. (6) S.S. Shushan. Loss on working from 1902 to 1913. Messrs. Lynch or Persian Transport Company : 2,302,905 -7 krans. (7) S.S. Shushan. Attacks on. 1902 and 1904. Messrs. Lynch : 10,663 krans. (8) Kasr-i-Dokhtar Toll-house. Demolition of and loss of tolls. 1906-10. Persian Transport Company: 68,751-35 krans. (9) Sir W. Haig. Breach of undertaking to employ in Persian Service 1919 : £4.807. (10) Mesopotamia Persia Corporation. War-time losses on wheat bought for Messrs. Lynch : 66,382-50 krans. (11) Rev. E. O. Eshoo. W^ar-time depredations in Urumia : 275,594 krans. (12) Persian Transport Company. Cancellation of concessions, 1921 : £50,000 (formerly £75.900 18s. Qd.). (13) Persian Railway Syndicate. Cost of surveys, 1913-4, 1920-21 : £202,207, with 7 per cent, compound interest. (14) British Quarantine Medical Officers in Persian Gulf. Arrears of salaries, 1923-24 : 69,967-10 rupees; and 16,814-60 krans. (Besides the above. Richards’s (Reichardt’s) Forestry Concession, for which he claimed £15,000, is included in the Legation schedule, but this claim, which is outlined on pp. 235 to 240 of the volume Legation Claims, was abandoned by us in 1932.)7. In Annex V the Legation assess the total value of the Legation or Tehran claims at 4,746,364 krans, £483,458, 70,417 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars. The investigation made here, as shown above, makes the total 5,447,415-20 krans, £345,413 35. §d., 70,417-10 rupees, and 6.962 -40 dollars. Some of this difference may be accounted for by the fact that many claimants claim in krans, with a sterling equivalent; some by the inclusion or non-inclusion of interest; and some by the elimination of a few claims that are unsound. In either case the amount is large, but the figures are necessarily provisional. In some instances interest at a high rate is claimed; in others at a less rate; in others not at all. Precise documentary evidence of the losses alleged to have been sustained is not furnished, except in certain cases of outrages during the war and in the claim of Mr. T. Casey. One claim (No. 13 in the Legation schedule) for extensive high way robberies in 1910 is not valued, the claimants, it is said, not having yet formulated their claims, which may yet be presented by underwriters; while in another (No. 31 in the Legation schedule), the Legation surmise that part may have been paid out of Bushire surplus customs revenues during the British occupation of that port. 8. Of the claims, as classified in paragraph 6 above— (1) Highway robberies are dealt with more fully hereafter in paragraphs 45-50. (2) and (3) War claims in paragraphs 51-56. (4) Investigation shows to be somewhat weak on principles underlying international law. (5) There is no precise evidence of Mrs. Rizzo’s losses. (6) The largest is more than doubtful, and has been characterised here in the past as somewhat absurd. (7) While committed on Persian territory, depends to an extent whether Turks or Persians committed the outrage. (8) There seems ground for thinking this claim was extinguished in 1913-14. (9) Sir W. Haig afterwards offered to take £2,500. (10) and (11) These are obscure cases in which there is no sufficient evidence furnished to show Persian liability. (12), (13) and (14) These are more important claims concerning which there is correspondence here. 9. It will be seen, therefore, that the Legation claims, as detailed at length in the separate volume Legation Claims, are in some instances open to question, and are in most cases unaccompanied by any precise documentary evidence of the losses alleged to have been incurred. In the circumstances it would be difficult to frame any estimate of their intrinsic values, and, consequently, of the total of such values. The figures given above can but represent the total of the various amounts claimed, and these, so far as one can judge, are sometimes based on generous estimates. This lack of documentary evidence is commented on later in paragraphs 31-36. 10. Of claims marked in the Legation schedule as settled, it is noted that— One case (Mr. Hubbard) for wounding, was settled in 1917 by a payment of £2,000 from the Seistan Grain Account. Three cases (one for murder in 1915, and two for highway robberies in 1921-22) were settled by the Indo-European Telegraph Department by pay ments of in all 290,770-75 krans from their Terminal Rate and Traffic Accounts; to which the Persian Government seemingly assented. Three cases (for cotton appropriated by Germans in 1915, for robbery and wounding in 1918, and a part payment for Shiraz outrages in 1915) were settled by payments of 98,954 krans out of Sir P. Sykes’s Fines Account. Nine cases (mainly for loss of life and wounding at Shiraz, Bushire and Isfahan in 1915) were settled by payments of £21,064 115 . and 387,500 krans out of Bushire revenues during British occupation, while it is said (under Claim No. 31), that others may have been. It appears, therefore, that some important claims (noted in the volume Legation Claims), were either compulsorily settled by us during the war period out of Persian funds; or otherwise, with the apparent assent of the Persian6 Government; or, in some seven cases of highway robbery, settled to the extent of £3,581 and 72,282, though whether by the Central Government or the Local Administrations is doubtful. 11. In the case of certain of the outrages on British consular officers or their staffs during the war period, advances were made by the Treasury or Government of India, or both conjointly, to afford relief to the victims of these outrages, the sums advanced to form a first charge on amounts which might be eventually recovered from the Persian Government. These advances are referred to in the volume Legation Claims, but their full extent is not evident from the documents furnished; it can no doubt be readily ascertained if and when any final settlement should be reached with the Persian Government as regards payment of war claims. In a letter from the India Office of the 24th June, 1929, relative to Indian claims, amounts so advanced were said to total £28,000, but this figure may be found to fall short of the combined payments under this head; while it is also shown in our correspondence here that considerable expenditure was incurred in the removal to places of safety of British communities from Persian towns evacuated during the war period. The total of all these payments must amount to a large sum. (B)— The Consulate Claims. 12. The lists of the consulate claims show in all 626 separate claims. These lists result from a circular sent by our Legation on the 29th July, 1924. to His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia, instructing them to examine claims registered in their respective districts in the light of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, and decide into which of the following categories they fell:— (а) Claims which, in their opinion, clearly arose from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, and in support of which sufficient evidence is now available to pursue them at once. (б) Claims which clearly lie against the Persian Government, but which are not backed by really complete and adequate evidence. (c) Claims which are not worthy of presentation to the Persian Government either through lack of evidence or owing to the fact that the Persian Government was neither directly nor indirectly responsible for the circumstances in which they arose. The consuls were at the same time instructed to furnish a detailed statement of each claim, setting out the name and address of the claimant, his status, date of claim, the circumstances, amount, &amp;c.; to attach certified copies of the documen tary evidence available; and to give their reasons for assigning each claim to category (a), (h) or (c) . 13. The lists furnished summarise the returns made by fourteen consulates: Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas, Bushire, Hamadan, Isfahan, Kerman, Kermanshah. Meshed, Resht, Seistan, Shiraz, Sultanabad, Tabriz and Yezd; and short details are added of each claim. In some of these lists the claims are fully classified as (a), (b) or (c) in accordance with the circular; in others they are only partly classified; in one instance, Kermanshah, they are not classified. Bundles of documents are supplied by the respective consulates; these in some cases cover (a), (b) and (c) claims; in others (a) and (b) only: in the case of Kermanshah there are none. 14. The notes furnished by our Legation on the consulate claims say— Of Ahwaz, that all correspondence is missing there, and that the list is compiled from papers in the Legation archives. Of Bandar Abbas (where there are twenty-one unclassified cases), that no trace of many of the papers can be found in the Legation or consular archives. Of Bushire (where there are 120 unclassified cases), that no trace of some of the claims mentioned in the list can be found. Of Kerman (where there are sixty-two unclassified cases), that it is not clear why only a few cases are submitted by the consul in detail; there is no information about the others.21 i Of Kermanshah (where there are fifty-four unclassified cases), that only a list is available, all archives having been destroyed during the war period. Of Meshed, that it is recommended that most of the claims submitted (eleven in number) should be dropped. Of Seistan, that further claims adumbrated have never been received. Of Tabriz, that of the claims submitted some are scantily documented. 15. It is apparent from the deficiencies mentioned above, and from others mentioned below, that the 626 claims set out in the consulate lists must suffer a very considerable reduction owing to lack of any evidence now to establish them. And though the Legation, in Annex V, assess the total value of these consulate claims at 4,446,688 krans, £22,959, 215,000 rupees, and 238 -40 dollars, it seems clear that without sufficient evidence to support these figures they could not stand the test of any tribunal. It seems necessary therefore at the outset to confine ourselves to such claims as have at least some evidence to support them, and these, for the purpose of investigation, must be those placed by the consuls in categories (a) and (5). Some few in category (c) might also be given consideration. 16. The number of consulate claims to merit examination is thus summarily reduced from 626 to 274 (apart from the few [c] cases), and these 274 claims are each set out in two separate volumes, Consulate Claims: Peace-Time and Consulate Claims: War-Time, showing the facts and the evidence furnished in support of each. In the first (or larger) volume, there are set out in chronological order, with indexes, claims which arose in times of peace, arranged as highway robberies (placed in the separated categories (a), (b) and (c) ), followed by miscellaneous claims under their respective heads. In the second (or smaller) volume, war-time claims are similarly arranged chronologically, with indexes. In the following paragraphs, however, they are briefly classified according as they are returned by the consuls in the categories (a), (b) and (c), with observations on each of these categories, the claims placed therein and the reasons assigned by the consuls for placing them there. 17. Category (a).—Claims placed by the consuls in category (a) are returned as in their opinion clearly arising from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, and in support of which sufficient evidence is available to pursue them at once. They may be classified, with the amounts claimed, as follows, distinguishing between peace-time claims and war-time claims :— Peace-time (145 cases). Highway robberies, 1894 to 1928 (101 cases): 1,324,738-90 krans, £1,129 9s. 3^., 12,061-11 rupees. Assault, 1913 (1 case) : £100.

Postal losses, 1897 to 1899 (2 cases) : 7,362 krans. Requisitions, 1928 to 1929 (2 cases) : 16,944 krans. Thefts, 1907 to 1912 (2 cases) : 140 krans, £28. Tribal raids, 1908 to 1912 (8 cases) : 56.058 -50 krans, 2,846 -1 0 rupees. War-time (57 cases). Highway robberies (43 cases): 478,899-15 krans, £6,268 10s. Orf 1,990 rupees. Burglaries (2 cases) : 3,100 krans.Evacuation of Persian towns (7 cases) : 237,789-75 krans. Murders— Aga Ferrukh Khan : 30,000 rupees. Consulate Sowar : 25,000 rupees. Postal losses : £4 195. Qd. Resht disturbances (1920-21) : 62.620 krans. Theft (peculation by Deputy-Governor) : 2,400 krans. Tribal raid : 2,352 krans. 18. The above claims placed in category {a) yield a total of peace-time claims of 2,083,368-27 krans, £2,214 85 . lid., and 111,282-5-9 rupees—and of war-time claims of 787,160-90 krans, £6,273-9-0, and 56.990 rupees—or a combined total in the 202 claims of 2,870,529-17 krans, £8,487 175. l\d., and 168,272-5-9 rupees. Highway robberies form the greater part, it being held by the consuls that it was the plain duty of the Persian Government to safeguard the public highways. But the figures, like those of the Legation claims, can only be regarded as provisional. There are a number of weak spots. Interest at an excessive rate is sometimes claimed—the claim for barracks construction in 1914 (the claimant, Mr. Haycock, now seems to be dead), e.g., is more than five times the original debt. Burglaries we appear to have decided in 1925 not to claim for, ( E though seemingly on grounds of policy and as likely to prejudice other and more of 1925 .) ' important claims. Thefts, our Legation once told the Persian Government in 1923, might elude the vigilance of the police. Peculation by a Persian Deputv- (See para. 47.) Governor seems a matter he was personally liable for. Civil riots at Lingah in 1899, and at Bushire in 1909 (the year of the revolution), raise questions of liability in international law; and in the former case the promise to defray British losses came from a local Governor now dead. Customs losses, many Governments deny liability for. The claims for evacuations of Persian towns in war-time include one for 180,000 krans by Messrs. Ziegler for the removal of their entire establishment from Sultanabad in 1921. which, on the facts shown, has but small prospect of success. 19. It cannot be said either that the allocation of claims by the respective consuls to category (a) has been performed with any great regard to the terms of Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions, to which their attention was specially directed by the Legation in its circular of 1924. Some of the claims placed in this category are well supported by evidence; some are imperfectly supported; some are backed by no evidence except the consul’s own statement of the facts. There is a wide range. In the volume Consulate Claims, in which the various claims are set out in detail chronologically, analysis has been made of the evidence furnished in each claim under the heads— (1) The claimant’s original representation. (2) The evidence of witnesses. (3) The representations made to the local Administration. (4) The notifications made to His Majesty’s Legation. (5) The sworn depositions of the claimants. It will be seen that in most cases we are not furnished with complete documentary evidence on these points. 20. There are also manifest differences of view among the consuls, both as regards offences for which the Persian Government may be deemed liable, and the grounds on which claims may be included in category (a). One return excludes looting of caravanserais as approximating to burglaries, which it also excludes; returns from elsewhere include both. One return excludes claims where no answer can be traced from the local authorities to representations made to them; other returns include claims wherever due notification was made to the local authorities. One return excludes claims because the robbers came from without the consul’s district; other returns include claims whatever the local jurisdiction. At Isfahan the consul in 1925 required many claimants to furnish statutory declarations in respect of past events before including them in category (a)\ if they failed they went into category (b) or (c); most other consuls did not make this requirement. At Shiraz, where the consul was similarly exacting. Messrs. Ziegler, who have more claims than any other firm, furnished at a late hour, after the returns had been made up, a comprehensive affidavit which might0 9 have the effect of translating 18 of their claims placed in category (b) into category (a), and which gives additional validity to five of their claims placed in category (c). 21. These differences doubtless arise from differences of opinion in different minds as to the degree of exactness requisite to form a claim valid both in substance and in evidence, as claims placed in category (a) might be presumed to be; and to this former habits and customs in Persia in the making of claims have probably contributed. But while weight must seemingly be attached to the views of the consuls on the spot that the claims they have placed in category (a) are claims which (in the words of the Legation circular of 1924) either arose from the action or inaction of the Persian Government or its officials, or otherwise lie clearly against that Government, it is evident that in dealing here with such claims they can only be dealt with according to their legal sufficiency or insufficiency, on the evidence available, or which may yet become available, to meet the test of whatever tribunal they may be eventually brought before. It is to be feared, therefore, that the number of those placed in category (a) by the consuls will suffer further reduction on this account. 22. Category (b).—The claims placed in category (b) are returned by five consulates alone, viz., Isfahan, Kerman, Shiraz, Tabriz and Yezd—as lying clearly against the Persian Government, though not backed by really complete and adequate evidence. They number 72 cases, relating almost entirely to highway robberies, though a few are for other forms of robbery, and one for war-time depredations in Urumia. They may be classified as follows, distinguishing again between those which occurred in peace-time and war-time. Peace-time (62 cases). Highway robberies, 1907 to 1921 (57 cases): 366,312-91 krans, £4,328 Os. lid. Caravanserai robbery, 1911 : £35. Civil disturbances. Kazerun, March 1914 (2 cases): 2,062-50 krans £1,079. Tribal raids, 1912-13 (2 cases) : 21,767 krans. War-time (10 cases). Highway robberies (9 cases): 124,679-07 krans, £2,367 3s. Od. Urumia, depredations in : 200,000 krans. 23. These category (6) claims, some of which cover more than one claimant, yield an aggregate of peace-time claims of 390.142-41 krans, and £5,442 0s. lid. —and of war-time claims of 324,679 -07 krans, and £2,367 3s. 0d.; or a combined total of 714,821 -48 krans, and £7,809 3s. lid. The evidence furnished in support of them, though incomplete, is in a good many instances not very different from that furnished in some of the category (a) claims, and it is set out in the volumes Consulate Claims in each case. The reasons assigned by the consuls for placing the claims in category (£&gt;) are as follows :— At Isfahan, because the claimants have not responded, or have been unable to respond, to requests made in 1925 that they should furnish further affidavits in support of their original claims, which are nevertheless just claims, never disputed. At Kerman, because the claims are old and the claimants difficult to trace or dead. At Shiraz, because firms being in liquidation the liquidator is now unable to furnish affidavits; or because the correspondence, or part of it. with the local administration cannot now be traced; or because the local administration never replied to the representation made; or because the muleteer’s statement is not now available; or because the robbers came from a neighbouring jurisdiction, &amp;c. : the claims being nevertheless just claims against Persia. At Tabriz, because the claim is not backed by complete and adequate evidence. At Yezd, because the claim fell to be dealt with by another British consulate; or because the identity of robbers and the locality of the occurrence does not appear. [11541] ciO 24. The claimants in these category {b) cases are mostly British firms, of London, Manchester or Bombay, and they include a former Anglican bishop in Persia (who, however, furnished an affidavit) and the Imperial Bank of Persia. It seems possible that if some of these claimants learned that any settlement of claims was in prospect, they might be prepared to come forward with additional evidence in support of their original claims. Messrs. Ziegler (as mentioned in^ paragraph 20 above) have already done so, and other British firms and claimants have within recent times made enquiries of us as regards any possible settlement of their claims. 25. Category (c) and the Unclassified Cases.—The claims placed by the consuls in category (c) are those not deemed worthy of presentation to the Persian Government either through lack of evidence or because that Government was not responsible. Together with the unclassified cases, they amount to 352 in number. As regards those placed in category (c), inspection of the documents which are sent as a rule bears out the view that they are not worth pursuing; but there are a few which might warrant consideration, and the facts and evidence in these selected cases are set out in the volume Consulate Claims. In the unclassified cases no documents whatever are furnished. Many of the claims in both groups are in respect of loans, bills unpaid, small thefts, debts of one kind or another, and similar minor matters which afford no sufficient basis for claiming against the Persian Government; and, though there are some others more serious for highway robberies, plunder, customs fines, and even piracy and murder, these relate for the most part to Orientals, are wanting in evidence, and have been rejected by our consuls for such reasons as that the claimant is not now traceable, that no documentary evidence is now available, that the Persian authorities cannot be held responsible, or sometimes that the claimant has been found not to possess British nationality. There are, however, among these groups some British firms of standing who might yet be prepared, if any prospect of settlement were in sight, to bring forward further evidence in support of the claims they originally lodged, and which they have no doubt long since regarded as unlikely ever to be settled. 26. Kermanshah List. —Among the unclassified cases are those arising at Kermanshah, where all the consular archives were destroyed during war-time, and the Legation archives concerning them similarly destroyed. With these we can apparently do nothing in the absence of any documentary evidence to establish them. There are over fifty cases on that list, extending' from 1907 to 1914, mainly for highway robberies and other losses during local disturbances, and it is said that frequent representations were made at the times of occurrence to the local administration, while the total amount claimed is assessed at 380,244-30 krans. These claims are mostly by Orientals, but there are among them some important items for highway robberies by Messrs. Sykes and Co for 40,000 krans in 1912; Messrs. David and Sons for 21,927 krans in 1912- Messrs. Ziegler for 14,000 krans in 1911-12; Messrs. Isaac and Co. for 27,000 krans in 1910; besides smaller claims by Messrs. D. Sassoon and Co., the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and even by His Majesty’s Government; there is also one by Consul McDouall for 7,635 krans supplementary to his claim (Legation Claim No. 69) for evacuation losses. Here again some of the claimants might be prepared to furnish additional evidence from their books of the losses they originally claimed for. 27. The examination of the consulate claims shows then that of the 626 claims originally lodged with our consulates in Persia in respect of losses and outrages of one kind or another suffered by British subjects or British-protected persons, or their property, in the past, only 274 are now deemed eligible for inclusion in categories (ci) and (5); while some 350 placed in category (c) or unclassified are not now deemed capable of being advanced, owing to the neglect of the Persian authorities to afford any remedy to the injured parties af the time, and the loss or disappearance since of any sufficient evidence to enable them now to be pursued. And, further, that of the 274 cases returned in categories 'a) and (b) some are in respect of offences which it is doubtful can be laid at the door of the Persian Government, while others are supported by evidence so incomplete as to be insufficient for the purposes of an arbitral tribunal thus involving a further reduction in the number of claims available for this purpose This lack of documentary evidence is commented on later in paragraphs 31 to 36(C)— Denials of Justice. 28. The claims under this head, which are assessed in Annex V at 455,565 krans, £6,913, 11,259 rupees, and 20,000 roubles, can apparently only be mentioned in order to be dismissed. What is known of them is set out in the extracts from the Legation archives which are furnished in Annex III and in the memorandum at the end of the volume Legation Claims. In paragraphs 10 to 13 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that only these meagre details can now be furnished, unsupported by affidavits, and that he considers it will be entirely impossible to hold the Persian Government to any responsibility for them. It is unfortunate, but there seems no alternative in the circumstances but to put them on one side. r (D )—Imperial Bank of Persia Claims. 29. The claims preferred by the Imperial Bank of Persia for the looting of their branches during the war-time disturbances in Persia, amounting to nearly 6 million krans, are mentioned in the volume Legation Claims. The Legation furnish Annex IV, containing a representation made by the Tehran Bank to them on January 5, 1933, together with a statement which had been prepared by the Legation themselves(') of the events leading up to the evacuation of each branch of the bank during the war-time disturbances. This account shows that the bank have repeatedly urged their claims; that they have met with a definite refusal from the Persian Government to consider them, accompanied on the last occasion by something of the nature of a veiled threat if they persisted in advancing them further; and that our Legation have from time to 'time lent their good offices to those attempts to obtain restitution, but without any success. It occurs to one that it may perhaps not be to the best interest of the Bank in Persia to insist too strongly on restitution by the Persian Government for these war time losses, but this is a matter of which the Political Department are the best judges. Sir R, Hoare’s despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, adds in paragraph 16. that researches by the head office of the bank in London may bring to light other claims of the bank in the past which were met by insurance companies for cash looted on the roads, &amp;c. One such is furnished 'in Legation claim No. 114, but up to the present we seem to have no information from the head office of the bank in London of these possible additional claims. (E)— Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia. 30. These claims are similarly set out in the volume Legation Claims. They relate to sixteen persons, and are in the main for losses sustained during war-time. No documentary evidence is furnished in support of them, except in the one or two instances mentioned there, but Sir R. Hoare says in paragraph 15 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, that it might in some cases be possible to obtain this if thought necessary. Out of the sixteen claimants, ten are said to be Persian subjects, and he presumes that as regards these Flis Majesty’s Government will be unable to support their claims. He adds that it is unknown how many of their losses were met by insurance companies, but that the head office of the bank in London have been asked to prepare a statement on this point and to send it to this department direct. Apparently, however, they have not done so yet. III. General Considerations. 31. The position of the five groups of claims being thus shown, and their details set out in each case as far as possible in the separate volumes Legation Claims and Consulate Claims, the claims may now be examined in the li°-ht of general questions common to most of them. These may be ranged under the &amp; heads of “ Evidence,” “ Nationality of Claimants,” “ Amounts Claimed,” “ Insurance Companies,” “ Highway Robberies,” and “ War Claims.” c 2 [H541] ( l ) Paragraph 14 of Sir R. Hoare’s despatch No. 09.12 Evidence. The rules laid down in Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions for guidance in the making of claims against foreign Governments may be summarised thus :— (1) All evidence of a vital nature should be obtained when the claim is first ^ notified; the claimant must show that he is a British subject or British-protected person, both then and now, by sufficient documentary evidence; or, if by a company, by a certificate of registration under the Companies Acts—possibly by proof of the substantial British nationality of its members. (2) Mere signed statements or letters addressed to the consul or other people are, technically speaking, worthless; depositions should bear all necessary stamps and signatures. (3) The evidence must show not only that the loss or damage occurred, but that the Government of the country are responsible; in claims for robbery or violence, e.g., by a policeman or soldier acting under orders; or, if by a private individual, that the Government or their officers knowingly instigated it, or might have prevented it by due diligence or care. (4) In armed insurrections against a Government, the latter are not liable unless they were negligent or might have prevented the damage, or unless they compensate their own subjects or other foreigners, or unless the rebellion was successful and the insurgent party installed in power. (5) The evidence must establish with precision the dates, places and circum stances of the damage; a list as detailed as possible should be appended to a sworn affidavit; while the evidence of the claimant should be supported by the affidavits of other persons as to every part of the claim. 32. It may, perhaps, be that these rules, as set out in the Consular Instructions, are in the nature of a counsel of perfection, and as a means of ensuring that a claimant should neglect nothing that might contribute to the support of his claim. But if they are to be read as representing what we deem essential for the purpose of lodging British claims before an arbitral tribunal, then it is clear that most of our claims against Persia, in whatever category placed, would, on the evidence at present available to us, fail to meet this test; and that, in spite of the fact that most of them are on record as having been officially presented in the past to the Persian Government at or about the times of the respective occurrences, it would now be necessary that they should be supported by much more ample evidence than any yet furnished. 33. The length of time over which these claims extend (nearly 40 years) and the conditions existing in Persia during the greater part of that period, seem indeed to militate against the application to them of the rigorous tests which have been evolved out of the proceedings of international commissions set up from time to time to deal with claims preferred by one Government against another. As mentioned in paragraph 3 above the habitual method, sanctioned by usage in Persia in the past, was for claims to be handled by the local Administra tions of the various provinces or satrapies into which the country was divided, while the representation of the claim to those authorities, arising out of a local and at the time easily identifiable outrage, was directed mainly to the purpose of an immediate pursuit of the culprits, and the recovery, in whole or in part, of the property looted, and the castigation of the offenders. It is easily understood that in such circumstances less attention was paid to the framing of claims with the precision and formality now deemed necessary, than to the immediate rectification of an outrage which had occurred. On the other hand, the Persian Government, now armed with text-books recording the exactitudes of inter national procedure in the making of claims, are seemingly in a position to carry these exactitudes into questions of the settlement of claims, which after many years still exist as claims, primarily because of their own neglect, or that of their local authorities, to afford adequate remedy to claimants at the time the events complained of arose. This appears to be a severe handicap; and the absence or13 loss during the interval which has elapsed of much of the original evidence furnished by the claimants is another; while the efforts made at Tehran and the various consulates to remedy these deficiencies do not seem to avail to carry us much further. 34. In paragraph 6 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that as regards depositions, the consulate claims are in almost every case provided with the necessary affidavits or declarations, but that, owing to pressure of work and the large number of claims involved, it proved impossible to follow the same method as regards the Legation claims. As a result, most of the Legation claims (as shown in the tabular statement of each in the volume Legation Claims) are founded on statements only; and though in the case of outrages and losses sustained during the war period there are some statutory declarations, researches which have been made in our own archives and in those of the Board of Trade and Clearing Office, have added only a few to their number. Sir R. Hoare says that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits or declarations, if these are thought necessary, but it occurs to one that if claims are of old standing, as most of them are, this may not always prove easy, even if statutory declarations made now in respect of occurrences which took place a good many years ago had the same weight as if made at the time. In the case of the numerous highway robberies dealt with by the Legation it appears to have been the habit of Messrs. Lynch, the Persian Transport Company, or other firm, simply to notify the Legation by letter of the outrage, and for the Legation to act on such notification; and it may be that the larger firms concerned can furnish from their books records of the losses in question, duly certified. In the case of the smaller applicants, some of whom may now be dead, there may be more difficulty. However, as regards the Legation claims specified as from (4) to (14) in paragraph 6 above, we appear to be entitled to assume that the necessary documentary evidence wherewith to establish the claims advanced is in the possession of the claimants themselves, and that he, or they, ought to be in a position to furnish it. 35. The consulate claims—at any rate those placed in category {a )—are in many cases better provided with evidence, though they do not bear out the state ment made in Sir R. Hoare’s despatch that they are almost in every case provided with the necessary affidavits and declarations, for the analysis made in the volume Consulate Claims shows that less than 100 claims out of the total of 274 placed in categories (a) and (b) are so provided, while these depositions are mostly of recent date. Further, as mentioned in paragraphs 18 to 20 above, there is considerable variation in the amount of evidence furnished in these consulate claims, and in the opinions held as regards the liability of the Persian Govern ment in respect of them. And while in some instances the consuls append certified copies of the evidence available, in others the evidence is not certified; in some the evidence is given in the form of quotations in the consul’s statement of the claim, and these quotations are sometimes certified and sometimes not. This may not be very material if we were assured that the original documents exist at the various consulates; but these and the other variations mentioned seem to show that we cannot accept in their entirety claims which are returned by the respective consuls as claims which lie clearly against the Persian Government or as being supported by sufficient evidence to enable them to be pursued at once. 36. As a preliminary to this question of sufficiency of evidence, it would therefore seem necessary, if we are to pursue these claims, whether Legation or consulate, before an arbitral tribunal, to endeavour to remedy the deficiencies mentioned as far as possible. Where the returns are uncertified by the consul (notably at Shiraz) they should be certified as true copies by him; where further depositions are obtainable from the claimants, they should be obtained from them; while it may doubtless be assumed that eventually we shall publish a notice in the London Gazette calling upon claimants to furnish all further evidence of which they may be in possession in support of their various claims. When all such evidence as can be thus procured has been obtained, it will be possible to proceed to an apportionment of the claims, according to their legal sufficiency or insufficiency for the purpose in view, in accordance with such a standard of measurement as may be deemed at least a minimum requisite to place them before an arbitral tribunal.Nationality of Claimants. 37. In paragraph 20 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that, so far as is known, all claims transmitted are by British subjects, but that this cannot be guaranteed. There is, in fact, no actual documentary evidence of the British nationality of any of the claimants, apart from the statements they themselves make in such statutory declarations as are furnished, or by the consul, that they are so registered at the consulate; or. in the case of Orientals, statements made by the consul that they are registered at the consulate as British Indian subjects, or sometimes as British-protected persons. As regards the Legation claims, there can be little doubt that, with one or two possible exceptions, the claimant, whether a person or firm, is British; as regards the consulate claims, there may be doubt in the case of Orientals whether they may not be of dual nationality, and possibly Persian as well as British, since Persian nationality seems to cling to an illimitable number of generations born abroad, as the Persian Government argued in the case of Messrs. Isfahan! (Legation Claim No. 92). But, with that exception, and the cases of the consular agent and clerk murdered at Lingah (Legation Claim No. 44), the Persian Government do not appear hitherto to have raised any question of the British nationality of any of the claimants, though the reason may, of course, be that they have seldom attempted hitherto to settle any claim. If they were to question it now in any individual case, it would no doubt be necessary for the claimant to furnish the proof necessary. 38. In the same paragraph of his despatch, however, Sir R. Hoare makes some qualifications, since he notes that the attitude adopted in the past by His Majesty’s Government was that anyone serving in a British institution, such as the Imperial Bank of Persia, the Indo-European Telegraph Department, or in a British consulate, was entitled to support in presenting his claim against the Persian Government. This certainly appears to have been the case, and there is a notable instance in the case of the outrage on the British consulate at Lingah (Legation Claim No. 44), where the British consular agent and his brother, a clerk in the consulate, both said to be Persians, were murdered at their posts, and we claimed from the Persian Government 35,000 tomans on this account. Presumably justification existed in the fact that the outrage was committed on a British consulate and on British consular officials. But in general it would appear that we are not entitled to advance claims against Persia on behalf of Persian subjects, whether of single or dual nationality, and this would dispose of such claims as are made by the Persian subjects on the staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia for their war losses, mentioned in paragraph 30. Amounts Claimed. 39. The totals of the amounts claimed, as computed in paragraphs 6, 17 and 22 above, are ;— Legation claims, peace-time: 2,681,564-88 krans, £259,185 25. 7c?., 70,417-10 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars. Legation claims, war-time : 2,765,850-52 krans, £86,228 Is. 2c?. Consulate claims, peace-time (categories (a) and (5)): 2,473.510-68 krans, £7,656 9s. 10c?. and 111,282-5-9 rupees. Consulate claims, war-time (categories (a) and (b) ): 1,111,839-97 krans, £8,640 12s. and 56,990 rupees. Or a combined total of both Legation and consulate {a) and {b) claims of— Peace-time claims: 5,155,075-56 krans, £266,841 12s. 5c?., 181,699 15-9 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars. War-time claims: 3,877,690-49 krans, £94,868 13s. 2c?., 56,990 rupees. Besides these, there are the war-time claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia for 5,952,027-80 krans for the looting of their branches in Persia, and the claims of five British members of their staff (the sixth appears in Legation Claim No. 63, &amp;c.) mainly for war-time losses, amounting to 19,894-20 krans and £100, but in regard to which we have no documentary evidence. Neglecting consulate {c) claims and those unclassified cases in which no evidence is available, the whole body of claims would amount to an aggregate of approximately 15,228,725 -60 krans, £361,810 5s. 7c?., 240,305-11-9 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars. There are further additions of interest claimed in a number of cases.40. Ill paragraph 19 of his despatch No. 69 of the 18th February, 1933, Sir R. Hoare says that it is worthy of note, since many claims are expressed in krans (normally 50 to the £), that the kran has depreciated considerably during the last twenty years, and that unless payment is made in the kran-sterling rate prevailing at the time considerable losses will result. This is no doubt the case, but, though in a few cases the equivalent of krans is mentioned, in most instances it is not, and it would be a difficult matter to translate into sterling the ever fluctuating kran, in claims which range over many years and many vicissitudes n 81 ^ 11 a n . irs ' P ara g ra pb he assesses the approximate grand total P res e n t rate of exchange at between £650.000 and £700,000, which seems to represent fairly closely the equivalents of 50 krans and some 15 rupees to the present £ sterling. The great majority of claims of all classes are expressed in krans—sometimes tomans (equal to 10 krans), though some claimants have preferred to state their claims in sterling, some (Indian) in rupees and one (with American connexions) in dollars. All these currencies seem to have sunered depieciation of late, though in unequal degrees. This Question of depreciated currencies is seemingly one that might give rise to considerable argument before a tribunal if the claims were to be argued there. A good many of the claims preferred by His Majesty’s Government or the Government of India are for sterling amounts or rupees. The point is perhaps one that has come up tor decision in the case of former international tribunals on the subject of claims(); but it would seem unfair, on the one hand, if claimants should be awarded what may be but a fraction of their original losses, or, on the other, that it they originally claimed in a currency now less depreciated they should have a fortuitous advantage over those who did not, 41. At the same time inspection of the amounts claimed by the various claimants leaves the impression that these are often based on a generous estimate ° osses incurred. So far as regards firms formerly trading in Persia of which there are a large number among the claimants, it seems probable that in view of the hazards to which their merchandise was exposed when in transit through a semi-barbarous country, it could only be by placing a high price upon their goods that they could continue to carry on a profitable business. Firms like leglers, of Manchester, appear to have sustained huge losses (amounting in their case to about £50,000), from robberies, often repeated, but nevertheless were seemingly able to carry on a profitable business, yielding good results. Individual claims of all classes seem to show a like tendency to estimate losses at a high figure sometimes held in check by our Legation or by the British consulate dealing with the claim. Interest again on the amount claimed is usually estimated at S i?* ^ ^ er cen ^' interest is not infrequently asked, leading to claims of which the most notable instance is that of Mr. Haycock (Isfahan Claim No. 1. category (a)), where the total amount claimed is more than five times the original debt. Yet there appears to be no actual rule concerning the addition of interest as regards claims for losses made by one nation against another; in the absence of any treaty provision governing the matter the question of interest seems to rest entirely with the tribunal before which the claims may be brought. Insurance Companies. Q . Jp- In P ara graph 17 of his despatch (No. 69) of the 18th February, 1933 • ir rloare says that the question of payments by insurance companies is of importance in regard to all the claims; that he has no information whether any and if so how many, claims were met in this way; and that he concludes that in SUCH cases the claim should be regarded as having been transferred from the original claimant to the insurance company. This is no doubt the case—at any rate if the insurance company was British—and in former correspondence with our Legation m 1923 (and previously), we have laid stress on the fact that if a claimant was insured against loss in this way, it in no way lessened the claim. Ine documents furnished do not, however, throw very much light on insurance companies or underwriters’ claims, though it seems'to have been a somewhat or mary practice for British firms trading in Persia to insure their goods against losses, where they could find an insurance company willing to accept the risk. H The United States Government hold that in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary t0 P a y ° b k? a t lon s established in foreign currency at the rate of exchange current &lt; io date of payment (see case of Lieut.-Colonel Liddell’s claim against United States (1922-25)4;i. As regards the cases shown, there are two (Legation Claims Nos. 23 and 77) where solicitors acting for underwriters (in one case at least unnamed) claimed in respect of goods insured and stolen, and another (No. 13a) in which Messrs. Loditi claimed compensation for goods which had been looted, part of which they said would have to be refunded to unnamed underwriters. There is a recent claim on behalf of underwriters (Legation Claim No. 114) for some £11,403 for sealed bank-notes stolen en route from Resht to Tehran, advanced • by the Imperial Bank of Persia. In the Isfahan (category (a)) list of claims. Messrs. Ziegler, acting for insurers, claim various amounts in sixteen cases of highway robberies, with a substantial addition of interest. In the same list the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, acting on behalf of Lloyds, claim for a high way robbery; and in the Isfahan (b) list there is a claim for a highway robbery by a firm whose loss had been defrayed by London underwriters. We are also to expect from the Imperial Bank of Persia (see paragraph 30) information as to how many of their official claims, and also those of members of their staff, have been met by insurance companies. 44. But in general there is little mention of underwriters, and it looks as if they have been backward in prosecuting their claims, perhaps because they saw little prospect of recovery. Some evidence of this is afforded by the entry in the Legation schedule against claim No. 13. where it is said of extensive highway robberies committed by one Naib Hussein in 1910 that the claim has not yet been formulated by Messrs. Lynch, but may be submitted by the insurance company. Surely in the course of twenty-four years they should have formulated their claims before this. But it would not be surprising if a good many insurance companies or underwriters asserted claims in the event of any possible settlement with the Persian Government, and this is a factor which must seemingly be taken into account. Highway Robberies. 45. Claims for highway robberies form by far the greatest proportion of the claims recorded in the Legation and consulate lists. On the computation made in paragraphs 6, 17 and 22 above, they amount in the aggregate to about 3,351-596 krans, £62,088 135. 2d., and 14,501 11 rupees, besides others for assaults, murder, &amp;c., which are separately classified, and others either placed by consuls in category (c) or unclassified, concerning which documentary evidence is now either insufficient or wholly absent. It was undoubtedly the custom of the past to hold the Persian Government to full responsibility for these robberies and outrages, which if not compensated by the local Administration of the province in which they took place, then became claims against the Central Government. It does not appear from the Tehran annual reports of the past that many of the claims thus notified to the Central Government were ever settled by them, but this was ascribed to the dilatory tactics of the Persian Government or to their chronic financial straits. There is enough to show that the Persian Government admitted their responsibility to take measures to repair the wrong done, and that compensation was afforded in a number of instances, though whether the amounts were paid by the Central Government or by the local Administration concerned is not apparent—probably the latter. 46. Questions of divided responsibility sometimes arose. In one of these in 1906 we find that our Legation called the attention of the Persian Government to a distinct assurance given by the Shah that a law would be passed making all Governors responsible for losses occurring in their districts, irrespective of the domicile of the robbers. In 1909 Sir G. Barclay reminded the Persian Govern ment that under article 3 of Messrs. Lynch’s Road Concession that Government had bound itself to provide protection of the traffic on the roads. And as late as 1923, Sir P. Loraine in a note to the Persian Government—after the latter had observed that robberies take place in all countries—pointed out the clear distinction which must be drawn between highway robberies and ordinary thefts; an ordinary thief, he said, might elude the vigilance of the police, but highway robbers in order to commit their depredations, profited by the absence of the security which it was the duty of every organised State to provide for all persons using the high roads on their lawful occasions; it was because of the absence of a proper degree of security on the high roads which had been noticeable for many years past in Persia that His Majesty’s Government held the Persian Govern ment responsible for losses sustained by their subjects through highway robbery;if the Persian Government declined this responsibility he had yet to learn on whom they considered it devolved; he would continue under the instructions of his Government to hold the Persian Government responsible, and to press them to afford proper compensation to the victims of such robberies, especially in cases where the property was not recovered. 47. The matter appears first to have come under legal consideration here in 1923, when the question of the form of tribunal before which our claims might be brought arose, since the Persian Government had by this time declined any responsibility beyond that of taking steps to trace robbers and recover goods stolen. In view of this attitude Sir W. Malkin considered it could be but an arbitral tribunal with a neutral umpire, and he thought that if our claims were brought before such a tribunal we must face the fact that many of them, if not all, might be rejected, either because the liability of the Persian Government could not be established in law, or because sufficient evidence in support of the claims would not be forthcoming. Sir C. Hurst, however, feared that an arbitral tribunal, presided over by a neutral, acting on strictly judicial lines, and on what he considered a strict application of the legal principles involved, might lead to the rejection of many claims, and he thought friendly discussion in the first instance preferable; in this event agreement reached on individual claims should be accepted and extended to cover groups of claims; where agreements were not reached, an issue or issues should be submitted to a claims tribunal; if this procedure were adopted, it would be necessary for claimants to produce reason able evidence that there were such circumstances of neglect or malpractice on the part of the Persian authorities as to render the Persian Government liable. 48. The matter was then further discussed at a meeting in this office in April 1924, at which Sir P. Loraine was present, when it was decided that the interests of the claimants would be best served by a preliminary examination of the claims between representatives of the Persian Government and of our Legation at Tehran, any claims of Persians against His Majesty’s Government or British institutions being similarly referred to this preliminary commission; decisions arrived at as to the validity of claims being accepted as final; while an exchange of notes might serve to place on record that where the representatives failed to reach agreement as to the validity of a claim, or where the Persian Government repudiated responsibility, the next step would be a reference of the claim or claims to a Claims Commission with a neutral umpire. 49. The outcome of this preliminary consultation with the Persian Govern ment is referred to in paragraph -60 below. It would seem, however, from the above that in Sir C. Hurst’s view the test of validity would depend upon the claimant being in a position to produce reasonable evidence that there were such circumstances of neglect or malpractice on the part of the Persian authorities as to render the Persian Government liable. That there was neglect to safeguard the public highways in Persia is, of course, evident; these robberies and outrages were of constant, often daily, occurrence; had they taken place in any Western country they would have undoubtedly led to the strongest representations and large demands for damages from Governments whose nationals might have been the victims of these attacks and spoliations; that such outrages and robberies habitually took place in Persia cannot be denied—there is a large volume of evidence to show it—and the onus seems rather to rest on the Persian Government of justifying a neglect to maintain law and order and to safeguard life and property in territories over which they claimed sovereignty and jurisdiction, which is a duty that devolves upon every responsible Government. But if any distinction is to be drawn between neglect and malpractice we must seemingly rely on the former. There are, indeed, a few instances which might suggest malpractice, as where it is alleged that the road guards quitted their duty, or that the gendarmerie in charge of the road saw nothing, or that premises robbed were supposed to be guarded by Persian soldiers. But in general the statements made by our consuls speak of the apathy and inactivity of the local officials, of their failure to take any proper steps either to safeguard the roads or to trace the thieves, of their neglect to guard localities close to towns or places where robbers were rampant, of their evasion of responsibility by endeavouring to shift it to others, or by alleging that the robbers came from another neighbouring jurisdiction, and the like. It is assumed by all our consuls that it was the plain duty of the Persian authorities to maintain the safety of the public highways [11541] ' D18 for traders and travellers alike, and this, as mentioned in paragraph 46 above, was also the view which Sir P. Loraine, our Minister, expressed in his note to the Persian Government of the 5th November, 1923. 50. It may, of course, be that in a number of instances the Persian Govern ment may be in a position to show that at the times these outrages occurred local uprisings or other serious disturbances rendered the Central Government for the moment powerless to prevent them, and so to argue that in these instances they are absolved from responsibility. But such argument is rather for the Persian Government itself to plead before an arbitral tribunal than for us to use as a means of disposing of representations made by British subjects and firms who incurred serious losses from the incidents complained of. War Claims. 51. The next most important class of our claims against Persia relates to outrages of various kinds during the war period, and to forced evacuations of Persian towns during the internal disturbances of that period. These incidents arose largely from the activities of enemy agents among tribes over whom the Persian Government either neglected or were unable to exercise control, and to the advance of enemy troops into Persian territory. The Persian Government have consistently denied liability for any of these occurrences, on the ground that, in spite of their remonstrances, the country had been made the battleground of the belligerent Powers, with the resulting disintegration of all internal organisation. We on our part appear to have almost as consistently maintained that they failed to preserve their neutrality, and that the claims must stand, borne exception to this attitude on our part might perhaps be drawn from the terms of the note which bir P. Cox addressed to the Persian Government on the 9th August, 1919 {State Papers, cxii, 764), where, in obtaining Persian agreement to a waiver on the respective sides, subject to a proviso, of damage done by British troops in Persia and the cost of maintenance of those troops, he spoke of “ the British troops which His Majesty’s Government were obliged to send to Persia owing to Persia s want of power to defend her neutrality.’’ Some distinctions exist between the incidents complained of. The evacuations of Persian towns mainly resulted from the advance of Turkish troops upon them, or of local disturbances engineered by enemy agents; outrages at various places were the work of Persian tribesmen; in the outrages at Shiraz in 1915 the Persian gendarmerie appear to have played a considerable part; elsewhere Persian local levies were responsible for some losses; while Russian troops, in the general disorder which followed the Bolshevik upheaval in Russia, also contributed their share. 52. These war-time claims, which are individually set out in the volume Legation Claims and Consulate Claims: War-Time, and are classified in paragraphs 6, 17 and 22 abo^, may, with the amounts claimed, be placed under four heads :— (1) Outrages on British consular officers and subjects : 680,931-22 krans and £38,640. (2) Losses on evacuations of Persian towns: 1,205,196-70 krans and £563 135. 9d. (3) Losses of the Imperial Bank of Persia and its staff: 5,961,500-80 krans and £100. (4) Miscellaneous: highway robberies, &amp;c. : 2,046,562-37 krans £55,664 195. hd. and 1,990 rupees. Or a total in all of 9,894,191 • 09 krans, £94,968 135 . 2d. and 1,990 rupees. Some ot these claims, however, appear to rest on slender foundation. 53. As regards (1), outrages on British consular officers and subjects are of course, serious matters, and afford just ground for demanding adequate compensation We have, as shown in paragraph 10, settled some claims under this head out of Persian funds during our occupation; and, as mentioned in T a ®f- a r we ha 7 e ultlmatel y account to the Treasury and the Government ol India for sums advanced to certain of the victims of these outrages to defrav then-losses, should we ultimately succeed in obtaining a settlement of these war-time claims by the Persian Government. As regards (2), the groundwork of our claims for losses sustained in the evacuation of Persian towns does not seem19 m so simple. There appear to be two classes of cases—those due to the advance of enemy forces invading Persia and those due to local uprisings, fostered it may be by enemy agents working on the minds of tribes over whom the Persian Govern ment seem to have exercised but a scanty control. In the first, the argument may perhaps be that when Turkish forces invaded Persia, ostensibly on the ground ^ that there were already some Russian troops there, it was the business of the Persian Government to keep them out, and that, as they failed to do so, losses sustained by British officials and subjects who were forced to depart in the face of this enemy invasion were losses for which the Persian Government are liable. There is obviously some contentious matter here. In the second, it seems clearer that the local populations, even if misled by enemy intriguers, were the actual offenders, even though it may be doubtful if the Persian Government had the means to control them. As regards (3), the claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia and its staff have already been referred to in paragraphs 29 and 30 above; while, as regards (4), highway robberies and other outrages were, of course, more frequent during the war period than in others, owing to the disorganised state of the country. 54. As regards our claims for war losses there seems little doubt that if these are advanced before an arbitral tribunal, the Persian Government will, on their part, advance counter-claims against us for Persian losses during this period. There are several references in the Legation correspondence to their intention to advance claims of this nature against the belligerent Powers who carried on operations in Persia; in that relating to Legation claim No. 29, e.g., they said they hoped, when the questions of the war were decided, to obtain considerable compensation for damage to Persia and its inhabitants from the operations of the belligerent Powers. It seems unlikely that they will obtain much in this way from either Russia or Turkey—and there seems no evidence that they have tried to do so—but they may hope to obtain some from us, more especially when the opportunity is afforded them of setting off their claims against ours; while their assessment of any damage they can lay at our doors is not likely to err on the side of moderation. We have already had indication of one large claim—that of one Atychides for a ship condemned by our prize court at Bombay, in which a figure of some £900,000 is mentioned—and research will doubtless provide them with further opportunities in this direction. A despatch of Sir R. Clive s of the 4th May, 1929, said that they were engaged in drawing up a list of counter-claims for damage done during the occupation of Persia by foreign armies in the period 1914-21; and in a further despatch of the 15th June, 1929, he gave his impression that their intention was to resist any possibility of a cash payment to us by presenting counter-claims arising out of the occupation of Persia by British forces during the war. In this event the total of their claims would probably far exceed ours, and this consideration—coupled with doubts as to the fate before an arbitral tribunal of our own war-time claims, when the conditions to which Persia, which early in the war declared its neutrality, was exposed at the hands of the contending belligerent Powers, came under review before that tribunal—has led us recently to the proposal that the terms of any agreement, which might be ultimately reached for the settlement of claims should exclude losses of a non-contractual kind incurred between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921, the date when the last British troops left Persia. If this proposal should be eventually adopted it will materially reduce the total of our outstanding claims against Persia, as shown in the approximate figures given in paragraph 39 above. 56. Questions of damage done by British troops in Persia arose in 1919, when, as supplementary to the agreement of the 9th August, 1919, between His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government, notes were exchanged on the 9th-10th August, 1919, between Sir P. Cox and Vossug-ed-Dowleh for the waiver of claims on the respective sides for the cost of maintenance of those troops and any damage done by them in Persia, but leaving the claims of individuals and private institutions to be dealt with independently. The latter clause was doubtless meant to safeguard our own claims, but it leaves the door open to Persian claims also. These notes are shown on pp. 167-8 of our printed correspondence respecting the affairs of Persia, 1919 (Confidential 11601). The agreement mentioned and its annexes provided by their terms neither for ratifica tion nor denunciation, and must be assumed therefore to have possessed validity as from the date of their signature. The correspondence, however, shows that the [11541] D 2submission of the agreement to the Persian Majlis was insisted on by the Persian Government; that they delayed such submission, while opposition to the agreement in the meantime sprung up and grew in force; and that the agreement was denounced a few years later. But in these circumstances it would appear that the Persian Government have already committed themselves by the notes exchanged on the 9th-10th August, 1919, to a recognition that questions of jg damage caused by British troops in Persia are set off against the cost of main tenance of those troops, subject, however, to such claims as might be preferred by individuals and private institutions, which, of course, might be, and probably would be, for very large amounts. IV. Attitude of the Persian Government. 57. Reference was made in paragraph 3 to customs of the past in invoking compensation for losses sustained by British subjects in Persia by means of repre sentations made direct to the local Administrations of the districts into which the country was divided, and to the subsequent notification of such claims to the Persian Government only after all prospects of redress in this way had been exhausted. It is apparent from the Tehran annual reports of former years that the Persian Government paid but slight attention to these notifications, with the result that most of these older claims still exist in our records. On the other hand, the system then followed, both in regard to the Legation and consulate claims, led to a somewhat loose procedure in the way of collating formal and precise evidence of the losses incurred. The loss or destruction during the war-time disturbances of much of such documentary evidence as did exist in the Legation or consulate archives is a further handicap in the way of our advancement of these older claims. The Persian Government may doubtless be expected to be fully alive to the disadvantage in which we are placed in this respect. 58. But apart from this there are many indications in the correspondence of the past of their disinclination to meet claims advanced against them, where any possible objection to doing so could be raised. Thus in regard to— Burglaries they contested claims because of delay in advancing them; because they saw no ground for compensation, even where the robbery was from a British consulate supposed to be guarded by police; because they found no precedent for compensation for such robberies. Highway robberies because no Government could be responsible for stolen goods, but only for efforts to recover them; because having taken steps to trace the robbers they could not be further responsible; because of delay in advancing the claim; because of the existence of a rebellion at the time or of war-time disturbances; because the robbers came from beyond Persian frontiers. Insurrections because of uncertainty whether the damage was done by Government troops or insurgents; because of the owner’s carelessness in taking the animals into the fighting sphere; because of the dual nationality of the claimant, British and Persian. Murder and other outrages because the British consular officials were Persians; because the claimants were Persians; because, though British they were also Persians. Question of Contract because there was only a written promise and not a contract; because, though contractual, it required submission to the Majlis. Revolution (1909) because the looting by troops of the late Shah constituted a case of force majeure. Riots because the Imperial Russian Government paid no compensation for similar losses in Russia; because the ringleader was Russian and so the claim properly one against the Russian Government; because of lapse of time; because the claimant had not availed himself of legal remedies Steamshi'p Shushan, attacks on, because these were made bv Turks from across the border. War-time outrages because compensation should be sought from the real instigators of the disturbances, viz., the enemv Governments; because the Persian Government was not responsible for losses and injuries consequent21 on the violation of her neutrality by the belligerent Powers; because of the dislocation of internal organisation owing to the operations of the belligerent Powers, notwithstanding Persian protests, &amp;c. 59. The above having been their attitude in the past, it is hardly to be ^ expected that in present circumstances the Persian Government will be found less difficult to deal with; while, so far as regards war-time claims, they are probably in a position to advance claims of considerable magnitude against us on behalf of individuals and private institutions, who are not likely to estimate any losses at a low figure. But as regards claims for damage done by British troops in Persia, the agreement of the 9th-10th August, 1919, referred to in paragraph 51, which appears to have had temporary validity, seems to absolve us from claims over and above such as may be made by individuals and private institutions, which by that agreement were to be dealt with independently. 60. In paragraph 48 Sir C. Hurst’s suggestion of 1923 that a preliminary examination of claims should take place between representatives of the Persian Government and our Legation was mentioned. Efforts in this direction appear to have been deferred at Tehran for some years thereafter pending the possible settlement of other questions and the classification of our claims. Meanwhile, Sir R. Clive in 1928 laid before the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee his general views as to the possibility of securing a settlement of our various private and commercial claims outstanding. Most of these claims, he said, were war debts which the Persian Government would never admit, and many of the claimants had doubtless written them off; in his opinion, the best means of settlement would be to induce the Persian Government to pay a lump sum of £250.000 in final settlement. This proposal was advocated in the Persian Gulf Sub-Committee’s report, which was approved by the Cabinet. Accordingly, on the 7th November, 1928, general instructions were sent to Sir R. Clive in which he was authorised to reduce the amount to be paid by the Persian Government for these private and commercial claims to a round figure of from £300,000 down to £250,000, representing, it was said, about one-fifth of the total amounts claimed. 61. Sir R. Clive, however, saw difficulties. The Persian Government might, he considered, (1) either refuse to recognise the claims altogether, or (2) might reject the reduced figures unless allowed to go through the claims themselves. As regards (1), he suggested we should either insist on an actual payment or, alternatively, on payment of £300,000 of the debt owing by the Persian Govern ment to His Majesty’s Government, settling in the latter event the claims ourselves in London out of this amount, and levying a percentage for the cost of distribution; while, as regards (2), he imagined that in this event we should have to submit the actual claims to the Persian Government. These suggestions, however, did not meet with approval here, and in a further instruction to Sir R. Clive of the 27th February, 1929, it was pointed out that the Persian Railway Syndicate’s claim in itself amounted to nearly £250,000, and that the cutting down of this and other claims sponsored in the past by His Majesty’s Government would doubtless arouse much opposition; it was preferable therefore to divide the claims into two categories, the first consisting of the Persian Railway Syndicate’s claims and others of special importance, to be settled by separate negotiation with the Persian Government; the second consisting of minor claims, war claims and brigandage claims, where less objection existed to pressing for a lump sum in final settlement, by discussing certain representative claims, with a view of reaching an agreement on the basis of a final pavment of some proportion of their face value; or else, alternatively, a formal claims agreement, on the analogy of one concluded with the Mexican Government, mioffit be negotiated, providing that all outstanding claims should be submitted to a Mixed Claims Commission with a neutral president, or to a single neutral arbitrator to be chosen by agreement. 62. Shortly afterwards, as recorded in the Tehran annual report for 1929 (p. 21), the Persian Minister of Court, in March of that year, suggested a commission of enquiry, with representatives on both sides, to prepare^ a report which might serve as a basis for subsequent negotiations. A rough analysis of our claims having been made at our Legation, a preliminary meeting was held at the end of April between representatives of the Legation and the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The latter were, however, of opinion that each claim would have to be treated on its merits, and that no general principle could22 be laid down to serve as basis for a settlement, while they added that the Persian Government would put in claims on the other side, and that these were being prepared. It thus became evident that a protracted examination of the claims on both sides would be necessary before even a basis for agreement could be arrived at, and it was suggested that an article should be included in the general treaty contemplated to deal with the special subject of claims. The Persian Minister of Court appears, indeed, to have suggested that His Majesty’s Govern ment should make themselves responsible for settling the claims of British subjects as part of the financial arrangements of a general settlement, or else that the claims should be excluded from the negotiations for the treaty, and be submitted in due course to the Persian Government for verification before anv actual scheme for liquidation was decided on. The annual report adds that in face of this intransigent attitude His Majesty’s Government considered it advisable to piess for arbitration on all the claims, a course which would entail securing in the general treaty an article and detailed protocol providing for the establishment of a Claims Commission with a neutral president 63. This appears to bring the matter down to the present time, and to the recent conespondence with our Legation at Tehran as to the form which this article and protocol dealing with claims should assume. Our recent proposal is that it should be drawn to exclude on both sides claims, other than contractual, arising out of acts done or events which took place between the 4th August 1914 and the 22nd February, 1921. If this proposal is accepted by the Persian Govern ment, and our Legation think there is some ground for this belief, it will relieve us from the prospect of meeting what might prove to be very extensive claims on the part of Persian subjects or institutions for losses during the war period occasioned by our operations in Persia. On the other hand—leaving out of account claims which appear in large numbers in the consulate lists °but are backed by no evidence whatever—it will reduce the totality of our claims apart from interest, to about 5,155.075 krans, £266,841 12.?. 5&lt;L, 181.699-15-9 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars; while unless the evidence available to us in support of these peace-time and contractual claims can yet be amplified by the various claimants there can be little doubt that the total amount resulting from such awards as are pronounced by an arbitral tribunal in respect of them, and in the face of Persian counter-argument, will fall far short of the figures mentioned. V. Conclusions. 64. The investigation made of the five groups of claims originally set out m paragraph 2 can now be summarised :— (A) The Legation Claims are classified in paragraph 6, and are commented on in £ a r?^ ra ^ j W ^ l e m t ie vo ^ ume Legation Claims they are set out in detail with the evidence furnished (consisting in the main of correspondence) and the Q ai ^ d CaSe ’ which reach a total of 5.447,415-20 krans, £345’4 13 3s. Oak ,0,417 rupees, and 6,962-40 dollars, neglecting a few which must be dismissed on the facts shown. The claims comprise Highway robberies and outrages. War-time outrages on British consuls and subjects. War-time evacuations of Persian towns. Persian Railway Syndicate (cost of surveys). Persian Transport Company (cancellation of concession). Quarantine Medical Officers in Persian Gulf (salaries). And eight other miscellaneous claims, some of which rest on uncertain foundations. Precise and detailed documentary evidence is wanting in most instances; it will therefore, be for the respective claimants to supply this need, where required if their claims go before an arbitral tribunal, though in the case of companies’ or firms we are entitled to assume that the necessary documents are in their possession. Certain war-time claims were settled by us out of Persian funds and some others for highway robbery were settled by the Persian authorities,’ 5 *23 while sums advanced by the Treasury and the Government of India fall to be repaid to the latter if claims for war-time outrages should be eventually met by the Persian Government. (P) i he Consulate Claims extend over a wide field and a period of some 40 years. They are returned by the consuls in three categories (a), (b) and (c), but many are unclassified. The (a) claims are returned as being valid, both in substance and evidence; the (b) claims as valid in substance but deficient in evidence; the (c) claims and those unclassified, amounting to 352 out of the total of 626, have now no sufficient evidence or none at all available to support them. The (a) claims number 202; the (b) claims number 72; while the facts of each of these 274 cases, and details of the evidence furnished in support of them, are set out in the volumes Consulate Claims: Peace-Time and Consulate Claims: War-Time, a few selected (c) claims being also included in this compilation. The total of the amounts claimed in categories (a) and (b), i.e., in claims held by the consuls to he clearly against^ the Persian Government, is 3,585,350-65 krans, £16,297 Is. \0d., and 168,272-5-9 rupees, apart from certain additions of interest claimed. But, as remarked in paragraphs 19-20, it is sometimes doubtful whether the offence for which a claim is made would justify a claim against the Persian Government; while there are manifest differences of view among the respective consuls as to what may constitute an (a), (b) or (c) claim; and also a wide range m the amount of evidence furnished, from a complete dossier to little of practical value. (C) The Denials of Justice Claims were commented on in paragraph 28, and amount to a total of 455,565 krans, £6,913, 11,259 rupees and 20,000 roubles. They lack any documentary evidence whatever to support them, since none can be traced at Tehran, and they must seemingly be dismissed from our reckoning a view which Sir R. Hoare upholds. (D) The Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for the looting of their branches in Persia during the war are commented on in paragraph 29, and amount to 5,952,027-80 krans, with interest. The head office of the bank in London are apparently prepared to furnish any detailed evidence that may be required of these losses; and they are also said to be engaged in a research to see how many of their older claims of the past were met by insurance companies, who, they presume, have never advanced claims for such payments. (E) The Staff of the Imperial Bank of Persia Claims for their private losses mainly during the war, are similarly referred to in paragraph 30. They relate to sixteen claimants, of whom ten are said to be Persians. Of the six’British subjects, only one has furnished detailed evidence of his losses, while the remaining five, who between them claim 19,894 -20 krans and £100, have not yet furnished any. The bank, however, are understood to be preparing a statement as to how many of their losses were met by insurance companies. (1) The investigation made shows that to the above groups of claims there must be added another—that of Insurance Companies or Underwriters. These are referred to in paragraphs 42-44, but it is evident that besides those mentioned there there must be a good many others who were concerned in pay ments made for goods pillaged or losses incurred in Persia, and that if the opportunity presented itself of any settlement of claims, a number might still be advanced. 65. War-Time Claims. —These are commented on in paragraphs 51-56. If, as Sir R. Hoare is inclined to think, the Persian Government would agree to the exclusion of war-time claims from the scope of the proposed agreement, this will relieve us from the prospect of having to face what, it is easy to imagine, might be extensive claims for alleged damage done to Persian subjects or institutions during the wai period, which might far exceed any total amount we are in a position to claim. If they accept the draft agreement in the form we propose it would also relieve us from the Atychides claim, which in itself appears to exceed the whole of our claims. But if the Persian Government, while aoreeino- in general that war-time claims should be excluded, nevertheless persist in retaining certain classes of them, such as that of Atychides, the matter would • then seem to become one for further, perhaps protracted, negotiations in which we have the appearance of having in hand a large body of claims for outrages done to British officials, subjects and institutions in Persia during the war (even if some doubt may be entertained whether, in the conditions then existing in Persia, we could successfully prosecute these before an arbitral tribunal) °The24 omission of these war-time claims from the scope of the agreement would, however, reduce the totality of our claims from the provisional estimate, made in paragraph 39, of 15,228,725 krans, £361,810, 240,305 rupees and 6,962 40 dollars to some 5,155,075 krans, £266,841, 181,700 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars, apart from additions of interest, from any further claims which may yet come to light, and from any underwriters’ claims which may yet be made. It would also throw us back largely upon pre-war claims, where the evidence furnished is the most defective. 66 . The proposal to eliminate these war-time claims arising between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921, will doubtless provoke repre sentations from parties who suffered losses during that period, but our case against the Persian Government to repair these war-time losses does not seem to rest upon any very strong ground, for most, if not all, of them may be attributed, either directly or indirectly, to enemy action in Persia ; while we seem to have admitted (to some extent at any rate), in the note which Sir P. Cox addressed to the Persian Government on the 9th August, 1919, that Persia was powerless to defend her neutrality. Towards the evacuations of Persian towns by British firms and communities who had remained in Persia during the disturbances and disorders which then prevailed, the correspondence here shows that His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India went to considerable expense on their behalf to convey them elsewhere; and often, in the case of our own officials, who had no option but to remain, to compensate them for the loss or suffering involved in outrages to which they were subjected. Incidentally, we drew upon Persian funds to repair some of these war-time losses; while a waiver of them will involve a non-settlement of such amounts as His Majesty’s Government and the Govern ment of India contributed. It seems possible, however, that there may remain one or two cases in which our officials sustained losses of property for which they might represent they had not been fully compensated. 67. Peace-Time and Contractual Claims —If war-time claims were thus excluded, these will remain.( 3 ) The following occupy the foremost places :— Persian Railway Syndicate: £202,207, with 7 per cent, compound interest. The figure is that given in 1924. In 1933 they offered to take £134,653 odd; their latest estimate in 1934 makes the figure £373,331 odd. Persian Transport Company: £50,000; but earlier £75,900. Quarantine medical officers in Persian Gulf : 69.967 • 10 rupees and 16,814-60 krans. We seem to be in need of a detailed account of these figures from the Government of India. Sir Wolseley Haig : £4,807. In 1921 he informed our Legation he would be satisfied with £2,500. Mr. T. Casey : £1,200. (Our Legation comment in 1909 on this was* “It seems enormous.”) The above total £258,214, 16,814-60 krans and 69,967 10 rupees, leaving for the remaining claims under this head some £8,627, 5,138,260 krans, 111,732 rupees and 6,962-40 dollars, which is distributed over a great number of individual claims for highway robberies, outrages of various kinds, losses in civil disturbances, tribal raids, piracies, burglaries, &amp;c. Among these is the large and very doubtful one for 2,302,905 krans preferred by Messrs. Lynch or the Persian Transport Company for the cost of running the steamship Shushan from 1902 to 1913, which seems to have little to rest on. If this claim were omitted as likely of rejection, we have a total when all is included, for peace-time and contractual claims, of some £266,841, 2,852,170 krans, 181,699 rupees and 6,962 -40 dollars, which, however, in itself includes a sum of about 468,000 krans claimed as interest by a Mr. Haycock on an original debt of some 100,000 krans owing to him by the Persian authorities. Reduced to a sterling equivalent at rates of 50 krans, 15 rupees and 5 dollars to the £, the whole body of these peace-time and contractual claims might be assumed to amount to at most some £340,000, apart from further additions of interest claimed in some cases, which there can be no certainty would be awarded by an arbitral tribunal in the absence of any treaty provision on the subject of interest. ( s ) A short summary of these is given on pp. vii to xxii of the volume Legation Claims immediately after the index. [This summary is printed below as Appendix 3.]25 68 . Evidence .—The question of sufficiency of evidence was discussed in paragraphs 31-36, where it was seen that the documentary evidence furnished by our Legation and consulates in regard to the various claims falls as a rule far short of that prescribed by Chapter XXII of the Consular Instructions as proper where claims are to be preferred by His Majesty’s Government against another Government. The conditions prevailing in Persia at the times when most of the claims were originally advanced seem, in fact, to have been such as not to demand the preparation of documentary evidence with all the fullness and precision of present-day requirements; while much of such documentary evidence as did exist in our Legation and consular archives has since been lost or destroyed during the war-time disturbances—in the case of Kermanshah this lack of documentary evidence, indeed, extends to the entire body of claims recorded there. On the other hand, the documentary evidence wherewith to establish claims of more recent date must often be assumed to be in the possession of the claimants themselves, and this would apply in particular to the first four of the important claims specified at the beginning of paragraph 67 above. 69. The main difficulty, indeed, as regards the peace-time claims resides in the great host of miscellaneous claims, also referred to in paragraph 67 above, which rest upon documentary evidence, occasionally complete, but usually incomplete, not to mention others in which it is wholly absent. A number of these earlier claims are for old-world events, in which it seems doubtful whether either the original claimant or the alleged offender is still alive, or whether after this lapse of time he has any further interest in the claim he preferred many years ago. On the other hand, a much larger number are by British firms formerly trading in Persia, who, in consequence of declining business, seem to be going one by one into liquidation, and who may be expected to be more active in the pursuit of their claims. It seems evident, however, that in the circumstances which have occurred opportunity must be afforded to these various claimants to furnish any additional evidence which may yet be available to them in support of their respective claims—either to supplement what we have, or to replace what has been lost, so as to provide a suitable documentary basis for as many as possible. It appears to be a usual practice, previous to the institution of arbitral proceedings of the kind, to publish a notification in the London Gazette for general information, and to give opportunity for the production of evidence in support of claims; and there seems the greater need for this in a case like the present, where the evidence we have, though often showing a just grievance, is as a rule defective according to international standards. In this connexion Sir R. Hoare’s remark in paragraph 7 of his despatch of the 18th February, 1933.( 4 ) that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from claimants affidavits or declara tions where necessary, should be borne in mind (most of Messrs. Lynch’s or the Persian Transport Company’s robbery claims are unsupported in this way); while, as regards consulate claims, more especially in the case of Shiraz, much of the evidence furnished is not certified by the consul, as it should have been and will have to be. 70. From the foregoing it would appear, therefore, that if the proposal to exclude war-time claims from the arbitration is eventually agreed to, we shall be left with these peace-time and contractual claims, the most important of which, specified in paragraph 67 above, reach a total which might be roughly estimated in sterling at about £263,000, apart from interest; leaving for the more numerous miscellaneous claims, also mentioned there, a total which might be similarlv estimated at about £72,000, apart from interest; or a combined total of about £335,000, apart from interest. But as regards these numerous miscellaneous claims, until we are furnished with all such further evidence as the claimants may yet be able to adduce, we shall not be in a position to make the final apportionment of their claims between such as can be regarded as adequately supported, and such as are not, for the purpose of submitting to an arbitral tribunal. Meanwhile, the individual claims are set out in the volumes Legation Claims and Consulate Claims, showing the facts of each and the evidence we at present have. When this is supplemented by all such further evidence as we mav hope to obtain (more especially perhaps from British firms) from the customary notification in the London Gazette and any other steps deemed desirable once the treaty position has been regularised, it should not be difficult to append this further evidence to what we have, and then to determine from the legal stand- (*) See also Sir P. Loraine’s despatch No. 100 of February 16, 1924—E 2428/344/34. rmni E26 point how many of these claims come within such a standard of measurement as may be considered legally requisite to justify their presentation to an arbitral tribunal. 71. I give below a list of British claimant firms, so far as documentary evidence is at present available in support of their claims of all classes, together with the total amounts claimed by each :— British Firms, Claimants, so far as any Documents are available in support of their Claims, with Totals claimed by each.

Appendix 1. Sir R. Hoare to Sir John Simon. (No. 69.) Sir, Tehran, February 18, 1933. AS arranged in private correspondence with your Department (see my letter of the 31st December, 1932, to Mr. Rendel), I have the honour to transmit herewith lists of the various British claims outstanding against the Persian Government. It will be remembered that in 1923 a previous list of claims was transmitted to your Department under cover of Sir P. Loraine’s despatch No. 308 of the 11th July of that year. 2. The claims dossiers themselves will be packed in a box, which will be taken to Bagdad by the ordinary fortnightly courier. His Majesty’s Embassy have been requested to arrange onward transmission across the desert to Beirut and thence to London. The box will be addressed to the Librarian, the Foreign Office. 3. A copy of this despatch accompanies the claims, and to each bundle or section is attached a copy of the covering list. 4. Some explanation is perhaps needed of the method that has been adopted in arranging the claims now transmitted. The claims are in two main classes, (a) “ consulate ” claims, (b) “ Tehran ” claims. 5. As regards the former, it will suffice if I draw attention to the circular( A ) addressed to all His Majesty’s consular officers in Persia in 1924. This circular explains the method followed at almost all consular posts, the only exceptions being noted and explained in Annex II to this despatch. 6. The claims on the “ Tehran ” list were, however, not dealt with in the same manner. The “ consulate ” claims are in almost every case provided with the necessary affidavits and declarations, but, owing to pressure of work and the large number of claims involved, it proved impossible to follow the same method in regard to the Tehran claims. In 1925-26, however, Mr. J. P. G. Finch, at that time probationer vice-consul at the Legation, went through the archives of the Legation and laboriously collected from the enormous number of dossiers under review (many of them unindexed volumes containing masses of unrelated papers) all possible documents bearing on the claims. These documents he arranged in separate dossiers, one for each claim. These dossiers have now been examined by Mr. Busk and Mr. Gamble; all unnecessary papers have been removed from them, and in many cases additional papers have been added from later archives. Moreover, various new claims have been added to the 1924 list, originally compiled by Mr. Humphreys. The labour thus involved was consider able, but the task of arranging the Tehran claims in dossiers would have been quite impracticable with the available staff had it not been for the invaluable work performed by Mr. Finch, whose labours in this connexion are deserving of the highest praise. Mr. Busk and Mr. Gamble have, in addition, prepared the covering lists to the “consulate ’’ claims, Shiraz having been the only post to supply one, and checked the dossiers, and I am greatly indebted to them for the time and trouble they have taken. 7. It is thus clear that, while the “ consulate ’’ claims are in most cases fully supported by affidavits, the “ Tehran ’’ claims are not. Each “ Tehran ” (*) No. 30 of July 29, 1924 : a copy formed Annex 1 to the despatch ; not printed.29 claim dossier contains, however, the fullest available details of the exact circum stances and amount of the claim, together with copies of notes to the Persian Government and other important documents where it has proved possible to trace any. These details should suffice to place any expert appointed to examine the claims in possession of all the relevant facts, and it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits or declarations if these are thought necessary. 8. It is thus clear that no attempt has been made to divide the claims into categories as was done in the enclosure to my predecessor’s despatch No. 196 of the 19th April, 1929. 9. I have the honour to submit, as an annex* to this despatch, some notes on the various ‘ ‘ consulate ’ ’ claims which may prove of value in any subsequent examination. All notes on the “ Tehran ” claims are contained in a special ‘ ‘ remarks ’ ’ column in the list. 10. In addition to claims by British subjects against the Persian Govern ment noted in the “ Tehran ” and “ consulate ” lists, there is a third category of claims of a rather different type. These have been classed in the past as “ denials of justice,” and are cases where British subjects have sued Persian subjects in the courts and have either failed to obtain justice or have obtained a favourable verdict, but have been unable to persuade the local authorities to enforce that verdict. 11. These claims are all very old, none of them dating from later than 1912, and as far as is known no statements regarding them have ever been transmitted to the Foreign Office. They were, however, presented to the Persian Government on at least two occasions before the war, and the original draft of the note covering the second presentation is annexed to the list. There is no trace of the previous note. 12. The only record of these claims in the Legation archives consists of lists giving meagre details of each case, unsupported by any affidavits; these lists* are transmitted in original (Annex III to this despatch), a brief summary of the list having been made for retention in the Legation archives in case of need. 13. It will, in my opinion, be entirely impossible to hold the Persian Government to any responsibility for these claims. 14. The final main category of claims are those by the Imperial Bank of Persia against the Persian Government on account of damage suffered during the war when bank premises were looted. A statement of these claims prepared by the general manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Tehran is attached to this despatch (Annex IV). The accounts of events leading up to the evacuation of each branch were prepared in His Majesty’s Legation at the request of the bank in 1927. It has unfortunately proved impossible at the moment to trace the representations (referred to in Mr. Wilkinson’s letter) which were made to the Persian Government in 1921. A search for the missing papers is, however, being prosecuted, and it is anticipated that they may yet be traced. It will be remembered that these claims were the subject of private discussion between the bank and the Persian Government in 1929 (see Sir R. Clive’s despatch No. 250 of the 4th May, 1929). 15. In addition to their official claims, the Imperial Bank of Persia submitted to this Legation a list of the £ ‘ private ’ ’ claims of various members of the staff. These claims were compared with the lists prepared by the Legation and consulates, and it was found that several of the claims already figured therein. Sixteen, however, were not previously recorded, and these have been added to the Tehran list as Nos. 98 to 113 inclusive. No detailed documents are available in support of these claims, but it might in some cases be possible to obtain them if it were thought necessary. It will be noted that claims Nos. 104 to 113 inclusive are by Persian subjects, and it will presumably not therefore be possible for His Majesty’s Government to support them. It was, however, thought better to add them to the list for purposes of record, especially in view of the fact that they are likely to figure in the future in correspondence between His Majesty’s Legation and the Imperial Bank of Persia and between your Department and the London office. 16. In submitting these “ private ” claims to the Legation, the manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia pointed out that he was unaware how many of them had been met by insurance companies or underwriters. The London office of the bank have, however, been requested to prepare a statement on this subject and to * Not printed.30 transmit it direct to the Foreign Office. It is, moreover, possible that the researches made by the London office may bring to light a number of other “ official ” claims of the Imperial Bank of Persia which were met by insurance companies and which do not, therefore, figure in the list* (Annex IV) attached to this despatch. The local manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia has no record of the number or magnitude of these claims, which are for cash looted on roads, &amp;c. The insurance companies have presumably never put in any claims against the Persian Government as they are entitled to do. 17. This question of payments by insurance companies is of importance in regard to all the claims, and I regret that I have no information as to whether any, and, if so, how many, claims were met in this way. I conclude that in such cases the claim against the Persian Government should be regarded as having been transferred from the original claimant to the insurance companies. 18. One claim which is in a category by itself is not noted on any list. This is the claim of the heirs of the late Mooshi Daniel, all information regarding which is available in the archives of the Foreign Office (see Foreign Office despatch No. 344 of the 14th June, 1932). 19. It is worthy of note, since many of the claims are expressed in krans, that the kran has depreciated considerably during the last twenty years, and that, unless claimants are paid in the sterling-kran rate prevailing at the time, considerable losses will result. A rough statement* of the totals of all the claims has, however, been prepared and is attached to this despatch (Annex V). It cannot be taken as definite (a) because of the exchange difficulty mentioned above, (5) because the amounts of some claims are not given, (c) because there is no uniformity as regards the computation of interest; in most cases interest has not been added, but in a few (notably the Persian Railway Syndicate’s claim) it forms a large part of the total sum claimed. The approximate grand total at the present rate of exchange is between £650,000 and £700,000. 20. One final point should be emphasised. As far as is known, all the claims now transmitted for consideration are by British subjects, except when the contrary is clearly noted, but it is quite possible that some of the claimants are non-British subjects, and, indeed, several claimants who have for years figured on the Legation’s lists and whose claims have been presented to the Persian Government have, during the recent examination of all the claims, been discovered to be non-British subjects. I regret that I am not in a position to throw any further light on this point, the attitude adopted in the past having apparently been that anyone serving in a British institution, such as the Imperial Bank of Persia or the Indo-European Telegraph Department, or in one of His Majesty’s consulates, was entitled to support in presenting his claims against the Persian Government. In the case of Legation or consulate employees, there is no doubt much justice in this point of view. A case in point is that of the Persian employees captured with Major O’Connor at Shiraz in 1915. But I cannot but feel that His Majesty’s Government has no real locus standi in respect of what I have referred to in paragraph 15 as the “ private ” claims of members of the Imperial Bank of Persia staff, where the claimants are non-British subjects and where the losses were not suffered for any reason connected with their British employment. 21. None of the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s official claims have been included, owing to the entry into force of the Telegraphs Agreement sio-ned on the 13th January, 1932. &amp; 22. I have sent a copy of this despatch (without enclosures) to Mr Finch care of the Foreign Office (No. 11 M), and to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India. I have, &amp;c. R. H. HOARE. P.S. A^ final examination of the lists leads to the suspicion that Bushire claims Nos. 76 and 77 may well be identical with Shiraz claims 33 (category B) and 8 (category A) respectively, though the amounts differ.

In the present volume as full and detailed an account as is possible is given of the claims shown in the Legation schedule (Nos. 1 to 114), both peace-time and war-time, setting out such information as can be gathered from the correspondence and documents available concerning these claims lodged at Tehran itself. In view of the recent proposal (which Sir R. Hoare considers the Persian Government will accept) to exclude from the contemplated arbitration non contractual claims on both sides falling within the period from the 4 th August, 1914, to the 22nd February, 1921, it may be convenient to summarise briefly the main facts of those which in this event would remain in the Legation group of claims, viz., those occurring in times of peace. There is one exceptional case (Claim No. 79) within the war period which seems to present features of a semi-contractual kind. It will be seen that, apart from correspondence, we have at present very little actual documentary evidence in support of these claims. But in some instances the evidence is known to be in the claimant’s possession; in others it may be assumed to be in their possession; while in others we have Sir R. Hoare’s assurance that it will be comparatively simple to obtain from the claimants affidavits if these are thought necessary. Claim No. 1 —Mr. J. P. Richards claimed 6,962-40 dollars, plus interest, for the loss of 117 bales of wool destroyed in riots at Meshed on the 22 nd March, 1905. There seems no evidence that the Persian Government granted compensation for losses occasioned by these riots, and there is evidence that at the time they refused claims preferred by Russia on the ground that Russia had rejected similar Persian claims for losses in riots in Southern Russia. There is a long correspondence, and it was reported in 1927 that the Persian Government at that time refused compensation to Richards on the ground that he had not availed himself of his legal remedies. On the other hand, the annual report for that year says that they made him a tentative offer of £300 in settlement, which he refused, maintaining that his original claim was for £1,500, apart from interest. The evidence furnished consists of copies of certificates relating to the wool and its destruction. The originals are presumablv in Mr. Richards’s possession.Claim No. 2.—Mr. T. Casey claimed £1,200 for the plunder of his house at Tehran during the conflict on the 14th-l7th July, 1909, between the Shah’s troops and the Nationalist troops, which ended in the deposition of the Shah. The Persian Government denied liability for the damage done by the late Shah’s troops on the ground of force majeure. We rejected this plea on the ground that it was not open to them to plead force majeure in connexion with the incidents ^ out of which the claim arose and to repudiate the responsibility incurred by their predecessors. No headway, however, has yet resulted, and the claim is supported by a statutory declaration made at the time by Mr. Casey as to the value of his goods looted or destroyed. Claim No. 3.—Mrs. Nanagan Rizzo made a claim for similar losses on the same occasion, amounting to 1,000 krans, which was also at the time preferred by our Legation against the Persian Government, but we have no statutory declaration from her in support of it, and no information concerning the lady herself. Claim No. 5.—Messrs. Lynch claimed 2,302,905*07 krans for expenses incurred in running the steamship Shushan on the Karun River from 1902 to 1913. Not having been able to get a concession for working their steamer on this part of the river, and as they wished to keep the traffic in their own hands, they made a present of the vessel to the Shah, and offered to work it, on the under standing, they say, that the profits, if any, would be paid to the Shah, while their out-of-pocket expenses would be made good to them. A rescript of the Shah of the 4th February, 1890, runs thus: “His Imperial Majesty accepts from the Euphrates and Tigris Navigation Company the steamship Shushan for trans porting passengers and goods between Ahwaz, Shuster and Dizful. His Imperial Majesty gives assurances to the above-mentioned company that the steamship in question will constantly run in conjunction with the company’s ships running on the Karun from Mohammerah to the Ahwaz Ham unless prevented from doing so by accidents.’’ This appears to be the main basis on which the claim rests, and it will be for Messrs. Lynch to furnish any other evidence of which they may be in possession in support of their contention that the understanding involved payment to them of their out-of-pocket expenses. The vessel was seemingly throughout the whole period run at a loss, and the claim mounted annually, until in 1913 it reached the total mentioned above. The Persian Government have throughout emphatically denied that they were in any way liable for any accounts connected with the running of the vessel, which, they said, had under strong pressure been accepted as a gift by the Shah. Our own view, expressed in minutes in 1919, was that the claim was rather absurd. From a recent letter from the Persian Transport Company it would seem that the latter now regard the vessel as their own, as they said it had broken its back, and that the remains of it when sold would add something to the assets of the company. Claim No. 6 .—Messrs. Lynch claimed 10,663 krans for attacks made in Persian territory on the steamship Shushan (mentioned above) by Arabs, who were Turkish subjects. As this vessel appears from the above to have been in 1902 and 1904 (the time when the attacks were made) to have been the property of the Shah, and as the Turkish Government at the time denied responsibility, it does not seem clear that a liability rests on the Persian Government to meet this claim, which was presumably for repairs to the vessel, though it included also some goods. Anyhow, it will be for Messrs. Lynch to provide the requisite evidence to support it, as no documentary evidence is furnished, and the claim at present rests on statements only. Claim No. 7.—Messrs. Lynch claimed 7,199*30 krans for the robbery of their caravans at Dehdiz on the 9th July, 1906, by Kuhgelu tribesmen. Notification was duly made to the Bakhtiari khans by His Majesty’s consul-general at Isfahan, but pursuit of the robbers was delayed owing to those khans referring • to the Persian Government for instructions, which were given that steps should be taken to arrest the robbers and recover the property. Nothing, however, resulted. It appears to have been the practice of Messrs. Lynch simply to notify our Legation of these robberies by letter only, and it will accordingly be necessary for that firm in this, as in other cases, to substantiate their claim by the production from their records of such documentary evidence as is necessary of the losses incurred. Claims Nos. 8 and 9.—These were claims by Messrs. Lynch for the destruction of their toll-house at Kasr-i-Dokhtar, between 1906 and 1908, and [11541 ; f 236 the loss of tolls thus occasioned. For the destruction of the toll-house 7,827-35 krans was claimed, according to a detailed account, and for the loss of tolls between 1908 and 1910 a further 60,924 krans. Messrs. Lynch were entitled under their road concessions to set up toll-houses and collect tolls, and their endeavour to do so at Kasr-i-Dokhtar met with the full support of the Persian Government, who were, however, powerless to enforce their repeated injunctions to the local authority, in the face of a determined local opposition, with the result that the building was wrecked by a mob, and the collection of tolls for the time being brought to an end. Here, again, we are furnished only with statements and no depositions, and if the claims are to be pursued it will seemingly be necessary for Messrs. Lynch to supply all requisite evidence in support. There is also reason to think that they waived their claim on this head at the time their concession was renewed in 1914 or thereabouts. Claim No. 10.—Messrs. Lynch claimed £15 155. for damage to a “ level ” used by their road engineers, which was injured in a fracas in January 1907 between Cossacks in the employment of the Persian Government and the staff of their toll-house at Menzerieh. The Cossacks were severely punished by their commanding officer for their misconduct, but no compensation seems to have been obtained for the damage done to the “ level,” and it is not altogether clear whether the claim of £15 155. was actually presented to the Persian Government. At any rate, Messrs. Lynch will have to furnish documentary evidence to justify the claim. There is none here. Claim No. 11 .—The Persian Transport Company claimed some 300 krans for a post-wagon robbery in April 1909. Due representations were made by our Legation to the Persian Government, but no documentary evidence is available concerning the loss, and this remains to be furnished by the Persian Transport Company. Claim No. 12 .—The Persian Transport Company claimed 180 krans for the forcible closing of their tea-house at Keraz Bridge in December 1910 by one Hasan Khan, a local dignitary, who appears to have acted in a violent and illegal manner in doing so. Representations were made by our Legation to the Persian Government, but the amount claimed is apparently still outstanding, and there is nothing in the way of precise documentary evidence to support it. Probably the Persian Transport Company, if they still maintain the claim, can from their records provide evidence. Claims Nos. 13, 21 and 22.—Messrs. Lynch in 1910 furnished our Legation with a list of goods robbed from caravans by one Naib Hussein, who in October of that year had with his followers broken out in revolt against the Persian Government and had captured and occupied the town of Kashan. Our Legation were at the time doubtful whether a claim would be justified in the circum stances; other Legations at Tehran were not entering claims; and they referred the matter home, observing, however, that in any case the line between insurgents and robbers in Persia was so fine that it might form an inconvenient precedent to put no claim in the present case. In reply we instructed the Legation that, having regard to the special circumstances, the proposal to present a claim for the sworn value of the goods was approved. This was minuted by our Legation to the effect that the sworn value of the goods should be ascertained, and that a claim would then be preferred against the Persian Government. As a result it now appears from the schedule of claims sent home that (after some twenty-four years) the claim has not yet been formulated by Messrs. Lynch, but may be submitted by the insurance company. Except in the case of two minor items (which form Claims Nos. 21 and 22 ), we have therefore no further information concerning these claims. These two items are as follows :— . Claim No. 21.—Merely an extract from the Legation register, which shows that Messrs. Lynch compromised with one Mashallah Khan, who had asked that his goods should be insured against loss (which was not, however, done) by paying him £100 for the loss of his goods. This seems rather a doubtful claim in the circumstances, as the fault appears to have been due to the neglect of Lynch’s agent to insure the goods against robbery. Claim No. 22.—Again merely an extract from the Legation register concerning Messrs. Lynch’s claim for 6,612-95 krans for nineteen cases of provisions shipped from London on Lynch’s account for subsequent sale to Jemshid Shahrian.37 Such documents as the Legation possessed in these two cases are said to be missing. Seemingly, therefore, unless and until precise documentary evidence in regard to these and other Naib Hussein robbery claims is forthcoming from Lynch’s or the insurance company concerned it will be difficult to maLe any headway with them. Claim No. 13a. —This also is a Naib Hussein robbery case preferred by Messrs. Roditi, of Manchester (a firm which has now dissolved partnership). They claimed £668 12s. 7d. for sixty-one packages of goods looted, consisting of cottons and woollens. These goods had been insured by them, but only for invoice value (the insurance company is not mentioned), and the actual claim of the firm is much less, since they say that of the total of £668 12s. 7d. part would have to be refunded to the underwriters. The documents relating to these goods had been sold by Messrs. Roditi to the Imperial Bank of Persia, and they attached a number of paid cheques showing that they repaid to that bank the greater part of the amount claimed. There is, however, no statutory declaration or other precise documentary evidence concerning the robbery, and it rather looks as if the claim merges into the larger Lynch claims mentioned above, concerning which we are still in want of precise details and the insurance company claims (if any) still awaited. Claim No. 14.—Miss Ross claimed 633 krans for assault and highway robbery in the Ears district in 1911. A previous similar claim by the same lady had been paid by the Persian Government ex gratia, but as regards this second claim we have nothing but statements and the fact that it was duly preferred by our Legation against the Persian Government on the 30th October, 1911. Claim No. 17.—Mr. G. Meriton, an employee of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, in charge of their Meshed line, was in December 1912, while travelling with his Gholams, driver and labourers, violently attacked by a band of Turcomans, who killed some of them and pillaged everything. Mr. Meriton claimed 5,199-45 krans for his personal losses and 5,450 krans for the outrage. The full claim, however, was for 22,311-35 krans, and formed at the time the subject of direct correspondence between the Indo-European Telegraph Department and the Persian Government. But there is nothing to show what resulted from that correspondence. The evidence consists of a letter from the director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department to the Persian Government enclosing Mr. Meriton’s report of the occurrence. Article 3 of the recent agreement with Persia of the 17th February, 1932, regarding the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia, says : “ the high contracting parties mutually agree to cancel all debts and claims existing between them in relation to telegraph matters.” It might, therefore, be presumed that, unless the claim was previously settled, as it may well have been (for the Indo-European Telegraph Department settled many claims out of their Terminal Rate and Traffic Account), the major part, if not the whole, of the claim of Mr. Meriton and his party founded on the incident of 1912 may probably have disappeared in view of this stipulation. Claim No. 20.—The Persian Transport Company claimed 5,666-65 krans for damage done to five of their guest-houses on the Tehran-Kum Road by Bakhtiari and Shahsevend tribesmen during 1911. The evidence consists of a detailed list of articles looted with their assessed values, and the amount was claimed from the Persian Government by our Legation on the 3rd April, 1912. Claim No. 23.—This is an underwriter’s claim preferred through Messrs. Penning and Shepard (74 Cornhill and Lloyds’), and the names Messrs. Hogg and Heath (33 Cornhill) were given as adjusters. It relates to a payment of £140 65 . bd. for a highway robbery of goods on the 17th March, 1912, on the Tehran-Isfahan Road, of which Messrs. Penning and Shepard were notified by Lynch’s, who asked that the amount should be credited to their account. Certain original documents were furnished to this office by Messrs. Penning and Shepard, and copies were made of these and sent to our Legation, the originals being returned to that firm. The claim was preferred to the Persian Government by our Legation on the 13th January, 1914. The names of the firms mentioned cannot be traced in the London Directory, 1933, but it is possible that Lloyds’ may have information about them, and in any case Messrs. Lynch should have record of the event. Claim No. 75.—Mira Jan, described as a British Indian subject, claimed 300 tomans, or compensation in kind, for the loss of six camels shot on the38 1 st September, 1921, by a rebellious gendarmerie force operating near Meshed against loyalist tribesmen. His Majesty’s consul-general at Meshed obtained from the local Karguzar a written promise that six camels of equal value would be handed over in compensation, but later the Karguzar said that he had referred the matter to the Persian Government, who held that the camels were probably killed at the time of fighting, and that it was uncertain whether they were killed by the gendarmerie or by the tribes who were attacking the latter; that the Shamser force was not liable to pay compensation; and that the owner’s loss was due to his own carelessness in taking the animals into the fighting sphere. Later the Persian Government informed Sir P. Loraine that the guilty parties had never been discovered, and that it was impossible to establish responsibility for the killing of camels while fighting was going on at night time. This claim rests mainly on the definite promise given in the first instance by the local authority that the camels would be replaced, and we are furnished with copies of the correspondence to this effect. Claim No. 79.—This is a claim which comes within the war period, since it arose in 1919-20, but it might be regarded as having some of the elements of a contractual claim. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Wolseley Haig (formerly political agent and consul-general in Persia and now Albany Herald in Scotland) claimed £4,807 for breach of an undertaking that he would receive employment in the Persian Service (as he thought, as adviser in the Ministry of the Interior). His claim rests upon a letter dated the 31st May, 1920, from the then Persian Prime Minister, Vossugh-ed-Dowleh, to the effect that he was admitted to the Persian Service, that the terms of contract and the designation of the post would be settled definitely later, and that the service would date from his retirement from the British Service in August 1920. This letter was in Sir W. Haig’s possession, and the view taken of it here in 1921 was that it constituted a distinct undertaking. Our Legation were accordingly instructed to inform the Persian Government that His Majesty’s Government held them definitely responsible for the losses incurred through the non-fulfilment of this undertaking, and the Legation did so on the 14th December, 1921. Sir Wolseley Haig estimated the expenses he had been put to in making adequate preparations for the promised appointment (travelling expenses of self, wife and family, provision of furniture, plate, &amp;c., suitable, as well as the compensation he should receive for his frustrated expectations, at £4,807 (though he afterwards, in conversation with our Legation, said he would be satisfied with £2,500). The Persian Government on their part maintained that the letter of their Prime Minister was a private one, that there was no contract and that the rate of prospective pay on which Sir W. Haig calculated his claim was excessive. Still, in 1921 they offered to submit the claim to arbitration, and Mr. Norman (our Charge d’Affaires) reported that he had had an offer of £2,500 from them in full settlement. Both these offers, however, Sir W. Haig at the time refused. In commenting on this claim in 1924 Sir P. Loraine considered Sir W. Haig was largely to blame for the non-success of the claim made on his behalf—his original claim was exaggerated, he was verbally offered arbitration and later £2,500, and refused both, though he afterwards reduced his claim to the latter amount. Claim No. 88 .—This is the important claim of the Persian Transport Company for the cancellation of their road and toll concessions in November 1921. For this breach of the concessions the company claimed some £76,000, the amount of capital said to have been expended on the construction of the roads, plus some portable equipment seized, but they offered in 1921 to accept £50,000 on condition of a prompt settlement, which, however, has not matured. Sir R. Hoare has recently taken up the matter anew with the Persian Govern ment, and the company have furnished material for this representation, which is about to go forward. The claim is one in the forefront of our proposed settlements with the Persian Government, and the company are no doubt in a position to produce all such documentary evidence as may be necessary to establish their various contentions. Claim No. 89.—This was a large claim by six British Indian subjects (unnamed) for an extensive robbery of their goods in September 1921 on the Yezd-Kerman Road, amounting to a claimed value of 238.454 -38 krans. The correspondence between Sir P. Loraine and the Persian Government shows thatthe latter took certain measures, which were to an extent successful, in retrieving some small part of the goods, while at the same time they denied their responsibility for affording any compensation for the loss of the remainder. On his part Sir P. Loraine definitely maintained their liability for the losses. Unfortunately, it is added that there is little to go on in the case, as His Majesty’s consul at Kerman had never furnished full details, and that no further attempt had been made to press the claim upon the Persian Government since 1923. Search among the Kerman returns fails to add anything, and we have accordingly neither the names of the claimants nor other evidence to support this claim of some thirteen years’ standing, and in the circumstances it is not clear how it can be further pursued unless fresh material can be brought forward. Claim No. 93.—This is perhaps the most important claim of all. The Persian Railway Syndicate claim £202,207, with accrued interest, amounting in 1932 to a total of £326,082 25. Id., for the costs of survey of certain specified railway routes in Persia. Their claim depends upon options granted them in 1920 by the then Persian Government, and the material clause on which their claim is based runs : ‘ c Should the Persian Government, after the expiry of the periods mentioned, decide not to construct the railways as State railways, and should the syndicate not be agreeable to accepting a concession on reasonable and practicable terms, then the Persian Government shall give notice that, after six months following the above-mentioned period, they will take over the plans and surveys and pay for them at a price equal to the cost thereof and interest thereon.” Ihe contention of the Persian Government is, in short, that the options given were never sanctioned by the Majlis, and so were not in accord with article 26 of the Fundamental Law; an argument which, as Sir R. Hoare has pointed out, was untenable, as no Majlis was in existence at any of the material dates. In 1933, however, the Persian Government still maintained their view; if the syndicate were not satisfied they might refer the matter to the competent courts, in which event the Persian Government would set forth in detail their arguments and evidence in support of the non-existence of their responsibility. It was ascertained that by the phrase “ competent courts ” the Persian courts of justice were meant. In November 1933 the Persian Railway Syndicate wrote to say they were prepared to compromise for the actual costs of the survey, viz., £131653 85 . 2d .; if this offer was not accepted their original claim would hold good. Later, in March 1934, they furnished an opinion on their case by Sir Leslie Scott, and in April a further statement of account, plus interest, amounting in all to £348,907 175. Claim No. 96.—This is a claim for arrears of salaries and pension allowances of officers of the Indian Medical Service formerly employed in the Persian Gulf Quarantine Service. The period for which these arrears are claimed is from the 1 st July, 1923, to the 30th June, 1924, and the amount due is stated by our Legation to be 69,967 10 rupees and 16,814 krans. J he Persian Gulf Quarantine Service remained under the supervision of British medical officers until 1928, when, by agreement with the Persian Govern ment, it came to an end. The correspondence shows that these quarantine arrangements were confided to British medical officers about as far back as 1864; their services, however, rested upon no contract or written agreement, though their presence had been recognised in numerous ways by the Persian Government and the service expanded and elaborated from time to time with their express approval. Down to 1928 their salaries appear to have been paid by the Persian authorities out of the local Customs Administration funds, with the exception of the period in 1923-24 for which they are claimed, and the reason for this omission is said to be obscure, but appears to have been due to some overlapping of accounts, which resulted in the payments for the period mentioned not having been sanctioned by the Majlis. As apart from some budgetary difficulties in framing estimates, it is not clear that the Persian Government really disputed the right of these British officers to be paid for work which they were efficiently rendering up to the time when the Quarantine Service was in 1928 handed over to the Persian authorities. But the correspondence seems to have passed mainly at Tehran, and I cannot find that we have any very accurate particulars here of the payments made to these officers in such detail as to make evident the precise deficiency left in suchpayments by the gap between the 1st July, 1923, and the 30th June, 1924. If the claim is pursued it seems necessary that we should have a clear and detailed statement of the position, and this would apparently have to be got either from our Legation at Tehran or from the Government of India through the India Office, preferably the latter, since it is likely to be more fully documented. The above constitute all the Legation peace-time claims of any substance. There are two others (Nos. 94 and 98), one for a robbery by a Mesopotamian tribe, who had crossed the frontier in 1923 and stolen goods valued by a Bagdad firm at 450 rupees; and the other for the alleged robbery from a member of the Imperial Bank of Persia near Isfahan in 1911 of articles valued at 8,421 krans, but there is nothing furnished on which these claims could be properly based. Appendix 4. Index and Introduction to the Supplementary Volume* of Memoranda entitled ‘ Persia: Consulate Claims {Peace Time)'' (Persia 36). Consulate Claims. (With the exception of those arising during the War Period, i.e., from August 4, 1914, to February 1921.) The claims are returned by the fourteen consulates in three separate categories, viz. :— (a) Those deemed supported by adequate evidence. (h) Those deemed supported by inadequate evidence. (c) Those materially lacking in evidence. But, as shown in the introductory remarks on these claims, this classification cannot be wholly relied on. For the purpose of the index and the statement of these claims which is within, however, the classification has been retained, and each claim is indicated accordingly as (a), (b) or (c) as returned by the consuls.

The Consulate Claims (Peace-Time). A main distinction between the Legation claims and the consulate claims is that in the case of the former we are furnished with little but correspondence, and must look to the claimants themselves to supply any requisite detailed documentary evidence; whereas in the case of the consulate claims we are furnished with all such evidence as can now be traced in the consulate archives, though much of it has been lost or destroyed. It is a question therefore of investigating this evidence to see whether it would be likely to stand the test of a tribunal. The lists furnished by the fourteen consulates set out 626 claims, but of these only 274 are supported by evidence deemed sufficient to establish the existence of the claim, while a division is made between those placed in category (a), as deemed by the consuls to afford conclusive evidence, and those placed by them in category (h), as not backed by complete and adequate evidence. There is a further category (c) relating to claims they do not deem worthy of presentation. There are in all 202 claims in category (a) and seventy-two in category (b). The proposal to exclude war-time claims (i.e., those between the 4th August, 1914, and the 22nd February, 1921) will reduce these numbers to 145 (a) claims and sixty-seven (b) claims. There are a few in category (c) which might be given consideration. In the present volume relating to peace-time claims we have therefore to investigate the evidence which is available in some 220 cases. The great majority relate to highway robberies, of which there are about 160 cases; the remainder may be grouped as miscellaneous claims, under their respective heads. In the attached statement each set of claims has been arranged chronologically as follows :— Highway robbery (a) claims. Highway robbery (b) claims. Highway robbery (c) claims. The miscellaneous claims follow under the heads of— Assaults. Burglaries and caravanserai robberies. Civil disturbances. Consulate-general, Isfahan, damage to. Customs losses. Debts. Murders. Piracies. Postal losses. Requisitions. Thefts. Tribal raids. As might be expected in returns made by fourteen different consulates, there are considerable differences between the amount of evidence furnished, the wav in which it is set forth and the views of the respective consuls as to its sufficiencv or otherwise. No great reliance can be placed on their assignment of claims to category (a) or (b ); and while it is clear that some of those placed in (a) ou^ht to be in (b), it is doubtful whether some of those in (b) might not appear in It seems necessary to investigate them all. [11541] G 2In each case the claim is prefaced by a statement by the consul setting out the facts. Often this gives a full description of the claim, the manner in which it arose, the steps taken and the views of the consul as to the liability of the Persian Government; in many cases, however, the description is meagre and incomplete. This statement is usually signed by the consul, and might then be deemed evidence compiled from the consulate records; but in the case of Shiraz (which returns most claims) it is not signed. To this statement such evidence as is available is attached, and consists as a rule of certified copies of correspondence and other documentary proof; in the case of Shiraz, however, this evidence is embodied in the consul’s statement (a rather inconvenient form). In a good many instances the copies are not certified as correct, whether by oversight or not is not mentioned; it may be that this is due to the original documents not being now available, but, if so, this should have been stated for our information. It might perhaps be premised that (apart from the question whether a particular offence might justify a claim on the Central Government) the following evidence would be desirable for the establishment of a claim :— (1) The claimant’s original representation, setting out the facts, the date of the occurrence, details of the property lost or other damage done, with their estimated value, as well as proof of the claimant’s British nationality. (2) The evidence of any witnesses to the occurrence—muleteer, camelman or others present. (3) The notification made to the local authorities with such correspondence as took place. (4) The notification to His Majesty’s Legation, for inclusion in the annual statement furnished to the Persian Government, or it might be special representation. (5) The sworn deposition of the claimant, if necessary, testifying to the validity of his claim. This numeration is accordingly adopted in the annexed statement of claims in dealing with the evidence furnished. It will be seen that in a great many cases the evidence is defective in one or other of these respects. In general it might be said as regards— (1) We are not always furnished with the precise facts of the case or the precise date of the occurrence; and where a precise date is given it is not always clear whether this is the date of the occurrence or of the claim made; while in no case is there any separate proof of the claimant’s British nationality, apart from his description as such, or (mostly in the case of Orientals) that he is registered in the consulate as such. (2) The evidence of witnesses is mostly wanting; though in the case of the highway robberies mention is sometimes made of the availability of the muleteer to make such a statement, or that his declaration cannot now be traced. (3) The date of notification to the local authority is usually given, but the correspondence which passed is often fragmentary or entirely wanting. (4) The date of notification to the Legation is usually given, but not the correspondence, while the date given appears often to be the final date, after all local remedy had been exhausted. In cases prior to 1911 the Legation archives (which we have here up to the end of 1910) provide some slight additional evidence regarding the action taken at Tehran, but usually the representations made by our Legation to the Persian Government seem to have been of a general character, calling for early settlement of blocks of claims which had arisen in some district without naming them specifically; sometimes the Persian script alone appears, and sometimes the papers are missing from the volumes of correspondence. But most claims arose subsequent to 1910, and in these the Legation furnish no additional correspondence from their archives, though their register (which we have up to 1913) mentions several; in that year a new system was set up under which the Persian Government were supplied annually with a tabular statement of the claims unsettled at the various consulates.45 1 (5) There are but few sworn depositions made by claimants at the time of the occurrence, and some of these are shown to have been lost. At Isfahan and Shiraz especially the consuls seem to have realised in 1925 (when these returns were called for) that it would be well to fortify such evidence as remained in the consulates by getting from the claimants sworn depositions in support. There are a fair number of these late-hour depositions, which would have been better procured at the time of occurrence. In the last-mentioned respect some British firms which subsequently went into liquidation seem to suffer disadvantage from the inability of the liquidators now to furnish sworn depositions as to the ownership and value of the goods formerly robbed, though in other respects the evidence in their case may be as good as in the case of other firms. One such firm—H. C. Dixon and Co., Manchester—has quite a number of claims, and it is noticed that, while some consuls place their claims in category (a), other consuls place them in category (b) on account of the liquidators’ inability to furnish such sworn deposition. There is a noticeable absence of information about insurers’ claims, though in many instances the goods lost seem to have been insured against loss. Lloyds are mentioned once or twice; unnamed insurers are occasionally referred to; and in one extensive robbery of goods belonging to Castelli Brothers, an Italian concern, there is a reference in the Tehran register to a Lloyds’ claim for £220 in 1910. The administrative areas into which Persia was divided furnish instances of claims which were repudiated by one local authority on the ground that the delinquents came from another jurisdiction, while the latter administration burked the claim because the offence was committed outside its authority. In such instances the consuls hold the Central Government responsible, though Shiraz sometimes places the claim in category (b) on this ground alone. It is, of course, apparent that of the 626 claims shown on the lists furnished by the fourteen consulates the loss or destruction of evidence, which it may be assumed was at the time furnished by the various claimants, leaves a very considerable gap; and it may be that some of these claimants—more especially British commercial firms—may yet endeavour to reassert these defective claims, and perhaps furnish additional evidence from their records to replace what has been lost or destroyed. At Kermanshah, e.g., we are told that all the evidence in support of some seventy claims has been destroyed, and at Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas and Bushire similar, if smaller, losses are said to have occurred; while it is evident from the statement of the claims which is attached hereto that a great deal of the original evidence which existed in furtherance of the claims recited is now no longer available. Certain claims by Bahreinis, figuring in the past as British-protected persons, have been omitted in the attached statement, as I gather that we do not now intend to assert their claims against the Persian Government.

(Arising during the War Period, viz., between August 4, 1914, and February 1921.) These claims, like the others, are returned by the various consulates in three separate categories, viz. :— (a) Those they deem supported by adequate evidence.

(War Period.) Most of the important claims arising during the war period (the 4th August, 1914, to February 1921) come from the Legation, and are included in the compilation dealing with the Legation claims; but a fair number, mainly relating to highway robberies, are returned by our consulates, and these are set out in the attached statement. These consulate claims arising during the war period are in general subject to the same observations as those arising out of the war period. These observations might be briefly summarised as follows :— (1) Much of the evidence originally furnished has been lost or cannot now be traced. (2) Not much reliance can be placed on the allocation of the claims to categories (a), (b) or (c), according as the evidence is deemed by our consuls to be respectively conclusive, incomplete or materially lacking. Many claims placed in (a) are sadly lacking in evidence, and there are manifest differences of view among the various consuls as to what may constitute an (a), (b) or (c) claim. Nevertheless, this allocation has been retained in the attached statement, as it represents what the consuls, with their local knowledge, think of the claims. (3) There is a noticeable absence of information about insurers’ claims, although mention is made of several. In the attached statement each set of claims has been arranged chronologically as follows : — Highway robbery (a) claims. Highway robbery (b) claims. Highway robbery (c) claims. The miscellaneous claims follow under the heads of— Burglaries. Evacuations of Persian towns. Murder. Postal losses. Resht disturbances, 1920-21. Shiraz outrages. Theft. Tribal raid. Urumia, depredations in, 1914-18. As regards the highway robbery claims, the country was no doubt in a highly unsettled state during the war period, and it is fairly clear that the Persian Government, during part of this period at any rate, had no adequate control over the disaffected districts. The miscellaneous claims relate to events which are mostly easily identifiable, such as evacuations of Persian towns, local outrages against British subjects, and the like, concerning which other and more definite evidence exists in our records. In dealing with the other sets of claims outside the war period, it was premised that (apart from the question whether a particular claim justified a claim on the Central Government) the following evidence would be desirable for the establishment of a claim :— (1) The claimant’s original representation, setting out the facts, the date of the occurrence, details of the loss or damage done, as well as proof of the claimant’s British nationality.4b (2) The evidence of any witnesses to the occurrence. (3) The notification made to the local authorities, with such correspondence as took place. (4) The notification to His Majesty’s Legation, for inclusion in the annual statement furnished to the Persian Government, or, it might be, special representation. (5) The sworn deposition of the claimant, if necessary, testifying to the validity of his claim. This numeration is accordingly adopted in the annexed statement of the war claims in dealing with the evidence furnished. It will be seen that in many instances the evidence is defective in one or other of these respects. Generally, it might be said as regards— (1) We are not always furnished with the precise facts or the precise date of occurrence; while in no case is there any separate proof of the claimant’s British nationality, apart from his description as such. (2) The evidence of witnesses is mostly wanting. (3) The date of notification to the local authorities is usually given, but the correspondence which passed is often fragmentary or entirely wanting. (4) The date of notification to the Legation is usually given, but not the correspondence. (5) There are but few sworn depositions made by claimants, and what there are have been furnished a good many years after the event, usually to amplify incomplete evidence now available. It seems possible, more especially in the case of British firms, that, where the evidence of the claim is incomplete, these may yet be able to furnish from their records further corroboration of the events for\vhich they claim.(E 67X2/346/34) . earce Higgins* Opinion, '3ec t 21, ISld # Enemy Character of ,hip Tlie 3.3. Kara eniz ^• The letter of the 13th December (1918) from oir M. de Bunsen to the India Office suggests that the pinion of ri.iv. rocurator General might be obtained as to the prospect of the condemnation of the s.s. ’Kara Denis” on the ground of enemy ownership. This case has been before the Bombay !rize ^ourt on several o casions, various witnesses have been examined, and a report of Uie proceedings has been received, which includes an interim judgment of acleod J. delivered on March 11, 1915. The 'Kara Deniz” was on November 13, 1914, seized in Bombay Harbour, and a writ was issued on November 21 asking for condemnation of the ship and goods as lawful prize. The ground of condemnation would appear to be that the ship snd cargo are enemy property. The ship is claimed by Socrates Atychides, who alleges that he is a , ersian subject, that he purchased the ship on ugust 15, 1914, at Constantinople from a Turkish Company called the Seir Jerani Company. The Indian Government Solicitor denies that there was any valid transfer of the shir&gt; before the outbreixk of hostilities between Gre t Britain and Turkey on November 5, 1S14. The claimant gave evidence on February 23, 1915. He is an Orthodox Greek aj d was born in Constantinople, has always resided and carried on business there, and hi s owned ships in p; rtnership with Turks and Germans. He was formerly a Turkish subject but became a iersian subject 3? years before the date whe.. he gave evidence,■hhbmbmhbhm but he haa never b^f*n in eraie ntA *oee ot X ow the leacu^fe. He did not produce his certif c^te of n^tarellseti n but produced a iereian fteenort. Hid ships sin e is nstir- lis tlon fly the Persian flag. He w s natur: Used by perailssl n of the ' irkieh 3ovt. to free Me child en from serv ing in ,he &gt;.ir ish r*?v. He *ent to J Iraeus on *he Hist. CfCtober and appears to h? ye been there wi en war with Turkey Wfia declared, nnd hla wife and f anily arrived there on the 13th. or 14 th. Nov ember. He eald he did t Intend to go bacK to Constantinople aa long es the preserit Goverriraerit ia in power, b 1 1 in eroaa-exsmlnation aaid that all his property w a there, and that he would go baci*c aa soon aa the hirdai elles w opened aa he wanted to look afte hie buaiiieas. oir . de Bunsen points out that the nua ie cast on the claimant of furnishing evidence that he ceased to be a urkiah subject on obtaining naturalisation in eraia iu eonaequence of rt. 6 of th«» Cttoman Nationality .aw of 166^, and that the absence of any act &gt;f a ithoria&gt;%tion of t;.e nat re mentioned it ia probable that he is still of Turkish nationality, an assumption which hi* intimate relations with the eneiay Government supports. This point seems to be a material one ^a regards nationality, but it ia submitted that for the purpose of priae It la not conclusive; what is of importance is the question of domicile, which is the test of enemy character in English i rise Law. The clfcimant undoubtedly htd a Turkish domicile at the time of the alleged purchase of th vessel, his absence from Constantinople ia clearly of a temporsry character, his domicile was therefore an enemy one at the time of the aeleure of hie vessel, and this gives an enemy character to&amp; to the ship and prima facie to the ct^rgo also. The Advocate-Gener 1 presented the issue whether the claimant was at the date of the alleged tr; nsfer and 'of the capture a Persian subject for the purpose of 'Prize Law', but he does not seem to h?ye developed this point, and the main discussion turned on the validity of the transfer before the outbreak of war. In this connection there has been a suggestion of &gt; akiag a payment to T. Vachratoglou for evidence to show the mala fides of the transfer. It apoears to me thBt the point of enemy domicile of the claimant is the vital one; the flag has never been conclusive in English Prize Law. The cases on domicile a e collected in Hall’s International Law (7th.Ed.526 note A following pages). The principle of domicile is laid down in the 1ostilion (Hay A Marriott. 245.I.E/P.C.20), the Vigilantla (I J.Rob.1:1 E.P.C.31) - the United btates Prize Court in the oan Jose Indlano (1814.2 Gall.257) followed the Vigilantia. Story J. said 'a ship is deemed to belong to the country where the 'bwners reside, and if the ship ca ried a neutral flag, 'but the owners reside in a belligerent country, she is 'condemnabla*. As regards the point made under Art.57 of the Declaration of London, the Privy Council has held that this Article is no bar to the Court going behind the flag /The roton .1516.A.C.578). In my opinion therefore there are strong reasons for the belief that the 'Kara Deniz' is liable to con demnation n uhe ground of the enemy character of her allegedalleged owner, the claimant, apart from questions relating to the mala fides of the transfer.

The quest! n then naturally er-iaes what counter-claims we might e pect to meet there. Unles war claims were excluded, perhaps a good many. One however is foreshadowed - th*t of tychidea in the case of the Kara Denis ' for which seemingly some £900,000 is claimed. The figure is fantastic and exceeds everything we could claim. In 1921 ( tate rs:ers.oxll.764) the i ersian Government appear to have been willing to consider waiving claims for damage done by British troops in Persia as against our waiver of claims for the coBt of maintenance of those troops; but thi seems to have fallen through* Now, in iir . Hotre's vie (Tehran n, ual He ort, 1933.p.8d) they would agree to exclude war claims, but not th^t of tychides, which they regard £*8 a counter to our ot er claims, and, in the event of the claims question not being settled by treaty, might take to the League of nations. This case then forms a stumbling-block, and it seems desirable to examine it further to see whet we might huve to f&amp;ce in dealing with it. The early fncts are set out in the 0 in on n the c* se (annexed; given on December 21, 1918, by Professor hearce Hig ins, then Adviser in International Law and / rise Law in the Procurator General’s Department, and the rest can be gathered from the Judgments pronounced by the Prise Court and the Privyprivy Council* The etory told there is that of * Turk* , tychldee* who* shortly before the war* became natur lieed Into a country ( ersia * where he had never lived* and of which he did not know the language; who said he was allowed to lo so by the Tur ish Govt, to free his children from serving in the Turkish rmyf who* on being granted release fro.a Turkish nationelity* was pernitted to remain and carry on his shining business at Constantinople* on con dition of being treated as a Turkish subject; who had been in partnership there with urks and Germans in the ownership of vessels; and whose vesi-els were* both before and after the outbreak of war* in the service of the Turkiah Cover, meat, engaged in the tr^, sport of troops* &lt; n ugust 15, 1914* he bought the 'Kra Denis 4 ’ a Turkish ship of 5GoO tons* then on a voyage to Bombay* with the intention of tr naferring her to the Persian flag (presumably like his other vessels at Constantinople); she arrived at Bombay on August 19, flying the Turkish flag, with a Turkish master and crew* but without a ship’s register, and was seized there shortly after Turkey entered the war; in Court his evidence showed that he did not in end to abandon his con ercial domicile at Constantinople* and that he had pre-arranged that the vessel (now re-named ’’Hamsdan*) sdould proceed to a Turkiah port* Basra* though he could assign no good reason for sending her there* The delay of the ship at Bombay was due to several causes* of which the only one that appears to concern us was that due to the tr nsfer of flag* sine: the Indian G ?vern- raent olicitor denied that there wes any valid transfer ofmmmbmh m of the ship before the outbreak of war with Turkey oa hove nber 6, 1914. This atory bears the a^rearance of a device, framed la prospect of Turkey being a war, designed to defeat the capture of vessels plying or in,ended to oly in Turkish service, ni this aspect of it engaged the atten tion of those who hud to deal with the cae . The ' eclarbtion &gt;f ondon rder in Council (No.^) 1914 ,, wee operative at the time of capture, tad its provisions had a bearing. There appears to h ve be&lt; 5 ii three considered jrounds for condeT.Uiation;- (1, a transfer before the outbreak of hostilities not .?itain tiio benefit of reticle 55 of the Declarati n of Londons not within tiie benefit of reticle 55 of the (2) a tr . 8fer yitl«tea by rafal# fidee dlsentitUng the vessel to sny benefit of rtiole 67 of the Declaration of Londons (3 the continued enemy commercial domicile of the owner. The Bombay jrise Jourt apeare in the first instance to have concerned itself mainly with (2), but, after receiving dr. } earce higgins’ Opinion on the case, it pronounced condemnation in terms of (3) in its .Judgment of June 9, ^annexed), with » ae hesitation as regards (£}, since it left this MflMtteft open. But the Op in on mentioned went further than t/iis, for in citing the case of the 'Proton” Floyds .rize Oases.vii.808) as justifying the «ses,Hi. Court in going behind the flag to ascertain the real facts of ownership, it held that the enemy character of the owner sufficed for condemnation, apart from questions of mala fides of transfer. The rivy Council on the appeal, while regarding the question at issue as one 'of fact'fact , appear to have given eoneltferation to both eidlea of the matter, since, la their Judgment of July 6, 192^ x x (aleq^ B.A C Pri*^ Gases 111.1070) {■loyds Prize Cases.y.368) the se^e Judges who h d pro- noimced on the 'iroton* case reviewed at conoid rable length tychides* previous activities arid associations f t Constantinople, his continuing coa jercial domicile there, and his intended despatch of the vessel for no good reason to a Turkish port, aid «rew from these the conclusion that he eonti ued to act exactly as before*. They then proceeded to their finding that 'there is no ground whatever for interfering with tne condemnation 'pronounced by the „hief Justice of Bombay . The positi n might be conceived thus:- a tychides * previous history and »S8ociati;,ns, and the other factors mentioned shove, rendered him in any case an object of grave suapici n. His continuing eoiamercial domicile in an enemy coon ry marked him definitely as of enemy character in Prize Law, and his vessel on th* t round conde finable, unless exempt on any other. Under rticle 67 (qualified by rticle 65) of the Declaration of London the vessel, assuming it to be in reality entitled to fly the Persian flag, was to be regarded as neutral, unless it was proved that the tr nsfer was made to evade the consequences to which an enemy vessel as such is exposed, and certain tests were provided. The case of the 'proton' however demonstrated that it w s the duty of the captor to consider the facts in evidence in order to ascertain what the character of the vessel really was, nd that if it a neared she was only nominally owned by a neutral, but in reality by an enemy sheshe was not protected from condemnation, although she might be entitled to fly a neutral flag* ^.tyohides being a person of enemy character in pris&amp;e Law, his vessel fell under this head, and in recording their view that 'he 'continued to act exactly as before' the privy Council no doubt regarded the transfer as of mala fid^s and as made to evade the consequences to which an enemy vessel as such is exposed* The case of the 'Proton' being the leading one in this connection, it is of interest to note professor Pearce Higgin8 , comment upon it in an introductory Chapter he wrote to a reoent work 'A Treatise on the Law of 'Prise' (by C*J* Colombos, 1926)* Speaking there of the iaaora , Hakan and 1roton , he says:- 'In the two latter 'the Iftrlse Court expressly declined to enforce provisions 'of the declaration of ,ondoa, which they held were 'not in conformity with International Law; these 'decisions ultimately led the Oovemment to withdraw the ')rders in Council bringing into operation the declaration 'of London* Incidentally they showed •.•*.. in tne 'Proton that the rule for determining the enemy character 'of a ship laid down by the joeclarati in of London 'was contrary to the unbroken practice of the British 'and American Prise Courts, and could not be construed 'as a mitigation of belligerent rights in conformity 'with the principle laid down in the Samora Judgment”. The divergence would seem however to be Less in tne intent of Article t&gt;H of the Leolaration of Ciondon, as expressed in the first sentence of it, than in the tests provided in the remaind r of it, which, accordingto Professor pearoe Higgins, the privy Council held 'were not in conformity with International Law', i*e. as beinsr in excess of the requirements of the latter. further light ie thrown by the judgment of the Privy Council in the ease of the 'Hakan' (B. &amp; C. prise Cases.li.483), which, though differing in character, raised the same question. There It is said ’’The ’Declaration of London has, however, no validity as an 'international agreement. It was, it is true, provided 'by the ^rd^r in Council of October £9, 1914, that during 'the present hostilities its provisions should, with 'certain very material modif icat i &gt;ns, be adopted and put 'in force; but the prize Court cannot, in deciding 'questions between His Majesty’s Government and neutrals, 'act upon this Order, except in so far aa the Declaration 'of London, as modified by the order, either embodies the 'international law or contains a waiver in favour of 'neutrals of the strict rights of the Crown. It is 'necessary therefore to consider the International law 'with regard to the condemnation of a ship for carrying 'contraband, *part from the Declaration of L ndon'. The next point relates to the delay of the vessel at Bombay prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey on November b, 1914. Here however we have no need to express any opinion, for the privy Council have done this very plainly for us in their Judgment• They aay 'Counsel/'Cotmael Iranfcly aaoiitted that tha oaae must bo, not that 'tnore was lilogai benaviour on the part of the port 'officials, but that tney acted unreasonably in exercising 'legal rights for a long time instead of accepting 'the representation diplomatically made on behalf of 'the claimant; and it was contended that the object was 'the indirect one of getting an opportunity of condemning ' a Persian vessel as Turkish, if war should break out 'between Great Britain and Turkey. 4 charge of bad 'faith like that, which haa never been investigated, still 'less supported, is one as to which it is unnecessary to 'say anything further'. *n6 again, 'It may be that if 'the ship had been released in the prize proceedings, 'he (Atyehldes) might have a claim for something of the 'kind, but what claim in prize he ooulo have as an 'alternative to a claim for the release of the vessel and 'consistently with her condemnation doss not appear 'If he has any such rights he should prosecute them in 'Bombay'. It would seem difficult In any case to separate an apportion delays which are divisible between that which might be regarded as the ordinary and necessary stay of any particular weasel in port, that due to the casualties to her machinery which befel the 'Kara lent*' and would have delayed her departure in any event, and that oaueed by the requirements of the Indian authorities as regards the transfer of flag of a ship which appears to have arrived with ut any proper equipment in this respect, or, for the matter of that, &gt;f Turkish registry, though otherwise documented as a Turkish vessel. Buttt is olaar that if Atyohidas th u^ht ha had any k round of oomplaint on the lattsr scoru, this was a matter or datezinination before the India n Courts at that time, and hia own neglect or unwillingnaas than to uae the means open to him, now &gt;uta him out or court. For this no ault can be attributed to a yone but himself. hether an aroitral tribunal, if the &gt;olnt were urged before them, might be inclined to follow an example of the recent AAglo~Amerloan Claims Commission in the case of one btudei, and auggeet that a further opportunity might be afforded him to do so, is perhaps however a feasibility. The next point is one of oo :sidsrable importance, vis:- whether we oan sub; it one of our rize Court Judg ments in the late war to arbitration. There is no obligation to auh it our &gt;rize Court Judgments to such s review, and on general grounds it would doubtless be undeeiraole to do so. u ther, the terms of our accessions both to the optional Clause of the rotoeol establishing the ennanent Court of T ntwrnatiooal tice (which Persia appears also to have accepted) and to the League General Act of bepteraler £6, 1918 i or the Faelfie Settlement of International Dlaputea (.which ersia appears not to have ac eptad) exores ly exclude all disputes of earlier ci^te. lodern practice appears to show that no country, short of compulsion, would con sent to submit its rize Court Judgments to arbitration. reiusud at least two such requests in the late war, and to reopen this ease would seeni to involve us in oontrauktion with what we said there, and expose us to risk of reopening others. AtychideAtyoftldoa hlme*l • appears to be a shady character undeaeryln.| of oonaideration, and va are oonoomed with ts e facts a &gt;d eiicumata eea of the case alone. Aa reg rds these, we have the Judgment o our hi heat Judi cial Authorities administering international law, reY^al— ing him as o an enemy dharactar and ausoc atlon aueh as in their estimation fully to warrant the condemnat on or hia ship in international law; a seeming setting aside by those Judicial Authorities, as not in coifomulty with international law, oi curtain tests provided by the un- ratii led ec3aration of L ndon (t ough it does ot seem roui the Judgment o the orabay x ise Court that Atyohidea ever even lullillea the^e tuats}; and an objection, foimded ot o ily Oh principle out on the actual tens ot our Aocesaio is t the r nty ins irusients or the League of hat one concerning Arbi wratlon* to the sub&lt;uiasion of our .rise Court Judgments to any arbitral procedure.

Dixon's motor boat with parts of the machinery belonging to the “Kara Deniz“ was sunk in Bombay harbour on the 18th September 1914. (2) ihe ship's machinery that was sunk consisted of ^a) a steam valve chest (one of the boiler connections which contains one cock and two valves) and (b) nine pet valves, ihe vessel could have gone to sea without this machinery as it only meant that she would have had one boiler less in use. (3) The exact date of replacement of the machinery*is not known but it appears that it was replaced some weeks after the sinking of Messrs. Dixon's motor boat on the 18th September 1914. (4) if the question of exchange of ownership had been dropped at any time after the 6th September 1914, the vessel would have been given port clearance, if applied for, on production of a valid Turkish Certificate of registry and provided that war had not been declared on Turkey.(5) &amp; (6) Un no occasion was an application made at the ^ort Office by the Oaptain or dhirazi to clear the 'Kara Deniz' to sea and there was no reason for either of them to suppose that the vessel would be stopped irom sailing had they produced her certificate ot registry* As regards points 5 and v6) above, i am to add, however, that it appears from the letter ^secret) of the I'ort Officer, hombsy, jmo. 660/41, dated the 5th November 1914 (copy enclosed), that on the 22nd August 1914, the Acting Ottoman Consul general at hornbay intimated to the rort Officer that the 'Kara Ceniz' had arrived on the 19th idem in Bombay narbour without the Ship's register, which the Captain had written for from Constantinople where it had been left behind* In the meantime the consul General requested that the vessel should, on payment of I'ort dues, be allowed 'to be entered m the Customs house for inward and outward c leara nce '* It would also appear that the question of change of nationality of the ship was brought to the notice of the Captain by the hort Officer on the 26th September 1914, and that the former calle d on the hort Officer and was advised on the 28th idem to cable to Constantinople for his register, which he agreed to do* icurs sincerely, Bd/- h.

Point (2).-- From Messrs, dixon’s letter No. F.O. 96, dated the 21st September 1914, to Captain Murad of the 'Kara deniz' (copy enclosed), it will be seen that the ship's machinery that was sunk consisted of (a) a steam valve chest (one of the boiler con nections which contains one cock and two valves), and (b) nine pet valves: And in the concluding portion of paragraph 3 of his letter No. 1101/41, dated the 18th February 1915 (vide copy attached) to the Solictor to Government, Bombay, the iDrt Officer has stated that the vessel could have gone to sea without this machinery, it only meant that she would have had one boiler less in use. ihis office is also of the opinion that the machinery parts which were sunk with the launch were not essential for the sail ing of the vessel. Point (3).-- The exact date is not known but from para^aph 2 of the Port Officer's letter No. 1101/41, dated the 18th February 1915, to the Solicitor to Government (vide copy attached) it would appear that it was replaced some weeks after the sinking of the Motor Boat on the 18th September 1914.

With reference to para. 3 of my letter No.359/41, dated 19th September 1914 I was under the impression when making this statement that the piece of machinery lost in the sinking of the Motor boat could not be re placed in Bombay but this appears to have been a mistake on ray part - the vessel could have gone to sea without this piece of machinery, it was not of such importance to | have delayed her departure till a new one was fitted, it only meant she would have had one boiler less inuse. 4.

''Kara Deniz'. We have received from the Foreign Office a letter, of which a copy is enclosed, raising a number of points which we do not appear, with the information available in this Office, to be able to answer. I should be grateful therefore if you xQuld^be* good enough to have the matter looked into / further and let us know whether you are able to shed any light on the questions which the Foreign Office would like to have answered. A spare copy of the 'Diary of Events' referred to in para. 4 of the Foreign Office letter is enclosed. A copy of our letter to the Foreign Office of the 16th April 1928 was forwarded to the Government of India with our letter of the 13th April No. S. &amp; 0.2322/28. 4794 5000 5.36tm FOREIGN Oi*F 20 th Ju! (E 4494/4494/34) 3^ My dear Clauson, I should he most grateful if you would pass this letter, which deals with the detention at Bombay in 1914 of a ship owned by a naturalised Persian subject named Atychides, and called the ''Kara Deniz' or ' , Hamadan' , , to the appropriate department of the India Office. The last letter from the India Office to the Foreign Office on the subject is - so far as I am aware - No. E. &amp; 0. 8269/32 of the 7th December, 1932. 2. This ship was at Bombay when war broke out with Turkey in 1914 and was subsequently condemned as a prize on the ground that it was of Ottoman ownership. The owner has ever since had a/ # M. J. Clauson, Esq,a claim against His Majesty’s Government on tne ground that the ship was really a Persian snip, and that in any case the only reason why it was at Bombay at the time and could therefore be condemned as a prize was that it had been wrongfully detained there in the period preceding the outbreak of war. This claim, which constitutes a formidable obstacle to our taking any really energetic action in support of our own claimants has the support of the Persian Government and though they have not pressed it lately we can never be quite sure it is absolutely dead. If it were revived, and if tne Persians could contrive any means of bringing it to arbitration, our legal advisers think that we snould probably lose. There is fortunately no way we can see in whicn the Persians could force us to arbitrate, but even so the large sum at stake (something like £900,000, including loss of earnings) makes it desirable that we should take every step that is/is possible to collect information bearing on the claim before the passage of time makes it more difficult than ever to do so. 5. It is for this reason that I am writing to ask whether it would be possible to obtain certain information on the lines indicated below. 4. Attached to this letter is a diary of events regarding the stay of the ’'Kara Deniz' at Bombay compiled from the 'Proceedings of the 'Prize Division of the High Court at Bombay in '1914-1915' (a document which I borrowed from the India Office about eighteen months ago and now return herewith) and from the enclosures to India Office letter E. &amp; 0. 2322/28 of the 16th April, 1928. On the basis of this diary, it appears that the following details (all relevant to the question whether or not the vessel was ever entirely unable to sail owing to the loss of parts of its machinery and if so whether its Captain ever/ever definitely applied for clearance, and was refused, before it became incapacitated), are lacking: (1) On what date did Messrs. Dixon's launch sink ? (2) Of what did the ship's machinery that was sunk consist and was it absolutely essential for the sailing of the vessel ? (3) At what date was the machinery eventually replaced ? (4) If the Captain had dropped the question of exchange of ownership at any time after September 6th, and asked for clearance as a Turkish vessel, would this have been allowed ? (the point is not entirely clear notwithstanding entries under August 22nd and September 4th). (5) If so, was this ever made clear to the Captain and/or Shirazi ?(6) On what date did Captain first definitely apply for clearance ? Subject to these elements of doubt. the position is probably as follows:- 6. The Captain did not try to sail before the 6th September and in all probability nox before the 26th September, when he produced a certificate of change of ownership from the Persian Consul* Before the 26th September, and perhaps even before the 6th September, some important parts of the 8hip*s machinery had been lost and were not expected to be replaced before the middle of November. These parts were possibly of sufficient importance to prevent the ship sailing, even if the permission of the authorities were obtained. 7 The following are some opinions expressed in the past by Government Departments in this country on the question of the ship’s detention. I only summarise them here for convenience: (a) It is generally agreed that until the Persian Consul gave his certificate (on September/— September 25/26th) the Port authorities were justified, in the absence of the Register, in refusing clearance. (b) If the loss of the macnineiy merely invalidated the vessel's technical seaworthiness, this alone would not have justified the Government of India in detaining her, as their powers in this respect applied only to British ships. (Admiralty) (c) As regards the position after the issue of this certificate the United Kingdom Customs suggest that in similar circumstances they might have made the absence of a Register an excuse for detaining a suspicious ship. (d) The Treasury Solicitor, however, is of the opinion that the Port Officer acted incorrectly in insisting on the production of the Register once he nad seen the Persian Consul's certificate. 8. If it were possible to obtain the answer to the questions in paragraph 4 above without too much difficulty, I think it would be a/”1 ^050 L a good thing if* this were done since every year that passes will make it more difficult to obtain this information if it were ever needed. I do not suggest that any deep research is called for, but it is possible that the reports upon which the India Office letter E. &amp; 0. 2322/28 of the 16th April 1928 was based may have contained information which was not passed on but which may furnish the answers. If they do not do so, it is hardly worth while delving further into the past unless and until the claim is again taken up. I may add tha-c we fortunately have a line of defence in the failure of the captain or the agent of the vessel to exhaust their legal remedies at Bombay in 1914 (see enclosure to the India Office letter quoted in the first paragraph ). But even so it seems desireole to make our defence on other issues as watertight as possible.Idaiy of certain events relatiag to the detention of the S.S, M Kara Deaig' at . ombay in 1914 &gt; (Based on the w^ceedings of the Prize Division of the High Court at Bombay in 1914 - 1916 and enclosures to India Office, letter in '1.4405/595/570 (1928)) 1914.

( 1934 , 20th Noveirfber ,~19S4-r--' Dear Dibdin, May I ask you to refer to India Office letter E &amp; 0 8269/32 of December 7th, 1932, about the claim of M.Atychides for the detention of his ship the ’’Kara Deniz’' at Bombay in 1914. This letter encloses a copy of a letter of November 17th 1932 from the Government of India, which in its turn had two enclosures, the first being the report of the Prize Court proceedings concerning the ’’Kara Deniz” and the second an extract from a letter from the Government of Bombay. The India Office letter to the Foreign Office states that the first enclosure is not included ’’since it is ’’understood that you do not require it” . I am now, however, engaged in studying certain aspects of the Atychides case, and would find it very useful if I could see the Proceedings, which I fancy may be in the form of a volume. As/'jJt. 1450/34 (E 355/346/34) Important FOREIGN OFFICE, S.Yf.l 1st March, 1934 My dear Gilbert, 1 send you herewith copies of correspondence exchanged with Hoare on the subject of the draft claims article and protocol in the Anglo-Persian treaty, and the bearing of the Atychides claim on this draft. 2. As time is short, we felt justified in sending off our reply, which merely states our own views, withour consulting you beforehand. Hoare, as you will see, has not yet been authorised to broach the question with the Persians, but is is of course very desirable that he should at the earliest moment be given the word '’go', and 1 should therefore be grateful if you would let me know as soon as possible whether you concur. Owing to arrangements which we recently made with the Dominions Office, it will no longer be necessary to aelay action pending the consent of each separate Dominion to the wording proposed for the claims draft; the Dominions will merely be informed of the gist of the draft, and told that we are going ahead on this basis. Consequently, all that is now required before we authorize Hoare to adopt the draft definitively is your concurrence, and the Treasury 1 s, in the minor alterations referred to in paragraph 7 of the despatch to him. And of these alterations, the only one of substance is that which comprises the deletion of the words were directly due to those circumstances and n M from paragraph 1 of the treaty article. Our which reasons for recommending this deletion are given in the despatch; the matter has been gone into very carefully by our legal advisers, who now feel that it would be impracticable to attempt to draw a distinction between those war claims J.G.Laithwaite, Esq ( T, other/('other than those arising out of contractual obligations') which were directly due to war conditions, and those which were not.

Sir, 1 have the honour to inform you that a certain Ali Khan Muqtadir, a young Persian who might be described as a 'lobbyist' 1 , recently called upon the Oriental Secretary in order to inform him that Monsieur Socrates Atychides was new in Tehran. Monsieur Atychides, as you are aware, has a claim against His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom (or the Government of India) for a sum of about nine hundred thousand pounas on account of the detention and subsequent condemnation as apprize of his ship, the 'Kara Deniz' at Bombay in 1914. This claim last formed the subject of corresponaence between your department and the Legation in the autumn of 1932, when the Persian Government who support the claim on the ground that Monsieur Atychides, an Ottoman subject by origin, became a naturalised Persian subject in 1911, announced their intention of bringing it to the notice of the League of Nations. They did not, however, put this intention into effect (see Mr. Rendel’s letter E 6136/208/34 of December 7th, 1932). 2. Ali Khan Muqtadir states that Monsieur Atychides, who is now about sixty years of age, had come to Tehran, bringing all his documents with him, with the object of pressing his claim. He had deputed Muqtadir to sound the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The latter had done so and had been told that the Atychides claim was to appear among the Persian claims which would come up for settlement when the outstanding questions between the British and Persian Governments were brought to a head. It was hoped that this would be in about two / The Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc., The Foreign Office.two months 1 time. The iersian Government were prepared, in the last resort, to take the case to the League of Nations, and they felt confident that if this was done their case was so strong that they would certainly win and obtain very large damages. But they wished, for the moment, to have this claim as a counter-weight to the claims which the British Government were making against the Persian Government Muqtadir said (in strict confidence) that his informant was Shayesteh, the head of the European and American Section at the Ministry. 3. Monsieur Atychides had come to Tehran this time at the expense of a French financial group, which was hoping to make use of his claim to do business with Persia. They had arranged with Atychides to pay him thirty per cent of the profits realised from the claim, the remainder going to the French group, which would then come to an agreement with the Persian Government to provide them free with eight freight steamers to be used in developing the trade of Persia through the port of Bander Shahpur. 4. Atychides was, however, tired of the delay in the settlement of the claim and Muqtadir thought that he could be induced to offer to come to terms with His Majesty’s Government independently. He did not know on what terms he would negotiate, but he proposed to ask him to state definite terms. In that case Monsieur Atychides would would doubtless write a letter to the Legation setting forth those terms. 5. Ali Khan Muqtadir has been informed that I have no desire to receive any offer from Monsieur Atychides. All the same, his information throws valuable light upon the intentions of the Persian Government and I venture in the following paragraphs to offer some observations upon the position regarding the claims article in the general treaty negotiations/3 . negotiations, 6. The question of excluding the Atychides claim from consideration under the treaty is not so simple as it has seemed hitherto. The refusal of the Persian Government to entertain 'war' claims is contained in two letters from Firuz Mirza, the Minister of Finance, to the Imperial Bank of Persia, dated January 22nd and April 29th, 1929, about the claims of the Bank against the Persian Government for losses suffered during the war, and may also have been asserted orally in the course of the negotiations. At any rate, during the last two years the Foreign Office and the Legation have been intent on devising a formula for the claims article which shall exclude all claims arising out of the war from consideration by any claims tribunal which may be set up under the treaty, partly out of deference to Persian prejudice on the point and partly in order to exclude the Atychides claim. But this formula, the exact wording of which is still under discussion, has never been presented to the Persian Goverment. When it is presented, they can hardly fail to seize its implications, and it seems likely that their views on 'war' claims will then undergo a violent change. 7. They would probably start by trying to secure such a definition of claims classified as 'war 11 claims (and therefore excruded) as would restrict them to those which arose out of events taking place in Persia during the period when the Government was precluded by the presence of foreign troops from exercising full control over her territory (the incapacity of the Government being conveniently ignored). 8. If this attempt failed, the Persian Government would perhaps agree to submit claims of all kinus to the claims commission, relying upon the commission when it came to the point to accept their contention that they were not morally or legally responsible for claims arising out of events which occurred/—'*• occurred during the occupation of Persian soil by foreign troops. 9. 1 should then apparently be obliged to tell them (see Lord Monteagle’s letter E 1776/642/34 of April 11th, 1929, to Sir Robert Clive) that it must be understood that no prize cases could be submitted to the commission. The Persian Government would presumably respond by declining to have a claims article in the treaty at all, or else by suggesting an article washing out all claims on either side. 10. If this last suggestion were accepted it would mean that the chances, such as they were, of securing payment for the British claimants, some of whom at any rate have claims which are good both morally and legally, had been surrendered in order to avoid a counter-claim which is either (a) good or (b) bad. If the counter-claim is good the British claimants would (whether they realised the fact or not) be in the position of having paid for its withdrawal: in other words of having made their fellow tax-payers a present of many thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of pounds. If it is bad, they would not even have tills vicarious consolation; their interests would have been sacrificed to no purpose. 11. if, hov/ever, the suggestion of a mutual waiver were refused, each side would be free to pursue its claims as best it could. The Persian Government might then take the Atychides case to the League of Nations. So far as the prize law issue was concerned, 1 understand that His Majesty’s Government could refuse to submit to a fresh investigation on the ground that the case had been heard by British courts applying international law and was chose jugee . But the question of the detention of the ’’Kara Leniz” at Bombqy prior to the outbreak of war with Turkey on November 5th, 1914, might not be so easy to explain, and this, with Monsieur Atychides’/5 . Atycliides 1 arrest in Bombay in 1917, might end in adverse decision (compare the case of Monsieur Chevreau). At any rate, the League might ask His Majesty’s Government and the Persian Government to consult together, on the analogy of the Finnish Ships case, with a view to ascertaining whether Monsieur Atychides had exhausted his legal remedies at Bombay. 12. In any case, His Majesty's Government would presumably be bound to insist, whatever doubts they might have as to the validity of some of theBritish claims, that the League took up the claims of both sides together. This again wouia probably end in compromise, that is, a waiver all round, and in this case 1 suppose it is not impossible that there might be some political agitation from, for example, the Persian Railway Syndicate or the Manchester Chamber of Commerce (for Messrs. Ziegler and Company) for compensation from His Majesty’s Government. In any case, the ultimate result could be no worse and might even be slightly better if a claims article admitting all manner of claims to arbitration were accepted in the first place, unless indeed the Atychides claim is in reality a sound one and all the British claims unsound. 13. 1 understand that the detention of the ’’Kara Deniz” at Bombay can be explained in a manner that would probably satisfy an international tribunal, although the archives of the Legation do not disclose what this explanation is. I suppose there were also good grounds for the detention of Monsieur Atychides himself in Bombay in 1917, after he had arrived there with the permission of the authorities in India, and for the other matters set forth by Monsieur Atychides in his printed memorial to the King of November 17th, 1923. If, hov/ever, full information on these points is not already available, 1 venture, at the risk of intruding into /X 6. into mo.tters which are not my concern, to suggest that tie iullest possible details should be collected regarding the events at Bombay of 1914 and 1917 - 1919. My excuse for so doing must be the importance which this case is likely to play in the treaty negotiations and the immense expenditure m which His Majesty’s Government would be involved if the claim were found to be valid. 14. so far as the archives of the Legation are concerned, it would be useful if 1 might receive (1) the judgments (and the full proceedings also, if readily availed le) of the trize Court at Bombay in 1915 and the Privy Council in 1922, and of the Court (1 am not clear whether it was a Prize Court or not) before which Monsieur Atychides appeared at Bombay in 1919, as being of general interest, and (2) the India Office letter with the report about the detention of the 'Kara Deniz ,, referred to in the enclosure to Lord Monteagle’s private letter to Sir Robert Clive already quoted in paragraph 9, with any other information on this point, as being of essential interest. 15. 1 am sending copies of this despatch to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India (No. 262). 1 have, etc., (Sd.) R.H.Hoare.A 0^ FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 22nd February, 1934. No. 95 (E 355/346/34) Sir, 1 have given careful consideration to your despatch No.609 of the 29th December last regarding the claim of Monsieur Socrates Atychides against His Majesty's Government, and the bearing of this claim on the general question of the claims article and protocol in the draft Anglo-Persian general treaty. 2. The question is of such complexity, and involves so many uncertain factors, that it is not my wish to express at this stage a final opinion as to the best course to pursue. Subject, however, to any further observations which you may wish to offer, it appears to me that on the available information the balance of advantage still lies with an attempt to secure the barring of ail claims relating to the war period: and that consequently it will be preferable not to abandon untried the provisional draft given on pages 25 and 26 cf the annex to my despatch No. 50 of the 25th January, although that draft will probably require modifica tion eventually in the minor respects dealt with in paragraph 7 below. 3. The question can best be considered under two mam heads:- (1) setting aside for the moment the probable reactions of the Persian Government, is the barring of war claims intrinsically desirable from the point of view of His Majesty's Government? (2) I3 there any prospect of securing the Persian Government's acceptance of a clause barring such claims? 4. 1 will deal with (2) first. From the outset of the h discussions regarding the claims article, it appears to have Sir Reginald Hoare, KC.,MC., etc., etc., etc., Tehran.been generally assumed that the Persian Government would themselves raise strong objection to any wording which did not bar claims relating to the war period. This view seems to h^ve been held strongly by Sir hobert Clive when the drafting of the article was first considered in detail during his leave 01 absence in this country, and at that time there was indeed little doubt as to the attitude of the Persian Government, which was suificiently indicated in the two letters (to which you reier), irom Firuz Mirza to the Imperial Bank of Persia. These letters appear to constitute the only positive pronouncement ever made by qualified representatives of the Persian Government on this subject. In more recent times you have, 1 understand, derived the impression that the Persian Government have been concocting a series of counter-claims against His Majesty^ Government, th^bulk of which presumaoly relate to the war period; and still more recently All Khan Muqtaair, the Persian intermediary mentioned in your despatch No. 609, has intimated, quoting the authority of Monsieur Shayesteh, that the Persian Government intend to make use of the M Kara Deniz” claim as a counter-weight to the claims of His Majesty’s Government against themselves. There are, however, at least three possible explanations of the Persian Government's apparent preoccupation with war claims: they may genuinely hope to reach a detailed settlement of all the outstanding claims of both parties (inclusive of those relating to the war period), calculating that, on balance, the settlement would be financially advantageous to them; or they may hope that the mere marshalling of their real or fictitious counter-claims for the war period will induce His Majesty's Government to agree to a general renunciation of all claims on both sia.es; or, again, they may simply hope by this means to persuade His Majesty's Government to agree to the waiver of the wax claims on both sides. The last of .hese three hypotheses/3. hypotheses seems as probable as the other two, but for the present no certainty is attainable on this score, and the Persian attituue remains an unknown factor. It may be, as you suggest in paragraph 6 of your despatch, that when the actual wording of the claims article comes to be discussed, the Persian Government’s views will undergo a violent change. You will appreciate, however, that the possibility of such a change is not in itself a compelling reason for abandonging in advance a draft which commends itself on other grounds. 5. As regards the intrinsic desirability from the point of view of His Majesty’s Gov ernment of barring the war claims, the main considerations governing the question (apart from the evident desirability of barring, if possible, the Atychides claim, with which 1 will deal more fully below), appear to be as follows. While in theory a reference of outstanding claims to the neutral claims commission might prove unnecessary, in practice it would almost certainly be impossible to settle them by the alternative method provided in the provisional draft article and protocol, namely direct negotations with the Persian Government within a period of one year from the entry into force of the treaty. If, however, the war claims of both parties were submitted to the Claims Commission for which the Treaty article provides, it would clearly be impossible to avoid much public discussion concerning the violation of Persian neutrality by belligerent forces during the war. Any such discussion would inevitably be highly embarrassing, and would be undesirable on general political grounds. liorever, it would in all probability influence the neutral arbiters strongly in favour of the rejection of all or most at the British claims for the war period, while admitting the bulk of the Persian counter-claims. As regards the latter point, it is true that as yet the Persian Government have presented but few claims against His } Maj esty's /v- A 4 . Majesty's Goveriiment, and that the British claims article and protocol, as provisionally drafted, but not yet discussed with the Persian Government, contains a limiting clause providing that only those claims shall be dealt v/ith which were presented to the other party before the 2s t January, 1^28. it is, however, only reasonable to assume that if, as you anticipate, the Persian Government press for the omission of the clause barring war claims, they will press withi equal insistence for the omission of this limiting clause, which would automatically rule out the claims which they are believed to be concocting at the present time. 6. To sum up, therefore, the general position appears to be that (1) it is definitely in the interests of His Majesty's Government, tor reasons of which the existence of the Atychides case is not the most important, to secure if possible the barring cf the war claims; and (2) the attitude of the Peisian Government is still by no means clear. V. As indicated in paragraph 13 of my despatch No.50, 1 am not yet in a position to authorise the definitive adoption of any text of the claims article and protocol. But lor the reasons set forth above, and subject to any observations which you may wish to offer after perusal of the present despatch, 1 contemplate the eventual adoption of thetext given on pages 25 and 26 of the annex to my despatch No. 50, with the following amendments, which further consideration oi the question has now shown to be desirable (a) the words ' were directly due to those 'circumstances and which ' should be omitted from paragraph (1) of the draft treaty article. The phrase was oi course designed to exclude from the scope of the general barrer clause a variety of claims which have no real connexion with/5 . with war conditions. in theory such a distinction is a reasonable one, but I have reached the conclusion that in practice the phrase would inevitably provoke endless argument, and would, in particular, give rise to the type of public discussion of war-time events in Persia which, as already explained in paragraph 5 above, it is so desirable on general political grounds to prevent. it seems better, therefore, to abandon definitely all war claims other than those in respect of contractual obligations. (b) In paragraph 2 of the treaty article the words 'the competent authorities of n should be inserted before 'the other High Contracting party'. This addition appears desirable in view of the lact that apparently certain of the less important British claims presented by His Majesty's Consular Officers to the provincial Persian authorities were never included in tie recapitulatory lists of claims presented from time to time by His Majesty's negation to the Central Persian Government. (c) Article 8 of the Protocol or Annex should be redrafted as follows:- 'The written proceedings of the tribunal shall be in Ihe French language, but the Agents and Counsel appointed by the respective High Contracting parties shall be permitted to plead in their own language, their speeches being translated into French if and when necessary.' in suggesting the adoption of the foregoing draft 1 have assumed that the Persian Govenmient would be averse, for reasons of amour propre , from a provision to the effect that the proceedings before the Tribunal should be in English and French. ' This, however, would, clearly be the most practical solution, and an attempt might be maue in the first place to secure its acceptance unless you consider the attempt foredoomed to failure. 8. In expressing myself against the abandonment, at the present stage, of the proposed clause barring war claims, I have not overlooked your conjecture that the claims of Monsieur/&amp; I 1 || s If - j • (3 6 . konsieur Atychid.es may prove a serious stumbling-block when, as a result of detailed treaty discussions, it is realized by the Persian Government that this claim would be barred by the existing draft. This conjecture is, 1 recognise all too likely to be borne out by events. I consider, however, that the situation which would then arise, while full of difficulty, would be unlikely to follow exactly the lines suggested in your despatch under reply and would probably not, therefore, justily the adoption of the solution which you propose. If, as you suggest, the Persian Government had it in their power to bring about the liquidation of this claim by the mere act rex erring it to the League of Nations, there would certainly be advantages in allowing it to be brought before the claims commission provided for in the treaty article, especially if i-iiis could be done without abandoning the clause barring war claims in general. In point of fact, however, while an attempt on the part at the Persian Government to bring this claim before the League ql Nations would undoubtedly be embarrassing and unwelcome, it is by no means certai n that such action would result in the final liquidation of the case. There would indeed be at least a fair prospect of convincing the Council of the League that such questions cannot be regulated by them without stultifying the principles underlying the Optional Clause. Again, an intimation by His Majesty 1 s Government that there were many British claims against the Persian Government, which would have to be considered concuirently, would be less likely to lead to a general compromise (as you anticipate, than to induce the Council to drop the matter altogether, in the realisation that they were coming to be looked upon as a sort of standing claims tribunal. Consequently it can hardly be said that, whatever wording be eventually adopted for the Claims article in the general treaty,! His Majesty»s Government will in any case be faced with the necessity of lighting this case and hence risking the serious financial/s' iinancial loss involved. There is, moreover, another and subsidiary objection to the inclusion of the Atychides case among those to be settled by the proposed Claims Commission: in so far as the claim relates to the detention of the M Kara Deniz” prior to her seizure on the outbreak of war with Turkey, the principal line 01 defence so far used has been that Monsieur Atychides failed to exhaust his legal remedies in the competent Indian courts. This argument,which is sound enough as far as this particular case is concerned, could in the last i esort (though not without some risk of embarrassment) be employed if the case were brought up as an isolated issue beloie the Council of the League of Nationsj but it would cleaily be ouo of the question to use it in pleading the case befoi e a Claims Commission, since there appears to be scarcely a single British claim against the Persiaa Government in respect of which any atoempt has been made by the claimant to obtain satisfaction through the Persian courts. 9. 1 have set forth above the serious disadvantages which appear to me to be inherent in your proposal to abandon the clause barring war claims. i admit, however, that l can at present suggest no alternative solution of the problem which would arise if, as you anticipate, the Persian Government set Uieir lace resolutely against any draft involving the barring of such claims in general, or of the Atychides claim in particular. The impasse thus created would undoubtedly add gieatly to ihe difficulties which stand in the way of a general treaty settlement, and for the present I can only hope that when you come to dis cuss the draft article with the Persian Government their reaction will prove more favourable than you anticipate. 10. 1 am dealing- in a separate uespatch with the request contained in the last paragraph of your despatch No.609 for copies of certain papers relating to the Atychides claim. I am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) (Sd.) G.ff.Bendel.nV (E 355/346/E4) Important. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 1st March, 1934. Rear Wooas, I am not sure how far you are conversant with the question of the draft claims article and protocol in the proposed Anglo-Persian general treaty. During the last two or three years there has been a considerable three-cornered correspondence on this subject between Trickett, the India Oilice and ourselves, but you will find the essential points summarised on pages ,22-26 of the long memorandum (Annex l) enclosed in our despatch No. 50 of the 25th January to Tehran, of which we sent you a copy officially under cover cf our letter No. E 580/139/34 of the 1st February. 2. The detailed investigations which we are now pursuing in connexion with the categorising of the claims files recently ieceived from lehran have led us to reconsider the provisional draft given on pages 25 and 26 of the memorandum referred to above. The draft has not yet been discussed with the Persians, and we have now reached the conclusion, subject to your views and those of the India Office (to whom we are writing separately on this subject) that the following modifications are desirable. (a) The words n were directly due to those circumstances 'and which ...' should be omitted from paragraph (1) of the draft treaty article. (b) The words '.. the competent authorities of ...' should be inserteu before 'the other High Contracting party' in paragraph 2 of the treaty article. (c) If, as is probable, the Persians decline to agree that the proceedings before the tribunal should be in French and English , article 8 of the Protocol or Annex should be re-drafted as follows:- J.H.E.Wooas, Esq., M.V.O., Treasury. 'The/'The written proceedings of the tn bunal shall 'be in the French language, but the agents and counsel 'appointed by the respective High Contracting Parties 'shall be permitted to plead in their own language, 'their speeches being translated into French if and 'when necessary.' 3. Oi these three amendments, (c) is self-explanatory. (b) seems to us desirably in view of the fact that certain minor British claims were apparently never included in the recapitulatory lists oi claims which the Tehran Legation presented irom time to time to the Central Government at Tehran, but were mereay forwarded by His Majesty’s Consular Officers to the local Persian Governors. (a) is the only point of any importance; the words which we now propose to omit were, oi course, originally intended to enable us to exclude from the scope of the barrer clause a variety of British claims which have no real connexion with war conditions in Persia. In theory such a distinction is a reasonable one, but our legal advisers, who have gone into the question very carefully, have now reached the conclusion that in practice the phrase would provoke endless argument and would clog the whole machinery oi the claims settlement. In addition, it would inevitably give rise to much public discussion regarding the violation of Persian neutrality by British forces (among others) during the war. This, of course, would be highly embarrassing (indeed, the desire to avoid such public discussion of the war period in Persia has always been one of our main reasons lor proposing to incorporate the barrer clause in the draft article) and would incidentally be only too likely to influence the neutral arbiters against us. 4. ae hope, then, that in the light of the explanations given aoove you will be able to concur in the three amendments in question. The matter is rather urgent, as until we receive your/your concurrence and that oi’ the India Office we cannot finally dispose of another treaty question regarding which the Dominions will have to be consulted. 5. 1 am sending copies of this letter to Laithwaite at the India Office and Wiseman at the Dominions Office.

Dear Earner, I received your letter T. 1154/42/370 of 29th September in regaru to the caae of the S.S. ''Kara Deniz ' 1 which was detained in Bombay and seized after the outbreak of war with Turkey. We cannot find any previous papers in this case, anu that is not surprising, for matters of this kind were left during the War to the i.umiralty anu the Customs, and the Transport Department of the Aumiraltj was not consulted. The Ministry of Shipping was not, of course, in existence at the time. The name of the ship is familiar, and I have at some time or other seen papers about this vessel, but these were probably Reparation Com ission papers. In view of what I have said you will probably ■5 consult the Customs and Admiralty as to whether a good case could be maue out in support of the action of the authorities in Bombay in refusing to allow the vessel to £&lt; 84 .. , C. M.Q. leave/ ■■■■■■■■■leave. Looking at it from the merchant shipping point of view, we should say that the Indian Government were justified in detaining the ship, in view of the fact that we were at war and that the future policy of Turkey was to say the least of it doubtful, and the fact that the ship had no papers - the alleged Persian sale, again without any supporting evidence, was altogether too thin a pretext. It should, one would imagine, be easy for a good case to be made out in support of the action of the Authorities in Bombay who obviously had every reason to be doubtful of the bona tides of the transfer.

Sir John Simon understands that the Persian Government may refer the matter to the Council of the neague of Nations, ^nd if so it may become of importance to establish that the action of the Port Authorities at Bombay prior to the seizure of the vessel furnished Mr, Atychidee vith a right of action of which however he failed to avail himself and whether, in the circumstances any form of action is now open to him, A copy of a letter from the India Office from which it appears that Mr. Atychides failed to exhaust the municipal remedies open to him in India, is enclosed. Gir John Simon is advised that proceedings in this country, based on English law, are now out of the question so far as concerns the Crown as such, but he would be glad to The Secretary to ,the Board of Customs and xlxoise. /learn The Secretary of the Admiralty.learn the views of the Board &amp; 8 o0 whether a good Their Lordships case could 'be made in support of the action of the Authorities in Bombay in refusing to allow the vessel to leave. 4.

P# reason# The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office, 5.W.I.mm » M.659/33. 28th Pebruapy 3 Sir, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to refer to your letter No.T.14448/422/370 of 9th January 1933, enclosing a copy of a memorandum concerning the claim of Socrates Atychides, whose ship the 'KARA DKNIZ' was detained at Bombay and seized after the outbreak of war with Turkey in November, 1914. 2. The Secretary of State requested the views of My Lords as to whether a good case could be made in support of the action of the authorities in Bombay in refusing to allow the vessel to leave. The opinion of the Treasury Solicitor has been obtained on this point and is as follows 'The Bombay Government do not suggest any peculiar provision of the local municipal law justifying the action of their port officer. The general position in international law appears to be fairly plain. A ship sailing the High Seas and visiting foreign territorial waters must possess a nationality, and her nationality is that of the flag she properly carries. The conditions on which States admit ships to their Register are not the concern of international law. It suffices that - for whatever reasons - a The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, 3 . . 1 . S ta t e..«- 2 - State accepts the authority and responsibility which result from the ship’s nationality. The ship’s right to carry her flag should be vouched by some public official document on board her. In this case, therefore, the port officer was justified in detaining the ’’KARA DENIZ*' untin satisfied of her right to carry the Persian flag, but I do not think he was acting correctly in saying that he would not recognise the alleged change of nationality from Turkish to Persian until the ship’s register had been produced. I think he should have been satisfied as to her nationality so soon as the Turkish Consul- General’s statement had been confirmed by the statement of the Persian Consul and a certificate of Persian nationality had been issued by the latter official'. 3. War with Turkey was declared to exist on the 5th November 1914, end so far as can be traced, the only order issued before that date regarding Turkish ships was tne order of the 4th November communicated by the Foreign Office to other Departments, stating that it had been decided, in view of certain acts of hostility committed by Turkey, not to allow Turkish ships to clear from British ports until adequate explanations were received. It was stated that this action should not be taken 'on the footing that we are now at war with Turkey, but amounts to placing an embargo on Turkish shipping”. 4. As, however, the retention of the ship took place before the 4th November, reliance cannot be placed on these.••mm ®&gt; these orders for embargo, and the question whether or not the Bombay authorities could properly detain her appears to depend upon whether a ship can, in time of peace, be detained in harbour, if her papers are not complete. The Treasury Solicitor has given an adverse opinion on thie point. 5. My Lords observe, however, that in the despatch from the British Minister at Athens dated the 13th December 1918 enclosed in Foreign Office letter of that date, No.200,766/J, doubt is expressed as to whether Mr. Atychides had ever ceased to be a Turkish subject, and it may perhaps therefore be possible to contend that the case is, in any event, covered by Article 58 of the Treaty of Lausanne, under which Turkey and the other Contracting Powers reciprocally ’^renounced all pecuniary claims for t**- *1038 and damage suffered respectively by Turkey and the 'Central Powers and their nationals (including Juridical persons) between 1st August 1914 and the coming into force of the pi*esent Treaty, as the result of acts of war or measures oi requisition, sequestration, disposal or 'confiscation'. 6. As the matter has turned out, it seems unfortunate that, if, as sta ted, the absence of certain partsOAH/ j@r - 4 - e&gt; 1 2eJ ’S parts of machinery would have prevented the yfeaarT to sea, the Port Officer did not allow clearance to be given, provided that this could have been done without admitting that the change of flag was in any way recognised. However, if the case is taken to arbitration, presumably the fact that the vessel could not have proceeded to sea will be put forward as a reason for resisting any payment of damages. 7. My Lords understand that in British India, the Indian Merchant Shipping Act, 1923, provides (and it is probable that earlier Acts provided) expressly for the detention of British ships unsafe by reason of defective machinery, but this provision does not apply to foreign ships which the Act renders liable to detention only when they are unsafe by reason of overloading or improper loading. fc.

That he resides 10 at Taj Mahal Hotel, Apollo JBunder, Bombay, and is a subject of His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia. 2. On the 15th August 1914 the claimant purchased the said ship “ Kara- deniz ” from the Seir Safani &amp; Co. at Constantinople, and the said company, which is a Turkish Co., assigned the said ship to the claimant. The purchase 15 was completed the same day according to the law of the land at Constanti nople and the document evidencing the sale was filed by the claimant with the Consul General for Persia who on the same day issued his certificate evidencing the said sale. A copy translation of the said certificate is hereto annexed and marked with the letter “A.” 20 3. Prior to such assignment, the above ship was named the “ Karadeniz,” and immediately thereafter the claimant changed the name of the said ship to that of “ Hamadan.” 4. News about the sale of the said ship was conveyed by wire by the vendors to their agent at Hodaida where the above ship was believed to be at the date 25 of the sale, and the agent of the Seir Safani Co. in his turn communicated the fact of the sale with the captain by a telegram dated the 21st August 1914. On the same day the Persian Consul General at Constantinople communi cated by wire the fact of the sale to the Persian Consul at Hodaida. At the date of the sale the above ship was on the high seas between Hodaida and 30 Bombay. She was carrying no cargo but had on board some passengers who disembarked in Bombay. 5. The above ship was not permitted to leave Bombay in the months of September and October 1914. The claimant having received information of this from the Commander Mourad Bey approached the Consul General on the 35 subject who in his turn communicated with the Ambassador of His Britannic Majesty at Constantinople and forwarded the original bill of sale to the Embassy proving the fact of such sale. The original bill of sale was up to the time of the outbreak of war between His Britannic Majesty and the Sultan of Turkey in the archives of His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople, 40 as will be seen from a copy office translation of a letter addressed by the Secretary to His Britannic Majesty’s Embassy at Constantinople to the Persian Consul General dated 31st October 1914 annexed and marked with the letter “ B.” 6 . In November 1914 war broke out between the Governments of His 45 Britannic Majesty and Turkey, and on the 13th November 1914 the above ship was compulsorily lying in the port of Bombay, was seized and captured as a prize of war. The Persian Flag was removed and the Union Jack hoisted instead./ « 7. There were at the time of such capture no contraband goods on board of the said ship and no subject of the Turkish Government or enemy of Great Britain had at the time of such capture or at any other time material to the matters in this cause any share, right, title or interest in the said ship or any part thereof. 5 8 . There was no just ground for the capture and detention of the said ship in Bombay. 9. The said claimant has suffered damages to the extent of Rs. 1,40,500 by reason of the detention of the abovenamed ship in Bombay since September last and its capture as per particulars hereto annexed and marked with the IQ letter “ C.” The claimant, Socrates Atychides, therefore prays that the Judge will decree restitution of the said ship to him with rupees 1,40,500 damages and costs.

The steamship “Kara Deniz.” 5 MouradBey .... ... ... ... Master. Ihe Hon ble Mr. Eustace Ferrers Nicholson, Solicitor to Government, in answer to the petition ^bf the claimant, says as follows :— 1 . The said steamship “Kara Deniz ’’was taken as prize under the circumstances set forth in the affidavit as to ship papers herein to which 10 reference is craved. 2 . None of the allegations in the said petition are admitted save the allegations to the effect that the said ship brought certain passengers to Bom bay and that at the time of her capture she had no contraband goods on board and save such as may also appear in the said affidavit. The claimant 15 is put to strict proof of all such allegations as are not admitted. 3. It is denied that there was any valid trahsfer of the said ship to the claimant before the outbreak of hostilities. 4. The claimant is put to strict proof that prior to her capture the said ship was in a condition to leave Bombay and that it was intended by him that 20 she should do so. 5. It is submitted in view of the circumstances set forth in the said affidavit that if, prior to her capture, the- said ship was detained in Bombay, such detention was lawful. 0. It is further submitted that under the circumstances aforesaid there ^ were good reasons both for detaining and capturing the said ship. 7. Any delay in these proceedings is due to the laches of the claimant who has only recently arrived in Bombay and put forward his claim. In this connection reliance will be placed on a letter dated the 7 th day of November 1914 from the Consul for Persia in Bombay to Government wherein a request 30 is made that Government should stay their hands for some reasonable time and give a chance to the alleged owner to prove his Persian nationality and the bona fides of his purchase. 8 . It is denied that the claimant is entitled to damages in any event, but in case he be held so entitled, the claimant is put to strict proof of the 35 damages alleged and every part thereof. 9. In the event of its being held that there was a valid transfer of the said ship to the claimant before the outbreak of hostilities Government will claim all expenses to which they have been put in connection with the said ship since its capture. 40 And the said Eustace Ferrers Nicholson prays the Judge to pronounce that the said steamship “ Kara Deniz ” was at the time of capture property of enemies of the Crown of Great Britain or otherwise liable to condemnation and to condemn the same as lawful prize to the captor or to pronounce for just cause of capture. 45 EUST.

Robertson, Esq., 5 Secretary to Government, Political Department. Sir, I am in receipt of your letter No. 2718-W, dated the 7th instant, and in reply thereto, have the honour to state as follows :— 19 On 2nd September 1914 I received a telegram from the Persian Consul General at Constantinople informing me that the steamship “ Karadeniz ” had become the property of a Persian subject since 2nd/15th August and asking me to name it “ Hamadan.” The Captain of the steamer saw me about the same time and asked me for a certificate for the steamer and for permission to change 15 its name and to hoist the Persian Flag on it. The Captain’s telegram men tioned the name of the new owner as Socrate who I am given to understand is. a well-known Persian shipowner in Constantinople. I referred the matter to * my Consul General in India for his orders. I received another telegram from the Persian Consul General at Constantinople on the 13th September saying 20 that the original documents of the steamer had been sent to Basra for trans mission to Bombay and asking me to give a provisional permit to the steamer for sailing to Basra. I referred this telegram also to my Consul General. The Consul General in India was in telegraphic communication with the Foreign Office, Teheran, for sometime in connection with this steamer and ultimately 25 received orders to issue a provisional certificate to this steamer. Under the orders of the Consul General, I issued such a certificate and informed the Port Officer of the same. The Port Officer demanded the ship’s register and in a personal interview I had with him informed me .that my certificate must be endorsed on the ship’s register in order that the change of nationality may be 30 accepted by him. The Captain repeatedly wired to his masters for the ship’s register, but the same evidently has not yet arrived. I received a letter from the Captain on the 5th instant, asking me to put myself in telegraphic com munication with the owner of the ship. I have not acceded to his request as -1 do not consider myself justified in putting my Government to heavy expenses 35 on account of a private steamer. Under the circumstances it appears probable that the alleged owner of the steamer will take steps to claim it for himself and as communication with him in Constantinople has become difficult on account of the state of war, I have the honour to request that Government may be pleased to stay their hands for some 40 reasonable time and give a chance to the alleged owner to prove his Persian nationality and the bona fides of his purchase.

I had corre spondence with him from May till August. I had bought one of my steamers through him before. The negotiations fell through. Then I tried to buy two other boats at Constantinople The “ Hella ” and “ Constantine ” but failed. Then I decided to try and buy the “ Karadeniz,” and the “ Ak. Deniz.” (Black Sea 5 and White Sea.) They belonged to the Seir Saffain Company. I bought the “ Karadeniz.” The price was £T15,000. The same price as was paid by the sellers. I paid TT5,000 cash and money £T10,000 which were due by the Company to me were set off. The document I got from the seller is now with the British Embassy at Constantinople. The Turkish G-overnment gave the 10 document, not the selling Company. The sellers were a company subsidised by the Turkish Government. The sale was absolute. Nothing was left to the sellers. All the documents were made in conformance with the customs in force in Constantinople. # W'hen this sale was completed I got this document from the Persian 15 Consul General at Constantinople. I produced the documents before the Consul General which are mentioned in the Certificate from the British Embassy. There was a document from the Government and a letter accom panying it. The British Embassy asked for those documents and they were sent by the Persian Consul General. When I heard that the vessel was 20 detained in Bombay I asked the Persian Consul General to communicate with the British Embassy and thereupon the • British Embassy asked for the documents which proved my ownership. 2 Certificate by the Persian Consul General. That document shows that the Persian Government recognized the sale. 26 I have similar certificates for all my Steamers. 3 Coll. I produce four of such certificates. 4 5 6 7, 8,9 10 The stamp duty is 1 per cent. I paid TT150. The Persian stamps affixed on the document are equivalent in value to that amount. On the 15th August the vessel was supposed to be at Hodeidah. Two telegrams were sent to 30 Hodeidah in my presence. One by the selling Company to their Agent. One by the Persian Consul General to the Persian Consul, announcing the sale of the vessel. The Agent was asked to wait for instructions. The name of the vessel was changed to “ Hamadan,” a Persian Town. The Persian Consul General applied for the return of the documents from the British Embassy. 35 This is the reply. The Persian Consul General sent it on to me. I get it on the 3rd January. I intended that the vessel should trade from Busrah, if I got two boats. , Otherwise I intended that she should carry pilgrims to Jeddah. Six or seven days after the sale I learnt the ship had left Hodeidah for Bombay. The 40 selling Company reported that to me. I arranged that they should send a wire to their Agent at Bombay. I arranged with them to take delivery of ^the vessel at Bombay, otherwise I had intended to do that at Hodeidah. The Persian Consul General also wired to the Persian Consul at Bombay at my expense. ^ Telegram 1st September sent by Persian Consul General. Telegrams sent by Company to Shiraz. I sent the ship’s Register, a Journal and copy of Ex. 2 to the Persian Consul at Busrah about the beginning of September. The Register bears a Persian Stamp for Duty and the writing was written 50 at the Persian Consulate. The Journal was also stamped in the same way and the initial entry is signed by the Consul General. I sent two Persian flags to the Consul at Bus?ah and the Company’s flag. • 5 j The Boat I thought was going to Busrah. I got back the papers and books from the Persian Consul in this cover. The Consul at Bombay tele graphed for them, at my request.11 LI L2 Ki L3 K2 12 L4 ^ K3 L5 L6 L7 13 14 Coll. 15 16 17 18 19 I produce a press copy. 25th January.

I sent this telegram to the Captain 15th September. I got a telegram of which this is a copy. 16th September. I did not see any telegram in terms of the copy shown to me. I saw the telegram of the 3rd October. 20 I paid what was asked for out of my own pocket. I paid afterwards but not regularly. I saw the telegram, 27th September.

I felt uneasy about the boat and went to the Persian Consul, Bombay. I got the reply at Piraeus. On the 19th November the Persian Consul at Piraeus sent this wire to Bombay at my instance. I got this repfy. After that I came to Bombay with the documents which I had. I could not get the document I had in Constantinople. I was detained at Port Said for 10 days. I got the Persian Consul to telegraph to Bombay. 25 30, 23rd February 1915. Part heard. SOCRATES ATTCHIDIES. Examination continued by Inverarity. Copy telegram Port Said to Bombay. December 1st. I got to Port Said on the 30th November. I got to Bombay on the 14th December. J 10 3PBefore I left Port Said the telegram arrived from Bombay. When war broke out, I sent a man to Constantinople to remove my wife and family. They arrived at Piraeus about the 13th or 14th November. When war broke out only one of 7 vessels, the Teheran, was out of Turkish waters. She is now trading in the Mediterranean. The others are stopped within the Dardanelles, j 5 I do not intend to go back to Constantinople as long as the present Government j is in power. The Seir Sefani Co. own 60 to 70 vessels. Last year the only \ vessel they sold was the “ Kara Deniz ”. The year before they sold one to my knowledge. These vessels trade in the Black Sea and Mediterranean and lied Sea. The Kara Deniz had been advertised for sale before I bought her. I saw 10 the advertisement in two papers. 15 20 25 30 At the time I bought her I had no idea that war was likely to break out between Turkey and Great Britain or between Turkey and Kussia. My vessels were carrying the Bussian Mjiils up to the end of September. I have bought a vessel before while on a voyage, viz., the Teheran. I had known her, Kara Deniz, for about 5 years. The Ak. Deniz was a sister ship. I had known her for about 5 years. She w^as at Constantinople when I bought the Kara Deniz. There is a Persian Consular Court at Constantinople. Similar to the British Consular Court. Cross-examined by STBANGMAN— I was born in Constantinople. I am 41. I had always resided and carried on business in Constantinople. I was a Turkish subject before I became a Persian subject. My business has always been connected with shipping. I have a partner Theodore Bachrato. He has been my partner for 3 years. Before that I was alone. Bachrato is a Turkish subject. Bachrato ' and I are partners for this agency business in managing the steamers. There are other partners in the ownership of the steamers. I have different shares in different ships. I have a share in each of the seven ships I have referred to. One of the ships belongs wholly to me, the Baziph. In other ships there are two or three owners including myself. I have the largest share. In one boat the sharers are Turkish subjects, in another boat one sharer is a German and the other a Turkish subject. In another boat there is one sharer, a German, in another boat one sharer, a Turk. I have no sharers who are not Turkish or German subjects. There are no sharers with me m the Kara Deniz. I purchased the Baziph H years ago. I have not got here the documents relating to her. When I became a Persian subject 1 hzi three ships. The Irani, Ispahan and another which was sent afterw ards. I key flew the Turkish flag. I became a Persian subject, to free my children from k serving in the Turkish army. I have never been m Persia. I dont know the lamraase. I Got permissionTi-om the Turkish Government to get .d of 40 my Turkish nafiSnality. Then I applied to the Persian Embassy for a- Firman. After I became a Persian subject my ships continued on the same runs as before. They were registered at Bunder Abbas. The Teheran was the biggest. Her tonnage was 2,300 gross, nett 925. • The others are half the size. The Teheran costs £T5,500. I paid 55 per cent. In the agency busmess my share is 65 cents, Bachrato 35 cents. I ave n0 8 ° i .■ spondence with Willis, nor the correspondence about the Hela and Constantine. The two ships I wished to purchase through Willis were about 2,o00 tons The Hela was 5,500 tons and Constantine 6,000. The negotiations fwJ*ese vessels began in May. When I saw I would buy the Kara Deniz I stopp them. I heard the Kara Deniz was for sale o or 0 months before August, began to negotiate for her in the beginning of August about 5 or 10 days before the sale. I had been on board of her, in December 13th January , and at other times. I went to look at her for the purpose of buying her I had private negotiations with the Company long before August.

I had some immoveable property in Constantinople which I trans ferred to Ismail Hucky Pasha. I had to execute a sale deed in his favour. He was a Government servant. He was 1 st Director of the Seir Sefani Company and Chief de L’attendance Militaire, that is to say the Supply and Transport Department. I sgreed to pay TT15,000 and he took the boat at Hodeidah in whatever condition she was, paying for the coal on board in addition. I have no notes here of the terms of this purchase. It was understood at first that the crew was to be paid off at Hodeidah. When I heard the ship had left Hodeidah I agreed to pay TT360 a month for wages from the loth August. I never sent out any crew before war broke out. I sent 7 men, Greeks, who arrived about 20 days ago. 3 Officers, 3 Engineers and a cook from Greece. I thought I could get sailors here. I telegraphed for them from here in January. I had the men ready before I left Greece. Four of them are serving in other boats, three are new. From the time I bought the Kara Deniz I had been making arrangements for the Officers and crew. No steps w T ere taken to bring them out until January. The Seir Sefani Company does not belong to the Turkish Govern ment, but it is subsidised. If she had belonged to the Turkish Government the Officers would be Government servants. I am prepared to contradict the Captain if he says he ^vas. It may be under control of Government. The 1st Director is the person whose name I have given. He was not 1 st Director ex officio. Before him a year ago there was a European Manager. I believe an Englishman. I had been pn the Kara Deniz in April or May, for the last time before I bought her. I had a survey made by myself and my Engineer called Mitso in December-January. I have not got any report. The ^Kara Deniz had been bought by the Company for T15,000. I paid that and T3,500 more. I thought she had been bought cheap. The Company had not renewed the engine. The Company owed me more than TT 10 , 000 . The agency firm had to recehe that from the Treasury. In all &lt;£T30,000 were due. I was doing transport work for them and supplying coal, for the last 4 or 5 years. In September or October I was forced to do that work, transporting troops from Constantinople to Beyrout under the Persian Flag. The last thin' I heard from my partner was that he had removed the crews to avoid them being used tor the Government. I have a letter here of the 13th October. In the begin- nmg of August the Turkish Government commandeered all steamers. °In August and September my ships w T ere used as transports. In October the Straits were closed. Ships could sail into the Black Sea under pilotage.

I got a cheque from the Treasury for TT10,000 which I handed o\ei to the Company Iliad got the- cheque 20 or 25 days before the sale quite irrespective of the purchase of the Kara Deniz. If the Seir Sefani had not been a Government Company they probably would not have taken the cheque. Both parties signed the Register in evidence of the sale and the Port Tiust authority granted a document which is called ’El Mouhabir and a letter accompanying it.

Mines were laid iif the DardanXs 5 10 15 30 35 40 45 50 55 6039 in the beginning of August. The Turks were detaining ships by the end of August. My ships were not taken over entirely for the transport of troops in August. The Turks wanted to*take them but the Persian Embassy inter fered. When I left Constantinople I thought the Kara Deniz had left Bombay for Busrah. I had communication with the British Embassy when 5 I heard from the Captain he could not leave Bombay. L3. The Persian Consul went to the British Consul and there was correspondence with London and I heard about the 18th or 19th October that communication had been sent from London to allow the ship to leave Bombay. The Persian Consul told me that the British Consul had told him that a wire had been sent to London 13 about letting the ship go. Before the 21st October I heard nothing more about the ship being released. L3 was the last telegram I got from the Captain before I left except L 6 . I thought the ship would sail from Bombay. When I left Constantinople I thought the ship was in Bombay. I had heard nothing definite about the ship being allowed to sail. I did nothing until I got 15 the Persian Consul to send a telegram on 15th November. I expected to take delivery in Bombay because I was to pay the crew, and the Persian Flag was to be hoisted. There was nobody in Bombay to take delivery on my behalf. But the Captain would follow my orders when he got them. I had heard of the Shirazis. I had nothing to do with them. They were never my 20 agents. I was to pay &lt;£360 a month, for wages from the 15th August. I sent £1,000 because the Captain was asking for it. I got the money from jny safe. Also the £500. I had collected money from my business. My book will show the payments. They are not here. I was anxious for the ship to go to Busrah to get cargo for Jeddah and Constantinople. The ship was to go with the 25 same Turkish Officers and crew. The Captain of the other ships are Greeks. The Officers and crew are of various nationalities. I knew on the 1st Novem ber war had broken between Turkey and the Allies. I produce the telegram about the Teheran sailing from Persia to Fez. I sent my man to Constantinople by the first boat to fetch my family. 30 The Kara Deniz was to be run by my agency firm in the same way as the other ships. lie-examined by INVERARITY— If I got to Constantinople I would try and get my ship to Piraeus. I have some immoveable property and some cash there. I don t want to trade there 35 while war continues. When I changed my nationality many other Greeks in Turkey did the same. Prior to that they had not been liable to serve. W e thought it easier to become Persian subjects. Bachrato is a Greek although a Turkish subject. My ships have always been transporting troops for the last 5 years if Government required that. About the end of August it became 40 compulsory. The documents I have produced relating to 4 other ships mention my other partners. Before I left Piraeus I had made arrangements for Greek Officers to come out. I made an application to the Bombay Government for permission for them to land. ' t 45 21 Correspondence with Government in January 1915. 22 Telegram sent on 9th January to Port Said. 23 Letter from Bashra to 30th October 1914. I told my Solicitors about my transferring land to someone in Turkey in order to effect the purchase of the ship. I didn’t want it to be mentioned in 50 Court. I am afraid about my relatives in Constantinople. 24 I have received three telegrams from my agent at Piraeus. 13th and 19th February. To COURT— I kept the accounts of the 7 steamers separate. It could be seen from 55 the books how much was due to each steamer out of the money due by the Turkish Government.40 the Turkish Government was that 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Q.—When you got the T10,000 from apportioned amongst the various steamers ? A.—That was done. My account was debited with the .£10,000. Q.—Did you distribute the £T10,000 amongst your partners ? A.—The proportionate amount was credited but the accounts have not been closed owing to my not getting news from Constantinople. Q.—Did you tell your partners you were taking the £10,000 for yourself ? A.—Bachrato knew about it. The others were not supposed to know. TO INVEBARITY— The agency agreement came to an end about 2 months ^go. HORMASJI BHIKAJI examined by INVERARITY— I am in the service of Meya Mahomed Shirazi. He was in Bombay in May 1914. He was the agent of the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Co. He sold that agency to Turner, Morrison &amp; Co. He went to Constantinople to get the agency of a Turkish Line. I was his C/A during his absence with two others. During his absence the Kara Deniz arrived in Bombay. We received a telegram from the ship at Jeddah, 7th August. I received a telegram before from M. M. Shirazi to say he had got the agency of the Seir Sefani Line. I got a telegram announcing departure of the ship from Hodeidah, 13th August. When the vessel arrived we did agents’ work for it. W r e had her surveyed for repairs and corresponded with the Collector of Customs. This is a copy of the telegram we sent to the Company on the 4 th September. We got this reply. Ex. 6 . Then I wrote to the Captain, 7th September. I got the letter from the Captain the same day answering my letter. I sent my bill to the Captain for 8,455. There is the receipted bill for Rs. 4,667-0-10.- On the 16th September I wrote to the Port Officer and Collector of Customs. Cross-examined by STRANGMAN— The ship was repaired. The Captain paid for the repairs. The Captain objected to the items in our bill. lie-examined — This was our bill with the items objected to marked. MIRZA ALI SHIRAZI examined by INVERARITY— Son of Meya Mahomed Shirazi. My father went to Europe. He gave me a power-of-attorney. I remember the telegram arriving about the sale of the Kara Deniz. I went with the Captain to the Persian Consul as he wanted a Persian Flag. We got a Persian Flag. My father returned to Bombav in Decernbei. I vas sent for by Government. I saw Mr. Robertson on the 23rd December. He asked me about the Kara Deniz. I showed him all the naners I had received and said we are no longer the agents for the ship. ' P INVERARITY— I liad summoned the Turkish Consul but he refuses to come I will show his proof to the Court. ' P. C. There is nothing in it which we can’t Inverarity admits the ship was not insured for its ^ya Claimant wished to insure but rates too high on account of the get from elsewhere, voyage to Bombay, war. 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50MOO RAD BEY cross-examined by INVERARITY— After my arrival in Bombay I saw in the Turkish Consul’s Office Turkish newspapers. I do remember seeing in them advertisements for the sale of the Kara Deniz. I saw that in a paper of the 13th or 14th September. I read it after one month. I told Mr. Mirza I had seen the 5 advertisement in a paper of the 13th August. The Seir Sefani Co. belongs to the Turkish Government. There are no shareholders in it. It has a fleet of 70 to 80 ships. They carry general goods and passengers. They trade everywhere. They go into the Red Sea. I came to India 20 years ago in one of thfe Company’s ships. I paid Shirazi’s bill and 10 the bill for repairs out of the monies I received from Socrates Atychides. To STRANGMAN— I sent this letter dated the 23rd November to the Brigadier-General. To COURT— I applied for a Port Clearance and it was refused. 15 (It is very difficult to get this witness to understand the question put to him.) STRANGMAN says the Captain asked for a Pilot, but not for a Port Clearance. 25th February 1915. 20 Part heard. INVERARITY— That is all the evidence I have at present. If sufficient no reason to apply for a commission,' but if not I shall apply for a commission as regards negotiations with Willis. Persian Law and status of documents not with the 25 Vienna Bank. STRANGMAN— The question must be decided now. Claimant must decide whether to close his case or to apply for a commission. 30 INVERARITY— I ask the Court to hear the arguments on the evidence as it stands, and if it thinks it can be decided without that evidence, let it be so. P. C. I think the application can be acceded to. The principle on which a Prize Court'proceeds is to do wdiat is fair between the parties. INVERARITY— 35 I should like to ask the Captain about the date of the paper in which he saw the advertisement of the sale of the Kara Deniz. MOORAD BEY to COURT— The date of the paper which I read was the 13th September. I read it in October. 40 After a time the interpreter says the witness said that date was the 30th July (Turkish) which would be 13th August. P. C. If it is correct that private negotiations were going on for months, it does not much matter. ADVOCATE GENERAL- 45 On the 15th August, war contemplated between Turkey and England. P. C. It may have been only by one or more ministers, not by the Government as a whole., ia 27—35 41^Lf. 42 ADVOCATE GENERAL— Turkish Government commandeered all steamers in the beginning of August (see p. 51).

The S.S. “ KARADENIZ.” Socrates Atychides Coram —Mx^CLEOD, J. .. Claimant. 11th March 1915. On the 5th November 1914 war was declared between Great Britain and Turkey. On the 13th November the “ Karadeniz,” then lying in Bombay Harbour, was captured as an enemy vessel by Lieutenant Underhill of His Majesty’s Royal Garrison Artillery, under Government orders. On the 19th November the ship’s papers were lodged in Court with the usual affidavit. On the 21st November the writ was issued against the ship and the goods laden therein for the condemnation thereof as lawful prize. On 15th January 1915 one Socrates Atychides, hereinafter called the claimant, filed his claim to the ship. His petition in support of his claim alleged that he was a Persian subject and had purchased the ship on the 15th August 1914 at Constantinople from a Turkish Company called the Seir Sepani Co., that the sale had been completed the same day and that at the time of capture, or at any other times material to the matter in the cause, no subject of the Turkish Government 6 r enemy of Great Britain had any share, right, title and interest m the said ship. He prayed for the restitution of the ship and damages for her detention. The Government Solicitor filed an answer on the 22nd January denying that there was any valid transfer of the ship before the outbreak of hostilities. This is the first cause to be tried by this Court sitting as a Court of Admiralty in its Prize Jurisdiction in which the question at issne is whet er the captured vessel bought is of an enemy or neutral character. The C such a cause has to administer the course of the Admiralty and the law ot nations but none-the-less it is true to say that in doing so it administers the law of England as applied in English Prize Courts, which is m effect the Common Law of nations as modified by International agreements. The whole system of litigation and jurisprudence in the Prize Court is neculiar to itself The procedure is regulated by the Prize Court ^ules of 1914 and the only precedents which can be considered authoritative are the English Prize cases. , . .

She arrived in ZZy m balS on theZth August, flying the Turkish flag and with2 Turkish officers and crew. Hodeidah was her last port of call, and on the 15th August she was probably between 1,000 and 1,100 miles from Bombay. Ibe Bombay Agent for the ship was Mirza Mahomed Shirazi. Havino- previously sold his agency for the Bombay Persian Steam Navigation Company he went to Constantinople in May 1914, where he seems to have secured the Bombay Agency from the Seir Sepani Company. This was an entirely new venture on the part of the company as no vessels belonging to it liacl up till then, or at least during the last 20 years sailed for Bom bay. ' Mirza telegraphed to the persons whom he had left in charge of his business in com bay that he had secured the agency, and telegrams were received by them trom Jeddah and Hodeidah announcing the departure of the ship from those places on the 7th and 13th August, respectively.

On the 16th September the Captain wired Persian Consul, Bombay, and Consul General, Calcutta, to do nothing without order Tehran. (L 5.) On the 24th September the Consul General for Persia having received instructions from Tehran wired from Simla requesting the Consul at Bombay to grant the necessary certificate to the “ Hamadan.” (Exhibit 14.) On the 25th September the Consul at Bombay issued a certificate that the “ Hamadan ” was under the Persian flag. (Exhibit 5.) On the 26th September the Port Officers wrote to the Captain that no change of name or nationality could occur or be recognised until he saw r the steamer’s register. On the 27th September the Captain cabled “ Documents taken trying to leave.” (Exhibit 7.)* 4 On the 1st October the Captain again cabled that for the was not recognised without seeing the Turkish registei an c v n Turkish and Persian register to be sent.

On the 15th October the claimant having heard that one of is s ips, the “ Tehran ” had been in collision at Piraeus, left for that port. After the war was declared on the 5th November he sent or is w family and remained himself at Piraeus until he left for Bombay ^j^d November in order to prosecute this claim. _ On the IGth “d 1 a ^ ^ the Persian Consul at Piraeus, at claimant s reques , ® S P‘ Rusrah and if the Consul in Bombay enquiring if the “ Hamadan had '^t fo h not what was the state of the crew.

Article 56 deals with the transfer of an enemy vessel to a neutral ag after the outbreak of hostilities. Article 57 deals with the determination - of the neutral or enemy character of a vessel. By an order in Council of the 20th August Great Britain has adopted the Declaration during the present hostilities subject to certain modification with which I am not concerned in this case. Under the order the General Report of the Drafting Committee shall be considered by all Prize Courts as an authoritative statement of the meaning and intention of the said Declaration, and such Courts should construe and interpret the provisions of the said Declaration by the light of the commentary given therein. The preliminary provision to the Declaration states the signatory Powers are agreed that the rules contained in the following chapters correspond m substance witja the generally recognised principles of international law, but the three articles above referred to contain many points of dinerence from the principles hitherto recognised by the English Prize Courts, and I doubt whether they can be considered as a satisfactory exposition of the principles which t e framers of the Declaration intended should be binding in the future so that they can be applied without difficulty to any set of facts w T hich may be brought before a Prize Court. Article 55 introduces certain artificial periods which cannot be found in any decision of any particular Prize Court belonging to any country, and the facts of this case show clearly how very undesirable it is to fetter the discretion of a Prize Court .by such means. Nor does article 55 appear to be exhaustive, so that w 7 hile following its provisions I must have recourse to English cases as well. i But for the change effected by article 57 there 'would have been no difficulty in deciding this case. According to the authorities the claimant at the outbreak of the hostilities for the purposes of Prize Law would be con- [ sidered a Turkish subject by reason of his mercantile domicile unless within a reasonable time he transferred himself and his property to another country. (See the Ariel 2 English Prize cases, p. 606.) But this he had no intention of doing. It was by mere chance that he was at Piraeus when the war broke out, and in his evidence he said that he intended to go back as soon as the j Dardanelles were open to look after his business. It was immaterial to him whether w r ar w T as going on or not. However under article 57 the neutral or enemy character of a vessel is determined by the flag she is entitled to fly irrespective of the personal status of the owner, and before the capture the Persian Government had recognised the vessel’s right to fly the Persian flag. As this transfer w T as effected more than 30 days before the outbreak of hostilities, there is an absolute presumption that it is valid if it is unconditional •5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60*\J \ 4 5 10 15 •20 25 30 35 complete, and in conformity with the laws of the countries concerned and if its effect is such that neither the control nor the profits arising from the emplo) - ment of the vessel remain in the same hands as before the transfer. It is contended for the captors that the transfer was effected when war was imminent and that the circumstances surrounding the sale were so suspicious that there is a primd facie case for thinking that it was effected in order to evade the consequences to which the vessel would be exposed, so that, though the transfer cannot be impeached on that account alone, the Court must be satisfacd before releasing the vessel that the.'sale was absolute and bond fide. It is necessary, therefore, to consider what was the state of affairs in Constantinople on the 15th August, making special reference to the official correspondence published in the Bombay Government Gazette of the 20th January 1J15, respecting events leading to the rupture of relations between Great Britain and Turkey. On the 10th August the ‘ “ Goeben ” and Breslau, German men-of-war, arrived in the Dardanelles. On the 11th August Sir Edward Grey telegraphed to Mr. Beaumont, then in charge of the British Embassy ( °^' stantinople, that those ships should not be allowed to pass through the Straits and that they should either leave within twenty-four hours or be disarmed and laid up Mr. Beaumont replied on the same day that the “ Goeben and Bros an had been purchased by Turkey and the officers and men would be allowed to return to Germany. Subsequent events showed that though these vessels weie nnminallv transferred to Turkey the German officers and crew remained on 1 U i l . m( ] L ] ia t i n spite of the Allies guaranteeing the independence and mtegri y n? TuC a-M S t any enemies that might wish to utilize the General European eomnHcationshf order to attack her, German influence was too strong tor those October hostile acts were committed against Russia and Giea, n Although it may be said that on the 15th August Turkey was not rea^ .. b»k °# V* n t‘'a° ■ b, “.“w S interning the officers and “^^‘^^^htrself open to an ultimatum being sending them back to Germanj, ‘ lied The Grand Vizier may presented wffch she won dn 1. that Turkey wished to have been sincere m tellm ti a ft e r events this may be observe strict neutrality, thoug , g f Government could be of doubted, but the jS been committed and- was being little value when a breach of ' , , • ro ii ea rrues were of opinion that persisted in.

The c 1 —a thKclaimant’s story was correct that at the Unless the Court was satisfied that tn to establi8h a ne w hue of much beginning of the year he had made up ^ Constantino pl e , it seemed strange bigger ships to trade- between B ■ f , He may have known the Kara- that he should make this the faC e‘ of it the purchase was denizB’ before she left Constantino^^ ^ of the usua i precautions being made at an excessive price 40 45 50 55 60 ia 59—46 * taken. No survey regarding her condition was possible : she might have been lost at the time, she was not insured and there was only the vendor’s promise to pay the expenses of the vessel up to the 15th August. The claimant was certainly anxious that the vessel should start from Bombay for Busrah, but there was no evidence that he had made any arrangement there for an agent to 5 look after the ship and secure cargo, nor was any attempt made to change the officers and crew until long after the capture, judged by the ordinary rules of conduct, it cannot be said that the claimant acted as a prudent purchaser would be expected to act, and at present I have only his own story as an explanation for his departure from such rules. It may be taken that, according 10 to the document of sale, the transfer was unconditional and on the price being paid would be complete under ordinary circumstances : but the transfer being effected while the vessel was in transition, the control of the ship would remain in tiie same hands as before the transfer until the purchaser took possession. In this way article 55 includes the hitherto accepted rule that in case of war, 15 either actual or imminent, a mere transfer by documents is not sufficient to change the property as against captors as long as the ship remains in transition because the title of the vendee cannot be completed by actual delivery (see the Baltica, 2 English Prize Cases, p. 630). . What is sufficient to constitute delivery in the absence of the purchaser or his agent at the port where the vessel is due to arrive is not altogether clear, ait it seems that if the Captain of the ship recognises the purchaser as the owner and shows himself prepared to obey his orders, that wouilr be sufficient m the absence of any evidence that the Captain had secret instructions from the- Ncllei which he was prepared to follow as soon as he put to sea. nr 35 * I am prepared to hold that on the face of things the transfer was unconditional and complete without any reservation by the parties that the seller should have any control over the ship. But as stated by the President m the case of the Tommie (Prize Cases No. 14, 15th October 1914) a Prize 13111 ica y legal ds the essential qualities of any transaction and tries to arrive 30 at the realities of any particular case, and I have very grave doubts whether at tins stage I have sufficient materials to arrive at the realities of this case. That the necessary documents are in order is not surprising^but for the acts relating to the transfer I have only the claimant’s own evideSbe. It may be perfectly genuine and if so can be corroborated by further evidence for which his counsel at the commencement of the hearing suggested commis- sions should issued it was found necessary. What was done after it was v l f tha £ tlle - Bomba y Porfc authorities did not recognise the right of the ‘ sessel to change her Hag is not material. The fact that the claimant’s agent at I nam after the capture arranged for the despatch of fresh officers Ind 40 engineers and negotiated for the charter of the ship for a voyage in the Medi- Th 1 tl } r?W n ? ll ^ t , 011 the realities of the transaction on the 15th ^ 0 ust. The claimant and his agent may have acted in the belief that it was genuine and m the hope that they would make it appear to be so. It is cer tainly remarkable that except a few lines which have not been translated and 45 so I presume are not helpful to the claimant, in a letter of the 30th October wntten by the claimant’s partner in Constantinople, not a single letter written after the Wth August with regard to the purchase has been produced The ’ vesLl^Ie^outofBon h**™™ t0 haVe don ? was to cable instructions for the essei to get out of Bombay as soon as possible and go to Busrah It i* w 50 souffhtTn h Sted t f lat . Ck ', mant Wr ° te any letters &gt; 80 there is nothing in the point sought to be made by his counsel on the fact that Government who P h a ve po\\eis to open all foreign correspondence have not been able to produce •ipv evidence or writing to throw suspicion on the bond fides of the transfer. “&lt; 1^01 it tor his ships. And it is certainly open to remark that a man should spend 0 ' v ei'‘ 1120,000 in getting a ship to Busrah without arranging that some one should be there to look after the vessel and procure freight or passen- r ^ e / s h ( ^at is not as a rule left to the Captain. Then the fact.that the vessel 5 left Constantinople at the end of June or the beginning of July for Bombay on a new enterprise in accordance with an arrangement made by the company with Shirazee is inconsistent with their having since January been negotiating with the claimant for her sale. To sum up, there is a great deal on the record to show that Ismail Huchey transferred' the vessel to the claimant to 10 evade the consequences to which she would be exposed if war broke out. If war had broken out before the 14th September I should have sufficient grounds for condemning the vessel as lawful prize. But as even the period of sixty days has been exceeded I must be satisfied that in spite of the apparent validity of the transfer the control of the vessel remained in the hands of the vendors. 15 That may be very difficult, if not impossible, for the captors to prove by direct evidence, but I think there is considerable justification for their asking me to hold as the evidence stands at present that it points inevitably to the conclu sion that there was an arrangement between the claimant and the vendor that they should retain the control of the vessel and use the transfer as a means of 20 getting her to the nearest Turkish port under the Persian flag. I therefore direct the cause to stand over for further proof. See the Johann Emilie 2 English Prize Cases, 252. The claimant shall be given every ' facility to [.|^uce further evidence either by issue of commission or otherwise to establish me bondfides of his claim.J?T' In the High Court of Judicature at Bombay.

DEPOSITIONS of a witness examined in the above action at the Royal Courts of Justice, 10 London, England, before me, FRANK BRINSLEY-HARPER, Justice of the Peace for the County of London, England, one of the Commissioners appoint ed by an Order in this action dated 14th May 1915. On Monday, the 28th day of June 1915, the examination was commenced at 11 a.m., I, the said Frank Brinsley-Harper, having first administered the. 15 oath to myself as Commissioner and to William Holmes King as Clerk. Mr. LEWIS NO AD of Counsel instructed by Messrs. Fardell and Canning f appeared as Counsel for the claimant. Mr. THOMAS JOSEPH STRANOMAN of Counsel instructed by the Solicitor-for the India Office, representing the Government of Bombay, appear- 20 ed as Counsel on their behalf. IT WAS AGREED between Counsel for the claimant and the Govern ment of Bombay that the evidence in this case should be taken by question and answer by a shorthand writer. GEORGE LLOYD ALLEN, having been duly sworn by me, was examin- • 25 ed by Mr. Noad on behalf of the claimant and said as follows :— Q.—Is your name George Lloyd Allen ? A.—That is my name. q Are you a partner in the firm of Rowland W illis and Company, Shipbrokers and General Merchants, of 141, Fenchurch Street, London ? 30 A.—I am. q &gt; Does your firm trade as “ Rowland Willis and Company” ? A.—Yes, it does. Q—Have you a partner ? A—I have a partner, Mr. Arthur Rowland Willis, but his side of the or business is purely dealing with importing wood wool and wood rope from Holland. That is absolutely outside my domain altogether. O —What I wanted to get from you was that your firm consists solely of yourself and the Mr. Rowland Willis that you have named ? A.—Quite so. 40 0 —I understand you to say that he does the merchant side of the business whilst you confine yourself to the shipbroking.side ? A.—That is so.Q* Did you have business relations with Mr. Socrates Atychides ? A.—I did. Q- When did those business relations begin ? A.—It would be somewhere about the early part of 1913—it may be April or it may be June, somewhere round about that time, and it ultimately ended 5 in my selling the “ Clapton ” to him. Q- Did you come into personal contact with him, or was the business solely conducted by correspondence ? A* We came into contact with each other in London and we transferred the boat,,the “ Clapton,” to him at Antwerp. It was afterwards named the 10 Shiraz ” and is running at the moment under the Persian flag. Q. Do you produce an agreement dated the 15th May 1913, between the Clapton Steamship Company, Limited, and Mr. Socrates Atychides ? * W I d°* That is only a copy. The original was left with Mr. Socrates Atychides, but I have certified the copy as being a true copy of the original in 15 case there is any query. It is not the same copy because that would be with Mr. Socrates Atychides, but I have certified it as being a true copy and I think that will be sufficient. That was made at Antwerp. (The document was handed in and marked “ Exhibit G.L.A. 1.”) Q. Had you anything to do with the renaming of that vessel ? 20 A.—No. Q* Have you searched Lloyd’s Pegister of Shipping in connection with that vessel ? A. I have searched Lloyd’s Pegister Book of Shipping, yes. Q-—What do you find ? • 25 y L ‘ 'That she is named to-day as the “ Shiraz ” and the port of register is Bunder Abbas, Persia. ..., Q—After the completion of this negotiation for the sale of the “ Clapton ” did your business with Mr. Atychides cease ? continued ri g ht on you might say, some part of last year; 30 the middle of last year. I offered him boats of all names from time to time and the correspondence is here with reference to them. Q.—Do you produce a bundle of correspondence consisting of 20 docu- merits beginning with a letter dated in Antwerp, the 27th May 1913, and ending with a letter dated in Constantinople, the 21st February 1914 ? ° 35 A.—Yes. • (The documents were handed in and marked “ Exhibit G.L.A. 2 .”) Q. After the negotiations resulting in the sale of the “Clapton” did market 1 ? 6 fUrther ° f VeSSelS t0 ' Mr - A ^ chides as they came into the A.—I did. 40 Q.—Did any sales result during the year 1913 ? rememy r '^ychides made me two offers for boats that I can “XZnt^ZTS ^ 1118 P™ 6 ?, r re ahvays t 00 l °w: one was the were always so Imr tv, 0 . er ' as ^ le River Scheldt.” As I say, his prices thT * 1 Oldham ” and ntvf ^ business ever resulted. He treated, I think, for me Uidham and other boats, as the correspondence shows.* 3 Q.-—Coming to the year 1914 do you produce a bundle of correspondence consisting of 20 documents beginning with a receipt for a telegram of eight words to “ Galata, Constantinople,” dated the 12th January 1914, and ending with a letter from Rowland Willis and Company to Atychides and Vahratoglon, 5 dated the 20th April 1914 ? • A.—I do. (The documents were handed in and marked “ Exhibit G.L.A. 3.”) Q.—Who are Messrs. Harris and Dixon of 81, Gracechurch Street ? A.—They are a firm of steamship owners and steamship brokers from 10 whom I was committed for the “ Ocamo ” and the “ Oruro.” Q.—Messrs. Harris and Dixon were the agents for sale of the u 'Ocamo ” and “ Oruro ” ? A.—Yes. Q.—I ought to have asked you before what is your telegraphic address ? 15 A.—“ Asceteria, London.” Q.—Can you summarise the names of all the steamers in respect of w T hich you have negotiated with Mr. Socrates Atychides during 1913 and 1914 ? A.—'Yes, I have a list here. There were 20 in 1913. (The list was handed in and marked “ Exhibit G.L.A. 4.”) 20 Q-—you also negotiate in 1914 ? A.—Yes, the “ Ashton,” the “ Lincoln,” the “ Ocamo,” and the “ Orurc.” • * ± [ ‘ ' **' . Q.—The last communication you had with Mr. Atychides was the 20th April 1914 ? A.—That would be the last as far as I can find. 25 Q.—I see in that last communication you end up by saying : “ If we can ever get the “ Ocamo ” and “ Oruro ” we will certainly wire you ? A.—That is right; that was to get them at his price of T10,000 for the two boats. CROSS-EXAMINED by Mr. Strangman on behalf of the Government 33 of Bombay, the witness said as follows :— Q.—Was this man Himminghoffen, whose name I see mentioned in the correspondence, a partner of Mr. Socrates Atychides ? A.—That I could never find out. When I sold the “ Clapton ” Mr. Him- minghoffen certainly came on board the second day when she was inspected. 35 That was in London, but since then Mr. Atychides has never come back to London and Mr. Himminghofien has ; he has always treated as if he was in some way financially interested with Mr. Atychides. Q.—In the purchase of steamers ? A.—Yes, but it does not appear in any correspondence because there have 40 never been any letters from Constantinople which Mr. Himminghoffen has signed. On the other hand, when he came over on matters beforehand with reference to the “ Clapton ” in wdiich there was some little difficulty, Mr. Himminghonen was sent over by Mr. Atychides. But as to whether he is a partner in that firm I cannot tell you. 45 Q-— The only ship you sold to Mr. Atychides was the Clapton ? A.—That is right. Q.—After the sale of the “ Clapton ” the negotiations you had with Mr. Atychides consisted of your sending to him particulars of steamers as they came into the market and his making offers for them in some .cases or no oiieis 50 at all ? A.—That is quite right.Q. —Where he made offers, those offers were in all cases inadequate ? A.—That is exactly the case. He always said that unless things were cheap so that they would suit his particular requirements it was no use sending them over. He wanted two types of boat; either boats carrying about 1,000 tons for coal, that is to say single-deck ships for Goal, or passenger boats with good speed, but they were to be like railway companies’ old boats like the “ Northenden ” which he bought. Therefore, when correspondence came along with regard to the “ Lincoln ” in 1914, she was a similar type of boat to the “ Northenden ” because she was owned by the same owners, the Great Central Kail way Company. Q.—Did he purchase the “ Northenden ” ? A.—He purchased that-boat some years ago. Q.—Not through your firm ? A.—No, not through my firm, but she is to-day running under the Persian flag. That was the type of boat he wanted. • Q.—That was one of the croBS-channel steamers ? A.—Yes, one of the Great Central Railway Company’s boats. Q.—What would be the tonnage ? A.—The tonnage of that ship would be very similar, I should say as far as I can. gather, to the “ Lincoln ” which I offered in 1914. Q.—What was the tonnage of that boat ? A.—She is smaller, she is 250 feet long and 1,250 tons and she carried 296 ’passengers, and had a speed of 12 knots. Q.—The type of steamer you were on the look out for was a steamer of about 1,000 tons which could carry coals or a steamer of the cross-channel steamer variety ? A.—Yes, with good speed and passenger accommodation. Q.—All the steamers, except the “ Ocamo ” and “ Ururo,” were of one of those two types, were they ? A.—That is quite so. Q.—What was the gross tonnage of the “ Ocamo ” and “ Oruro.” A.—The gross tonnage was 1,919 tons. Q.—Were they sister ships ? A.—Y r es, they were. Q.—Those were the biggest steamers you offered to him, were they ? A.—As far as passenger and cargo boats were concerned I never had an opportunity of getting larger boats : they never seemed to come into the market. Q.—Thope were the biggest steamers offered ? A.—Yes, that I particularly offered but he offered of course for the twcr, they were sister ships. Q.—What type of ship were they ? A.—They have three decks,'so therefore they were cargo and passenger boats. They could be converted for emigrant trading, having three decks. They were rather exceptional boats because it is difficult to find boats of that sort only 300 feet long having three decks unless they are boats really in the emigrant trade. The three deck ship is not so frequently met with. Q.—I understand you only brought to his notice steamers of the types you have mentioned because he had told you that those were his requirements ? A.—That is so ; but then on the other hand if I had had larger boats with good speed I should certainly have offered them but, as I say, at that time, the early paH of 1914, I never seemed to be able to get hold of boats that might suithinf . 8ia 59—11 Q.— 1 understand he left instructions with you that the type of steamer he wanted was a collier of 1,000 tons or fast passenger boats of 1,000 tons ? no ^ so regard to the passenger boats. They could be mger. He never specified. He said “ If you ever come across boats with o plenty ot passenger accommodation and plenty of'speed that are going cheap and the boilers are going all right, let me have them at once,” therefore he never bound me down as to the passenger boat type, but of course with regard to the cargo boats 1,000 tons was the suitable thing. in Q* on ly reference I can find in the correspondence is in the letter of the 29th May 1913 written in Antwerp. The penultimate paragraph says : Have you got another old steamer tp offer me of 1,000 to 3,000 tons even with two decks even without class,” what does that mean ? A.-—-That means without classification at Lloyd’s. That would be possibly ^ at the time when he was wanting to get something on the cheap as he always ) did and nothing came of it so far as passenger boats were concerned. For instance I have some of the correspondence here with Mr. Alexander to show that he went into Mr. Alexander’s office and spoke to him but his price was altogether out of it. What Mr. Alexander writes and says shows that his price is to ° low. I had another boat called the “ Dyle ” in Antwerp at that time and his price there again was absolutely out of it. He would buy anything cheap as regards the cargo boats, but as regards the passenger boats what he wanted was a dilferent type altogether. The cargo boats would only be wanted to do 8 or 8^ knots but the passenger boats he would want would be 11 or 12 knot boats or something like that. 25 Q.—Small steamers ? A.—-Not necessarily, because if he got a boat as long, I may say as the Strand, if it was cheap and very very cheap, ho would buy it, but it would have to have the speed and the passenger accommodation. Q- What do you mean by “ very very cheap.” Do you mean a parti- 39 cular sum or a sum in reference to the steamer ? A. The price would be the market value. He would try to buy below what would be the general market value although it would have to be remarkably cheap to interest him. He was one of those sort of men who was extremely difficult to work with on account of his low ideas of price, otherwise I should 35 have done much more businetes with him. Q.—Is there anything in writing specifying his requirements except this letter of the 29th May 1913 ? A.—That I am not sure of. Have you anything at all. Q.—I have not seen any reference in the correspondence ? 4 Q A.—Then possibly it would not be in existence. I think I had one letter in which there was something mentioned. I think that would come in in 1913. Q.—What I want to know is whether there is anything in the correspon dence as to his requirements except the letter of the 29th May 1913. A.—No, unless of course it is mentioned among the letters. 95 Q-—I h ave looked through the copies and I do not see anything else. A.—Only from what I know of his requirements personally what he would tell me at the time. Q.—Let us first of all keep to the correspondence. Is there anything in writing as to his requirements except' the 'letter of the 29th May 50 with reference to size ? In 1914 he speaks of wanting two steamers of about 1 ,600 to 2,000 tons with cargo and passenger accommodation. Are those the only references to size ? A.—That is as far as I can tell yes ? %6 Q-—Then the only references to size are those in the letters of the 20th • May 1913 and the 19th March 1914 ? A.—And my verbal statement as I said before—I do not want to go over that again—“ If you have cargo and passenger boats with good speed, but they must be cheap, always send them over to me.” So I was never bound down to size, but when it came to the cargo boats he usually wanted a boat of about 1,000 tons but if they were cheap and carrying cargo and passengers and had a good speed somewhere about 12 knots, he would be willing to. buy the boats. But his main feature was always the question of price. He never limited me to any particular size with the cargo and passenger boats of good speed. Q- ' % f n response to those enquiries the biggest passenger steamers you offered him were the “ Ocamo ” and “ Oruro ” ? A.—That is so. * , Q.—All the others were of the cross-channel type ? A- Yes, but if I had had a larger boat I should have offered it to him. If 25 I had a 6,000 tonner I should have sent it out if it did the 12 knots and carried passengers, but I never had the hick to come across a boat of that size. RE-EXAMINED by Mr. Noad on behalf of the claimant the witness said as follows :— Q.—I see that the letters of the 20th September 1913 and the 19th March 20 1914 both speak in general terms of their requirements ? A—Yes, it seems like that to me, but I think if I might go on with the evi dence if it has to be covered when he came across the “ Ocamo ” and “ Oruro ”— this is my point which I should like to emphasise. Both of those boats had a new boiler in 1900 and a new donkey boiler in 1900 and she had good speed and 25 passenger accommodation. Those two boats at &lt;£5,000 each were no doubt cheap : two for £10,000. No doubt that caught his eye. He might have taken something larger but the two combined would mean that those two ships would carry 4,600 tons of cargo and the passenger accommodation would be about 200 all told, therefore it seems, although at that time he may have treated with me go for a boat only of this particular size, 2,300 tons of carrying cargo taking the two combined showed to me that he might even have gone in for something larger if we had had it but I had nothing to offer him.

'Kara Deniz'. 2. Monsieur Lidji explained that he did not represent Mr. Socrates Atychides, the owner of the 'Kara Deniz w but a group of the latter's creditors, and that he desired to make a proposal. He said that the Persian Government had informed Mr. Atychides that they were going to bring the case before the League of Nations. Monsieur Lidji admitted that it was possible that, in English law, Mr. Atychides had no claim, but he expressed the view which was supported by an opinion of Mr. Politis, the Greek Minister in Paris, in his capacity as an international lawyer, that in international law, Mr. Atychides' claims were well founded. In Monsieur Lidji's opinion they were certainly so in equity. His proposal was that, while His Majesty's Government should maintain their attitude in regard^ to the 'Kara Deniz' they should agree to pay compensation to Mr. Atychides for his internment in India, in respect of which the latter had, up to the present time, made no claim, but in regard to which mention is made in the Persian memorandum to the League of Nations. Monsieur Lidji himself would act as intermediary in the matter. 3.

Sir, - 1 % ka h, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to refer to your letter, No. E and 0 4810/28, of the 28th July 1928, regarding the claim of Mr. Socrates Atychides in respect of the s.s. 'Kara Deniz', which was detained at Bombay and seized after the outbreak of war with Turkey in November 1914. 2. Sir John Simon understands that the Persian Government will bring the matter up before the Council of the League of Nations, and it may become of importance to establish whether the action of the Port authorities at Bombay prior to the seizure of the vessel furnished Mr. Atychides with any right of action and whether, if so, any form of action is now open to him. A copy of a memorandum which has been prepared in this Department is enclosed. 3. Sir John Simon is advised that proceedings in this country, based on English law are now out of the question, so far as concerns the Crown as such, but it appears to him important to consider what remedies may have been, and may be now, open to Mr. Atychides at Bombay. In this connexion I am to observe that in their judgment on appeal, a copy of which is enclosed for convenience of reference, the Judicial Committee of the Privy council referred to the contention put forward at the first trial that the ship had been detained by the Government of Bombay either without legal authority or in the unreasonable exercise of a legal authority, and under such circumstances as to warrant the claimant in the Prize The Under-Secretary of State, India OfficePrize proceedings making a claim for damages tlic detention of the vessel. No such contention appears in the records of the proceedings in the possession of this Department 'beyond a reference in the Judge’s notes and in Mr. Atychides’s petition, and I am to enquire whether a full report of these proceedings could he obtained from Bombay. 4. Sir John Simon would be glad to be favoured with the views of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare at his early convenience,as to whether it can be contended that Mr.Atychides failed to exhaust the municipal remedies open to him in India because he did not bring proceedings against the Port authorities at Bombay in respect of the detention of his ship prior to the seizure of the vessel as prize. 5. A copy of this letter has been sent to the Procurator General. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,Vft* produced as that document vat tue authority enoMing the nationality and owneranip of the veeacl. On the 19th September the iort Offioer reported that he understood from uu representative of Meeare oieicson and sona (or uixon and bon*) f a firm entrusted by the owners vith the repair of the mac Milner y of tr*e Kars Jenia, that during the bad weather their motorboat was sunk, that important parts of the Kara i&gt;#nid eaohiner/ which were on board v&gt;ere not likely to be recovered* and that it would take some two or three months to repisee it* On the Sbth September the Government of India informed the Government of Bombay that the consul* General for Persia had received instructions from his Government about the transfer of the &amp;ara ertla to the Perslen flag. 'his wee comaunioated to the ‘ort Offioer. On the 86 th -e^t ember the x’erei&amp;n Consul informed the Pott Of fleer that under instructions from his Government he had ^iven a certificate to e steamer formerly known as Kara venis, but now called Raiaadan, to the effect that she belonged to a er&amp;l&amp;n subject and was under the ersian flag* on the tfth September the iort Officer informed the jersian Consul that as the aster of the Kara Penis had not yet .roduced his ship's register, the document which clearly showe all the necessary particulars as to owner, tonnage, flag, etc* and one that all vessels are required to carry, he could, not accept the vessel’s name aeing changed or her nationality altered* The ersian Consul made further efforts to obtain the recognition of the transfer of the vessel to Persian ownership, bu, wee informed that this was not possible until the snip's register had been produced* On the outbreak of war with Turkey the military authorities placed e guard on thetue vessel, on the 7%h RnTMrtai the uovernaent. of Bombay iiloi - ku i.i* lerslan consul that It was understood tnat a ® r ®l ' n suojsst laid olola to tbs Sara j«nli but tha t no snip's register or bill of .,1. bad boon produced, and the alteration of nationality oeuld not therefore be recognised. Unless, thsrsfore, the Consul or the alleged owner of the &gt;esnel could give any valid reason to tho contrary, tho lovernraent of Bombay propoasd to issue orders for the vessel to be bro tght before the rise Court. On the saae day the Persien consul reoliad that on the ana September he had received a talegrsa from the Peralam consul censra! at Constantinople informing him diet the Kara ^enis had become the property of a Persian subject since l^lb August end aesing hia to name it Hamadan, The Captain of the steamer ■Tie.i tinned the name of the new owner ae taerate, on the ilth September the erelon Consul at Bembsy received another telegram iron the eralan consul osneral at Constantinople •aying ti;&amp;t th# original documents of tbs steamer bad been sent to Basra for cransjaisslon to Bombay and asaina Ms to give a provisional permit to tbe atefcs?er for sailing to casra, Tbe erslan Consul oeneral in India ultimately reosivsd orders to issue a provisional oertifiosts to this stearaer* /he i ersian consul at Bombay Issued the certifieste and informed the i^ort Officere Xhe ^ort Officer demanded the ship’s register and informed the Persian consul that the latter a oertifieate must be endorsed on the ship's register in order that the onange of nationality might be accepted# Xhe Captain repeatedly wired to his masters for tbs ship's ragister but it did not arrive. In the olroumstenoes it appeared to the Persian Consul that the owner of the steamer would probably tahe steps to claim it and he ashed that time pdght5* alght h® ® 11 owed for the owner to do eo« On the 7th December the publio were notified of the constitution of the *ise Court on account of the Kara uenis* JProceedin^s for the Priae court commenced on the 15th December lftr« Socrates Atyctiide* appeerin, to olelm the roloeoo of the vessel and on tha 11th March 1 'It the Court delivered a preliminary Judgment shleh sae based upon Article 57 of tha paolaratlon of London.

There in nothing in t^ie records in our i&gt;osses8ion on this point beyond s note by the Chief Justice. In giving Judgment Chief Justice MeelMd said *To sum up there la a great deal on the record 'to show that Ismail Huchsy transferred the vessel to the ’claimant to evade the consequences to which she would be 'exposed if war broite out., If war had broken out before the *14th September I would have sufficient grounds for condemning the vessel ae lawful prise, but ae even the period of sixty days has been exhausted, 1 must be satisfied 'that in spite of the apparent validity of the transfer, 'the control of the vessel remained in the hand of tbs 'vendors. That may be very difficult if not impossible 'for the captors to prove by direct evidence, but I think 'there is considerable justification for their asking me to 'hold as the evidence stands at present that it points ' inevitably to the conclusion that there was an arrangement 'between the claimant and the vendor that they should 'retain the control of the vessel and use the transfer es s ^eena of getting her to the nearest Turkish port unut?rM th« ! ereian flag* W I therefore direct the oauee to etand over for 'furUier proof, ^ On the $&gt;tfc June, 1919, chief Justice Hec eod delivered e further judgsient* He explained that when he delivered hie preliminary judgment he wee of opinion that he vas bound by the Order in council of the 20th August 1914 to consider the Declaration of London ae governing this case, in vhioh case the vessel could not be condemned ae lawful prise unless he was satisfied that in spite of the apparent validity of the transfer of the vessel to the claimant, the control of the vessel remained In the hands of tne Turkish vendors* Further evidence on thia point had been taken In England on oommlaslon, but owing to the continuance of hostilities, the claimant had been unable to proeure the evidence he warned from Constantinople. Further, owin^ to a recent decision of the i^rivy Council, the oovernment had as*ed him to set down the case for further argument, and he had heard the arguments of counsel on the uueation whether the vessel should not be condemned as lawful prise on the ground that the oommercial domicil of the claimant at the time of the capture wee Turkish* fter referring to a number of oases and to ths avidence which had been adduced, he said that 'on the best consideration that X oan give to these 'questions, I have come to the conclusion that on the out- 'break of war the claii&amp;ant had his commercial domicil in 'Turkey and that at the time of the capture and for many 'months after he had no intention of removing that domicil 'to a neutral country•••**••••*• If the claimant on the 'outbreak of war had directed that the rtilp should remain 'in Bombay end had announced that he dissociated himself 'entirely^entirely from Me bus! ne»» In turkey leaving of Me being able to remove hie property from Turkish M territory to depend on the attitude of the Turkish aovern- 'ment, 1 do not think it mould have been according to the 'law administered by Prise Courts to condemn the ship* but ! the claimant did absolutely nothing towards abandoning or ’denouncing his Turkish domicil Therefore in my opinion on the best consideration I can give to this very 11 difficult ease y the ship muet be eondemed as lawful prise* 'This decision whether reversed or upheld on appeal still '’leaves open the question whether the transfer to the 'claimant was made in good faith”* (copies of the proceeding before the Court *nd of the Chief Justice's two judgments are attaeaed^, : r* Socrates tyohides appealed to the Judicial uornmitt of the Privy council against this judgment, and on the tth July 1928 the Judicial committee delivered their judgment to the effect that there was no ground whatever for Interfering with the eondsanation pronounced by the Chief Justice of Bombay and they advised Hie Majesty that the appeal should be dismissed with coats* Xn givln* judgment the Privy Council referred to the contention put forward at the first trial, that the ship had been detained by the Government at Bombay either without legal authority or in the unreasonable exercise of a legal authority and under such circumstances ae to warrant the claimant In the jrise proceedings making a claim for damages for the detention of the vessel* They observed in this connexion that on the first occasion, either by arrsn.eaent or in the discretion of the beamed Judge ; those questions did not seem to hove been tried and that on the second occasionIt unnecessary to try then because tbs vssssl ess condemned* t 2h&amp;f fttated thet i i was qulta clear th- t •ittlng In appeal tueir ozdahlpe could not Investigate this matter for the purpose of givin* a decision themselves.

The facts, briefly, are as follows:-*^ M. Vahratoglou was in possession of certain documentary evidence which it was believed might secure the condemnation of the ,f Kara Deniz'. Considerable importance was attached to the value of this evidence and it was agreed to give as a reward for it £1,000, to be increased to £10,000 if the vessel was condemned* This offer did not satisfy M* Vahratoglou and the Government of India then expressed their willingness to pay as much as £30,000 if necessary. It was subsequently decided to set down the case for further argument on the evidence already recorded, leaving the matter of M.Vahratoglou*s evidence in abeyance. The case was heard and the vessel condemned on the ground of the claimant’s commercial domicile in Turkey. The evidence which M.Vahratoglou desired to sell did not bear on this point. On the case being taken to the privy Council on appeal the judgnent was upheld without the Crown being called on. In The Secretary to H.M. Procurator General*In the circumatances the Secretary of state for India does not propose to take any further steps with regard to Mr. Silley's communication. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sd. E. J, TURNER, Secretary, Economic and Overseas Department.- /• / Sir, I am directed by His Majesty's Procurator General to forward in original a communication dated the 5th October last addressed to the Secretary of State for War by a Mr. A*C» Silley, acting on behalf of Theodore Vahratoglou, in respect of the latter's claim for a reward for information supplied by him in connexion with the Prize proceedings instituted in the Court at Bombay. Sir Maurice Gwyer observes that on the 19th March 1913 the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury sanctioned a proposal to offer to Mr. Vahratoglou the sum of £1,000, to be increased to £10,000 in the event of the vessel being condemned. He/ The Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l.He has no inTormation as to what steps, if any, were taken in pursuance of that authority. If Air. Silley’g statements are correct and no reward has as yet been paid, it is assumed that the matter will now be taken up with him.

Notwithstanding ,that I have endeavoured for several yc years to obtain some award for the Informant,and have on more than one occasion suggested sthat the amount of his remunerafc- tion should be submitted to ARBITRATION,I regret to say that I have never been favoured with any reply to my^puggestionjon every occasion my suggestion being evaded. I have recently been advised to bring the matter before your notice,being assured that I will receive satisfaction# will you therefore,be good enough,Sir, to peruse the enclosed and tD fix an appointment when I may call at your Department to give further details.

So far,no reply has been received* I therefore beg to place the facts, clearly and frankly before you. Sir, to enable you to form an Jt opinion,and telegraph or write to me^or to the British Legation to be communicated to me* FIRSTLY .allow me to point out that I am an Snglishman-previousJ to the war residing in Constantinople,but now temporarily resident in Athens. That my sole desire and interest in this matter is, that the Prize Court should be placed in full possession of evidence, and that we should not be hoodwinked by Mr Socrates Atychides* Mr Atychides was afSHipowner and Contractor to the Ottoman Govern - ment,and some four or five years ago he became a Persian subject. On the outbreak of War with Turkey, the'HAMADAN ,, happened to be trading between the Red Sea and Persian 0-cilf,and in order to save the steamer,I understand a fictitious sale was arranged between the Director G-eneral of the Ottoman Stm/Nav Co and Mr atychides in xlxx virtue of which she was of course placed under the Persian flag* I also understand thaYpending the flecisionjof the Prize Court, our Authorities have concluded an agreement wiV'h Atychides for the hire of this steamer at £3500,per month,such sum to be regularly deposited in a Bank,it being also stipulated that in the event of Atychidea proving she could have earned a larger amount (provided the Court pronounced a Judgment in his favour)that the Admiralty will indemnify him for such difference,besides several other condi tions in favour of Atychides* Consequently should jfhe proceedings in the Prize Court ter minate favourably for Atychides,it will cost our Exchequer,anything between £30,000 and £50,000,if not more,nay even £t00,000 at the present rates of freights* Mr Atychides,was in partnership with the aforementioned T.B.TBahratoglou (A Cireek, Ottoman Subject) but subsequent to the fore” going details,they quarrelled and separated-Vahratoglou knowing he-—i-.- &gt;- LU 00 o o L&gt;J L'f —1 will never get his share or what is due to him by Atychides,now ^0 oomes forward with documentary evidence which will ppove that the __ HAl;lADAN * e x 11 KARA- DSN IZ 0 is still the property of the Ottoman J/N Go,the alleged sale to Atychides being a fictitious one,and it is only after such evidence has been foun^ conclusive and satisfactory by the Prize Court that he asks for payment of his services in proportion to the amount,or rather based on the amount saved to X the British G-overnment. * Mr Vahratoglou wishes to point out that in the event of 11 RAMADAN ** being condemned as a good prize and should the Turks xtl still remain in power in Constantinople After the 7/ar is over,he could not possibly return there,his business prospects would t»nepe- fore be ruined ahd he would not get his share of what is ^ue to t - the firm of Atychides &amp; Vahratoglou by the °ttoman Government, besides running the risk of his life,consequently all this should notlbe lost sight of in any award you may make. J I understand that the value of the H RAMADAN was fixed at £15,000,at the time the agreement above referred to- was made with Atychides,of course,at todays prices she would fetch very mueh more. In conclusion,! would request that my name likewise that of ^r Vahratoglou should not be brought into Court or disclosed in any way* Awaiting the favour of a reply I have the honoub to be, 3ir ’your obedient servant, (Signed^ Alfred C.Silley ,m —f on O o n: RE* THr- dXEAiJSHIP 'KAiiA-BSNIZ '.

The Persian Government apparently wish to contest the legality of tne condemnation of the tjara ueniz' on tne ground (among others) that it was illegally detained at Bombay before the outbreak of j W!,r w i th Turkey. The Foreign Office letter of the 30tn December 1927 suggested that it was desirable to elucidate this point and to obtain precise information as to the causes which necessitated the stay of the vessel in port until the 5th November 1914. The Government of India were thereupon asked for a reoort and have forwarded the attached report from the Government of Bombay. Neither the Government of India nor the ! ermieri^ of Bombay have directly expressed an opinion on the merits of one conoention of the Persian Government tut the statement of facts now received affords apparently good material for replying to that contention. Tne Foreign Office have now drafted a note to the Persian Minister, which puts into the mouth of the Government of India the statement that they are 'not prepared wo admit that the stay of the vessel a.t Bombay prior to the date of the outbreak of war with Turkey was due to any unauthorised action on the part of the Port Authorities at Bombay', and 'observe that in any case the ship was not in a condition to leave port owing to the loss of essential portions of the i machinery. ' The matter is one on which the Government of India ('or the Secretary of State on their behalf) ^ snould be prepared to express a view, as the action complainedcomplained of was taken by Indian officers and the proceeds of the sale of the Deniz' have gone to Indian revenues. Assuming that the substance of the Foreign Of!ice draft nc^ie commends itself to the Secretary of State for India, it has to be decided whether, before expressing concurrence in the draft note, ne will refer it to the Government of India ior concurrence. The draft note seems to me to be a good one, and, as the Foreign Office wish to treat the matter as urgent, I suggest that the Secretary of State might express concurrence without further reference to India. If such reference is to be made, it should apparently be made by telegraph i the text of the note (which is not lorg) being telegraphed approximately in full ^ - ' ; ' -V Legal Adviser, % Do you think that the Secretary of State might express concurrence in the draft note without further reference to India?

On the 19th August 1914 the Government of Bombay received a report from the Port Officer, Bombay, stating (i) that the Turkish ship ’’Kara Deniz” had arrived in the Bombay Port in ballast in the morning of that date f (ii) that it appeared that she was shortly &lt;7oing to apply i for a certificate to carry pilgrims and (iii) that the Port Officer, Bombay, had received a secret message from the Military that no vessels were to clear for a Turkish Port. The Port Officer also enquired whether Government had any orders to issue in this case. 2. On the same day the Government of Bombay, Political ' Department, accordingly telegraphed to the Government of India, Foreign Department, intimating .the arrival of the s.s.’’Kara Deniz” and the expressed intention to employ her in the Pilgrim traffic and stating that orders had been issued that she should not be interfered with and that she would be given clearance to Turkish Port if she asked for it. It was explained in a subsequent letter !To.430-'.V, dated the 19th August 1914, issued on the same day that the above orders were issued in view of the fact that Turkey had again declared her neutrality. 3. On the 22nd August 1914 the Government of Bombay received information from the Polifce that the ’’Kara Deniz” was boarded on arrival by a Customs rummaging party and' that one small signalling cannon, 2 pistols, 4 revolvers and 1 small mitrailleuse and 43 cartridges were found on board and that a guard of 2 preventive officers was being maintained on board 4. On the 22nd August 1914 the Port Officer, Bombay, received the following letter from the Ottoman Consul General No.293, dated the 22nd August 1914 ; -'I have the honour to inform you that the Turkish Steamer, ^ ^Karadaniz' arrived in the Bombay Harbour on the 19th instant. From the report of the Captain I learn that as the steamer was running only between Turkish -Ports the Ship’s Register is left behind at Constantinople. 'The captain says that he has written to Constantinople ask ing for it. In the meantime I have the honour to request that S you will be-good enough to take the Port Due£ according to he Lloyds Register in order to allow the steamer to be entered • in the Customs House for Inward and Outward clearance. ' 'As soon as the Ship's Register arrives it will be sent for inspection.' \ 5. On the 28th August 1914 the Government of Bombay received I a telegram from the Government of India, Marine Department, No.500-H, dated the 27th August 1914, st*ting that (i) it was understood hat Persia had purchased the Turkish Steamer 'Kara Deniz' then lying in Bombay and that a Persian protection cer tificate was being applied for; (ii) that in view of the possible contingency of war breakin'' out with Turkey before the matter was carried through, an eye should be kept on the vessel, and if any formality such as need to deliberate upon port autho rities of^ the change of flag had to be gone through by the Persian Cons ilate before the transfer was a fait accompli vis a via the British Port authorities, matters should be delayed, if possible, for a few days in the restricting course of routine. 6. On the 29th August 1914 a telegram from the Government of India, Marine Department, was received asking for as complete particulars as possible regarding the 'Kara Deniz' with a view to her identification. The Port Officer was requested to reply to the Government of India direct in the matter. 7. On the 2nd September 1914 the Government of Bombay, Poli tical Department, replied to the Government of India, Marine Department, with reference to their letter Ho-H-500, dated the 27th August 1914, referred to above, stating : - (i) that in accord_ance with the ordinary procedure in the case of a change of ownership the owners or agents of a foreign vessel lying in Bombay harbour had to inform the Collector of Customs, Bombay and the PortPort Officer, Bombay in writing that Lheir vessel had been sold to a subject of another power, and if any doubts existed concerning the sale, the Foreign Consuls of seller and purchaser were asked to verify the correctness of the statement, and (ii) that in the case of the 'Kara Deniz r ', the ship's register was not there and that without it the . Port Officer, Bombay, would refuse to accept any change until it was produced, as that document was the authority showing the nationality and ownership of the vessel. 8. On the 17th September 1914 a telegram from the G-overnment of India, Marine Department, was received inti mating that the name of the 'Kara Deniz' was changed to Hamadah, that a Persian flag was no isted by ner and tnat she had received no Persian articles. 9. The Port Officer, who was asked to make enquiries in the matter, reported on the 19th September 1914 (i) that he had received no report to say that the 'Kara Deniz' had been sold to a Persian firm though she was flying a Persian flag and those on board stated that her name was changed to 'Hemedan'.! (ii) that he did not propose recognising the transfer till the Agents or Master had produced the ship's register, and (iii) that he understood from Messrs. Dixon and Sons’ representative that during the bad weather their motor boat was sunk, that important parts of the 'Kara Deniz's machinery which was on board was not likely, to be recovered, and tnat it would taxe some two or three months to replace it. 10. On the 25th September 1914 a telegram from the Government of India, Marine Department, No. H-1105, aatea the 25th September 1914, was received stating that the Consul General for Persia had then received instructions fromfrom his Government about the transfer of the s.s. 'Kara xieniz’ 1 to the Persian flag and that he had instructed the Persian Consul at Bombay accordingly. This was communicated to the Port Officer. 11. On the 26th September 1914 the Port Officer, Bombay, wrote the following letter to the Master of the 'Kara Deniz' No. 413/41 ;- I have me honour lo inform you that I have received a repoit .0 the eifect that the name oi your vessel has been changed and instead of flying the Turkish Colours Persian are being hoisted. 2. I snail be pleased uo know ii this is so and under whose authority it has been allowed, for until I see the Steamer's Register, no change of name or nationality can occur nor be recognized'. It. On the same day the 26th September 1914 the Master called upon the Port Officer with tne following letter from the Persian Consul No. 562, dated the 26th September 1914 I have the honour co iniorm you that under instructions irom my Government I have given a certificate to a Steamer formerly known as 'Kara Jeniz' but now called 'Hamadan' that she belongs to a Persian Subject and is under the Persian Flag.' ±o. )n the 2/th September 1914 tne Port Officer ad- diessed the following letter to the Persian Consul, Bombay no. 414/41, dated the 27th September 1914':- 1 In reply to your letter No. 562, dated the 26th instant, I have the honour to'state that as the Master of the 'Kara Deniz' 1 has not as yet produced his ship's Register tne document which clearly shows all the necessary particulars as to owner, Tonnage Flag etc. , and one that all vessels are required to carry, I cannot accept the vessel's name oeing changed or her Nationality altered; it will be necessary the above document bein._ first produced. The Ottoman Consul General on the vessel's arrival stated it hadliaci oeen leit at Constantinople. This is over a month ago and they have had ample time to ?/rite and get it.' 14. n the 28th September 1914 the Llaster of the vessel again called at the office of the Port Officer, Bomoay regarding the changing of the ownership and his vessel being transferred to the Persian Flag.

But the Government of Bombay are informed by the Port Officer, Bombay that no ship* s register or Bill of Sale has been produced, and that the alteration of nationality cannot therefore be recognised, the more so as the transfer of ownership shortly before the outbreak of war ‘with Turkey gives reason to believe that it ms made in order to evade the consequences to which an enemy vessel, as such, is exposed• ' 2. Unless, therefore, you or the alleged owner of the ves 3 d can give any valid reasons to the contrary, the Government of Bombay propose to issue orders for the detention of the vessel and for bringing it before the Bombay Prize Court for orders. w 3. The favour of a very early reply is requested. 20. On the same day 7th November 1914 the Government of Bombay received the following letter from Hr. Mirza Ali Akhar Khan Consul for Persia No. 568, dated the 7th November 1914 'I am in receipt of your letter Ho. 2718-W, dated the 7th instent *nd in reply thereto have the honour to state as follows On 2nd September 1914 I received a telegram from the Persian Consul General at Constantinople informing me that the Steamship 'Karadeniz' hi d become the property of a Persian subject since 2/15 August and asking me to name it M Hamadan M . The Gaptain of the Steamer saw me about the same time ? nd asked me for a certificate for the ste mer and for permission to change its name and to hoist the Persian PI'g on it. The C pt in f s telegram mentioned the name of the new owner s Socrate who I am given toY unc.e- st nd is a well-knov/n Persian shipowner in Const ntinople. I referred tlie matter to my Consul General in India for his orders.- I • received another telegrain from the Persian Consul General at Constantinople on the 13th September saying that the original documents of the steamer had been sent to Basra for ransmission to Bombay and asking me to give a provisional permit to the steamer for sailing to Basra. I referred this telegram also to my Consul General. The Consul General in India was in telegraphic communication! with the Foreign Office Tehran for sometime in connection with this Steamer and ultimately received orders to issue a provisional certificate to this steamer. Unuer the orders of the Consul General I I issued such a certificate ^nd informed the Port Officer of the s^rne. The Port Officer demanded the ships Register • nd in a personal . interviev; had with him informed me that my certificate must be endorsed on the Ship’s Register in order that the change, of n‘- tionality may be accepted by him. The C' ptain repeatedly wired to his masters for the ship’s register but the same evidently has not yet arrived. I received a letter from the Captain on the 5th instant asking me to put myself in telegraphic communication with the owner of the ship. I have not acceded to'his request as I do not consider myself justified in putting my Government to heavy expenses on account of a private steamer. Under the circumstances it appears probable that the alleged owner of the steamer will take steps to claim it for himself and as communication with him in Constantinople has become difficult on account of the state of War I have the honour to request the t Government may be pleased to stay their nands for some re - son. ole time and give a chance to the alleged owner to prove his Persian Nationality and the bona fides of his purclr se.' 21. On the 13th November 1914 the Secretary, Defence Committee, Bombay Defences, was asked in the Government of Bombay letter 2995-W, dated the 13th November 1914, to seise the vessel formally on behalf of Government. 22. The Government of India, Department of Commerce, and Industries, were informed accordingly in the Government of Bombay letter No.3372-W, dated the 23rd November 1914.

In this regard it is observed that in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council of July 5th, 1922 on the case, reference is made towards the end of that ^ pV 1 judgment to certain contentions made at the first trial of the vessel that the ship was detained by the Government of \\ Bombay either without legal authority or in the unreasonable exercise of a legal authority* 5.

'Hamadan^ or '^aradeniz” LB, VAHilATOOLOlI'S OL.UL: Vie have 0 oen instructed to approach you v/ith regard to the above matter. In investigating the facts of this case and the claim of Hr, Vahratoglou, it would appear from the correspondence handed to us that the considered decision of the India Office is that this Claimant, altnough ne at the request of His LIsjesty’s Government (Embassy in Athens) supplied them with certain information, for nhiuh they asked, and which was sent by the Legation to the Prize Court at Bombay, is not entitled to any remuneration whatever (1) because the ship was finally condemned on different grounds from those with wnicn tne Claimant’s evidence was concerned; (2) because no bargain as t o what remuneration he ms to receive was concluded. It is admitted that Mr, Vahratoglou at the instance of his friend Mr, Alfred Silley, an Englishman at the time residing in Athens and patriotic enough to dislike the idea of the Turks succeeding in the Prize Court in getting a fictitious sale admitted, called on several occasions at the British Legation in Athens, saw Mr, A.T. Waugh Mr, Arthur Hill, and Mr, Cumberbatch of the Commercial Department, REC2 E. &lt;fc 0.

These interviews took place while legal proceedings as to the ownership of the ship were in abeyance and because the British Government wanted evidence to prove that the sale to Atjchides was a fictitious one. At all these interviews (there appear to have been at least six) the question of payment to L£r. Vahratoglou for the infor.mtion he was giving was discussed, and he v/as invited to say at what figure he put his claim. It should be noted that he did not withhold his information or refuse to give it until a definite bargain had been arrived at as to his remuneration, and at the interview of the 1st ilay 1918 he specifically stated that he would leave this to the generosity of the British Government. Is it true to say that the ship was finally condemned on different grounds frem those with which Hr. Vahratoglou 1 s evidence was concerned ? The CJase had stood over for ’'this proof by the Plaintiff to establish the bona fides of the transfer, and the final Judgment of the Court rejected the Plaintiff's claim as to the fictitious sale and pronounced the steamship to have belonged to enemies of the Crown and as suoh liable to confiscation. The preliminary Judgment (llth Uarch 1915) stated that the transfer of the ship to Atyohides was complete, but that the bona fides of the transfer was in doubt. It is edmitted in this connection that copies of all the documents provided by lir. Vahratoglou were sent to the proper authorities and were received by them before the date when the final Judgnent was given* The shipwas ultimtely condeianed on the ground that it belonged showed that the alleged sale to Atyohides was a fictitious one and it appears that this evidence was of assistance to Counsel for the Crown Case. Mr. Vahratoglou's second claim is that the documents were so marked by the British Legation at Athens that he cannot produce them in any Turkish Court without giving away the fact that he acted as an informer. As regards this the Foreign Office rely on a statement made on Mr. Vahratoglou*s behalf in May 1916 that having quarrelled with Atyohides , he knew he would never get anything out of him. Circumstances alter. He may have thought this at the time, but it does not follow that he thinms so now, and in any case the action of the Legation at Athens in marking the documents for their own purposes has precluded his using them, whatever chance he might now have. This man relied in good faith upon the generosity of the British Government. He did not insist upon driving a bargain as to his remuneration before he supplied the Embassy in Athens with any information. We believe and hope that on further consideration you will come to the conclusion that he has not been fairly treated and that he is entitled to reasonable remuneration. He must be entitled to something, if only for the trouble and time involved in the interviews which he had with the Legation authorities, the time his original documents were retained by the Embassy and the fact that being marked by the Embassy, they are new useless to him.
