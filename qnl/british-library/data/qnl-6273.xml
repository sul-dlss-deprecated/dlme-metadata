Information received during the Insecurity of Persian month showed that the trade route's. insecurity, which had hitherto distinguished the southern routes, had now spread to the roads between Hamadan and Kermanshah and from thence to Tabriz. The General Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia considered that, owing to the danger of remitting money, the transaction of any business was becoming an impossibility. 2. Hitherto, with the exception of the movement in The situation in Persia. Azerbai j an aad an abortive rising as far east as Meshed (vide paragraphs 6 and 9 of Memorandum for December 190^), popular discontent at the government of the Shah had elsewhere not shown itself in acts of overt hostility. But, early in January, Disturbances in Ispahan. Ispahan followed the example set by Tabriz. The revolt was due partly to the Nationalist movement, partly to the feeling aroused by the corruption and oppression of the Governor. For two or three days Ispahan was a scene of anarchy and confusion, the bazaars being pillaged by the Shah's soldiers. The Governor and other local authorities took refuge in the British Consulate. On the 3rd January, how ever, order was restored by the arrival of the Samsam-es-Sultaneh, who had lately been deposed by the Shah from the position of Illkhane. The Governor tendered his resigna tion, but the Shah, in spite of remonstrances from the representatives of Great Britain and Russia, who, as the only means of guaranteeing securitv, urged His Majesty to appoint the Samsam-es-Sultaneh, nominated the Firman Eirma as Governor of Ispahan. In the meantime, the British and Russian Consuls at Ispahan were instructed to hold the Sarasam-es-Sultaneh, who was defacto Governor, responsible for public order and for the security of British and Russian nationals. Following the usual Persian policy of “ divide et impera” the Firman Firma decided2 to despatch a Deputy in advance accom panied by 300 Bakhtiari under the Sardar Zafar and other Chiefs in the hope of foment ing dissensions among the Bakhtiari. On the 7th January, the Firman Firma telegraphed to the Samsam announcing his appointment as Governor of Ispahan; the latter’s reply, though containing professions of loyalty, was a frank espousal of the nationalist cause; and, in an interview with His Majesty’s Consul-General, he professed loyalty and most conciliatory sentiments and stated that he was ready to retire on receiving guarantees for the constitutional rights of Ispa han and for his own safety. He added, how ever, that, if the Shah sent forces, he could not abandon the people of Ispahan, nor they him. On the 8th January, the Samsam issued a proclamation to the effect that the inhabitants of Ispahan should, within three days, appoint representatives for a local constitutional assembly, otherwise the Bakhtiari would with draw from the town taking with them the three chief priests, and abandoning the place to the mercy of the Shah and his troops. About 200 or 300 Bakhtiari with their Chiefs are said to have left Tehran on the 12th January, the Firman Firma’s deputy following the next day. It seems, however, highly improbable that the Shah’s attempt to foster dissensions between the Bakhtiari will he successful. All the information received goes to show that the Bakhtiari tribesmen will not fight with one another, and it is reported that the Sardar Assad from Paris has in structed his tribesmen at Tehran and Ispahan to throw in their lot with the Nationalists. A more probable development is that the Samsam’s successful usurpation in defiance of the Shah may incite other tribes to follow the Bakhtiari’s example, e.#., the Kashgais at Shiraz and the Kalhors at Kermanshah, and it is reported that the Chief of the Kashgais has actually been incited to try a similar coup in Fars. In the meantime, the Bakhtiari in Ispa han, who are said to number about 1,500, are provisioning and fortifying the town, and, on the security of the taxes, are trying to raise a loan of 20,000 tomans. They have also arrested the official charged by the Persian Government to collect taxes. The late Governor of Ispahan left Ispahan for Kashan escorted by three Bakhtiari Khans and numerous horsemen on the morning of the 27th January. His efforts to obtain a guarantee for his safety from the British Consulate were unsuccessful, His Majesty’s Consul-General being instructed not to engage British responsibility in any way after the Governor’s departure from the Consulate- General. On the 29th January, a so-called regiment variously estimated at from 300 to500'strong left Tehran for Ispahan. On the 31st January, Sir G. Barclay telegraphed that the Firman Firma was trying to evade going to Ispahan. At the commencement of the outbreak at Ispahan the family of the Zil-es-Sultan implored His Majesty’s Consul-General to protect them and asked that the British flag might be hoisted over a garden belonging to them, so that they might use it as a place of refuge. Sir G. Barclay authorised the hoisting of the flag and directed our Consul-General to protect the Zil’s family: he also requested the Russian Charge d’Affaires to instruct his Consul to co-operate with our Consul-General in the matter. 00. (Vide parag'aph 1 of the Memoran dum for December 190^.) At the end of , December, representa- The position at Tehran. .. ' - 1 . , tions were made by Sir G. Lowther to the Porte that it was not desirable to encourage political bast at the Persian capital, and that, if the safety of the bastis at the Turkish Embassy could be guaranteed, they should be compelled to quit the Legation. But, on the 2nd December, despite the apparently genuine efforts of the Turkish Chargd d’Affaires to induce them to leave, 270 bastis were reported to be remain ing at the Turkish Legation. (Videparagraph 6 of the Memorandum , .. for December 1908.) Situation in Azerbaijan. tvt x* t x The rsationalists are reported to have suffered a defeat towards the end of December at the hands of the Governor of Maraga—otherwise the position at Tabriz remains unaltered. The Nationalists, evidently with a view to replenishing their deplet ed exchequer, stated that they would cancel the Indo-European Telegraph Com- peny’s concession as regards Azerbaijan, unless the local traffic were re-opened. This traffic had been suspended, because the Nationalists claimed the receipts accruing therefrom. The London Office had granted the local branch of the Company permission to deal with this traffic, but the Nationalists threatened to cut the line if the receipts were not handed over to them. The Company informed the Persian Gov ernment that, if the line were cut, they would demand £500 a day indemnity for disorder, and asked for permission to hand over the receipts to the Nationalists. Sir G. Barclay reported that he and his Russian colleague would support the Company, should the necessity arise, and, in the meantime, the British and Russian Consuls had been directed to point out to the Nationalists that serious conse quences would arise, if the line were cut and international traffic interrupted thereby; they would also urge the Nationalist party to await the settlement of the question, withwhich the two Legations were dealing, at the capital. Pending the consent of the Persian Government, the Company accepted the Nationalists’ terms, and on the 7th January a delegate of the local assembly took up his post in the Customs to control the receipts for local traffic. (Fide paragraph 9 of the Memo- r , randum for December Riots (tt &amp;A.(}SiI€(X 9 -| \ X j • i 1 1908.) It is reported that, although the revolutionary movement proper is at an end, considerable disturb ance is being caused by revolutionary irre- concilables. These are, in many instances, Russian subjects (Turks and Caucasians), and the Russian Consul-General would appear to be unwilling to take stringent measures against them. The Governor-General, who is uneasy at the present state of affairs, maintains his guns in position near the Ark, and has pickets in the city. 3. On the 4th January, Sir G. Barclay German instructions telegraphed that in fer the Persian Army. formation had reached the Russian Legation which led them to believe that the Shah was negotiating with the German Government for the engagement of German officers as instructors for the Persian Army. The Russian Legation doctor, who is attached to the Palace, declared that the question of German military instructors had been definitely settled, and that several officers and non-commissioned officers had already been engaged. On the other hand, the Shah, in an audience granted to the Russian Charge d’Affaires on the 15th January, declared that there was no truth in this story. 4. On the 31st December, Sir G. Seizure of Bank moneys Barclay reported that by the Ain-ed-Dowieh. the Ain-ed-Dowleh had plundered 25,000 tomans, the property of the Imperial Bank of Persia. He represented the matter to the Persian Government and was able to report later that 15,000 tomans had been refunded by the Ain-ed-Dowleh, and 7,000 by the Persian Government, and that he was pressing for a recovery of the balance of the amount. Subsequently the Ain- ed-Dowleh appears to have seized a further sum of 30,000 tomans which was being sent to the Tabriz Branch of the Imperial Bank by post. It was out of this amount that the refund of 15,000 tomans had been made. Sir G. Barclay, while holding the Persian Govern ment responsible for the loss, demanded the attachment of the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s house in Tehran. He also informed the Grand Vizier and the Minister of War that, in consequence of this further act of plunder, he and his entire staff would absent themselves from the two banquets which were to be given to the Corps Diplomatique that week. The Shah begged Sir /G. Barclay to reoonsider this decision, and, as a condition of his consent, the Minister demanded that the Bushire Customs should be pledged by the Persian Government from the 6th of January as security for all moneys appropriated by the Ain-ed-Dowieh from the Imperial Bank of Persia. The demand was granted. 5. The Persian Special Envoy (vide Persian deputation to p&amp;Vdgt'aph 4 of Jlletno- Hussia. randum for December 1908), on liis arrival at St. Petersburg!!, was received by M. Isvolsky, but not by the Emperor. On the 2tth December, the Envoy called on ills Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburg!! and complained of the severe attitude of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs. He spoke at great length as to the need for reforming the Persian Administration before convoking an assembly for which he considered the country was not yet prepared. He added that Persia’s more pressing need was money and that he would see some European financiers in regard to the matter. Both Sir G. Barclay and Sir A. Nicolson consider it probable that the Envoy will seek financial aid from Germany when he proceeds to Berlin on leaving St. Petersburgh. This opinion is also shared by M. Isvolsky, who has requested the Russian Ambassador at Berlin to ascertain what the Envoy does during his stay in Berlin. On the 5th January, Sir A. Nicolson telegraphed that the Envoy, who was then in Berlin, had left him (Sir A. Nicolson) palpably annoyed at not being received by the Russian Emperor and at the cold reception accorded to him by M. Isvolsky. 6. ( Vide paragraph 5 of the Memorandum Recall Of the Zil-es- for December 1908.) Sultan. It appears, from in formation received during the past month, that the Zil-es-Sultan has received a friendlv message from the Shah who desires his return to Persia. His Royal Highness’s brother has also begged him to return, and he has received an order to the same effect from the Persian Prime Minister. The Zil was disposed to comply : but the Russian and British (-iovern- ments intervened and pointed out to him that his return to Persia was undesirable until the country was less disturbed. They further informed him that, if he insisted on returning to Persia, it would be at his own risk and peril, and that they could no longer be respon sible for the protection of his property or of his life. The Zil replied that he submitted to the ad rice of the two Powers and would remain in Europe; but he pointed out that it was impossible for him to remain in exile for an indefinite period : it was disagreeable to him and, in addition, he could not afford the cost6 of living abroad as well as the expenses of his establishments in Persia. The Zil also request ed that, in view of the disturbances at Ispahan, {vide paragraph 2 above) fresh instructions might be given to the British Consulate there to carefully safeguard his interests and to watch over his family. The Taki Zade is reported to have returned to Tabriz. This individual had been exiled as a result of the Shah’s coup last year, and His Majesty’s Government had guaranteed his life and property. Sir. G. Barclay informed His Majesty’s Consul-General that he considered that the Taki Zade’s return cancelled our guarantee regarding his life and property. 7. {Vide paragraph 10 of the Memorandum for December 1908.) His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain Bussian interference reports that the village in Seistan. 0 f Gurguri has been handed over by the Deputy Governor to Hussain Khan, the Bussian protege. M. Bravine informed Major Kennion on the 5th December that he had received no answer to his telegram to the Russian Legation, and that the matter had apparently been settled in Hussain Khan’s favour “ by the Karguzar ”. 8. The usual disputes are said to be The Seiatan Water occurring between question. Afghans -and Seistanis on the border about the digging of new canals. Major Kennion has advised the Afghan Brigadier to take joint action with the Seistanis both in the direction of strengthening the Shahgul Band, and clearing out silt from the Rud-i-Sim. Captain Daukes, who recently returned from a tour in Miankangi, reports that there is no fear of the water question assuming an acute form this season. 9. {Vide paragraph 11 of the Memo- Bobberies on the Perso- randum for December Afghan frontier. 7908.) Major Kennion reports that robberies by Afghans on the roads between Seistan and Kain have become very numerous lately, and that the Karguzar com plains that his letters on the subject to the Afghan frontier officials are disregarded. The Karguzar now intends, failing a satisfactory reply, to represent the case officially to His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate in Seistan ; and has already telegraphed to the Hissam-ud- Dowleh to take measures to protect the roads and also to the Foreign Minister complaining of the supineness of the Afghan authorities. The Afghan Brigadier, whom Major Kennion met on a recent visit to the frontier, said that he would look into the matter when he visited Jo wain, as he shortly intends doing.7 © 10. (Vide paragraph 23 of the ’Memo- The Khaf-Seistan tele- randum for October graph line. 190 Qj It is rPported that the annual repairs to the Khaf~Seistan telegraph line, which are usually carried out in the autumn, have not been undertaken hitherto. The line will therefore probably be in a bad condition when it is handed over by the Russians. 11. Major Kenmon had a very friendly Interview with interview with the Afghan frontier offi- Afghan frontier offi- cial8 ‘ cials, on the 20th De cember 1908, at Milak in Afghan territory. 12. Major Kennion reports that, in order Proposed loan to the to repay an old loan Shaukat-ui-Muik. from the Russian Bank, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk applied, but without success, to the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia for a loan of tomans 15,000, offering as security to pledge his gold and jewels. Major Kennion was of opinion that, in view of the previous history of our deal ings with the Shaukat and the possibility of his being again made Governor {vide para graph 20 of the Memorandum for October 190b), it would be well to assist him. He therefore asked His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, by telegraph, to consider the advis ability of moving the Imperial Bank of Persia in the matter. The Minister replied that the Bank authorities were very reluctant to lend money in the present situation; and that he did not see his way to press upon them a course which is regarded as inconsistent with their banking interests. 13. (Vide paragraph 12 of the Memo- Passport fees in randum for December Seistan. 1908.) His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran has informed Major Kennion that the Controller of Passports has sent telegraphic orders to resume the tax of krans five only for servants of British subjects and for camel drivers. 14. {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- Arms traffic in the randum for December Persian Gulf. 7^8.) On the 15th January, the Secretary of State expressed his concurrence, as regards the future measures to be taken for tbe suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, in the views of the Government of India, which had been communicated to him on the 6th idem, to the effect that political and financial considerations precluded the use of troops in Persian territory or any great increase of naval activity. The course proposed by the Government of India of continuing naval activity with the ships that were available was approved, and it was decided in accordance with Sir G. Barclay’s recommendation that it was desirabletemporarily to withdraw the telegraph staff at Dehaneh to Koh-i-Malik Siah. The Secretary of State added that there was no objection to the temporary retention of troops at Robat or to the reinforcement, if necessary, of the telegraph staff guards along the coast. On the 23rd January, Sir G. Barclay stated that tbere was no necessity to take imme diate steps for the removal of the staff from Dehaneh. From information received from Maskat, it appears that, during the period 6th Decem ber 1908 to the 9th January 1909, 2,300 rides, with the usual quantity of ammunition, were shipped by arms-runners to the Mekran Coast. 15. {Vide paragraph 7 of the Memo- Ahwaz-Borasjun tele- randum for December graph line. 1908.) On the 8th December 1908, Sir G. Barclay telegraphed to Sir E. Grey that the Indo-European Telegraph Department would probably receive from the Persian Minister of Telegraphs a proposal to take over control of the reconstruction and maintenance of the Arabistan telegraph lines, t&gt;., from Mohammerah to Borasjun and from Dizful to Ahwaz, and that the Department bad also been informed that the Shah wished the wooden posts to be gradually replaced by iron ones, which would cost from £6,000 to £14),000, according to the quality to be used. It appears from a Memorandum drawn up by Mr. Kirk (Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department) that, should the proposal referred to in Sir G. Barclay’s telegram be received, the Indo- Europeqn telegraph Department would be prepared to accept it, and, provided that, in addition to other minor stipulations, the Persian Telegraph Department would undertake to procure an extension of the concessions till 1945, would offer in the first instance to reconstruct the Arabistan line on behalf of the Persian Telegraph Department at a cost of some £6,000 and to spend some £600 per annum in maintaining it sub sequently. In addition to this, should it prove necessary in order to secure the exten sion of the concessions, the Indo-European Telegraph Department would be further pre pared to offer to advance to the Persian Telegraph Department a lump sum not exceeding £10,000, being ten years’ rental of the Central Persian line. In a telegram, dated the 9th December, Sir A. Nicolson pointed out that it had been originally decided to consider the question of the prolongation of the concessions along with the transfer of the Tehran-Khanikin rights. He doubted therefore the advisability of combining it now with the question of the control of the Arabistan line which had been dealt with independently of Russia.9 \ 4 I An agreement in principle for the control of the line was come to on the afternoon of the 25th December between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Telegraphs, and the Indo-European Telegraph Department, and proposals were to be submitted in writing by the Ministers for the consent of the Shah, who, it was expected, would not delay his sanction. Sir G. Barclay reported that he had authorised Mr. Barker (Director of the Department at Tehran) to consent to forego immediate payment for the iron posts referred to above, in the event of the Department being entrusted with the repairs and control of the line, as, if immediate payment were insisted upon, it would be hopeless to expect to obtain control. Moreover, it was possible that what ever amount was due on account of iron posts, might be used later as a quid pro quo for the prolongation of our telegraph concessions. 16. (Vide paragraphs 19-21 of the Karan irrigation oon- Memorandum for cession. April 1907.) On the 18th January 1909, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphed that he had received in formation that a Dutch Syndicate had obtained a concession for an irrigation scheme in the Karun valley. Sir G. Barclay had questioned the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject and, the following day, the latter handed him a copy of a document granting M. de Sturler, late Netherlands Minister, Tehran (who is at present in Europe), a two years’ option from the 10th January for a ‘’concession d’exploita- tion a TAhwaz”. Sir G. Barclay promptly reminded the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the note, dated the 2nd October 1906, from Sir C. Spring-Rice to the Ala-es-Sultaneh, to the effect that, in view of the interests possessed by British subjects in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz and the very considerable commercial and political changes, that an irrigation project was calculated to introduce into the existing situation, His Majesty’s Government were confident that no definite step would be taken in the matter without previous com munication to them (see paragraphs 21 and 22 of the Memorandum for October 1906). He also asked His Excellency to keep him informed of the progress of events, and was directed by the Foreign Office to inform the Persian Government that, as they had dis regarded the terms of Sir C. Spring-Rice’s note, His Majesty’s Government reserved their right to take objection to the scheme (vide paragraph 15 of the Memorandum for March 1907). Sir G. Barclay also, under instruc tions from the Foreign Office, directed the Political Resident at Bushire to inform the Sheikh of Mohammerah of what was passing.10 to sound Mm as to his views, and to keep in touch with him (ride paragraphs 19-20 of the Memorandum for April 1907). Subsequently Major Cox reported to the Government of India that after consulting Sir G. Barclay, he had, on the 31st December 1908, informed the Sheikh that there had been no further developments of the Karun irrigation question. The Sheikh had repeated his apprehensions, and begged Major Cox to reiterate and press on his behalf his former request for a loan for the purpose of financing a not too ambitious irrigation scheme himself, to he worked for him by a suitable British syndicate (vide paragraph 11 of the Memorandum for March 1907). The Sheikh was very much in earnest and asked for a telegraphic reply. Major Cox apprehended that it would be a serious shock to the Sheikh to hear the news of the present concession, as he had from the first left himself entirely in the hands of the British Government and relied on them to look after his interests. In communicating the foregoing particulars to His Majesty’s Government, the Government of India observed that they regarded the situ ation with anxiety : that, if given a free hand or supported, the Sheikh could probably make any work by the concessionaire impossible ; and that they would like to suggest that Major Cox should go to Mohammerah to discuss the situation with the Sheikh and reassure him. He could, however, do nothing unless fully in formed as to the nature and scope of the con cession and the result of the objection which had been lodged by His Majesty’s Government. It was also necessary to know whether the con cession referred to could even now be cancelled or neutralised by a counter concession. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India replied on the 28th January that he would consider the suggestions of the Government of India in consultation with the Foreign Office. Meanwhile, the Persian Government, in reply to Sir G. Barclay’s note, stated that, should a company be formed, and a conces sion be granted under the option, the British Government would have the right to object to anything contrary to their interests, and that they (the Persian Government) would take suitable measures for the removal of such objections. British interests being identical with those of the Sheikh, Sir G. Barclay presumed that, if the Sheikh’s interests could he effectively safeguarded, there would be no objection to the British Government continu ing to maintain a neutral attitude. He also pointed out that, in the absence of a Dutch .Representative, he was unable to discover how the matter was likely to develop. He had private information that something more definite than a mere option had been granted. * *• t#. 11 and suggested that it might he well for His Majesty’s Government to remind the Nether lands Government of the conditions on which it had been agreed to remain neutral in the matter. 17. In regard to the assurances to be Relations with the P^O^ph Sheikh of Mohaimnerah o2 oj the Memorandum and the Bakhtiari f or J u l y to the Sheikh of Moham- merah and the Bakhtiari Khans, Sir E. Grey informed Mr. Marling in a despatch, dated the 31st July 1908, that it would be undesirable at present to give the Bakhtiari Khans any assurances beyond an expression of friendly sympathy, but that, in Ihe case of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the general assurances already given to him in 1902 (viz., that the British Government would protect Mohammerah against naval attack by a Foreign Power, whatever pretext for such action might be alleged, and also, that, so long as the Sheikh' remained faithful to the Shah and acted in accordance with the advice of the British Government, they would continue to give him their good offices and support), might be repeated, and extended to his successors. It might further be pointed out that His Majesty’s Government had engaged to respect the independence and integrity of Persia; and this involved the maintenance of the status quo in that country and included the continuance of the Sheikh’s present state of autonomy.. External aggression on him would therefore constitute an infringement of Persian integrity, w hich was recognised by the Anglo-Russian Convention. Mr. Marling was directed to instruct His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire to address a communication to the Sheikh in the above sense, and His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz to take an opportunity of offering to the Khans an assurance of the friendly sympathy of His Majesty’s Govern ment towards the Bakhtiari tribe. Major Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, communicated the necessary assurances to the Sheikh in a letter, dated the 1^; December 1908. Intimation has not yet been received of the delivery of the message intended for the Bakhtiari Khans, as His Majesty’s Vice-Consul has been on tour in the north. 18. (Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- Hormuz red oxide randum for October concession. 7^8.) On the 26th September 1908, Mr. Ellinger informed the Board of Trade that the Muin w 7 ould be willing to form a company for the workingof the oxide concession, provided that he received satis factory assurances of protection by His Majesty’s Government for himself and his12 eons in the event of such a company being formed in England. The Mu in was informed in reply that, in the event of a company being formed, he could rely upon the absolute protection of his property and upon the bene volent protection of the British Government during the currency of a bond fide contract, provided that the contract had been concluded before the need for protection arose. On the 7 th November, Mr. Wilson Fox communicated to the Foreign Office the result of his efforts to bring about a settlement between Messrs. Ellinger and Strick. Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. refused to enter into the company proposed by the Muin on the grounds that the terms were much too onerous. Nor would the firm take up a contract for the purchase of oxide in view of the uncertainty of finding a market for the commodity. Mr. Ellinger, who was unable to float the company unaided, thereupon addressed the Muin advising him to offer more reasonable terms for the form ation of a company. On the 17th December, acting on instruc tion received from Sir E. Grey, Sir G. Barclay telegraphed the following summary of the Muin’s firman of 1904*:— “The Muin is con finned in his posses sion of the islands of Hormuz, Larak, Bosta- neh, Henjam and Kishm, and also of Minab and Khamer on the mainland, which places have been rented by him and placed in his charge. In addition to the original amount of Tomans 16,000 he must pay a further sum of Tomans 10,000 for rent and taxes. '* “The islands and places cited are en trusted to the Muin for the future, and, as was the case in the past, they shall be regarded as specially vested in him. No exactions will be made from him beyond the amounts already particularised. The Muin is entrusted with the collection and administration of taxes and he shall retain the difference between the actual and assessed taxation of the places mentioned; also all profits obtained from the sulphur, salt and red oxide mines. Interfer ence by officials at the places concerned is forbidden On the 21st December, Sir E. Grey telegraphed to Tehran that Mr. Ellinger had announced the conclusion of a three years* contract between himself and Messrs. Andrew Weir for the sale of Hormuz oxide. 19. Prior to the conclusion of a contract Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s for the Hormuz red sions in the Persian oxide {vide paragraph Gutf- 18 supra), a difficulty arose in the settlement of the question of a concession for the deposits on the island of Sirri, owing to a claim preferred by the Muin to the effect that the general terms of hisn 13 firman of 1904 {vide paragraph 18 above) covered that island. When it was pointed out that the firman in question contained no mention of Sirri, the Muin stated that he was in possession of other firmans conferring on him the right to mine for red oxide, and that these concessions extended to all the islands in the Persian Gulf. He said that he had not access to the originals of those firmans at the present time. Sir G. Barclay examined a copy of one of the firmanSy which spoke of “ all red oxide minps in the Persian Gulf” and another of “red oxide in all ports of the Persian Gulf”, hut the Muin stated that no places were mentioned by name in any of his firmans except that of 1904. In this, however, no mention is made of Nabiyu Farur, Sirri, or Little Tamb: the islands on which Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. desire | vide paragraph 21b of the Memorandum {Arabian affairs) for November iy08) to obtain concessions. 20. [Vide paragraph 174 of the Memoran- Abu Musa red oxide dum {Arabian affairs) concession. for September VjO^f] In a letter, dated the 29th November, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the German Consul had informed him (Major Cox) that, though from time to time he had reminded Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. of their obligation to give notice of their intention to recommence shipping the material, that firm had not moved in the matter. Hassan Samaiyah had consequently—though he had been informed by the Resident that he was at liberty to do so—taken no steps to remove more material to the shore. This inactivity of the German firm, coupled with information which Major Cox had received to the effect that the firm’s last shipment was lying unsaleable at Hamburg, led to a reasonable doubt as to whether Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. had, as they alleged, for ward contracts for the supply of red oxide. Major Cox further discussed the question of the recommencement of mining operations. He had been informed of a probable request from Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. for a sample shipment of 500 tons. If this w r ere pre ferred, he suggested that the Residency Agent’s brother should be instructed to proceed with mining operations and be guaranteed against loss. If not, it would be better to postpone fresh mining until some demand was notified. On the 3rd January, the Secretary of State was informed of the position of affairs, and it was pointed out that, in the statement of the German case [vide paragraph 38 of the Memorandum {Arabian affairs) for March 1908] stress w r as laid on the loss which Messrs. Wonckhaus w'ould suffer owing to their failureto supply oxide iu accordance with the terms of their forward contracts. In view of the doubt which the Resident expressed as to the existence of such contracts, it seemed desirable, if possible, to obtain definite in formation from the German Government, as to their nature and the intentions of Messrs. Wonekhaus as to further shipments unless there was a demand for oxide. In the circumstances, the Government of India were disposed to agree with Major Cox’s recom mendations that the Agent’s brother should postpone the recommencement of mining operations, until there was some demand for oxide.

He stated that he was informing Major Cox of the action which he had taken and w r as suggesting to him that the question of the punishment of the men still at large should be held over until the spring, when, if they returned to the pearl fisheries, they might perhaps be captured. 22.

The Secretary of State agreed that there was no objection to the position being explained to the Sultan by the Political Agent. The Political Resident at Bushire was informed accordingly on the 22nd January and was directed to issue the neces sary instructions to the Political Agent at Maskat.

The situatioa in Persia. ^ ^ political situation appears to be increasing and the chances of a reconciliation between the Shah and his people are becoming less probable. The eiforts of the British and Russian repre sentatives to obtain the restoration of a consti tutional regime have so far been unavailing. The Nationalist party have been disturbed by rumours of the intended imposition of Anglo- Russian control which have arisen from specu lation as to the progress of the pour par ers between England and Russia with regard to Persia. On the 17th January, Sir A. Nieolson forwarded to His Majesty’s Government a copy of a Memorandum received from M. Isvolsky in regard to Persia. The Russian proposals are summarised as follovvs :— (1) To recommend to the Shah in a friendly manner, without in the least depart ing from the principle of non-intervention in Persian internal affairs, that he should summon to his councils, capable and energetic men, who have in the past given proof of their desire to extricate Persia from the dithcult position in which she is placed, and specially to mention Nasr-ul-Mulk and Saad-ed-Howleh. (2) To tell the Shah of the desire to see a representative Government established in the country, the necessity of which has been re cognised by him, and, without insisting on the re-establishment of the form in which that Government existed in 1907-08, to advise His Majesty to proceed, without delay, with the help of those above-mentioned and of other men of merit, to elaborate a law instituting a new legislative body which will be in accordance with the usages and historical customs of the people of Persia as well as with their religious ideas, and which will satisfy its needs and contribute to the establishment of peace and order in the country. (3) If the Shah gives sufficient proofs of his decision to follow Russian and British advice, to help him in contracting an external loan, more or less considerable, conditional on the institution of a Special Commission made2 up of the Directors of the British and Russian banks, with Persian Delegates—this Commis sion to control expenditure and to see that the expenditure is devoted exclusively to the wants of Persia—to superintend various Budgets of the Administration, and to assist the Minister of Finance in the revision and regu- larisation of the maliat laws. (4) The two Governments would be pre pared, in order to prove their amicable feelings, to place at the Persian Government’s disposal an advance of £200,000, on the conditions arranged in 1906 {vide paragraph 9 of Memo- randum for October 1906), in order to meet the immediate expenses necessitated by the reforms being introduced. The British reply to the Russian Memo randum is under consideration. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs is displaying considerable anxiety as to the situation, and in an interview with Sir G. Barclay on the 16th February urged on him the immediate necessity for further joint representations. The Nationalists arc reported to have- acti '- e in Mazanderan towards the end of January, and there was apparently a possibility of the Turkomans joining them. The Governor is said to have sounded the Russian Consul at Astcrabad as to how the Russian Government would view a coalition of the Caspian provinces. {Fide paragraph 2 of Memorandum Disturbances in Ispahan, /‘f 1909.) There has been no change during the past month in the situation at Ispahan. On the 12th February, the Bakhtiari Chiefs from Tehran were at Kum parleying with the Samsam. During the same period there has been no situation in Azerbaijan. material alteration in the situation at Tabriz. Early in January the village of Sardarud which had been captured by the National party was L evacuated by them. The Royalists captured a few prisoners, who were released after they had been stripped. The incident was magni fied at Tehran into a great victory by ^the Royalist party. On the 13th January, it was reported that communications were being interrupted by the Royalist troops on the road in the vicinity of Julfa. The last Europe post had been captured and carried off by them. Their plan apparently was to surround Tabriz with a force and starve it into surrender. It was almost impossible to get fuel in Tabriz and prices were going up. There was fighting at Khoi and Salmas. 63 % Later reports showed that, though not much damage was done, fighting of a rather serious nature had taken place outside the town of Maraga, in which the National party, who bad succeeded in putting a stop to all com munication between the Ain-ed-Dowleh's forces and those of Maraga, had got the best of it. The Ain-ed-Dowleh was believed to be waiting for the return of Rahim Khan before moving. The Nationalists are reported to have fought a successful engagement with the Maku near Julfa on the 26th January. {Vide paragraph 2 of the Memo- T , randum for January Afa, r .„U^. Isog) •' Meshed i3 reported to be to outward appearance normal, but the outlook is not encouraging. The Russian Consul-General is very pessimistic and is seriously alarmed for his own safety. In case of emergency, Major Sykes has decided to offer the Russians a part of the British Consular premises, which he states, they should be able to hold with our assistance. Russian subjects are said to be forming secret societies which will probably work on sinister lines. 2. {Vide parogt'aph 19 of the Memo- Tour of His Britannic a f 0r . October Majesty’s Consul-Gene- 1908.) Major Sykes, rai, Meshed. _ an d Captain Watson, I.M.S., returned to Meshed, from tour, on the 22nd December 1908. Captain Watson left Meshed on the 31st December 1908, and arrived at Turbat-i-Haidari on the 3rd January 1909. 3. {Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo randum for January 1909.) The Ispahan Anjuman has demanded from the Zil-es-Sultan one-tenth of the taxes due next year, which begins on the 21st March, or five hundred pounds sterling. Should he pay this, his action will, the Zil fears, be construed as hostile by the Persian Government; and if he refuses, all the Nationalists will go against him to the danger of his property, and they may make further demands. As “all have to contribute to public security ” the Samsam and Anjumans decline to waive their claim to the taxes. Under instructions from the Legation His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General at Ispahan declined to accede to a request preferred by the ZiPs son for advice as to the payment of taxes. 4. Sir G. Barclay reported on the 25th Financial situation in January that the Persia. Minister for Foreign Affairs had asked M. Bizot, the French Finan cial Adviser to the Persian Government, to make arrangements in Paris to appoint The Zil-es-Sultan.4 Frenohmen to the posts of Treasurer-General and Financial Inspector, as the Shah had consented to the establishment of these posts, which were considered both by the Russian Financial Agent and the French Financial Adviser to be very necessary if financial reform was to be carried out effectively. M. Isvolsky informed Sir A. Nicolson that he had no objection to the appointment of a French Treasurer-General and a Financial Inspector. He (Sir A. Nicolson) replied that, as the position of those who controlled finances in a country such as Persia would be a very strong one, he presumed that the functions of those two officers would be strictly defined, and that, in dealing with the affairs of Persia, no third party, not even France, would be admitted on equal terms with Russia and England. M. Isvolsky replied that he regarded the two officers merely as M. Bizut’s assistants. The question of a joint Anglo-Russian loan to Persia seems likely to take practical shape in the near future. The Russian propo sal [videparagraph 1, supra) to give an imme diate advance of £200,000 to the Shah is due in part to the fear that the Persian Govern ment may turn to Germany to afford them financial assistance. His Majesty’s Govern ment are not, however, disposed to make any loan until a constitutional Government is actually established, and until definite guarantees can be obtained as to the objects to which the loan will be devoted. In any case they pref&lt; r, before taking the question into consideration, to await the report on Persian finances which M. Bizot is preparing. It seems clear that any loan now advanced would be repudiated by the Nationalist party bo soon as they came into power. (Vide paragraph 43 of Memorandum for July 1908.) In connection with the question of the transfer of the lien of the Imperial Bank of Persia from the Customs receipts of Kermanshah to those of Bushire, Sir G- Barclay reported on the 28th January that he had received a note from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs pledging the customs of Bushire from the 21st March for the interest on the Bank’s advances to the Persian Government, to be paid in monthly instalments of 18,000 tomans. Sir G. Barclay enquired whether, if the interest for last year and this year on the Anglo India loan was not paid by April next, His Majesty’s Government would like him to press for pay ment from what remained of the Bushire receip's. In that case the 13,000 tomans a month for the reduction of the Persian Government’s debt to the Bank would h ive to be obtained from some other port in the south*V The Secretary of State instructed Sir G. ^Barclay to tell the Persian Government that, in accepting the proposal, His Majesty’s Government must look upon it as a provisional arrangement, and that they look to the Persian Government to arrange for further pavments in the future. As His Majesty’s Government would always be free in a year’s time to re-open the question, Sir G. Barclay was told that he need not say anything, if in his opinion the arrangement wouid thus be jeopardised. If it was con sidered imprudent further to mortgage the customs of Bushire for the debt of the Bank, His Majesty’s Government would then have to arrange for the collection of the extra 13,000 tomans at another port, where, for purposes of encashing the requisite amount, a Bank’s representative could be stationed. 5. Captain A. Grey arrived at Turbat-i- His Britannic Msje.- Haidari, from India, ty’e&gt; Oonaui at Turtut-i- on the 7th January Haidari. 1909, and took over charge of the Consulate from Captain Watson, I.M.S., on the following day. 6. Russian prestige is reported to have Buesian position at increased considerably Birjand. in Birjand since the Hisam-ud-Dowleh took over the Governor ship of Kain {vide paragraph 7 of the Memorandum for November 1908). Hr. Kosminsky is now an important and busy man while the British hospital is only attended by the lower classes. This is attributed partly to preference shown for a European doctor, and partly to the fact that he is favoured by the Governor. Hr. Kosminsky has given out that, in addition to his plague cordon duties, lie is to be given an official position as Russian Agent. 7. {Vide paragraph 9 of the Mrmo- , randum for January Perso-Afgh.nBeUt.on8. mg ^ ^ Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed reports that the Governor of Herat is being addressed on several frontier questions by the Persian authorities through the Afghan Agent. On the night of the 28th Hecember 1908, a number of Afghans headed by Sher Muham mad Khan, an Afghan in military employ, are reported to have crossed the frontier, entered the village of Host Muhammad in Miankangi in Seistan,and forcibly carried off a woman into Afghan territory. The Seistan Karguzar recently visited the frontier with a view to meeting the Afghan Brigadier and Musa Khan, in order to settle the case, but returned to Seistan without attaining his object. The woman, however, was shortly afterwards returned. ■ ■ m6 8. (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memoran- The Khaf-Seistan dum for January 1909.) telegraph line. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, reports that owin» to the annual repairs not having been carried out the Khaf-Seistan telegraph line is in a very had state, and interruptions are of frequent occurrence. Some urgent repairs are now being carried out on the Seistan-Seh Deh section, but, as no funds have been allotted, the payment of the labourers engaged (at brans daily) is to be made by “the ghulams on the line” from their own pay. 9. (Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- Arms traffic in the randum for January.) Persian Gulf. On the 27th February, Sir G. Barclay reported that one of the tele graph staff at Dehaneh was being removed for departmental reasons, and would not be re placed for the moment. The other member of the staff has been ordered to proceed, at the beg'nnmg of March, to Koh-i-Malik Siah. According to reports received from Maskat, two thousand and thirty rifles, and the usual quantity of ammunition, were shipped by arms runners to the Mekran Coast between the 10th January and the 6th February. 10. On the 18th February, Sir G. Barclay „ J ... telegraphed to Sir E.

Lynch in London on the security of the Bakhtiari road, but that, before the loan could be recognised, the consent of the other concessionaires would have to be obtained. 11. (Vide paragraph 15 of the Memo- Ahwaz-Borasjun tele- randum for January ernphiine. 1909.) On the 26th January Sir A. Nicolson telegraphed to Sir E. Grey that he had presented a memorandum on the subject of the Arabistan line to the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The RuKian Government agreed to all the British proposals, but desired that the employment of Russian signallers on the lines should be regarded as permissible, were such employment rendered desirable hereafter by the develop ment of Russian trade. Sir A. Nicolson expressed the hope that the point would be conceded. He added that it was doubtful whether the Russians would take advantage of the concession for some time to come, and that he thought they desired it only in the light of a compliment. On the 27th January, Sir E. Grey in formed Sir G. Barclay that the following arrangement had been arrived at with theF*/ Russian Government, viz., that the Indo- European Telegraph Department would, on receipt from the Persian Minister of Tele graphs of the proposal to take over control of the re-construction and maintenance of the line, he prepared to accept it, and, on condi tion that the Persian Telegraph Department should undertake to secure an extension of the Telegraph Concessions till 1945, would in the first instance offer, in return, to reconstruct the line at a cost of some £6,000 on behalf of the Persian Telegraph Department, and to spend some £600 a year in maintaining it subsequently. Should it prove necessary in order to secure the extension of the Telegraph Concessions, the Indo-European Telegraph Department would further be prepared to offer to advance the Persian Telegraph Depart ment a lump sum not exceeding £ 10,000, being ten years’ rental of the Central Persian telegraph line. Sir G. Barclay was requested to endeavour to get the agreement concluded on these lines. Sir G. Barclay telegraphed on the 17th February that the Persian Government had sent him a note saying that the Persian Minister of Telegraphs had been instructed, by command of the Shah, to make arrangements with the Indo-European Telegraph D^ partment for the repair of the Arabistan line as soon as possible. His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India telegraphed on the 25th February that instructions to proceed accordingly had been given to Mr. Barker. Mr. Barker was also requested by the Minister of Telegraphs to report on the state of the line. 12. (Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- Karun Irrigation Con- randunt for January cession. 1909.') On the 2nd February, the First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that in accordance with Sir G. Barclay’s instructions His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah had interviewed the Sheikh, whose views were briefly as follows:— That it would be preferable that the Ahwaz scheme should not be carried out, and that, in any case, he alone had the right to do it; that, if it were attempted, it uould be prevented by the Arab cultivators unless the Sheikh held the concession himself and influenced them, but that any attempt at coercing them would be disastrous; that, if promised British capital to work it, he himself could take up the concession, and that be looked for guidance in the matter to the British Legation. He considered that it would be advisable that he should telegraph to the Persian Government that rumours of a foreign irrigation concession were disturbing the Arabs, who would not agree to it, and shouldwarn the Persian Government of the danger of granting any sueh concession, and he enquired whether Sir G. Barclay would approve of his sending such a telegram. The Minister telegraphed on the 4th February, requesting that the Sheikh might be informed that he (Sir G. Barclay) was glad to know his views, but that as the prospects of a concession being granted seemed still to be remote, the Sheikh would act wisely in refrain ing for the present from making the proposed communication to the Persian Government, and that he was consulting His Majesty’s Government as to what steps should be taken to safeguard the Sheikh’s interests. Sir G. Barclay added that the Minister for Foreign Affairs quite recognised British interests in the question and would keep him fully informed. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also told Sir G. Barclay that the late Netherlands Minister had expressed his dis satisfaction with the option. On the 16th February, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India telegraphed that he had agreed to the proposal of the Foreign Office (1) to remind the Netherlands Govern ment that no scheme, which was not viewed favourably by the Sheikh of Mohammerah, or which was in any way prejudicial to British interests, could be supported by His Majesty’s Government, and (2) to enquire the scope and nature of the reported negotiations. His Majesty’s Secretary of State added that no further communication with the Sheikh was proposed, pending the reply of the Netherlands Government. In a telegram dated the 26th February, Sir G. Barclay staled that the Sheikh had again expressed a desire to telegraph to the Persian Government in the sense formerly proposed, as he had heard from a Dutch merchant at Ahwaz that a concession had been granted. Sir G. Barclay caused the Sheikh to be informed that His Majesty’s Government were watching the matter closely, and that lie would keep His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah informed; that as* far as he could ascertain there was no truth in the Dutch merchant’s assertion; and that there seemed no necessity for the Sheikh to make the proposed communication. 13. In June 1908, Major Cox addressed Establishment of &amp; Government of Vice-Consulate at India reviewing the LiDEah ‘ general political situa tion in the south of Persia and in the Persian Gulf. He indicated briefly the efforts that were being made by the Germans, through Messrs. TVonekhaus &amp; Co., to work up an interest at Lingah. Inter alia Major Cox recom mended the appointment tentatively for two orthree years of a British officer as Vice-Consul at this port in supersession of the Native 'Residency Agent by whom British interests are now represented. On the 9th October, the Government of India telegraphed to the Secretary of State supporting Major Cox’s proposal on the usual understanding as to the division of expendi ture. On the 3rd February 1909, the Secretary of State for India called for an estimate of the cost of appointing an officer from the Indian Service to the Vice-Consulate at Lingah. 14. [Videparagraph 160 of the Memo- Lighting and buoying r a n d um [Arabian the Persian Gulf. Affairs) f r August 1908.'\ On the 5th February, the Secretary of State telegraphed approval of the proposal contained in the despatch of the 13th August from the Government of India that the question of lighting and buoying the Persian Gulf should be considered by a Commission of enquiry, and asked, as the Trinity House expert had been warned to start at short notice, at what place and on what date it was suggested that the Commission should meet. After consultation with Major Cox His Majesty’s Secretary of State was informed on the 25th February that the enquiry might conveniently commence at Maskat at the end of March. Arrangements are being made accordingly. Ihe cost of the enquiry is to be divided equally between Imperial and Indian revenues. 15. {Vide paragraph 19 of the Memo- _ . ., . . randum for Januaru.) Red oxide mining con- ' y ' cessions in the Persian Un the loth January, Qulf - Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. were informed by the Foreign Office that nego tiations as regards Little Tamb should be con ducted with the Sheikh of Shargah through tbe British Resident in the Persian Gulf as advised by the Government of India [vide paragraph 210 of the Memorandum {Arabian Affairs) for November 190$\ It was suggested to the firm that, before putting forward their demand lor a concession on the island, they might, with advantage, take into consideration possible oxide deposits on the islands of Dalmah and Sir Abu Nair, belonging respectively to the Sheikh of Abu Dthabi and the Sheikh of Shargah. The firm expressed their intention to endea vour to send an European represent ative to prospect for red oxide on these islands, as well as on other islands in that part of the Persian Gulf, but they stated tliat, before sending him, they would instruct their Bushire Agent to consult with, and act upon, the advice of the Political Resident at Bushire.10 In regard to the island of Sirri, Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. were informed that His Majesty’s Government had no objection to the firm making f«n application to the Persian Govern ment for a mining concession on that island, hut that, in the event of Messrs. Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Co. also making an application for a con cession, they were not prepared to support the application of the former firm in preference to that of the latter. On the 28th January, the British Minister at Tehran enquired whether Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. were negotiating through the Persian Legation in London with a view to acquiring the mining concession on the island of Sirri. Sir G. Barclay added that, if the firm had an Agent at Tehran, it would be v eil for him to call at His Majesty’s Legation in order that the British Minister might judge how Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s interests could best he furthered The latter, from whom an enquiry on the point was made, stated that they had no represent ative at Tehran, and that as negotiations through Mirza Mehdi Khan, before he became Persian Minister in London, did not appear to lead to business, they had instructed their Agents at Bushire to endeavour to obtain the concession. Sir G. Barclay was informed on the 30th January that in October, Messrs. Strick had asked the Persian Chargd d’Affaires, in his private capacity, to obtain a concession for mining rights on “ all Persian islands except Hormuz” for ten years at a royalty of two shillings per ton exported and had offered £1,000 down for the option of accepting or declining such concession during nine months. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister was instructed to consult Major Cox and to do what he properly could to assist Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. in regard to Sirri and other Persian islands not already leased. Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s Bushire Agents have sent samples of the Sirri oxide home with a suggestion that the oxide deposits on the island should be properly examined before proceeding further, as the person sent to obtain the samples reported that the deposits were scanty and hardly worth working^ Sir G. Barclay expressed the opinion that if Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. decided to go on with the business, they should appoint an agent in Tehran, without whom it would be difficult, consistently with the promise made to Messrs. II aji Ali Akbar &amp; Co., to do more than merely present their application. Sir G. Barclay con sidered that, if the firm had an agent at Tehran, he might see his way to helping the latter indirectly. 16. (Vide paragraph 20 of the Memo- Abu Musa red oxide randvm for January.) concession. On the 24th February, the Secretary of State for India intimated that11 2 : 0 . the Foreign Office saw no particular advantage in approaching the German Government at once, unless Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. desired soon to begin purchasing oxide from Abu Musa. As Abu Musa oxide was of poor quality and the market was over-stocked, such action by the firm seemed unlikely until they had prospected on Dalmah, &amp;c., [vide paragraph 210 of the Meworavdum (Arabian Affairs) for November 1908.] For the present, therefore, the recom mencement of mining operations might be deferred. 17.

The Secretary of State for India tele- cf an g^pbed on the 22nd Agent at February that the Italian Government had agreed to the proposals of His Majesty’s Government (vide paragraph 22 of the Memorandum for January) as to the introduction of their Agent, and his acting always in consultation with the British Consul at Maskat. The Agent left on the 20th February for Maskat. 19. [ Vide paragraph 152 of Memoran- „ • dum (Arabian Affairs) sovereignty over for August li/Oo.) Bahrein. After considerable delay, the Minister for Foreign Affairs offered to send His Majesty’s Minister an amended note to be substituted for the Mushir-ed- Dowleh’s note to which objection had been taken. Such substitution was, however, to be conditional on the Grand Vizier’s concurrence. On the 19th December, Sir G. Barclay reported to Sir E. Grey that the matter had been sub- His Highness pronounced against the proposed amended note in the strongest terms, declaring that the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note was an admirable one, and that to change it would be giving aw ay the Persian case. British activity in Bahrein and British pretensions in regard to that island could not be allowed. SirG. Barclay did not press for the amended note, as he fear ed that the influence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was not strong enough to modi fy the refractory attitude of the Grand Vizier. Further, he considered that such a course might have led to the fall of the Minister, for it would have been necessary to make it clear, -12 in any further representations, that the Ala- es-Sultaneh himself had submitted the proposed text to the British Legation before the Grand Vizier had seen it. Sir G. Barclay therefore addressed a note to the Persian Government returning Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s note as being altogether inadmissible. The Minister’s action was approved by His Majesty’s Government. 20. [ Vide paragraph 177 of the Memo- Sheikh of Koweit’s randum {Arabian properties at Fao.

On the 3rd February, Sir E. Grey instructed Sir A. Nicolson to inform the Russian Government that His Majesty’s Government was disposed to think that the best course to adopt would be for Great Britain and Russia to stand entirely aloof from the internal affairs of Persia, allowing the existing chaos to endure till whatever element irj the country was strongest gained the day. The grant of a constitution would, they were assured, result in the restoration of tranquillity over the whole of Persia, and consequently both Gov* ernments should direct their efforts towards inducing the Shah to fulfil his promises in that respect. The following detailed reply to the Russian Memorandum was communicated to the Russian Government. (1) His Majesty’s Government gladly welcome the suggestion that the two Govern ments should advise the Shah to call to his Council able and energetic men, capable of assisting His Majesty in drawing up a scheme of representative Government. As a corollary to this, it would be advisable to recommend His Majesty at the same time to dismiss reac tionary advisers such as the Grand Vizier and Amir Bahadur Jang, who are believed at present to be the chief opponents of a popular policy, and to be largely responsible for the situation of affairs at Tabriz and Ispahan. His Majesty’s Government would further sug gest, with a view to reconciling: Azerbaijan and Ispahan, that the Shah should be induced to proclaim a general amnesty for all his subjects under arms. (2) His Majesty’s Government entirely concur in the proposal to advise the Shah to elaborate at once a scheme of elective govern ment in conformity with the civic ideas of the Persian people. This advice has already been given to His Majesty on more than one occasion by the Representatives of Great Britain and Russia, but hitherto with no result, and it may be feared that the Shah will continue to disregard it, unless he is convinced that such a course will have inconvenient results to himself. v. rHis Majesty’s Government therefore suggest that a date should he proposed to the Shah beyond which the fulfilment of his pledge should no longer be postponed, and that it should be intimated to His Majesty that, un less a form of representative government suited to the needs of the country be granted by a named date, he will get no support of any kind from the British and Russian Gov ernments, who will reconsider their attitude to His Majesty and take measures to safeguard their interests. (3) His Majesty’s Government consider that the question of a loan is by no means pressing, and that it had better be deferred until the receipt of the Financial Adviser’s report, which, they understand, is likely to be ready in a few weeks. If that report shows that a foreign loan is essential to the re establishment of Persian credit, the conditions under which an advance might be made would have to be carefully studied. His Majesty’s Government vould deprecate anything in the nature of a large loan, and could not consent to make any advance until an elected assembly had approved of the transaction. His Majesty’s Government think that the question of control may also stand over until constitutional government is an accomplished fact; but the aim, in their opinion, should be to give the new assembly control over the finances in the same form, possibly by the institution of a “ Cours des Comptes ” organized by a foreign expert. If, however, the Shah decides to appoint a Treasurer-General at once, His Majesty’s Government will not object. (4) To lend money to the Shah in present conditions w’ould, His Majesty’s Gov ernment consider, be regarded as a demonstra tion against the constitutionalists in favour of a personal government ‘ by His Majesty, and would constitute an interference in the internal affairs of Persia. The two Govern ments would, moreover, be surrendering their only hold over His Majesty without obtaining any quid yro quo. No action has so far been taken by either Great Britain or Russia in regard to Persia, and the Russian reply to the above British memorandum is still awaited. On the 8th February, the house of Situation at Z.M. the Governor of Eesht w r as attacked by re*, volutionaries, and the Governor himself killed. The troops fled to the Russian Consulate for refuge, and telegraphic communication was interrupted. The next day the revolutionaries took possession of the town, and a provisional government was established. The people of Resht subsequently elected the Sipahdar as Gov ernor. This action produced a telegram fromthe Council of Ministers, repudiating the Sipahdar, and warning the Notables of Resht that forces would be sent to Gilan from all directions if the Sipahdar was recognised as Governor by them and the innocent would then suffer with the guilty. It was reported on the 4th March that 60 or 70 Russian soldiers, with a couple of mitrailleuses were being despatched to Resht and Enzeli, and that a larger detachment would be kept in reserve at Baku. M. Isvolsky explained that the troops sent to Resht were meant as a reinforcement to the present Cossack guard there, and that they would act under the orders of the Consul with a view to protecting the lives and properties of the subjects of Russia and other foreigners at Resht and Enzeli. On the 18th March, Sir G. Barclay reported A that there were no Sitiuihon at Tehran. i* i -i i , • fresh developments in Tehran. The bazaars had been closed for over a month, and there was some anxiety and great discontent. The Shah’s authority was still maintained. The only chance of an out break appeared to lie in either a defection of the troops from the Shah or help to the nationalists from outside. He hoped shortly, in conjunction with the Russian Minister, to make further representations under instruc tions with a view to the restoration of consti tutional government. There was some hope that the Shah would yield. Telegraphing on the 24th March Sir G. Barclay reported that four bastis had been murdered the previous evening at Shah- abdul Aziz by the Shah’s roughs, with— there was reason to believe—the Shah’s cogni zance. A joint note, urging punishment of the culprits and showing that such crimes would lead to general disorders to the prejudice of the nationals of the two Governments, for which the Shah’s Government would be held responsible, had been presented by the Russian Charge d’Affaires and Sir G. Barclay. Early in Eebruary troubles broke out in 0 . ^ , Yezd. The movement Situation at Yetd. , . 1.1 ,. . claimed to be national ist. A number of Parsis appear to have gone to the Acting Vice-Consul for refuge, and a party of Bakhtiaris were reported to be harry ing the neighbourhood, and to have been joined by inhabitants of Taft. On the 22nd March, Saiyid Murtaza Ahremi, a half-edu- cated, fanatical Mullah, at the head of a number of Tangistani rifle men, assumed control of the government of Bushire on behalf of the Nationalists. The principal local officials resigned. On the follow ing day, the Saiyid took over the customs and the Belgian customs officials withdrew.In reply to a representation from His Majesty's Consul-General to the effect that the^ customs receipts were pledged to His Majesty’s Government, the Saiyiil proposed that he should retain a sum of 500 tomans for the daily expenses of his force, and that the balance should he deposited with a reliable Persian merchant. He assured Major Cox that arrangements would be made for the security of the lives and property of foreigners. On the 29th March, there were about 1,000 Tangistani riflemen in Bushire and the Saiyid had up to that date retained the customs receipts himself. The news-agents of the Russian Consulate and the Residency reported that the German Con sulate had been responsible for the failure of the Saiyid to come to terms regarding the customs. The native population were in daily fear of depredations and the foreign Consuls were reported to be growing anxious. In response to a requisition from Major Cox, H. M. S. “Redbreast” was sent to Bushire. On the 29th March, Major Cox represented to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that, as His Majesty’s Government had assumed respons ibility for the protection of foreign subjects, it was desirable to send a cruiser with a white complement of two or three hundred men. On the 17th March, as the result Situation at Bunder Abbas. ^ PieSSlire from the Mujtahids of Nejef and the Saiyid of Raristan, the Nationalists assumed control of the government and customs of Bunder Abbas and installed the Karguzar as Governor. The Belgian Customs Director declined to remain in the Nationalist service and withdrew. In accord ance with a requisition from His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas, who appre hended danger to the lives and property of British subjects, a gunboat was despatched to Bunder Abbas and arrived on the 17th March. Instructions were sent by His Males tv’a Minister to Major Cox not to land blue-jfckets except in case of extreme necessity. Great caution was necessary, as anything like interference in the south would give the Russians a pretext for intervention in the north, where Russian subjects had Ion 0 * been exposed to similar risks. His Majesty’s Consul was also informed that the Karguzar of Bunder Abbas should not be given official recognition as Governor but that he might he dealt with as de facto Governor. Captain Shakespear was instructed to warn the Nationalists that the Gulf customs were pledged to Ills Majesty’s Government and to request them to pay the Bunder Abbas receipts to the Consulate who would see that they were used only as payment of interest on the British loan. Hie Persian Government5 would be informed that duties paid by British merchants to N ationalists would be considered as fully acquitted, though, on account of the loan, the proceeds were being claimed by the British Government. The Karguzar, on the 23rd March, pressed His Majesty’s Consul to permit him to retain half the customs receipts to pay the Nationalist soldiery. Captain Shakespear considered that the request should be granted. There were 1,200 armed men in the town and, if they were not supplied with food and water, there was danger of an outbreak; the Karguzar had agreed to stop the arrival of more men, and the Nationalists, who had kept excellent order, were desirous of maintaining peaceful control. Moreover the Nationalists could only be restrained from retaining the whole of the revenue and abolishing the custom house by occupying the latter with a force of blue-jackets. Sir G. Barclay replied that the British claim to half the customs receipts, and even to all, might be waived if danger was apprehended, though the latter course should, if possible, be avoided. So far the Nationalists have maintained order efficiently at Bunder Abbas. On the 25th March 1909, Major Cox Situation at jatic. reported that Mir Bakat had taken over the Jask customs under instructions from Bunder Abbas. Towards the end of the month news was Situation ai Shiraz and received that the hamadan. ^ ationalist movement had spread to Hamadan and Shiraz. In the latter town on the 24th March it was decided at a meeting attended by Vizier Begler Begi, Nasr-ed-Dowleh and other leading persons that the Constitution should be proclaimed and a local Assembly inaugurated. The position of the Nationalists in Situation iaAaerlaijan. Tabriz at the begin- mng of Jb ebruary was reported to be precarious and supplies to be running short. The royalists appeared to be confident of its early surrender. On the 11th February, Mr. Wratislaw reported that the Kasvin, Maraga and Julfa roads were blocked, the last by cavalry from Karadagh. On the 22nd February, an indecisive engagement took place between the Karflan- ghis and a strong force of Nationalists at Alvar, on the Julfa road, 8 miles from Tabriz. An expedition which had been sent to clear the Julfa road and to bring away the Marend garrison returned to Tabriz on the 23rd February, having failed in its objective.The Maraga forces were repulsed with heavy loss in an attack which they made on Tabriz on the 24th February. On the 3rd March, the Indo-European telegraph line to Julfa was cut. Great distress and scarcity has been felt in Tabriz owing to the roads bein^ closed, and on the 25th February Mr. Wratislaw was of the opinion that the town could hold out for a month unless taken by assault. (Vide paragraph 1 of the Memo- 1909.) On the 8th March, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General reported a fresh outbreak of the revolutionary movement at Meshed. Apparently, on the evening of the 7th March, the revolutionaries, led by Russian subjects whom the Russian Consul-General w r as unable to restrain, seized the telegraph office and imprisoned the Deputy Governor. The serious feature of the position was the absence of all the permanent respon sible officials—the Commander-in-Chief, the Karguzar and Governor-General, having all been dismissed, while the two latter, who were most influential officials, were leaving the city without waiting for their relief. On the 13th March, the city was in the hands of the new Assembly who were preparing to raise a strong force. Subsequently street fighting ensued between the inhabitants of Meshed and the Russian subjects. The refusal of the Prussian Consul-General to state in writing that the latter were not his subjects or to give the local authorities a free hand with them, conveyed the impression that he was awaiting an excuse to summon Russian troops to the scene. 2. It is reported that the bodies of Murder of Russian three Russian spies, spies on the Khorasan said to be an officer frontier. „ j , . and two Armenians, who were killed on the Khorasan frontier, have lately been found. Major Sykes states that the whole affair is somewhat mysterious as the men are termed “ scouts ” in the Russian newspapers. 3. (Vide paragraph 3 of the Memorandum The Zil-es-Sultan. -{ 0r February 1909.) In a despatch, dated the 20th January, to Sir E. Grey, Sir F. Bertie reported that the Zil had expressed his grati tude for the protection accorded to his family at Ispahan, and begged that this protection might be extended to certain of his servants whom he mentioned. As regards his family, the Zil bad asked, early in January, that, in view of the state of affairs at Ispahan, His Majesty’s Consul-General should be given fresh instructions to protect them very carefully. His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan is doing all he can in this direction. In regardto the ZiFs later request in favour of his servants, His Majesty’s Government requested Sir P. Bertie to inform him that they regretted their inability further to extend the protection afforded to him and his family. Mirza Akhar, the Zil’s son, has enquired from Sir F. Bertie whether His Majesty’s Government would he prepared to give an assurance that, in the event of an agree ment being reached between the Shah and the constitutional party, which he thought might occur in a few months’ time, the Zil would then be permitted to return to Persia. The Zil was afraid that the Russian Govern ment might continue to oppose his return even after the constitutional regime had been re-established, alleging that his presence would lead to a recrudescence of disorder. The Zil considered that such an apprehension was unfounded, and did not anticipate that his return would be attended with any danger to himself. His desire was to return to Ispahan, as soon as order was re-established there, and live quietly with his family, taking no part in politics, and he was prepared to give an under taking that he would act in no way contrary to the wishes and advice of the British and Russian Governments. In reply, Sir E. Grey requested Sir F. Bertie on the 11th February to inform the Zil that His Majesty’s Govern ment could not at the present time give any assurance of the kind desired, but that, if, and when, constitutional government was establish ed in Persia, they would consult with the Russian Government as to the possible date of his return. Further,that it might be advisable to explain to the Zil that he was, of course, at perfect liberty to return to Persia whenever he desired at his own risk. If, however, he decided to obey the Shah’s summons, His Majesty’s Government could not continue to protect him. 4. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister Endeavour of Edward ut dehran has reported Kitabji to secure a eon- that an individual of cession for a road from , , , ^ , Seistan to Koh-i-Maiik cioubttul antecedents, Siah - named Edward Kitabji, was seeking a concession at Tehran for a road from Seistan to Koh-i-Malik Siah on the Perso-Baluch frontier. Kitabji, who did not apparently represent any group in Eng land, said that he was about to become a British subject and that he would form an English company to work the concession. In reply to a reference on the subject, the Government of India have informed His Majesty’s Government that they consider that Kitabji’s application should be regarded with suspicion. A genuine company would never be benefitted by the concession which could, however, be used to subvert British influence, hamper British trade, and obtain rights8 amounting to domination over Seistan land holders, through whose land would run the only portion of the road which requires construction and by whose labour it would, if ever construct ed, be made. Further, trade on this route could not bear road dues in addition to the existing heavy freightage charges. The Gov ernment of India were of opinion that, hoth on political and strategical grounds, as well as in the interests of trade, an attempt should he made to frustrate the application. 5. {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- The Meshed-Tehraa randum for February and Khaf-Seistan tele- 1909.) Mr. G. New, grap imes. o £ Indo-European Telegraph Department, has recently returned to Tehran after completing an inspection of the Meshed-Tehran line and effecting repairs where necessary, so that the line is now in good condition for another year. The Khaf-Seistan line is, however, not in such a good state. Mr. McManus, Sub-Assistant Superintendent of the Indian Telegraph Department, who recently made an inspection of the line from Nasratabad to Bandan, has reported that no new posts have been put in since the line was made, the old ones having been merely shortened as their bases were destroyed or became decayed. There is con sequently in very many places insufficient headway, and the line generally is in bad condition. It is understood, however, that the more urgent repairs on this line have since been carried out. 6. ( Vide paragraph 9 of the Memorandum Arms traffic in the for February 1909.) Persian Gulf. 0 n the 7th March, an arms-runmng dhow, belonging to Omani subjects, but with no flag or papers, was captured off Jask by H. M. S. “Fox”. Tiie vessel contained 350 rifles and 50,000 rounds of ammunition. Under instructions from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, her crew were handed over to the Sultan of Maskat for custody and punish ment. As the Sultan did not claim the dhow and seemed inclined to disown the crew, the Government of India ordered that the dhow should be burnt and the arms jettisoned. Five days later, another dhow flying no flag and without papers, with a cargo of 1,200 rifles and about 1,25,000 rounds of ammunition, was intercepted on the high seas also by H. M. S. “ Fox ”. As her crew abandoned her before she was captured, it was impossible to as certain the vessel’s nationality. The Govern ment of India approved the proposal of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to sell the dhow for prize money and to jettison the arms. Reports received through the Director Persian Gulf Telegraphs, show that 8,40(5 4Trifles were landed on the Mekran Coast during the month ending the 15th March 1909. 7. (Vide 'paragraph 11 of the Memo' Arabistan telegraph randum for February Unes - 1909.) Sir G. Barclay telegraphed to Sir E. Grey on the 8th March that he had ventured to insert in the draft agreement, in addition to the special stipula tions mentioned by the Director-in-Chief (see paragraph 11 of the Memorandum for Feb ruary) , one for the right to co-operate in the construction and maintenance of any extension of the Arabistan lines, as an extension from Mohammerah to Basrah was contemplated. Sir G. Barclay presumed the Bussian Govern ment would not object if it were explained to them that the right would, in the case of an extension to their sphere, be waived. As regards the employment hereafter of Russian signallers on these lines, it has been considered advisable by His Majesty’s Govern ment to provide for the contingency in a secret agreement between the British and Russian Governments and not in the agreement with the Persian Government, as the mention of such an eventuality might arouse the suspicions of the latter and thus delay the progress of the negotiations. The agreement with the Persian Government is to stipulate that, without the concurrence of the British Government, no others than Persian subjects and members of the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department should be employed in the offices or on the lines of the Arabistan telegraph system. 8. Under instructions from Sir E. Grey, „ . Sir A. Nicolson inform- in Persia. ed the Russian Govern- Extension of Telegraph Con. me nt in January 1909 cessions. ,, . . ' that, m connection with the negotiations respecting the Arabistan lines, the opportunity was to be taken to secure from the Persian Government the extension of the existing Telegraph Concessions to 3 915, and to erect, at the request of the Persian Government, a second wire from Tehran to Shahrud. It was pointed out to the Russian Government that the prolongation of the concessions till 1945 would apply to the Tehran-Khanikin line, the rights over which are to be transferred to the Russian Govern ment (vide penultimate clause of para graph 8 of the Memorandum for Septem ber 1907), and that, as regards the proposed second Tehran-Shahrud line, in view of the impending transfer to Russia of control over the Teh ran-Meshed line (paragraph 23 of the Memorandum for October 1908), and of the fact that the line is within the Russian sphere, the British Government wished this proposal to remain in abeyance until the transfer had been effected, when the Russian Government would be able to consider whether they would wish to erect the second wire.i 10 In reply to the above, the Russian Gov ernment gave Sir A. Nicolson a Memorandum, stating that they would offer no obstacle to the proposal respecting the prolongation of existing concessions, but they reserved the right, should it be necessary, to induce the Persian Government to transfer to the charge of the Russian telegraph establishments the lines from Shalirud to the Russian frontier, and from Meshed to Askhabad, on similar conditions to those now existing on the Meshed-Seistan line. The Russian Govern ment further explained that, in their opinion, it appeared to be urgently necessary to separate negotiations on the question of any new concessions from negotiations on the matter of an exchange between Russia and England of their respective lines, so as to preclude any delay in the decision of this latter question, winch had already been perfected and regulated by both Governments {para graph 23 of the Memorandum for October 1908), ^ Ticolson was instructed on the 19th February to address the Russian Govern ment to the effect that the proposal in the Russian aide-memoire as to taking over the lines from Sharud and Meshed to the frontier °n the conditions now existing on the Meshed- Seistan line, should admit of the employment of British signallers on the lines in question if it should be thought desirable hereafter • that any further agreement with the Russian Government that might be necessary in respect of the Tehran-Khanikin line, should be deferred till after the consent of the Persian Government to the extension of the Telegraph Concessions to 1915 had been received ^ and tlifit the questions of the exchange of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf-Nasratabad lines should, if possible, be deferred till the other negotiations had been concluded. I n reply Sir A. Nicolson telegraphed on the 24th Tebruary that the Russian Government would probably raise objections to British signallers on the telegraph lines from Meshed and Shahrud to the frontier, on the ground that the lines in question are in the Russian sphere, while the Arabistan lines are in the neutral zone and that the latter fact was mentioned bv the Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs as enabling Russian signallers to be employed on the latter lines, if necessary; that as regards the exchange of control over the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf^eistan hnes, he (Sir A. Nicolson) would also suggest that he should tell the Russian Government that the two Represent atives at Tehran might at the first favourable opportunity bring the question before the Persia^ Government, as this would enable His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran to take it up11 Z&lt; 1' when he thought desirable, while, if he told them that the exchange had better be depend ent on the conclusion of the arrangements of the Arabistan lines, they might reply that, while the former question was practically part of the convention concluded a year and a half ago, for the settlement of which the British Government had from time to time pressed, the question of the Arabistan lines was an importunate one chiefly of British interest. 9. {Vide paragraph 12 of the Memo- Karun irrigation con- randum for February ce88ion - 1909.) The Sheikh has reluctantly expressed his willingness to accept Sir G. Barclay’s advice not to telegraph a protest to the Persian Government. He asked, however, for a guarantee that no con cession would be made without reference to him, and claims a right of option in any concession. A report has been received from His Majesty’s Consul at Ahwaz to the effect that Van Roggen, the Hutch Engineer, had written from The Hague to Ter Meulen of the Dutch firm of that name at Ahwaz, asserting that on the 11th January news of the signature of a concession for 99 years for a syndicate which must be formed within two years was received at The Hague by the late Netherlands Minister, and that he had been promised all help by the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs. Ter Meulen had been requested by Van Roggen to visit the Sheikh and inform him quietly that the concession had been granted with the approval of the British, Russian, and German Governments, and that he could not treat it lightly. His claims would be recognised by payment in cash and shares. His Majesty’s Consul was directed to explain to Ter Meulen that His Majesty’s Government were addressing a note to the Dutch Legation, enquiring the nature and scope of the negotiations which were reported to be on foot, and reminding them that no scheme which in any way prejudiced the interests of His Majesty’s Government, or was viewed unfavourably by the Sheikh, could receive their support. Until the situation was clear. His Majesty’s Consul was to do all he could to dissuade Ter Meulen from approaching the Sheikh, and was to tell the Sheikh that he should pay no attention if Ter Meulen approached him. At the request of His Majesty’s Gov ernment, the Government of India instructed Major Cox to proceed to Mohammerah with a view to overcoming the apprehensions of the Sheikh. On the 16th March, Sir E. Grey tele graphed to Sir G. Barclay that the Netherlands Government emphasised the undefined and12 vague character of the option granted to their late Minister at Tehran for a ** concession d’exploitation a TAhwaz ”, adding that, if the Persian Government were to grant a concession for works near the Karun river to a Dutch Syndicate, the Netherlands Government would give such a syndicate timely warning that no work could be undertaken without the co-oper ation ot the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the assured support of His Majesty’s Government. Ibis telegram was communicated to Major Cox, who reported on the 26th March that the Sheikh’s apprehensions regarding the irrigation question had for the present been allayed. 10. On the 16th March, His Majesty’s * 5 u pr ??° 8ed loan to the Consul reported that Sheikh of Mohammerah. the Sheikh , )ad) amon( , other requests, represented that he was ih immediate need of money and reiterated his previous application for a loan (paraqravk 16 °f Memorandum for January), adding that, if the British Government were not prepared to grant one, they must not object to his getting it elsewhere. With reference to this request, Major Cox suggested that, if the Sheikh s statement that full pro prietary rights over Abadan Island, Moham- merah, and the land on the east bank of the Kanin, occupied or cultivated by them were vested and confirmed in him and his tribe by the terms of the firman in his possession was correct, Government should acquire a frontage on the island by lease or purchase in connection with the grant of a.loan or the ex- , 4 . ass ' 1 f an , c ® s (paragraph 11 below), for which the Sheikh now asked or, failing this that an opportunity might be taken to obtain the ground required by the Syndicate on easy terms in connection with the grant of the a Ia T f “ tu J re the north and west shores of , 4 WOuld be of muoh ralue, and the Oil Syndicate was reviving its endeavours to acquire land there. T n ,,-° n -H' 6 19t ! 1 March - the Government of India informed the Secretary of State by telegram that they were so impressed with the necessity of supporting the Sheikh that they h W e er Xr edt0ShareiUthe l0aQ £or wlliob On the 26th March, Major Cox tele graphed that the Sheikh would, for the present, be content with a provisional assurance that we were ready to grant a loan on suitab.e terms, and that he need not look elsewhere for i The Sheikh was now search ing for the old firmans on which his tenure is based, since the character of security or quid pro quo to be given by him could not be decided until they were found. Major Cox suggested that a lien on the works as they nroT greased would be a feasible form of security in the event of an irrigation or other utili-tarian scheme being undertaken by the Sheikh ■with our assistance. Before, however, the foregoing telegram had been communicated to His Majesty’s Government, Sir E. Grey had informed Sir G. Barclay that the British Government were under no obligation to the Sheikh to provide him with a loan; that no hope of a loan should be held out to him; and that he must be left to make his own terms with the Syndicate for land at Abadan and any other facilities required by them. 11. Erom a conversation which the Sheikh Relations of the Sheikh ^ith Major Cox at of Mohammerah with the end of December, it thePersianGovernment. appeared that he was already getting anxious as to the elfect of the revolutionary movement in Persia on his own position. He represented that the greater part of Persia was completely out of control, that the payment of revenue was being very generally suspended by the local chiefs and peasantry, and that, if he had only his present and personal interests to consider, he was in a strong position to refuse revenue, to turn out the Belgian Customs, and to avail himself of other openings in a similar direction, as oppor tunity arose. So far from pursuing such a policy, he claimed that he was neglecting these convenient opportunities simply in order not to injure his position w r ith the British Govern ment. He begged once again for our constant and vigilant solicitude for his best interests and candid advice as to how he could best shape his footsteps. Major Cox and Mr. McDouall endeavoured to reassure and persuade him that the line of conduct which he had hitherto pursued was the correct one, and that per severance in it would be best calculated to enable the British Government to support his interests. With reference to the customs, the Sheikh informed Mr. McDouall that when the British Government persuaded him to accept the customs arrangement the whole country between Mohammerah and Lingah was wait ing to see what action he w r ould take. The firman under which the customs was established at Mohammerah declares that the directorship is vested in him; but that, as he had not the necessary men, the Persian Government would appoint a director and an assistant and that the rest of the staff would be ap pointed by the Sheikh in consultation with them. The first directors carried out these stipulations. They recommended men to him, and he sanctioned their engagement; but they gradually referred less and less to him, the last director appointed one or two men without consulting him, and the present one had made sweeping changes in the staff without any reference to him at all.n As regards bis relations with the popular movement, the Sheikh mentioned that he had already been asked by leaders of the popular party to declare himself, and he had been advised to seize the customs and send assistance to Tabriz. Requests for assistance iiad at the same time reached him from the Shah through the Nizam-es-Sultaneh. He was in danger of falling between two stools, and would like our advice as to what course he should pursue. The question was, however, not pressing and no reply was given at the time. On the 10th March, Major Cox tele graphed that the Sheikh had represented that the assurances which had been given to him on the 1st December on behalf of Government (paragraph 17 of the Memorandum for January), would only safeguard him so Ion'- as Persia remains on her feet.

O’Conor jor March 1JU8). ^ In this despatch Sir N O Conor, then Ambassador at Constantinople' was informed that in the Mohamme -an district His Majesty’s Government w“r“15 3 A T ^ t prepared to recognise any other frontier than that laid down by the mediating Commis sioners in 1850, and that, moreover, the Ottoman Minister for Foreign Ailairs had, in November 1893, informed His Majesty s Ambassador to the effect that “ the Turkish Government laid no claim whatever to Mohammerah”. Any advance of Ottoman troops to the south, more especially in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, likely to cause a disturbance of the status quo at Mohammerah, would therefore affect British interests, and might not improbably lead to the active intervention of His Majesty s Government, who had given the ^ Sheikh certain assurances in regard to his territory. The Constitutionalists continued to exert very strong pressure on the Sheikh to espouse the popular cause, and the difficulty of his position was aggravated by the fact that it was impossible for him to get any private te e- gram to the Shah or Prime Minister past the Nationalist censorships at Ispahan. On the 26th March, Major Cox, who had arrived at Mohammerah, reported that the Sheikh had informed him that the situation at Mohammerah had been rendered much more critical by the news of the recent suc cesses of the Nationalists at Bunder Abbas and Bushire, and he anticipated that their unruly levies would now turn their attention to his outlying ports of Dilam, Hindean, &amp;c., and that he could not hold out much longer, unless he could be assured that the British Government would give him effective support in resisting the Nationalists and would protect him against the subsequent consequences of his so doing; he added that he must take some course which would save his face with both parties. Major Cox replied that he had no power to give any such guarantee. The Sheikh went on to explain that, if the customs receipts continued to be forwarded to Tehran, Nationalist resentment would be unrestrainable; that he, as head of tie Mohammerah customs, w r ould be made ^spon sible for the receipts, and that, if the British Government ■were unable to intervene, or to give him definite advice, he vvould have to ask the Belgian Director to retain the receipts in the custom-house premises under adequate guardship until matters became quieter. The following is the extent of assurances asked for by the Sheikh :— Firstly, to be assured that the British Government will not allow any ^ Persian rdgime, whether absolute or constitutional, to disturb the status quo in regard to himselt or his successors; V,1G Secondly, that, as long as he fulfils his obligations to us, the British Government will not disturb it; and Thirdly, that His Majesty’s Government 'will oppose any power attempting to do so. When the Sheikh realised from Major Cox’s replies to his enquiries that a dynastic guarantee could not be given, he earnestly begged that the assurances given to him {paragraph 17 of the Memorandum for January) might at least be extended to his immediate offspring, provided that thev give us satisfaction. He said that he was quite ready to satisfy us as to the concurrence of the Tribunal of Sheikhs. Sir E. Grey had, however, before these requests^ had been communicated to His Majesty’s Government, already approved the instructions given to Major Cox by Sir G. Barclay, in respect of the revolutionary move ment and the assurances required bv the Sheikh. SirE. Grey added, “ Great Britain and .Russia having promised to respect Persia’s integrity, we cannot admit the possibility of her ceasing to be a Sovereign State or beino* occupied by Foreign Powers. Our assurances would be more binding than ever in the eventuality which the Sheikh contemplates. He should not forget the danger of losing ms present strong and unhampered position tJ ^gaging in political party connections. H the Sheikh shows signs of following the example of the Nationalists at Bunder Abbas and seizing the Persian customs, he should be dissuaded’’. In communicating these orders Barclay informed him that the Sheikh’s proposed action in regard to the customs appeared to be unobjectionable. 12. Sardar Assad and two other Bakhtiari Sardar Assad. Chiefs en route to Persia arrived at Bombay on the 5th and left on the 11th March for Moham- merah, which they reached about the 22nd It was Sardar Assad’s intention, unless the Constitution was granted, to join the Samsam and march to Tehran. He tried to persuade the Sheikh of Mohammernh to declare for the Constitution, but the Sheikh was anxious to avoid an explicit declaration. 13. {Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- ,, Iji 5j ltin 8 ar| d buoying randum for February \ the Persian Gulf. * 0n f n V, ,' -yr. n ^ 11th March, Major Cox raised the question as to what inti- ma ion should be made to the local authorities m connection with the proceedings of the Committee of Enquiry.

The 29th March was fixed as the date on which the Committee were to assemble at Maskat. Abu Musa red oxide concession. 14i. (Videparagraph 16 of the memo randum for February 1909.) Major Cox reported on the 5th March that a definite order had been given by Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. for a sample shipment of 400 tons of oxide urgently. The firm agreed to pay half the price in advance, at the rate of 15s. 6d. per ton. Major Cox had therefore called at Lingah and made necessary arrangements for the immediate commence ment of mining that amount under the super vision of the Residency Agent and his brother. He also addressed a letter to the Sheikh of Shargah, explaining the arrangements made in his interests for the supply of this particular consignment. Up to date, Hassan had not resumed operations, nor had the Germans made any further move. In reply to an enquiry from the Government of India, Major Cox stated the final settlement of the German case would not be prejudiced by com pliance with Messrs. Strick &amp; Co.’s request, and that there need be no apprehension that the operations would result in ultimate loss to Government. The Government of India in telegraphing the above facts to His Majesty’s Secretary of State on the 17th March proposed, with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Govern ment, to approve Major Cox’ action. 15. (Vide paragraph 18 of the Memo- Appointment of an randum for February.) Italian Agent at Maskat. Further information was received from the Secretary of State on the 25th February to the effect that the Italian Ambassador had further explained that Signor Omar’s mission was “ limited to the question of the repression of the traffic in arms ” and that he would remain a simple confidential informer. 16. Persian claim sovereignty Bahrein. to over (Vide paragraph 19 of the Memo randum for February 1909.) On the 16th February, His Majesty’s Government, in approving Sir G. Barclay’s action in returning the Mushir-ed- Howleh’s note, pointed out that the Persian Government should clearly understand that they in no way departed from their attitude in considering the island of Bahrein andits inhabitants to be under British protec tion, and that the question would be raised again when an opportunity occurred. On the 22nd January, prior, however, to the receipt of this communication, the Meftah- es-Sultaneh, late Chief of the English Section at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, called on Sir G. Barclay on behalf of the Ala-es-Sultaneh to say that, if he (Sir G. Barclay) would with draw his note returning the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s objectionable communication, the Persian Government would send him, in substitution for the latter, an amended note in the sense desired. If this arrangement were not accept ed, the Persian Government would be obliged to send a strong reply to Sir G. Barclay’s note. As this would have raised the general question of Bahrein, for which the moment was con sidered inopportune, Sir G. Barclay accepted the proposed arrangement and received an amended note from the Persian Government accordingly. The amended note stated inter alia that, by referring to previous notes of the Persian Foreign Ministry regarding Persian claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and its inhabitants, the British Government would be quite enlightened as to the arguments of the Persian Government on the subject.

(Vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum for March 1909.) At Situation in Persia. interview on the 15th March the Shah is said to have expressed to M.' Sabline his concern at the Russian and British representations being delayed. His Majesty, who appeared to hope that these representations would offer some way of escaping from the difficult position in which he was placed, asked M. Sabline for advice. The latter replied that it would help to relieve the situation, if His Majesty gave his consent to the Minister for Foreign Affairs* proposal, that a meeting of the representatives of the various parties and classes in Tehran should be called to consider the situation. The Shah promised to give his consent. Telegraphing on the 24th March, Sir G. Barclay reported that the Shah was shown to be as insincere as ever by the proposal he had made for the composition of the Medjliss, which, if held, would, no doubt, pronounce against a Constitution. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was very discouraged, had stated that he would not attend the Medjliss. A joint memorandum, expressing their disapproval of the list of persons selected to take part, has been presented by Sir G. Barclay and his Russian colleague. Eventually, as a result of further Anglo- Russian negotiations, a joint memorandum was presented to the Shah by the British and Russian Representatives on the 22nd April, which made it a condition of any financial assistance that Amir Bahadur Jang and the Grand Vizier should be dismissed, and that His Majesty should, after the introduction of the following reforms, undertake to re-establish a constitutional regime :— (а) That a Cabinet should be formed composed of persons worthy of confidence, and that suitable persons belonging to -different parties should immediately be added to the Council of the Empire; a list of candidates for the Cabinet and Council to be privately submitted by both Legations to the Shah. (б) A new electoral law to be elaborated and promulgated by the Council; the date of2 elections and of the convocation of the Assembly to be made public without delay. (c) The Shah to grant a general amnesty, subject to the limitations already agreed upon, namely, that only those persons who have committed political crimes and who have taken up arms against the Shah shall be included in the amnesty, which is not to extend to those who are guilty of offences against the common law. In regard to these, and those by whom acts of brigandage have been committed, guarantees, that they should have an impartial trial, to be obtained from the Persian Government. As regards the form of financial assistance to be given, the memorandum contemplates that, if they think it necessary, the Russian Government shall advance £100,000 to the Persian Government as soon as the above measures have been taken by the Shah; and that, when they think it necessary, the British Go\ ernment shall make a similar advance to the Persian Government wdien an elected Assembly has accepted the principle of a loan. . . It is indicated in the memorandum that, if it is found necessary afterwards to face a larger loan to Persia, this can be effected only under certain guarantees, which will form the subject of a subsequent exchange of views between the two Governments and the Persian Government. In submitting this programme, the two Representatives were to make a categorical statement to the effect that, if the Shah did not accept the programme in all its details, he was no longer to count on support from the two Governments, w ho would desist from giving him advice and leave him to his own devices! In acknowledging the communication, the Shah is alleged to have asked for more than the advance of £100,000. The two Represent atives pointed out that their communication held out hope of more: and that both Governments would do their best to accelerate the loan, the need for which was recognised when ^ an Assembly was working and the financial administration reformed. It has been proposed to the Russian Government that the advance beginning with £100,000, which Russia will give on receipt from the Shah of satisfactory assurances should be put to the joint account of the two Representatives, who will disburse it in instal ments f5 the Persian Government after an agreement has been come to between them and approved by the financial adviser. No reply has yet been received from the Russian Gov ernment, but they indicate the view that His Majesty’s Government should participate in the first advance in the event of their accent ing the British proposal. ' ^(Paragraph 1 Situation in Azerbaijan. Early Marend was captured by the subsequently threatened Julfa. ing villages were burnt and inhabitants taking refuge on an of the Memorandum for March 1909.) in March Royalists who The surround- pillaged, the island in the river as the Russians refused them asylum. At Tabriz itself during the month of March the situation has passed from bad to worse and the suffering among the poorer classes has been very great, many deaths from starvation taking place. The city has been controlled by an assembly which is divided by dissen sions. On the 28th March, it was estimated that only three weeks’ provisions remained, and it was rumoured that an attack on a foreign Consulate had been projected in order to force on intervention. The military were opposed to any attempts to treat for peace, though a section of the nationalists were will ing to do so. The correspondent of the “ Daily News,” Mr. Moore, is reported to have joined the nationalists on 1st April, his example being followed by a leading member of the American Mission. On 4th April, the Royalists for the first time shelled the town of Tabriz causing some casualties among non-combatants and damage to buildings, and on the 6th Mr. Wratislaw reported that a relieving force from Salmas had reached Dizakhalil. On the 20th April, an imminent attack on the Consulates at Tabriz by the famished population being apprehended by the British and Russian Consuls, the two Representatives demanded a truce and leave to introduce provisions. The Shah consented to a six days' truce. However, as the Shah's Generals did nothing to facilitate the entry of food, and the situation again became acute, a Russian force of 2,000 men crossed the frontier. The troops received orders to guard the entry of provisions by the Julfa road, and to abstain from interference in the struggle. The Shah subsequently ordered a cessation of hostilities and facilities to be provided for the introduction of food into the town. Throughout Situation at Ettht. March, Caucasians from Russia appear to have been constantly arriving at Resht. The reinforcement to the Consular guard the despatch of which had already been reported {vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum for March) is said to have arrived at Resht on the 22nd March. Sir A. Nicolson telegraphed on the 7th April that he had received a memorandum from the Russian Government in which it was stated that, because of the increasing alarm in North ern Persia, and because the measures taken up to the present to prevent the passage ofi Mi f Situation at Tehran. arms and of Caucasian anarchists into Persia had failed, it had been decided by the Russian Government to send a gun-boat to Enzeli as a stationaire and another man-of-war to do police duty off that port. Like measures were to be taken in the Gulf of Asterabad. A later report from Tehran showed that Asterabad appeared to be at the mercy of Turkomans who were acting under orders from the Shah. There was no material alteration in the position at Tehran during March. To wards the end of the month the late Minister of Finance, Sani-ed-Dowleh, who is a promi nent nationalist, and who in consequence despairs of his life in Tehran, took refuge in the British Embassy. Sir G. Barclay was arranging to get him out of the country as quickly as possible. {Paragraph 12 of the Memorandum for March and paragraph situation at Ispahan. 1 of the Memorandum for February 1909.) At the beginning of April the Samsam endeavoured to ascertain from His Majesty’s Legation the real situation at Tabriz. Sir G. Barclay, however, refused to comply with the Samsam’s request. The Bakhtiaris at Ispahan are said to have announced their intention of starting for Tehran on the 20th. Sardar Assad, with some 2,000 horse, was expected at Ispahan about the 15th. Towards the end of March riots occurred a t Kermanshah direct- ed principally against Jews, several of whom were killed. One house belonging to a British subject uas looted by the troops. {Vide paragraph 1 of the Memo- «... . * ,. randum for March 1909.) The position at Bushire during the first week in April grew steadily more serious. The nationalists, who had been unable to get rid of Saiyid Murtaza or to bring him to reason, refused to associate with him or to accept any responsibility for his actions. The Saiyid, whose inability to control the tufangchis was apparent, repudiated responsibility for the preservation of order. On the 7th April a part of the bazaar was raided by the tufangchis and looted, and disturbances again occurred on the 8th. In reply to representations which he had made to the Saiyid, Major Cox was informed by him that efforts were being made to clear the town of the men. These efforts proved unsuccessful. In view of the pressing representations of the Russian, German and Turkish Representatives, Major Cox presented an ultimatum to the Saiyid on the 9thApril to the effect that, if the tufangchis did not leave the town, men and guns would be landed to clear them out. As no reply was received, Major Cox, with the approval of His Majesty’s Legation, landed 100 men from His Majesty’s S. S. Fox&gt; after issuing a pro clamation that the step was being taken for the protection of British subjects and other foreigners. Most of the Tangistanis left the town, but Saiyid Murtaza retained about two or three hundred tufangchis, whose presence kept the town in a state of trepidation. In consequence of reports that the Darya Begi was setting out for Bushire in the interests of the Shah, Major Cox informed the Legation that it would be inadvisable to utilise our forces to expel all tufangchis, as this course would result in the restoration of the Shah’s authority by the Darya Begi and w T ould impair the Nationalists* trust in our neutrality. He thought it preferable to have the Darya Begi’s progress stopped from Tehran. The Nationalists and Loyalists both considered that security could only be restored by the expul sion of the Saiyid, which they could not do un aided, and Major Cox enquired whether assist ance should be afforded, especially in view of the Russian Consul-General’s concurrence in the need for expeditious action. Sir G. Barclay, however, was unable, without the sanction of His Majesty’s Government, to authorise the use of blue-jackets to expel the Saiyid, unless foreign lives were in danger, as we should be placed in the position of deciding on whom the government should fall, since no satisfac tory authority existed to take up the task of government. The Saiyid should, he thought, be warned that force would be employed against him in the event of an attack on foreigners. On the 16th April, the Government of India sanctioned a proposal made by Major Cox to bring up a detachment of 50 Native Infan try with a British officer to relieve the blue jackets landed from the Fox, but, in view of the opinion of Sir G. Barclay that such a step might be liable to misinterpretation, the pro posal was not carried into effect. The customs question was temporarily solved by the landing of the men from H. M. 8. Fox. The customs receipts had been paid to the joint account of three Persian merchants in trust until the 8th April, when Saiyid Murtaza forcibly appropriated them, thus obtaining possession of the whole customs income from the 23rd March, amounting to about 20,000 tomans. A body of 50 men was, however, placed at the Custom House and the Saiyid was thus prevented from further appropriations, the customs receipts being kept under guard at the Custom House in the possession of Belgian officials till a satisfactory arrangement was arrived at with the Nationalists in regard to6 their apportionment. The Belgian officials took service with the Nationalists under directions from the Administrator. On the 22nd April, M. Zwinne diverted 12,000 krans from the customs receipts in payment for coal shipped by the Persepolis. Major Cox refused to accept M. Zwinne’s explanation of malentendu and called on him to replace the money by the forenoon of the 23rd. The Persepolis was at the same time forbidden to leave the harbour. M. Zwinne’s action was apparently prompted by the necessity of despatching the Persepolis to Basrah to bring the Darya Begi and his force to Bushire. As his action constituted a breach of faith and also compromised our neutrality, Major Cox was authorised to detain the Persepolis until the money was refunded and until such time had elapsed as would suffice for coaling the ship. A com mittee was meanwhile formed to control the customs receipts and expenditure. Subse quently M. Zwinne was instructed to refund the money, and Major Cox was authorised to detain the Persepobs till further orders, on the ground that she could not ha^e left, had no*, the Tangistanis been compelled to quit the town. On the 16th April, Major Cox » , ... reported that the iN ationalist leaders at Bunder Abbas had agreed to lodge the customs receipts in the Consulate minus departmental expenses and 83 tomans which they would retain daily. This arrangement received Sir G. Barclay’s approval. {Vide paragraph 1 of the Memo- .. , ,, , , randum for March 1909.) On the 3rd April, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General reported that his Russian colleague had given out that 100 Cossacks with two guns were com ing to Meshed. The Russian Chared d’Affaires at Tehran explained to Sir G. Barclay that the inci eased guard had been asked for by the Russian Consul-General at Meshed owing to the disorder at that place being due to an anti-Russian propaganda, to a Russian subject having been killed, and to his own life having been threatened. Major Sykes, however, maintained that the disturb ances were entirely due, as he had previously reported, to the turbulence of Russian subjects, and that the murdered man, who was an Armenian, had a Persian passport and appa rently was not a Russian subject, but in any case a revolutionary. The British Ambas sador at St. Petersburgh was informed by the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs that the Russian consular guard at Meshed had been increased, and that the increase had been made under exactly the same conditions as at Resht i.e.y for the protection of the lives and property of the subjects of Russia and other foreigners. The Russian Consul would continue to abstainmorning Situation at Turbat-i~ Said art. from all intervention in the struggle between the Shah’s partisans and the revolutionaries. The reinforcement for the Russian Consular Guard, which consisted of 30 gunners with two maxims, 75 Cossacks, and 6 Turkoman levies, under four officers, arrived at Meshed on the 25th April, and was received by the Persian General with troops lined up Major Sykes said that the inhabitants of Meshed were then completely cowed, and that the new Governor-General, who had not yet put in an apjiearance, might now come to Meshed. On the morning of the 15th March, one Yawar Asadulla, a Persian outlaw, raided Turbat-i-Haidari at the bead of two hundred well armed Baluchis, murdered the Deputy Governor, who was temporarily in charge owing to a change in Governors, and took possession of the town. The Meshed Anjuman directed him to maintain order there pending the arrival of the new Governor. The in vaders, who styled themsel ves constitutionalists, announced to foreigners and others that life and property would be respected, and Asadulla sent a message to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul saying that he considered himself a friend of the British and would always help them. The people of Turbat were reported to be quite satisfied with the turn of events. On the 5th April, Major Sykes reported that some of the Russian revolutionaries had gone to Turbat where the new Governor had, the day before, been defeated with casualties and had fled. No further details of this occurrence have yet been received. 2. {Vide paragraph 7 of the JMemo- Irs^curity of Shiraz- Vanduirn f r October Ispahan road. 1908.) Great insecurity prevails on the roads in Pars. In March, a British subject (Agent for Messrs. Ziegler) w as robbed and totally stripped near Sivand on the Shiraz-Ispahan road by Lashani tribesmen. During April, the Kuhgulu were out, robbing and murdering, in the neighbourhood of Yezdi Khast. British subjects have been warned not to travel by this route. 3. (Vide paragraph 3 of the Memo randum for March 1909.) In a despatch, dated the 13th February, Sir G. Barclay reported that the Minister for Foreign Affairs bad recently asked him in the course of con versation why the two Powers had warned the Zil-es-Sultan that their guarantees w r ould be cancelled if His Imperial Highness returned to Persia. Sir G. Barclay replied that these guarantees had only been given on the under standing that the Zil left Persia, and that they must therefore naturally cease to be held good if he returned. The Minister for Foreign The Zil-es-Sultan.8 c c Affairs, who seemed for some reason to desire the return of the Zil, told Sir G. Barclay that he had secured from the Shah guarantees for the Zil’s security should he come back, and had transmitted a message to him to this effect. The Russian Minister, who was informed of this conversation, told Sir G. Barclay that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had not men tioned the matter to him. 4. On the 22nd March, Sir G. Barclay Persian Minister in enquired whether the London. appointment of Mom- taz-ul-Mulk, who was Minister at Washington, and brother of the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, as Persian Minister in London would be acceptable to His Majesty the King. Sir G. Barclay had been told by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that he would send Mom- taz-ul-Mulk his credentials to Washington, and that the Momtnz-ul-Mulk would return to Tehran for a month or two after he had presented them in London. Sir E. Grey replied on the 5th April that the appointment of the Momtaz-ul-Mulk would be acceptable to the King. Proposed replacement of the Seistan branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia by the Punjab Banking Company. of India suggested to 5. {Vide paragraph 28 of the Memo randum for April 1208.) In a despatch, dated the 15th April 1909, the Government His Majesty’s Govern ment the desirability of replacing the Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia in Seistan by an institution with a more elastic constitution. It was pointed out that unless the constitu tion of the Imperial Bank was modified so as to admit of its undertaking trade agency busi ness, its utility as a means for the furtherance of our trade interests largely failed. If, there fore, the Imperial Bank were unable to meet their wishes in the matter, the Government of India recommended that negotiations should be opened with the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Punjab Banking Company with a view to transferring the business to the latter. 6. On the 8th April 1909, the Political visit of Colonel Von Resident in the Persian G t ulf reported the arrival to Kerman. of a Russian surveyor with an assistant, two cossacks, and three Brahuis at Nasratabad Ispe. It subsequently transpired that the Russian in question was Colonel Von der Flaas, the Russian Military Attache in Seistan, who was proceeding on a visit to Kerman. The Russian Consul in Seistan declared that Colonel Von der Flaas, who had gone off without permission, would be recalled. The Attache’s arrival at Kerman was sub sequently reported by Major Ducat.9 3?* 7. M. Mornard, of the Persian Customs, Grant of permission Wh .° is sported to have to M.

Nicolson was instructed by His Majesty’s Government on the 5th March 1909 that, in the event of the Russian Government pressing the point of the method of procedure to be adopted at Tehran with regard to the exchange of control of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf-Seistan Telegraph lines, they should be informed that, while His Majesty’s Govern ment entirely share the desire of the Russian Government for the speedy settlement of the exchange of control of the lines, they consider that tiie Persian Government are more likely to waive their objections to this exchange if they have first been well disposed by the financial advantages arising from the transfer to the British Government of control over the Arabistan line. With regard to his suggestion that the Russian Government would probably raise objections to the employment of British signallers on the telegraph lines from Shahrud and Meshed to the frontier, Sir A. Nicolson was told that there was no need for him to raise the question. On the 9th March, His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran suggested that, if the construction of a second line to Shahrud was pressed for by the Persian Minister of Telegraphs, it would be well that authority should be given to the Indo- European Telegraph Department to under take the preliminary work (which might be abandoned by degrees when the telegraph negotiations were completed), as the negotia tions, which were being hastened as much as possible in Persia, might be jeopardised by a direct refusal. On the 17th March, Sir A. Nicolson was instructed to explain the situa tion to the Russian Government, and to ask them if they wished the preliminary work to be undertaken by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 9. (Vide paragraph 5 of the Memo- State of the Tehran- randum for March Meshed telegraph line. 1909) On the 10th February 1909, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, drew the attention of the Russian Minister to the report that the usual repairs to the Khaf-Seistan telegraph line had not been executed during the past year, al though the Tehran-Meshed line, the control of which it was intended should be handed over to Russia in exchange for that of the10 Kbaf-Seistan line, had been repaired as usual. M. Sabline said that he believed it was the case that the Khaf-Nasratabad line bad not been repaired, and promised to inform the res ponsible authorities at Tiflis that Sir G. Barclay bad drawn bis attention to the omis sion. 10. {Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo- Arms traffic in the randum for March Persian Gulf. 19 09.) Reports received through the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, show that over one thousand rifles were landed on the Mekran Coast during the month ending the 15th April. {Vide paragraph 17 of the Memorandum for April 1908.) On the IGth April, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed to make arrangements with the Director, Indo-European Telegraphs, for the deputation of a telegraphist to Bam to send information regarding the arms traffic. A large arms caravan with 700 Afghans is said to have arrived at Nasratabad-Ispe on the 23rd April and to have proceeded in the direction of Neh. 11. On the 21st February, Sir A. Nicolson Arabistan telegraph addressed to the Russ.an lines- Ministry for Foreign Affairs an aide-memoire, communicating the opinion cf His Majesty’s Government as regards the conclusion of a secret agreement to provide for the employment of Russian signallers on the Arabistan line {ride para graph 7 of the emorandum for March 1909 ); and stating that, with regard to the Tehran-Khanikin line, it appeared to His Majesty’s Government that the exchange of the Memoranda of the 10th (23rd) June and 11th (24th) August 1907 constituted a sufficient record of the agreement arrived at between the British and Russian Governments, and that, should any further agreement be necessary, it would be preferable that it should be deferred until the consent of the Persian Government had been obtained to the proposed arrangement in regard to the Arabistan system. [ l n the M emoranda referred to above, the British Government had made, and the Russian Government had accepted in principle, the proposition that the Russian Government should not object to the renewal for 20 years of the concessions of the telegraph lines from Tehran to Bushire, from Jask to Gwadur, and of the Central Persian telegraph line to Rohat, and in return the British Gov ernment would surrender to the Russian Gov ernment their rights over the Tehran-Khanikin line {vide the two concluding clauses of paragraph 8(4) of the Memorandum for September 1907) ]. 12. {Vide paragraph 9 of the Memo- Karun irrigation con- randum for March ce88ion - 1909.) As regards the11 Dutch concession, M. ter Meulcn is reported to have read to Lieuteuant Wilson a letter which he had received from M. van lioggen, the Dutch Engineer. The letter stated that M. de Sturler had received a telegram saying that the concession, which was for 91) years, had been signed. The syndicate must be formed within two years. This tends directly to traverse the assurances given to His Majesty’s Minister by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the effect that no actual concession had been granted but only an option for two years (see paragi aph 16 of the Memoravtdum for January 1909). Sir William Willcccks, who recently pro ceeded up the Karun, accompanied by His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, has in formed Major Cox that in his opinion the best interests of the Sheikh lie in the postponement of the scheme for works at Ahwaz and in making a start with a scheme from the Kerkha river. He considered both schemes especially the Kerkha project very easy and very remunerative. 13. (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo- Proposed loan to the vandum for March Sheikh Of Mohammerah. 19o9.) Major Cox tele graphed to Sir G. Barclay on the 5th April, with reference to the refusal of His Majesty’s Gov ernment to accede to the Sheikh’s request for a loan, that the Sheikh did not suggest or con sider that the Britisli Government were under an ‘‘obligation to grant him a loan”, that he had been under pressure of great anxiety and had simply counted on the friendly desire of the British Government to promote his interests, and hoped for an assurance that they would do their best to find him the money for irrigation works when the need arose, either by means of a Government loan or the introduction of British financiers. Major Cox pressed that he might be permitted to inform the Sheikh that in the case of a small loan the Government of India would accommodate him on learning the amount and object in view, and that if a larger amount were required for utilitarian purposes, the British Government would endeavour to obtain the money for him from British sources. The Government of India, in a telegram dated the 9th April to His Majesty’s Secretary of State, strongly support ed Major Cox’s recommendation. They drew attention to the vital imports nee to Indian inter ests of maintaining British influence with the Sheikh, and emphasised the importance w hich the Sheikh’s attitude might assume in certain eventualities, expressing general concurrence with the views expressed by Lord Curzon’s Government, in their telegram dated the 26th November 1902. The communication quoted pointed out that our weakness in Persia arose largely from failure to support those Chiefs and officials w T ho inclined to our side,12 •arid expressed the opinion ihat, if there was a Unef entitled to such support, it was the ©neikh ot JVIohammerah, and if there was a part of Southern I’ersia where British interests specially demanded protection against foreign competition or intrigue, it was the mouth ot the Karun. In reply, the Secretary of State tele graphed on the Kith April to the effect that he had communicated the foregoing telegram to the Foreign Office, and had intimated that he adhered to his view that no charge should on this account be laid upon Indian revenues. JJe saw no objection to the suggestion that the Sheikh might be given general assurances that, if money were required by him for any purpose to which the British Government had no objection, they would do what they could to laciiitate his obtaining it from British sources. • . On the 29th April, the Political Resident inthelersian Gulf telegraphed that, it had been reported by His Majesty's Consul Ahwaz, that the Sheikh was alleged to have contracted a loan of £10,000 from the Germans, ilie rumour has not as yet been confirmed. His Majesty's Consul at, Mohammerah, who a 'card nothing of the rumour, is making enquiries in the matter. ° U - (Tideparagraph 11 of the Memo. Relations of the ran dum for March Sneikh of Mohammerah 1909). Maior Cox inti- witn the Persian Gov- nmtorl n +1 ^, ernment. mated, on the 5th o- T , r , , . , April, with reference to bn R. Grey s instructions as to the assurances to be given to the Sheikh, that these might satisfy the Sheikh so far as concerned the contingency of the break up of Persia or of intervention by Foreign Powers, but that H° U d *r qmre some de finite reply as to whether the guarantees already riven to VT. I1 ^ ' ,dei 1 1 protection against intrenchment Ins rights by a possible constitutional regime and also in regard to an extension of existin'' guarantees to his immediate offspring. ° In reply, Major Cox was instructed by Sir G. Barclay to inform the Sheikh that His Majesty s Government, were ready to give him the same support against any encroachment on Jus lights as was promised him in 1902 ($pp paragraph 17of the Memoranaumfor January 1909) whatever change of Government there might hem Persia. Major Cox was also To itmind him that the assurances of His Majesty s Government had already been ex tended to his successors, so that, as his offspring would presumably succeed him, the assurances did m fact already apply to them. If, how ever, this did not satisfy the Sheikh, there was no objection to extending the guarantee already given, to “ his heirs and successors.”v 13 Early in April the Sheikh received tele grams from the Samsam at Ispahan and Saiyid Murtaza of Bushire, calling on him to prevent the Darya Begi, who was at Baghdad, from re turning to Bushire. The Samsam also pressed the Sheikh to remit the customs receipts to Ispahan for the expenses of a march on the capital. To the latter request the Sheikh replied that the British authorities had officially notified him that the Mohammerah customs must not be touched, being pledged to them. As regards the former question, the Sheikh, who had at the same time been appealed to by the authorities at Tehran to provide the Darya Begi with 300 riflemen, was again urged by Sir G. Barclay, whose advice he asked, not to mix himself up in party politics. Major Cox also instructed His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah to advise the Sheikh privately to take a trip up the Karun when tne Darya Begi was nearing Mohammerah. 15. (Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- Abu Musa red oxide randiwi for March Concession. 1909.) On the 13th April, His Majesty’s Secretary of State inti mated that the action of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf might be approved on the assumption that care would be taken not to supply any oxide to Messrs. Strick &amp; Co., which could be claimed by Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. No communication would be made to the German Government. Major Cox was informed accordingly on the 15th April. 16. (Vide paragraph 15 of the Memo- Bed oxide mining con- randum for February cessions in the Persian 1909.) On the 2nd Gulf ’ April, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf informed the Government of India that the Agent for Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. had asked for permission for, and assistance in, obtaining samples from the island of Halul, and other islands and had been informed that the Political Resident could not comply without consulting the Government of India, as two or three Arab Sheikhs claimed rights in the island. On the 25th April, Major Cox was asked to arrange to obtain a preliminary sample for Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. By this means attention will not be attracted to the island, and should the firm desire to undertake operations, the ques tion of granting permission can be considered deliberately. (Vide paragraphs 18 and 19 of the Memorandum lor January 19o9.) On the 21st April, Major Cox reported that employes of the Muin had operated on Earur and its littoral, and had excavated about 100 tons of oxide in Sirri. His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reminded the Persian Government of the caveat by the British Government, stated14 that he was unable to recognise the Muin as the coTiC€S8ionciir6 1 and requested that measures should be taken to stop him from further operations on Sirri. Sir G. Barclay informed the Muin of the attitude of the British Gov ernment with regard to Sirri, and reminded him that he had given no proof of any rights as regards oxide in the Persian Gulf beyond those conferred by the firman granted to him in 1904 by the Persian Government. In reply, the M uin gave a promise to desist from mining operations in Sirri. 17. (Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- ^ ♦ randum for March sovereignty over 1909.) On the 17th Bahrein. March, Sir E. Grey, in informing Sir G. Barclay that His Majesty’s Government had approved his (Sir G. Barclay’s) action in accepting the amended note of the Persian Government, pointed out that he should at the same time impress on the latter that His Majesty’s Government could not consider the arrangement as final, that they maintained their original attitude on the subject, and that they would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian authorities make it necessary. 18. [Vide paragraph 997 of the Memo- randum (Arabian ej a airs. affairs) for December 1908]. Hamoud-ibn-Sebhan, the uncle and guardian of the young Emir of Hail Sooud- ibn-Rashid, has apparently for some time been trying to unite the various sub-tribes of Shammar under his command and to draw to bis side as many tribes of the Nejd as possible. He is said to be now in a position to defy Ibn Saoud and his forces concentrated in Kassim. The latter has been deserted by the powerful tribes of Oteibeh and Muteir. Eurther, the strong sub-tribe of Shammar, Aslem, who, it was reported, had left Ibn Rashid about a year ago and joined Ibn Saoud, has now turned back to Ibn Sebhan’s side. The latter is said to have retired from the Kassim frontiers to Hail early in the year. Ibn Saoud is reported to have been at Bureideh, in Kassim, about January. It was, therefore, not considered probable that these two rivals would be engaged in battle in the near future. On the 16th February, Consul Devey reported that Ibn Rashid had succeeded in making an alliance with the Harb tribe of the Hedjaz. Ibn Saoud, on being informed of this, led an expedition against the tribe and severely defeated them. Ibn Rashid had, mean while, attacked and inflicted severe losses on the Muteir tribe.4-2 15 The Political Agent, Koweit, reports that news has been received through Sheikh Mubarak of Koweit that the pay of Ibn Saoud has recently been fixed by the Turkish Government at T. £220, a month, on the condition that he would look for advice and assistance to that Government and not to Sheikh Mubarak or any one else.

(Vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum for _ April 1909) On the Situation in Persia. ^ April Sir q. clay reported that he and his Russian colleague had intimated to the Shah that no Cabinet which included his uncle, Narrob-es-Sultaneh, would meet the requirements of the joint programme of advice given to His Majesty on the 22nd April. This was done, because the two Re presentatives had heard that the Shah contem plated the appointment of the Narrob, who is a reactionary of the worst type, as Grand Vizier. The Secretary of State approved this action. On the 3rd May, the Persian Minister was informed that no Cabinet, in which the Saad- ed-Dowleh and the Nasr-ul-Mulk were not included, could he regarded as inspiring con fidence. Telegraphing on the 4th May Sir G. Barclay reported that, the two Representatives had been officially informed by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that the joint advice, which they had tendered on the 22nd April, had been accepted by the Shah, who, how ever, desired explanations on points of detail. His Majesty had issued a rescript promising the re-establishment of a Constitutional regime in accordance with the country’s needs and subject to the limitations of Muhammadan law. The elections had been fixed for the 19th Julv and the electoral law had been promised shortly. On the 10th. May, the Shah issued a proclamation, ordering the immediate elabora tion of an electoral law by a number of learned Constitutionalists, who were trusted by the Government and the people, and who would be added to the Council. The law was to be published without delay, the elections beginning immediately afterwards; and the National Assembly being opened in the place where it first sat, as soon as two-thirds of the deputies were ready. The Cabinet was, the two Representatives thought, as good as circumstances permitted, their private suggestions having been adopted by the Shah. The Saad-ed-Dowleh was to act as Prime Minister pending the return of the2 Nasr-ul-Mulk. A general amnesty for political offences was granted by another decree which also permitted the return of the exiles. Amir Jang remained at the Palace, but his influence was destroyed for the moment. To facilitate the restoration of order the British and Kussian Consuls at the centres of revolt were instructed by the two Representatives to arrange to show the Nationalists that it was now their duty to strive for a reconcilia tion between the Shah and his people. During the following fortnight there was an improvement in the political situation. The direction of affairs was left by the Shah in a great measure in the hands of the Cabinet, and a rescript was issued declaring that both the fundamental laws of 1906 and 1907 were in force. The Nationalists in Tehran were somewhat reassured. Ispahan, Tabriz and Kazvin declared themselves satis- fied.^ A Committee, the composition of which inspired confidence, is making good progress with the electoral law. The Russian force despatched to Tabriz Situation in Azerbaijan. C^OSSed the frontier OQ . the 28th April and ar rived at Tabriz on the 30th April, only a small force entering the town. The strength of the expedition was about 4,000 men of all arms. R ; ahim Khan is reported to have left the vicinity of Tabriz at the end of April, and by the 13th May the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s force had almost entirely dispersed. Instructions were sent to M. Sabline by the Russian Government to urge the Persian Government to appoint a Governor for Tabriz and Sir G. Barclay was directed to support M. Sabline’s request, if he saw no objection, with the proviso that the Governor should be one acceptable to the Nationalists. Towards the middle of April Astera- Situation at A.terabad. ^ WaS SUlTOUnded by Turcomans and some fighting occurred. This resulted in an appli cation for Russian troops being made by the Consul for the protection of the Consulate and to stop the fighting. In view of the danger of the town being pillaged, the Russian Com missioner at Gumbet-i-Kabours was ordered to proceed to Asterabad in all haste with his escort. At the beginning of May, Kazvin Situation at Eesht and WES OCCUpied with little Sazvl,% -' bloodshed, by 200 re volutionaries from Resht. There was no disorder. In consequence of a report that the revolutionaries were advancing from Kazvin, one hundred Cossacks were sent against them under the Shah’s orders. M. Sabline, who considers the Russian officers with the* Shah’s Cossacks no longer as being under the control of the Russian Legation, did not3 r ^ l^now whether the Cossacks were accompanied by a Russian officer.* Sir G. Barclay under stood that Captain Zapolski was in command. In order not to hamper the British and Russian efforts to bring about a reconciliation, the Russian Consul at Resht was instructed by the Russian Charge d’Affaires to induce the Sipahdar to stop the advance of the revolution aries. The Sardar Assad appears to have arrived c ., , r , at Ispahan at the end Situation at Ispahan. * .1 rrn . ol April. The threaten ed advance on Tehran seems to have been abandoned owing to lack of funds, differences with the clergy, and dissensions between the Khans. On the 30th April, Saiyid Murtaza was requested by a deputa- tion of local notabilities to dismiss his tufangchis and to ^ive an account of the customs receipts which he had misappropriated. This he refused to do with out a guarantee from the British Resident, through the German Consulate, that the British forces on land would be -withdrawn within three days. On the following day Major Cox learned from the Tehran Legation that the German Government had refused the request of their Consul at Bushire for the despatch of a warship to that port as they wished to avoid offending British susceptibi lities. All the troubles at Bushire were, in Major Cox’s opinion, due to Saiyid Murtaza, and there were good circum stantial grounds for believing that he had all along received incitement and support from the German Consul with the sole object of increasing British difficulties. The German Consul denied having interfered in local affairs, a statement which w r as possibly correct as he had been only a fortnight in office. Major Cox, how'ever, had accumulated evidence indicating that the German Consul ate had intrigued against us from the begin ning of the disturbances. * *] t As the Ulema of Nejef and the National ists withdrew their objection to the appoint ment of the Darya Begi, the “ Persepolis ” was permitted to depart to the Shat-el-Arab for water and also, if required, to bring back the Darya Begi to Bushire provided that he was unaccompanied by an armed following. The Darya Begi left Baghdad on the 4th May, and arrived at Bushire on the 10th May, receiving a cordial reception. In view of the improvement in the situation after the Darya Begi’s arrival, Sir G. Barclay was authorised, on the 14th May, to order the withdrawal of the blue-jackets. Major Cox was at the same time informed by his Consular Colleagues that they were no longer under any apprehension as to the safety of their N ationalists and that4 they saw no objection to the withdrawal of the force. The Darya Begi also gave satis- lacioiy personal assurances for the future main tenance of order and security. The blue-jackets were consequently embarked partly on the 19th and partly on the 20th May, and H. M. S. “Pox” left Bushire on the latter date. At the beginning of May there was a Situation at Hunder Abba,. de cided improvement in ... 0 . the position at Bunder Abbas. Saiyid Abdul Husain Lari withdrew nearly all his tufangchis owing partly to the news of the Darya Begi’s arrival and partly to fear of an attack on Lar from the direction of Shiraz. During April the revolutionary party situation at Meshed. a * ^ es hed are reported to have received rein forcements in the shape of two gangs of Caucasians, but there have been no further disturbances. Some excitement was caused by the arrival of the Russian troops and, though the bazar was closed for two da vs the inhabitants are now said to be resigned! The Kussian Consul-General told a deputation plainly that he had sent for the troops as there was no security in Meshed and that manv of the leading inhabitants had approved of the step.^ Major Sykes has, on the other hand received many petitions asking that the troops should be sent back. He has asked the ixarguzar to explain that he cannot take any action in the matter. On the whole the popular party gained ground during the month largely owing to the absence of the Governor- General at Nishapur. . Mujtahid Sheikh Muhammad Hadi, of Bn-jand, has received a telegram from 'the Meshed Anjuman announcing the fact of armed interference by Russia, and saying that Meshed had telegraphed a protest to the Parliaments of the World ”. The Mujtahid sent a similar telegram of protest from the people of Birjand. . A further telegram from the Meshed Anjuman, addressed to “all the Mullas, nobles and residents of the places of Khorasan and Seistan ”, informed them that the Russian Government had increased the number of Cossacks under the pretence of protectinn* their Consulate, and that a protest had been made against this action. In an aide-memoire communicated to Sir A. Nicolson, dated the 13th April 1909 the Russian Government stated that the British Ambassador had expressed a wish that the Russian Consulate-General at Meshed might be instructed to protect, in case of danger the lives and property of British subjects' in Meshed and it was hinted that this was one of the reasons for the increase to the Consulate^7 5 guard, which would give its protection, in case of danger, not only to Russian subjects re siding in Meshed, hut also to all foreigners. Details received regarding the defeat of 8it*nti*n at Turiat-i- the Salar-i-Moaziz, the Haiiari. new Governor of Turbat, show that on the 4th April Yawar Asadulla at the head of a party of Nationalists, who had received reinforcements from Meshed, defeated the Governor at Subukh after an engagement lasting five hours, and that the latter retreated in the direction of Daulatabad. Salar Khan assisted by Asadulla is now in charge of Turbat which is quiet. Captain Smyth visited Turbat towards the end of April to improve the defences of the Consulate. It is reported that the Hissam-ud- Daula has been asked Situation in Seittan. . i j i i ^ to supply sowars to help the Khorasan troops to suppress the constitu tional movement, but that his attempts to summon Baluch tribesmen are meeting with no response. The Meshed Anjuman has instructed the Mujtahids and Mullas in Seistan to see that further payments of revenue are suspended and Mulla Mehdi and the Deputy Governor have both expressed their readiness to suspend further collections. Telegrams posted in Birjand from the Meshed Anjuman directing the people to pay no revenue till the Majlis was established at Tehran were immediately torn down by the Hissam-ud-Daula’s orders. The revenue is not, however, being paid, and the Hissam is afraid to use any pressure. 2. (Videparagraph 3 of the Memoran dum for April 1909.) The Zil-es-Su tan. ( j eS p a | :c i 1} dated the 8th March, Sir G. Barclay reported that, at the request of the Russian Charge d’Affaires, he had instructed His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan to use his good offices in the matter of the protection desired *7 servants of the Zil-es-Sultan, but that, in accordance with the views of His Majesty’s Government on the subject (see paragraph 3 of the Memorandum for March 1909), he had instructed His Majesty’s Consul-General to make his good offices of as non-committal a nature as possible. In the course of a conversation with Mr. Churchill at Nice on the 27th February, the Zil-es-Sultan stated that his most ardent wish was that His Majesty’s Government would bring about a better understanding between himself and the Russian Government who, he felt, looked upon him with quite unjustifiable suspicion and hostility. He had no desire to take any political part in Persia and did not aim at acquiring the throne, and was prepared to give identic written assurances6 to the British and Russian Governments that he would under no circumstances put himself forward as a candidate for the throne. He wished to live on his estates near Ispahan in a private capacity, and hoped that, once the air had been cleared, he would cease to be the obiect of hostility on the part of the Russian Agents in I ersia, as had been the case hitherto. The Zil again represented to Sir Bertie the matter of the demand of the Nationalist party at Ispahan, that His Imperial Highness should advance part of the sum which thev claim as being due for taxes. The Zil desired that His Majesty’s Consul-General should be instructed to urge that no taxes be demanded until it was made clear to whom such advances 'H ere o e paid. Sir F. Bertie was instructed to inform the Zil in reply, that His Majesty’s fnuTZ C ° Uld n0 ‘ uad 'take to intervene in the manner proposed. 3. (Fide paragraph 4 of Memorandum P&lt;^!i! nCial situation in f or February 1909.) 0 On the 11th Mav Secretary of State telegraphed that it would be seen trom his telegram of the 3rd May (ride paragraph 1 of Memorandum for April 1909 ) that, subject to the fulfilment by the Shah of the conditions imposed and to safeguards on the proper expenditure of funds, His Maiestv’s Government were pledged to contribute to the moiety of the joint advance by the two Gov- ernments to enable the Shah to meet urgent clauns the discharge of which was necessary te secure his position on the establishment of tee ne» regime. In accordance with the agree- in e Octob r er e ]qflf!''r lt v/ the Eussian Government 1 Uctober 1906 (vide paragraph 9 of Memo- randumfor October 7^6j wh c h had heet treated as hoiding good in Vindplethrougl- ^iiRlr^rVr 0f tbe oogotiations Russia, the total amount of the ioint advance was not to exceed four hundred teousand pounds in all. The conditions which made that agreement necessary applied with equal force now and in the circumstances the Government of India must accept financial responsibility for one hundred thousand pounds, being a moiety of the British share of the joint advance; India was, however f rtefr° m fi atiy • ? nsa ’ ement a s regards any lurther financial assistance to Persia If had been made clear to the Foreign Office that, apart from objections on the grounds of general Imperial policy to financial and other entanglements m Persia, Lord Moriev cm M not admit that Indian interests in Persia were of a nature to justify expenditure from ndian revenues on schemes for establishing a reformed Government in Persia. Schemes°of this nature involved not only financial rlk but danger of international complications and it was essential logically that India should be7 kept entirely free from responsibility regard to the latter. 4. In March With Transmission through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, of tele graphic messages from Persian subjects to their Government. last, His Britannic Majesty* s Consul, Seistan, asked the British Minister at Tehran for general instructions regarding the transmission through the Consulate of tele graphic messages from Persian subjects to their Government. Major Kennion was of opinion that to withhold facilities for sending telegrams through the British Consulate so seriously diminished in the eyes of the Seistanis the value of our friendship as compared with that of the Russians, that telegrams should not be refused except in very special circumstances, and that, if the Indo-European Telegraph Department declined to accept telegrams on account of their political nature, they should be sent through the British Legation. In a despatch, dated the 20th April 1909, Sir George Barclay replied that although there was no rule in the Indo-European Telegraph Department prohibiting the acceptance of telegrams from a Persian subject to his Government, and presumably this was also true in the case of the signallers of the Indian Telegraph Department employed on the Seistan line, he considered it undesirable that such telegrams should pass through the channel of His Majesty’s Consulate and the Tehran Legation. He accordingly instructed the Consul, Seistan, to refuse to undertake the transmission of such messages without reference to, and without the authorisation of, the Minister at Tehran. His Majesty’s Minister also requested that he might be informed of any instance where such messages have been sent through the Russian Consulate and Legation in order that he might have an opportunity of pointing out the objections to this procedure to his Russian Colleague. 5. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain left Persona . head-quarters on the 3rd April 1909, en route to summer quarters in the Kainat. Captain Hunter, I.M.S., has received through M. Bravine, the official thanks of the Russian Government for professional services rendered to the Russian Consulate during 1908. 6. {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo- Exchange of telegraph, randum for A.pril lines in Persia. 1909.) In accordance with his instructions, dated the 17th March 1909, Sir A. ISicolson addressed an aide- memoire to the Russian Government on the 18th March 1909 respecting telegraph lines in Persia.0 U 7.

The Bussians have paid for each message at the time of despatch, in the same manner. In March, however, the Armenian at Tehran, who is in charge of the accounts, told the English clerk to send all receipts to him direct through the Bank. I he International clerk, who is for the Majlis, which now controls the office, said that, if this were done, he would object to our signaller sending any messages. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General has now instiucted the signaller to pay in the receipts as before to the International clerk. 8. (Vide paragraph 7 of the Memoran- M.

Mornard, of the Persian Customs Department, has given up all idea of travelling down the trade route. 9. (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo- Arms traffic in the randum for ^nril Persian Gulf. JS00.) Three afms caravans are reported to have passed through Persian territory in May, keeping to the routes to the west of Koh-i-Malik Siah in order to avoid British territory. The arms caravan, the arrival of which at JNasratabad-Ispe was reported on the 23rd April, is said to have passed through to Af o-han- istan wa Aliabad in the 2nd week of Mav. The Afghans are stated to have captured two Cossacks, and, after seizing their rifles and stripping them, to have let them go. A report received from Mr. Hedges, the Telegraphist deputed to Bam, intimated that as all Afghan caravans had passed for this “V he had left Bam for Eehaneh on the zlith May. 10. (Vide paragraphs 63 and 64 of the Comp«ny.' PerSiaU ° U Memorandum for July . •i o• -n n l9uo.) At the end of April Sir E. Grey telegraphed to Sir G Barclay that the newly-formed Anglo-Persian 0.1 Company wished to acquire immediately a site for a refinery on Abadan Island and a stop of land for a pipe line to connect the refinery with the wells, that the land for the refinery was estimated to be not over I 000 acres and was uncultivated, as was most of the land which would be required for the pipe line, and the Company were entitled to acquire waste land free of cost by the terms of their Concession. The Companv however, recognised that the Sheikh’sgood-will and co-operation were necessary, and were willing to lend him, through his Majesty’s Government, from £5,000 to £6,000 on con dition that their application for land was granted, and that the Sheikh gave or procured a good title to it on the Company’s behalf. The Company were ready to pay a reasonable market value for the land, if bought, or £500 per annum in full for all land required, if leased for the duration of the Concession, or any extension of it, and they would demand interest at 6°/ 0 on their loan. His Majesty’s Government directed that the Sheikh should be informed that they were willing to lend him £5,000 or £6,030 on the understanding that he concluded an arrange ment with the Oil Company on the above terms, and that he granted to a British com pany a concession containing exclusive rights to carry out, on lines proposed by Sir William Willcocks, a scheme of irrigation on the Karun. Care was to be taken to represent the loan as coming from His Majesty’s Government. 11. (Vide paragraph 12 of the Memo* Karun Irrigation Con- randum for April cession. 1909.) On the 20th May, the Government of India forwarded to His Majesty’s Government copies of reports containing Sir William Willcocks’ views on the possibilities of irrigation in the Karun district of Ahwaz. In their opinion Sir William’s opinion as to the potential wealth of the Karun valley confirmed the importance of the British Government retaining their present position of paramount influence with the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and of preventing him from procuring from other than British sources the funds for its exploitation. They also drew attention to the view expressed by Sir William Willcocks as to the desirability of giving a scheme of irrigation from the Kerkha river preference over the Ahwaz scheme, in case the Sheikh decided to grant a concession to a British Company in consideration for the loan of £5,000 or £6,000 which it was proposed to negotiate through the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (vide paragraph 10, supra). 12. (Vide paragraph 13 of the Memo- T * ou i v. t randum for April 1909.) Loan to the Sheikh of XT . , r r , , ' Mohammerah. His Hajesty s Consul at Mohammerah reported, on the 12th May, that the Sheikh admitted that £1,000 had recently been borrowed by Hajji Rais, the factotum of the Sheikh, from Messrs. Wonckhaus of Basrah, on a note of hand signed by Hajji Rais, on the surety of the Sheikh. The amount was taken to complete a sum of £7,000, paid for a date garden purchased by the Sheikh and is repayable after the date harvest. According to a rumour current in Ahwaz but denied at10 Mohammerah, the Sheikh was also coquetting with Messrs. AVonckhaus in other ways. Sir G. Barclay had accordingly authorised the Poli tical Resident, should he think it desirable, to insist on repayment of the borrowed £1,000 as a first charge on the contemplated loan from His Majesty’s Government. Sir G. Barclay’s action was approved by His Majesty’s Govern ment, who also directed that the Sheikh should be made to understand that the advance of £5,000 or £6,000 (vide paragraph 1 /, supra) would not be regarded as including payment for the proposed Karun irrigation concession, the terms of which the Sheikh and the Con cessionaires would settle between themselves later. 13, The Sheikh of Mohammerah informed Reported despatch of His Majesty s Consul in Turkish gun-boats to April last that he had Mohammerah. beard that the Turkish Government were sending three gun-boats to the Shat-el-Arab and that they were destined for use against Mohammerah. He therefore reminded Mr. McDouall of the assurances given him by the British Government against foreign attack (see paragraph 17 of the Memo randum for January 1909). Mr. McDouall ascertained from His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah that it was a fact that three vessels were being sent by the Turkish Govern ment, but that, as far as he was aware, it was only with the object of patrolling the Shat-el- Arab to prevent piracy and not with any design against Persian territory. 14. ( Vide paragraph 11 of the Memo- Henj am-Bunder randum for February Abbas cable. 1.908.) In March 1909 Sir G. Barclay reported the settlement of the difficulties regarding the location of the telegraph office and cable house of the wire connecting Henjam and Bunder Abbas, by the conclusion of an agreement between the Persian Minister of Telegraphs and the Indo- European Telegraph Department, whereby a line was carried from the cable house, where the cable is landed, to the telegraph office of the Department at the British Consulate and thence to the Persian Office in the town. There are, however, difficulties in the way of opening the line to the general public, as the Persian telegraph clerk is unable to send or receive messages in the Roman character, and is, moreover, incapable of keeping the com plicated system of accounts required by the International Telegraphic Bureau. His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas has sug gested that, in order to open the line with as little delay as possible, the wire should be treated as part of the Indo-European Telegraph system for the present, and that the British Postmaster should be authorised, with the concurrence of the Persian Government, toaccept and deliver messages. This measure, which was supported by the Political Resident at Bushire, was recommended by Sir G. Barclay to His Majesty’s Government, who were of opinion that the Department might thus obtain, in time, the complete control of the office. Meanwhile, the Persian Minister of Tele graphs had, in an interview with Mr. Barker, Director of Telegraphs at Tehran, proposed that the international part of the telegraph work at Bunder Abbas should be carried out by the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Mr. Barker recommended the adoption of the proposal, and Mr. Kirk, Director-in-Chief of the Department, has requested permission to arrange to have the Persian Minister’s proposal made formally in writing. 15. (Vide paragraph 15 of the Memoran- A . dum for April 1909.) On the 5th May, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that fresh oxide weighing about 500 or 600 tons had been mined for Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. The German Consul, although no objection had been raised by his predecessor, who must have known that mining operations were being carried out, had sent in an official protest and demanded that all operations should be stopped on the ground that the claim of the German firm was not limited to oxide previously mined, and that the shipment or excavation of fresh oxide would be an encroachment on their rights. The Resident informed the German Consul that he would report the matter to the British Government for orders. On the 28th May, the Secretary of State approved of the proposal of the Government of India to instruct Major Cox to take no notice of the German protest, and, if again approached by the Consul, to point out the limited character of the undertaking to the German Government, and draw his attention to the failure of Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co. to take advantage of the undertaking. His Majesty’s Government also asked that the Resident’s attention should be called to the fact that the mining of only 400 tons of oxide had been authorised. They presumed that mining operations would now cease. In reply to a note from the German Embassy, the German Government had been reminded of the restricted nature of the undertaking in regard to Messrs. Wonckhaus &amp; Co., and informed of the scope of the present operations and the probability of their early conclusion; they were also told that the rights of the Sheikh were being fully reserved by His Majesty’s Government. Instructions to the above effect were communicated to the Resident on the 1st June.12 16. On the 3rd April 1909, the Political Opening of a dispen- a t Maskat re- sary at Mutrah by the ported to Major CoX M?s e k™ an Mi8Sioa in that the American Mis- sion in Maskat had claimed the ri^ht to open a dispensary at Mutrah. His Highness the Sultan, who had just raised a subscription for the construction of a Maskat and Mutrah hospital, and feared that the Missionaries might interfere in ad ministrative matters, objected to the proposal and had refused permission. In spite of the refusal, Dr. 1 horns of the Mission occupied a house at Mutrah. The Sultan then appealed to the Political Agent at Maskat for the diplomatic support of the British Government, and on the 6th May the Government of India addressed the Secretary of State on behalf of His Highness, expressing the hope that His Majesty s Government would represent the matter in the proper quarter with a view to the recall of the doctor by the Mission. 17. On the 22nd December 1908, a dhow Seizure of a Maskat ^ am ed “ Khadra” dhtptr by the Italian bound for Mombassa, BenadirCoast. 0a the and ‘he flag of . , the Sultan of Maskat, was seized by an Italian steamer near Has Hafun. Tne Italian Lieutenant, who was in command of the steamer, is said to have taken down the flag and destroyed it. The dhow carried five rifles, under written permission from the Sultan. Pour of these were landed at our, the fifth being retained bv one of the crew unknown to the ftakhoda of *the dhow This rifle was confiscated by the Italian authorities. The JVakhoda assessed his damages at 10,008 dollars. But the Sultan on scrutiny reduced tins sura to 8,o28 dollars. His Highness iniormed the Political Agent at Maskat that, m his opinion, the Nakhoda ought to be granted a free passage for himself and a new crew by steamer from Bombay to Aden, where the dhow had been removed under the orders ot the Italian Consul-General. On the 2nd April, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf reported, on the authority of information received from the Political A&lt;?ent, Maskat, that the Sultan had received complaints from his subjects from Mombassa that the fla^s of about 30 Maskat vessels had been confiscated by the local Italian authorities at Hafun. The Italians searched the vessels without finding any arms, and the Aakhodas were warned not to return to the Somali Coast Protectorate in future without English, German, Italian or Trench flags, on pain of capital punishment. At the beginning of May the Italian Agent at Maskat attempted to approach the Sultan direct on the subject, but the latter declined on the ground that Umberto Omar was not authorised to act in a Consular capacity.13 Umberto Omar then informed tbe Political Agent that the Italian Consul-General at Aden would restore the dhow “Khadra” to Abdulla Hilal, the Sultan of Maskat’s representative at Aden, subject to the following conditions; and he asked the Political Agent to press the Sultan to agree to these proposals :— Firstly .—His Highness • to instruct Abdulla Hilal by telegraph to sign an agree ment in the Sultan of Maskat s name recognising the legality of the seizure. Secondly .—Abdulla Hilal to renounce his claim to his 1,000 dollars which were on board the dhow at the time of seizure, because (a) this sum had been spent by the Italian Government in sending to Zanzibar passengers found on board the dhow, and (6) in sending the dhow to Massowah and Aden from Hafun. Thirdly .—That Abdulla Hilal undertook, in the Sultan of Maskat’s name, in the name of the master of the dhow, and in the name of everybody else who claimed an interest in the dhow, to resign all and every claim for com pensation. Fourthly.—Ttet Abdulla Hilal agreed that the rifle found on board remains confiscate. The Agent went on to say that the Italian Government would return the dhow only on these conditions; that if the Sultan did not agree the matter would be referred to a prize court. The Agent hoped that, by the accept ance of these conditions, tbe Sultan would be shown every consideration by the Italian Government and an apology offered by them for the destruction of his flag. The Sultan indignantly repudiated what he considered the injustice of the proposals and asked for the special support of the British Government. In view of the action of the British Gov ernment in the recent Trench flag case {vide paragraph 23 of the Memorandum for January 1909), the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considered it incumbent upon Govern ment to give the Sultan the support which he desired. The disrespect shown by the local Italian authorities to the Sultan’s flag had placed the British local officers in a false position, and might very well lead the Sultan’s subjects to revive, for their own protection, the use of foreign flags, a practice which it is to the interests of both the British and Italian Governments to prevent. The Political Resident was also of opinion that the present incident gave point to the grounds already urged for the adoption by the Sultan of a distinctive flag, which would distinguish the craft of his subjects from those who sail under the plain red flag of Islam,and the Resident accordingly proposed that, should redress be obtained for the Sultan in the present instance, an attempt should be made to persuade His Highness to introduce this reform. The facts of the case were reported to the Secretary of State for India on the 21st May by the Government of India, who expressed the opinion that the action of the Italian authorities was calculated to prejudice the success of our attempts to obtain the Sultan’s co-operation in the suppression of the arms traffic and might lead to the revival of the use of foreign flags by the Sultan’s subjects, a practice which it was to the interests of both the English and Italian Governments to prevent. In view of the friendly desire to co-operate hitheito evinced by the Italian Government, they trusted that a representation to them might result ,in obtaining reparation for the Sultan and compensation for the losses sustained by him. 18. (Vide paragraph 17 of the Memo- Persian claim to so- randum for April vereignty over Bahrein. 1909 } In a telegram to Sir E. Grey, dated the 8th April, Sir G. Barclay deprecated the inclusion, in the com munication which he was about to address to the Persian Government intimating to them the acceptance by His Majesty’s Government of the amended note, of any statement as to the attitude which the British Government proposed to maintain regarding Bahrein. He feared that such a declaration might raise the general question, which he was unwilling to do, unless His Majesty’s Government were pre pared to press it to an issue. Sir E. Grey proposed to leave the wording of the commu nication to Sir G. Barclay’s discretion, but considered that His Majesty’s Government should continue to show by their acts that they could not permit the Persian Government to exercise sovereignty over Bahreini subjects in Persian territory. In these views the Secretary of State for India concurred. 19. On the 4th April, the Political Reported Turkish Agent at Bahrein occupation of Zakhnu- reported that, in March mya is an . last, the Mudir of Ojair had visited Zakhnuniyah, a small island ten miles south of Ojair, and bad run up the Turkish flag there. The island has no per manent inhabitants, but is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein and is frequented by the Bahrein Dowasir in winter. The Political Agent visited the island on the 18th March and found the Turkish flag attached to a mast on the fort. He was told by the Dowasir that the Mudir had asked them*whether they came under Turkish rule. They replied in the nega tive and refused to comply with the Mudir’s request to run up and lower the Turkish fla^15 daily. On the 6th May, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed that the Turks had repaired the tower on the island and had arranged to keep a guard of 20 men there, relieving them from Ojair daily. The Sheikh of Bahrein protested against Turkish occupa tion, stating that the fort was built by his father, Sheikh Ali, with the concurrence of the Nejd Amir, and that the former used to keep a garrison on the island. In reporting the matter to the Secretary of State for India, on the 23rd May, the Gov ernment of India expressed the opinion that the Sheikh’s claim should be supported, as His Majesty’s Government had never recognised Ottoman jurisdiction as extending south of Ojair. They recommended that the Porte should be told that the island belonged to Bahrein and should be urged to issue orders to the Mudir to remove the garrison from the island. The Government of India also sup ported Major Cox’s recommendation that the Sheikh should be advised to fly his flag there. 20. [ Vide paragraph 228 of the Memo- v.* r randum (Arabian Rights of the Sheikh /y. . » /. v -rk of Koweit to the islands affairs) for JJecemoer of Bubiyanand Warba. 2908.] On the 6th May, the Government of India informed the Secretary of State for India that the further enquiries instituted by the Political Agent, Koweit, in the matter had not resulted in tie production of any fresh evidence as to the ownership of Warba island, and that they did not consider it desirable to take any steps towards the assertion of the Sheikh’s claims so far as this island was concerned. 21. (Vide paragraph 20 of the Memo- Sheikh Of Koweit’s randum for February properties at Fao. 1909.) On the 27th May, the Government of India forwarded copies of correspondence to the Secretary of State for India from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in which it was reported that the Sheikh’s embankment at Pao had been repaired with the consent of the Turkish military authorities at Basrah. In the circum stances, the Government of India agreed with the Resident’s recommendation, that no further action in the matter was necessary at present. 22. In January last, the Sheikh of Koweit Loan to the Sheikh of applied to the Political Koweit. Agent for a loan of two lakhs of rupees, without interest, to be repaid in two yearly instalments. The Sheikh had been making large purchases of land, and explained that his need for ready money was due to large advances made by him to pearl mer chants, whom lie could. not press for im mediate repayment, and to the fact that his brother, Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah, had asked for the postponement of the payment ofthis year’s instalment of a large loan due to him (the Sheikh of Koweit). The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf strongly supported the application. The Gov ernment of India, in applying, on the 22nd Pebruary, for the sanction of the Secretary of State to the grant of the loan, expressed the opmion that, for political reasons, and in order to prevent the possibility of the Sheikh applying elsewhere for pecuniary help, it was desirable to make the required advance, free of interest, on condition that it was repaid in two yearly instalments and that the Sheikh should not borrow from other sources until repayment was made. On the 24th May, the Secretary of State sanctioned the grant of the loan on the terms proposed above and Major Cox was informed accordingly. Simla; } L. W.

The improvement in the situation which was apparent at the end of May was not maintained. The efforts of the Eritish and Russian representatives to overcome Nationalist distrust of the Shah appear to have failed and hitherto attempts to persuade the Nasr-ul-Mulk to return to 1 ersia to take office have equally been unsuccessful. At the end of June the situation was complicated by the advance on the 26th June of the Bakhtiaris on Tehran. The Sardar Assad arrived at Kum with one gun and seven hundred men. At the end of June the position was shortly as follows. The, Sipahdar, who was still at Kasvin with several guns and a considerable force, was in touch with the Bakhtiaris. The palace and the upper classes in Tehran were panic-struck. The Russian and British Consuls at Ispahan had gone to Kum to try to dissuade the Sardar from advancing further. The Russian Lega tion was still parleying with Kasvin. The electoral law had been completed and signed by the Shah, and was shortly to be promulgated. The Saad-ed-Dowleh, who was still acting Prime Minister, as the Nasr-ul-Mulk had not arrived, was very unpopular and had resigned as he was not supported by the other members of Cabinet, who feared the Nationalists, but was temporarily retaining office. (Vide paragraph 1 of the Memoran- Situation in Azerbaijan. dim f Or May 1909.) I he arbitrary conduct of the Russian troops after their occupation of Tabriz, which they treated like a conquered city, produced a most unfavourable impression. The arrest of several Russian Nationalists and of Naib Husain, one of Sattar Khan’s Lieuten ants, resulted in numbers of people, including Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan, taking bast in the Turkish Consulate-General on the 31st May. The Turkish Charge* d’Affaires subsequently explained to the Russian Minister that this was due to the oppressive measures of the Russian General, and he added that the bastis would continue to receive Turkish protection until such time as the Russian General altered his conduct.2 The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs complained to His Majesty’s Legation. But, in spite of diplomatic representations, there was no improvement in the behaviour of the Kussian military authorities who appeared to disregard entirely the instructions issued to them by the Russian Legation. Their attitude was markedly anti-Nationalist and went far to destroy the good effect which had been created by the joint efforts of the Russian and British representatives to establish a constitutional Government and to restore peace in Tabriz. A further pretext was afforded for Turkish inter vention. For a heavy claim presented by the Russians against Sattar Khan on account of damages done to the Russian road, led to the pro perty and persons of Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan and of other notables being taken under Turkish protection on the 2nd June apparently under instructions from Constantinople. The Turkish Charge d’Affaires denied knowledge of the fact. Great indignation was aroused at Tehran by these occurrences, and, on the 3rd June, Sir E. Grey addressed Sir A. Nicolson pointing out the critical condition of Persia and urging on him to impress on the Russian Gov ernment the absolute necessity for the adoption of an impartial attitude by the military author ities who should restrict their action to the protection of foreigners if they desired His Majesty’s Government to act in agreement with the Czar’s Government, to remain passive and abstain from intervention against the Shah. The Russian Government could best show their good faith by the withdrawal of a part of their force. The headstrong action of the military should not be permitted to upset the policy hitherto pursued by the two Governments with all its consequences. Sir A. Kicolson was instructed on the 6th June to assure the Russian Government of the continuance of British co-operation, but to request that stringent instructions should be given to confine the action of the military authorities to the lines already agreed upon. On that day Sir A. Nicolson was also informed that the Russian Charge d’Affaires, Tehran, had been instructed to let his Turkish colleague know that the matter of Sattar Khan was one for settlement between the Persian and Turkish Governments, that Sattar Khan had nothing to fear in view of the general amnesty and the Russian desire to protect him, and that he would be provided with facilities for crossing Russian territory if he desired to leave Persia voluntarily. The Russian Ambassador in London was of the opinion that the incident of the bast was largely due to Turkish intrigue and Sir G. Barclay, while admitting the possibility of this, held that a pretext had been afforded by the action of the Russian troops. The Ambassador-—(—s'— was informed by Sir E. Grey that the anxiety of His Majesty’s Government in the matter was due solely to a desire to be able to defend the Russian Government and not to lessen their influence in Northern Persia where the retention of Russian troops would enable Turkey to claim an undesirable right of inter ference on strategical grounds. The Ambassa dor said that M. Isvolsky was in favour of the withdrawal of troops which would, he hoped, be soon decided. Sir G. Barclay reported on 8th June 1909 that Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan were will ing to leave Persia for Turkey if they could be given guarantees that their property would be protected, their persons safeguarded till the frontier was reached, and their return permitted on the evacuation of Tabriz by the Russians. Sir G. Barclay, however, considered that their departure would create a bad im pression as it would seem to be an expulsion. Ala-ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor of Tabriz on 29th May in preference to the Nationalist candidate Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. Much indignation was expressed at the choice by the Nationalists at Tehran as the Ala-ed- Dowleh is regarded as a reactionary imposed on Tabriz by Russian pressure. Sir G. Barclay did not, however, anticipate that he would prove unwelcome to the Tabriz populace. At Urumia at the end of May complete anarchy prevailed and the Russian guard there was strengthened by a small force from Tabriz. Mr. Wratislaw telegraphed on 27th May that Soujboulak was being attacked by a large body of Kurds whose advance guard was approach ing Miandoab. Turks were supposed to be accompanying them and the fall of Soujboulak was said to be imminent. {Vide paragraph 1 of the Memoran- Situation at BuoUro. f 0r ^ay 1909) A party of Tangistams, numbering some 200, contrived to penetrate Bushire island early on the morning of the 6th June. Fighting ensued between them and the forces of the Governor and on the following day they were driven out and Saiyid Murtaza seized. With the removal of Saiyid Murtaza Ahremi, the cause of all the recent disturbances, a marked improvement has taken place in the situation at Bushire, normal Customs arrangements having been restored. ( Vide paragraph 1 of the Memorandum . SituationaiSUraa. for March 1909.) The grant of the constitu tion has been coldly received at Shiraz, where order has been maintained chiefly through the attitude assumed by the Soulet-ed-Dowleh. Information was received early in May to the effect that Lar, the head-quarters of the rebellious Saiyid Abdul Husein Lari, had k4 been captured by the Nasr-ed-Dowlah with severe loss to the rebels. Further disturbances have occurred sanation at Meshed. ^ Meshed. Early in . May the Nayyir-ud- Eaula resigned the post of Governor-General of Khorasan, and the Rukn-ud-Daula who was nominated to succeed him arrived in Meshed towards the middle of June. The appointment was unpopular with the local assembly. On the 9th June, Meshed was in a state of complete anarchy, the movement being strongly anti- Russian. The Governor-General proved un willing to take action against the Nationalist volunteers, though the Russian Consul-General threatened, in the event of his refusal, to disarm Meshed himself. A second squadron of Cossacks, 100 strong, arrived in Meshed on the 23rd June. On the 24th June, the Nationalist volunteers were attacked and the city bombarded by the garrison, who had apparently got completely out of hand. Eurning and looting took place, and some Russian refugees, who were stopped on their way to the Bank, fired a machine gun. Un popular with both parties and unable to control the situation, the Governor-General resigned on the 27th June and placed himself under Anglo-Russian protection. Hostilities m the city have now ceased. A disagreement is reported to have Situation at Turbat-i- arisen between the ii i o revolutionary leaders Asadulla and Salar Khan. Situation in Seistan. Seistan remains quiet. 2. (Vide paragraph 2 of the Memo- The Zil-es-Sultan. randum for May 19u9.) The Shah having ex pressed a desire to make the Zil-es-Sultan Governor of Ears, Sir E. Grey on the 24th May expressed his concurrence in Sir G. Barclay’s suggestion to approve the appoint ment in concert with the Russian Minister at Tehran. The Russian Government stated that they were indifferent whether or not the Zil- es-Sultan returned to Ispahan as Governor. 3. Towards the end of May it was re- The Cossack Brigade, ported that Colonel Liakhoff was to be given a command in Russia and was to be replaced by Colonel Margani who had been for a long time in the Trans-Caspian district. Colonel Margani would be retained on the active list of the Russian army while holding the appointment. On the 29th May, Sir A. Nicolson telegraphed that the Acting Minister for l oreign Affairs had told him that a proposal to increase the Cossack Brigade from 1,500 to 2,000 men was being made to the Shall by the Russian Government, and that a portion5 of this force would be stationed at Tabriz to police the town. Sir G. Barclny thought the present an unfortunate moment for increasing the Cossack Brigade. An increase to the Brigade, whether more Russian officers were appointed or not, would be regarded in Tehran as a proof that .the Shah was being supported by Russia apart from the fact that the legality of the step, without the consent of the Assembly under the newly-restored constitution, was open to question. It would aggravate the elfect of the conduct of the Russian troops at Tabriz, encourage the Shah, and depress the Nationalists. It should be possible, without further weakening the force now in the Capital, to furnish the Governor of Tabriz with a sufficient guard from the Cossacks who were with the Ain-ed-Dowleh. 4. {Vide paragraph 61 of the Memo- The Palang Koh trade randum for February ^ Ut - 0 tt 1908.) His Britannic Majesty s Vice-Consul, Seistan, reports that a rough track has been completed along the Palang Koh trade route, which is now passable. In the interests of trade, the Gov ernment of India have, with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, sanc tioned an expenditure of Rs. 1,000 for the further improvement of the road; the work cannot, however, be put in hand until next cold weather. o. {riae paragraph 5 of the jucrnu Tho Russian Bank in randum Soistan. 1909) Bank Manager has approached of the Imperial Bank of Persia in regard to the terms on which Bank of Persia would be willing lor April The Russian the Manager confidentially the Imperial to take over the liabilities of the Russian Bank in Seistan. 6.

Dr. Kosminskv recently informed the British Agent at Birjand that the Kainat had been officially included in the Russian Consular District, and he also thought it possible that the Russian Consulate would be moved to Birjand. M. Bravine, however, gave His Majesty’s Vice-Consul to understand that the arrangement would be similar to that adopted by His Britannic Majesty s Consul, Seistan, viz., Seistan in the winter, and the Kainat in the summer. /.

In October6 1908, the Tehran Legation represented the matter to the Administrator-General of Cus toms, who replied that, in view of the arrange ments recently made by the Customs Depart ment for clearing foreign parcels sent by post to inland towns through the Post Office, the establishment of a bureau expressly for this purpose was unnecessary. Sir George Barclay communicated this decision to the Consul, Seistan, in January last, and stated that, in % view of the Administrator-General of Customs’ ruling, he could not see his way to pressing the matter. On the Consul continuing to urge the proposal, His Majesty’s Minister said that he did not feel able to approach the Customs Department again unless the local Seistan authorities themselves recommended it to the Administrator-General of Customs, in which case the Minister would be ready to support their recommendation. The Vice-Consul, Seistan, now states that the Director of Cus toms in Seistan is apparently not prepared to recommend the proposal at present, and would prefer to await the further development of the Palang Koh route (vide paragraph 4 above), a point on which the Consul has laid stress in support of his proposal. The Director of Customs in Seistan has, however, suggested that the matter might conveniently be discuss ed by His Majesty’s Consul when in Meshed, whither he was proceeding on leave, with the Director of Customs at that place. 8. (Vide paragraph 9 of the Memo- Arms traffic in the randum for May 1909.) Persian Gulf. The Chagai Diary for the week ending the 24th May contained the following information regarding Afghan arms that had arrived at Band-i-Kamal Khan (a) Twenty camel-loads escorted by 15 men under the leadership of Lai Muhammad, Ghilzai, who resides at Nad Ali. These arms were purchased in Sarkad. (i) Thirty-four camel-loads escorted by 26 men under the leadership of Din Muham mad, Karoti,. of Kur. It is said that these rifles had not been imported by Din Muhammad, but had been purchased in Persian Baluchistan! (c) Pour hundred camel-loads of arms escorted by 200 men under one Mohim Khan, Barakzai, of Jalalabad. These rifles were im ported by the leader or his agents directly from Maskat. (d) Thirty camel-loads of arms escorted by 24 men under a Nasir Afghan named Syed Khan whose home is at Ghazni. These rifles were also imported direct by the dealer named. (e) Twelve camel-loads of rifles escorted by six men under the leadership of one Khalifa Niaz Muhammad of Zindawar. These arms were purchased in the Bampur district.7 (/) Seventy camel-loads of rifles escorted by 29 men under a Kandahari Popalzai named Nizam-ud-din. These arms were imported direct from Maskat. In addition to these about 700 additional camel-loads of arms were expected. The Thanedar, Pobat, reported that a large number of camels laden with arms had crossed the Dewan-Chah-Nasirabad trade route in the vicinity of Girdi coming from the direction of Baluchab, and that the headman of one of the caravans had seized some supplies in the Girdi shop and had maltreated some of our dak sowars. , According to reports received from Neh the large caravan which passed through via Aliabad consisted of 250 men and 700 camels. Other reports put the number at 1,000 camels. The caravan reached Farah on the 26th May. It was reported on the 16th June that a Lohani caravan of 600 camels with 6,000 rifles and pistols had arrived at Herat, via Anardarra, and that the arms were being sold in the neighbourhood. 12,000 more rifles are said to be on the way. On the 21st June, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Khorasan, reported that* a second caravan of 1,000 rifles had reached Herat and that other caravans had all gone to Kandahar. 9. [Vide paragraph 5 of the Memo randum for November W08.) At the request of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf orders were issued in June for the withdrawal of the extra 50 sepoys, who had been sent to Jask in November 1908 on account of the threatening attitude of the Afghan arms traders. 10. (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo- Anglo-Persian Oil randum for May 1909.) Company. The sheikh of Moham- merah has replied to the following effect, on the subject of the wish of the Company to acquire land for their refineries, &amp;c. He understands the Company’s requirements to be— Firstly .—For the pipe-line and connected structures, a strip of uncultivated land. Secondly .—For the refinery and buildings connected with it, a plot of uncultivated land on Abadan Island, area of land to be 650 Persian jareebs with frontage on the Shatt-el- Arab of 2,000 yards. Thirdly .—A right of way to the Bameshir river from the latter plot. Fourthly .—In case of need, the right to acquire other uncultivated land contiguous to the Abadan site, within one year from date at the same fair rate and, after one year, at the market rate current at the time.8 Fifthly. —If, on further examination, the present plot on Abadan is not approved, the Company to have the risjht to choose elsewhere on tiie island another similar plot. Sixthly .—If land is subsequently required by the Company for wharfs and warehouses on the banks of the Karun, at Ahwaz or else where, in order that they may acquire it at reasonable rates the Sheikh to do his best to help them. On behalf of himself, descendants, and tribesmen, the Sheikh undertakes to lease to the Company the lands mentioned under clauses 1 and 2 with good and sufficient title, for such period, while their Concession lasts, as the Company may require, and he also undertakes to comply with their other four requirements on one of the two following terras, i.e., either (1) for an annual rental of £6o0 payable in advance every ten years, or (2) for an annual rental of £1,000 payable annually in advance, whichever the Company may prefer. While offering the above terms the Sheikh makes the following stipulations Firstly .—On the expiration of the Con cession all buildings, machinery and workshops which have been erected on the land shall lapse to the Sheikh. -Interference in tribal affairs by the Company’s officials shall be forbidden, nor without the Sheikh’s cognisance shall they employ tribesmen. Thirdly .—Treasure trove shall be the absolute property of the Sheikh. Fourthly. —If, on the expiration of the first term, the Concession is renewed, the lands, buildings, &amp;c., shall be leased by the Com pany from the Sheikh and his descendants on such terms as the latter may consider satis factory. Major Cox stated that stipulations Nos. 1 and 4 were made by the Sheikh as the result of conversations which had taken place between Mr. Reynolds and himself, and that, if, as he gathered was the case, the Company were of opinion that the way their Concession was drafted rendered it possible for them to agree to the condition mentioned, it was perhaps not' necessary, until the question is raised 50 years hence, for us to take exception to or to adjudicate upon the point as between the Sheikh and the Persian Government. The Sheikh further pointed out that the sum of £5,000 or £6,000 which the Oil Company proposed to advance was too small to be of any use, and he asked that the amount should be raised to £10,000. As the Political Resident had been given to understand that the Company were prepared to consider a loan |) f h9 of two la'klis, he trusted that, considering the assistance they had received from His Majesty’s Government, it would he possible to induce them to provide the desired amount. As regards the requirements of the Com pany, as summed up under six headings by the * Sheikh, the Political Resident was asked whether the Sheikh would accept the Com pany’s requirements as specified in the draft agreement drawn up by the Company’s local manager, which showed what w ould be accept able to the Company. In regard to the Sheikh’s first stipulation, the Company replied that under the terms of their Concession from the Persian Government they were precluded from meeting the Sheikh’a wish, as on the expiration of the Concession all machinery and buildings became the pro perty of the Persian Government. The Company could, however, agree not to remove them at the termination of the lease. The Political Resident was asked whether on the foregoing assumption and on the assump tion that the Sheikh w T ould not ask for a rental of more than £650 per annum, he would be satisfied with a cash payment of £12,500, of w hich £6,000 would represent a loan at an interest of 6 per cent repayable in ten years (either in instalments or at the end of ten years in full), while £6,500 w'ould represent the capitalised value of ten years’ rent paid in advance. Major Cox replied on the 9th June that to repeat the offer of £6,000 would not be likely to prove at all more acceptable to the Sheikh by bracketing it with the question of the payment of rent by the Company, and he suggested a reconsideration of the question of granting the £10,000 asked for by the^ Sheikh. In regard to the Sheikh’s first stipulation, the Political Resident expressed the opinion that the Sheikh, and also, if they heard of it, the tribal headmen, would certainly be upset by any definite statement of the Company at the present stage that buildings w ould lapse to the Central Government, and he enquired whether the Sheikh and tribesmen could not, under the terms of their firman, be regarded as “ pro prietors ” for the purposes of Article 3 of the Concession. Failing this, the Political Resident suggested that, after verifying, as far as possi ble, that the date of the Oil Concession was prior to the date of the firman, the Sheikh should be informed of the fact and advised not to raise the question at present, but to accept the undertaking given by the Company to leave the buildings where they stood, and to settle the matter with the Persian Govern ment himself when the time came. The same argument would, the Resident considered, apply to the Sheikh’s fourth stipulation.In regard to the draft agreement prepared by Mr. Reynolds, the Resident pointed out, firstly) that Abadan Island was practically two miles across at the point selected, and not one mile as the Company understood, and, secondly, that the Sheikh could not he ex pected to include, within the price agreed upon for the pipe-line and plot on Abadan Island, the grant of building sites on the banks of the Karun, either at Mohammerah or Ahwaz. Apart, however, from the fore going items, it did not appear that the Sheikh was likely to take exception to anything else. 11. {Videparagraph 14 of the Memo- Assurances for the randum for April Sheikh of Mohammerah. 190 g^ The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf having com municated to the Sheikh of Mohammerah the assurances granted him by His Majesty’s Government, the Sheikh further requested that the words “ own successive male descendants ” might be substituted for the words “ heirs and successors ”, and he also expressed the hope that His Majesty’s Government would dispel the last shadow of doubt from his mind regarding their intentions in the future by adding after the words “ male descendants ’* the words “ up to a period of 100 years ” (or, if it were possible, 150 years). The Political Resident promised to mention the point to His Majesty’s Minister, whom he hoped shortly to meet. 12. (Vide paragraph 11 of the Memo- Karun irrigation con- randum for May 1909.) cession. Major Cox informed His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs on the 18th May that written under takings in the following sense had been given by the Sheikh of Mohammerah :— (i) In view of past events, the Sheikh presumed that it would he necessary for him to obtain the assent of the Persian Government before he started on any scheme depending on the construction of the dam at Ahwaz. ° He stipulates that any concession which the Persian Government may grant shall be given in his own name, and that the British Government shall both help him in getting the concession and in refusing to agree to it being granted in any one else’s name but his own, whether that of a Persian, a foreigner, or a British subject. The Sheikh, on his part, undertakes that for necessary expert assistance and funds for the carrying out of the work he will depend solely on tiie British, and that, both in the execution and working of the scheme, he will not allow either foreign subjects or foreign Govern ments to participate in any way whatever. (ii) The Sheikh is of opinion that he could undertake minor projects which may ftbe considered desirable, such as unpreten tious schemes on the Karun, not dependin'* ? n the building of a dam at Ahwaz; or minor irrigation schemes from the Kerkha, Jerrahi, Shaur, Hindiyan, or other rivers which flow through his territories, all of which would be profitable and useful, as ordinary items of tribal or domestic administration, and that reference to the Central Government would not be necessary. He engages that, in the contingency of any such scheme being under taken by him, and, if need should arise for the employment of outside help, financial or expert, the British shall have the option, and that he will employ such syndicate or persons as the British Government may put him in touch with, and that, until Great Britain has been asked for help and has refused it, no foreigners or foreign assistance will ’ be employed. In regard to the minor schemes, Sir E. Grey considered that the Sheikh’s offer might be accepted, as, otherwise, they might be given to foreigners. In regard to the main scheme it was decided to secure the assent of the Persian Government, especially now that the Shah had agreed to grant a Constitution, and that caie must be taken not to create trouble between the Sheikh and the Persian Government. An opportunity should, if possible, be created to secure the concession for the Sheikh, as in this way we should both expose ourselves less to Dutch criticism and avoid difficulties with the Mejlis as regards concessions to foreigners. The question arose, however, as to whether it was advisable entirely to exclude foreign capital, as the necessity of compounding with the Dutch concessionaire was a contingency which could not entirely be overlooked. Sir G. Barclay replied that, as regards the Mejlis, he doubted it the proposal to secure the con cession in the Sheikh’s name would avoid difficulties, as the Karun irrigation question had been so much before the public and was thought to be so profitable that great oppo sition and the closest scrutiny might be expected when the Sheikh applied for the concession. As regards the exclusion of foreign capital, Sir G. Barclay considered this desirable, and expressed the opinion that Dutch claims to participation wmuld *presumably cease on the expiry of their option in January 1911, and that it was not improbable that the Mejlis would cancel it before then. This end might also be attained by the Sheikh protest ing against the option when the Mejlis met and himself applying for the concession. Even if he were not successful, he would at least have first claim to be considered when the Dutch option did expire. In the event of it becoming necessary to compound with the* • \y. -4k: 'J l Dutch concessionaire, Sir G. Barclay did not think it would be very difficult to induce the Sheikh to admit the required amount of Dutch capital under British auspices. The Political Resident reported on the 24th June to His Majesty’s Legation that, with the Sheikh’s co-operation, Lieutenant Wilson had made a preliminary reconnaissance and had furnished a full report of the Kerkha project, that the Sheikh was greatly attracted by the prospect of a simple and* profitable scheme, and that he had invited Lieutenant Wilson to undertake a preliminary survey of the work with a view to framing a scheme and estimates during the present summer, at the end of which he said he would ask Government for the loan of an engineer to examine sites for a dam and to estimate the cost. As the Sheikh is evidently in a favourable mood, the Political Resident hoped advantage would be taken of it, and requested permission to send a copy of the report to Sir William Wilcocks at Bagh dad and ask him to advise as to what might usefully be done for the present as regards preliminary work, and what arrangements he would suggest during the winter months. 13. In connection with the loan of German competition £1,000 taken by the at Mohammerah. Sheikh of Moham- merah from Messrs. Wonckhaus (vide para graph 12 of the Memorandum for May), Hajji Rais says that Wonckhaus and Company have repeatedly intimated their readiness to lend ' money to the Sheikh. On receiving the loan he now asks for, the Sheikh under takes immediately to liquidate this debt and in the future altogether to avoid such trans actions. The Political Resident impressed upon the Sheikh that it was impossible to dissociate himself from the proceedings of Hajji Rais, his factotum^ and explained to him in clear terms that, if he desired to retain the confidence of the British Govern ment, he must endeavour to resist undesirable foreign influence both in his own interests and ours. The Sheikh said that in this matter he wished entirely to follow our advice. The Political Resident also discussed the subject with Hajji Rais. The latter requested that it might be remembered that he was first of all a trader, and, like other traders, his object was money-making, but he realised that he and the Slieikh were so closely connected in their general relations that it was inevitable that the latter should be associated with his own dealings, and he expressed his readiness to take such line of conduct as we might decide to be most conducive to our own interests and those of the Sheikh. He assured the Political Resident, as regards the wharf which had lately been builtand leased to Messrs. Wonckhaus on behalf of the Sheikh (vide paragraph 3 of the Memo- randumfor May 1908), that, if a British tenant could be produced, who would pay the same rental (£200) now paid by Messrs. Wonckhaus, in the event of the latter giving the lease up, he would undertake to prevent them from obtain ing business in Mohammerah and force them to relinquish their lease by arranging an undetect able boycott by himself and other merchants over whom he had influence. He pointed out that his son would in this process be compelled to resign the German Shipping Line Agency and he hoped that the British Government would not let him lose by it. The Political Kesident suggested that, as the Sheikh and commercial affairs in Mohammerah were practically controlled by Hajji Itais, if he attained the result indicated, it would be well worth while, as long as the position was maintained, to give him a subsidy. This matter could now be conveniently arranged indirectly through the Oil Company. The Political B;esident also suggested that the Oil Company or Messrs. Shaw Wallace might undertake confidentially to take on the tenancy of the wharf at the same rental as Messrs. Wonckhaus and Company in the event of the latter being forced to give up their lease, as it was important that Hajji Rais should begin pushing this matter before Messrs. Wonckhaus* position is assured. The Political Resident stated that, although he did not doubt the Sheikh’s personal bond Jides, it was necessary in British interests for His Majesty’s Representative to keep a tactful watch on Hajji Rais, as it was of the greatest importance to have the latter’s good-will and co-operation. Sir G. Barclay replied that, if the pro posed arrangement with Hajji Rais were made, it would not only give him an undesirable hold over us. but would, if it came to light, give the Germans a very justifiable cause for complaint. Sir G. Barclay would prefer to rely on the influence of His Majesty’s Consul to check any efforts which might be made by Hajji Rais to improve the position of the Germans. 14. (Vide paragraph 11 of the Memo- Arabistan telegraph randum for Mpril lines - 1909.) Sir G. Barclay informed Sir E. Grey on the 21st May that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was now ready to sign a Convention very much on the lines desired by Sir E. Grey, provided it was agreed by an exchange of notes that the Convention should not come into force until approved by the Assembly. Sir G. Barclay was disposed to agree to the condition, after consultation14 with the Director of the Indo-Europerm Telegraph Department and an individual who was in close touch with the Nationalist party. Shortly after this, Sir A. Nicolson received the reply of the Russian Government to his memorandum about Persian telegraphs. The principal points mentioned were—(1) the necessity of effecting as quickly as possible the exchange of telegraph lines‘to Seistan and Meshed (paragraph 6 of the Memorandum for May) ; (2) the employment of Russian signallers on the Arabistan lines, as the Pussian Government held that the present wording of the agreement was too vague and left it open to Persia to insist on her previous sanction being obtained to the employment of Russians; (3) that extra lines from Tehran to Shahrud (paragraph 8 of the Memorandum for March) should be begun at once; and (4) that Russia should be supplied with certain information which should satisfy her as to the financial position of the Tehrau- Khanikin line. Sir G. Barclay pointed out that the settle ment of these questions would cause an un desirable delay, and that any alteration of the Convention now would arouse suspicion. Sir E. Grey accordingly enquired whether the Russian Government would be satisfied with the reservation which had been suggested by them in regard to the future employment of Russian signallers. Russia thereupon replied thot she had no objection to the immediate signature of the Convention without alteration, provided the proposed secret Anglo-Russian Agreement contained a clause to the effect that, should Russia desire at any time to employ signallers on these lines, such signallers should be considered as employes of the Indo- European Telegraph Department and should be attached to that Department, the explan ation being that her sole object was to ensure, in the event of the development of her trade in those regions, the efficient transmission of Russian messages. . Sir Barclay was accordingly instructed to sign the Convention at once and without alteration, and Sir A. Nicolson was requested to inform the Russian Government that the British Government agreed to the terms pro posed by her in regard to the employment of Russian signallers, that the question of the exchange of the Tehran-Meshed and Khaf- Seistan lines would be taken up at the first favourable opportunity, and that, in regard to the remaining points, a reply would be sent later. 15. (Vide paragraph 15 of the Memo. Abu Musa red oxide. for May 1909.) T&gt; i.,. , „ . 0n the 2n d June, the 1 ohtical Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that the German Consul had been informed15 verbally of tbe position 4&gt;n the lines suggested when he first broached the subject, but that he had proceeded to lodge a written protest as he was not satisfied. With reference to His Majesty’s Secre tary of State’s comment that the mining of only 400 tons had been authorised, the Resi dent explained that eventually Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. asked for as much oxide as possible up to GOO tons, and this figure was given to the Residency Agent as the concessionaire. He added that the minerals awaited shipment, mining having ceased. 16. (Vide paragraph 18 of the Memo- Persian claim to ? andum for JHuy 1909.} sovereignty over On the 10th May, Sir .Bahrein. Q re y informed Sir G. Barclay that the communication to the Persian Government could be worded as he thought best, lie added, however, that His Majesty’s Government could not allow the Persian Government to exercise sovereignty over tbe inhabitants of Bahrein and that they would continue to act in accordance with this principle. 17. (Vide paragraph 19 of the Memo- Reported Turkish ? anduui for May 1909.) occupation of Zakhnu- On the 4th June, the niyah island. Secretary of State for India telegraphed that His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople had been ins tructed to bring the facts of the case to the notice of the Porte and to request them to issue instructions for the withdrawal of the garrison on the ground of avoiding any dis turbance of the status quo. His Majesty’s Government were of opinion that it appeared desirable not to raise the question of a British protectorate over Bahrein in the first instance. As to the proposal to advise the Sheikh to fly his own flag on Zakhnuniyah island, they proposed to await the result of their represent ations to the Porte before deciding on any line of action. 18. (Videparagraph 17 of the Memo randum for February 1909.) On the 19th February, Sir G. Barclay iniormed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that the Persian Government, in reply to the note which he had addressed them on the subject of the Taona murders (vide paragraph 21 of the Memorandum, for January 1909) had once more repeated their inability to do anything further in the case, and had absolutely denied that the two men, seen last year at the pearl- fisheries, were still alive. He consequently felt unable to approach that Government again lor the present, but he would be glad to use in a further representation to them any Murder of certain subjects of the Chief of Abu Thabi by residents of Taona.16 further evidence that came to the fcnowledsre of the Political Resident. The latter will endeavour to effect the capture of the men during the present diving season. 19. {Fideparagraph 18 of the Memo- Nojd affairs. a / °'V 1909.) According to a Mecca newspaper of the 4th April, the forces of the new Amir of Nejd, Ibn Rashid, had decisively routed the forces of Saud Ibn Abdul Aziz who was killed. Two batteries of artillery and five battalions of infantry of the Ottoman army had been sent to chastise the Saud party and had worked successfully (whether they took part in the engagement or not was not stated). The same newspaper further reported that Ibn Rashid, after the victory, had written to the Central Government at Constantinople propos ing that, fqr the conservation of the peace, he should form a regular force of some thousand local Arabs under Arabic-speaking officers of the Turkish army. He begged also that competent civil officials to re-organise his administration and instructors in law might be sent to him and he promised to assure the safety of the Hedjaz Railway. The newspaper applauded his sentiments, though hinting at the difficulty of fulfilling this promise, and anticipated peace and happiness for Nejd under his Amirate and the new Turkish regime.

Ihe Situation in Persia. a( ]yi ce ari (] represent ations of the British and Russian Legations failed to stop the Bakhtiari advance. On the 6th July, the Saioar Assad and Sipahdar returned identic replies to the two Legations, and declared that the men in charge of the affairs of the country were traitors and reactionaries, the constitution was a sham, the electoral law was delayed and steps had been taken contrary to the people’s rights. They announced that, in accordance with the exigencies of the day, the constitutionalists considered it necessary to take measures to destroy the power of the traitors, and with confidence in the tw r o Powers, the Persian nation considered itself free to demand and obtain its rights. The situation was aggravated hy the decision of the Russian Government to send troops to Persia for the safety of foreigners and foreign interests in Tehran. M. Isvolsky replied to a representation from the British Government on the subject that it was merely in deference to the British opposi tion that the despatch of troops had been delayed, and he thought that the present crisis w'ould have been averted if troops had gone earlier. There w as no question of assist ing the Shah and intervention would be avoided as far as possible. But if anarchy and brigandage continued with the removal of the Shah, intervention on a large scale would become imperative. Mr. O’Beirne gathered that one important reason for despatching the troops was to save the Russian Bank which w r as said to contain a deposit of £2,000,000. The view of His Majesty’sGovernmentwas different, and edr G. Barclay held that, though there was a possibility of danger, owing to strong anti- Russian feeling, yet M. Sabline and his Gov ernment appeared to hold an altogether exag gerated view of the danger, and that, at the most, an increase of 200 or 300 men to the Russian Legation guard would suffice to guard against any possible danger, and that the despatch of such a large force was bound to he regarded as intervention on behalf of the[ 2 ] Shall. Sir E. Grey intimated to the Russian Ambassador in London that he viewed with anxiety the despatch of Russian troops and indicated the risks attendant thereon, hut that^ the cordial relations between the two -Ministers were not impaired in his view by the discussions on the advantages or disadvantages of the action. M. Isvolsky expressed his gratifi cation at the communication and said his one desire was to work cordially with His Majesty's Government His Majesty's Consul at Batoum reported on the 8th July that one regiment of Cossacks, one battery of field artillery and two companies of sappers were believed to have left Baku on the 6th July for Enzeli. M. Sabline put the strength of the force at one battalion of infantry, oOO Cossacks, four guns and some sappers. I he Local Assembly at Hesht was exasperated at the approach of Russian troops and protested in vehement language to foreign k 10 Ti, m ey thre ^ tene ' 110 boycott Rinsian gooils. 1 he Ulemas of Nejef expressed them- selyes strongly against the Russian action. 6tnct orders were issued to the Russian Com mander of the force not to advance beyond Razyin unless cahed to move by the Russian Minister at Tehran, and to strictly confine himself to the protection of foreigners and Tehran 1Uterests lf tlle foroe was to enter The further advance of the Russian troops fortunately proved unnecessary, for on the morning of the 13th July, t^e joint Ws Tel l„ S T ar i AS ^ d and tl,e Si P a hdar entered practically unopposed and succeeded aftei a brief struggle with the Royalist troops m acqumng complete mastery of the situation! the R h°, 0 ^ * P ossuislon of the nortliern and the Baharistan quarters. The two Legations ::?r ce f s the the lfit. f f y r, 0f i 0rei S n interests. On t e 16tli July, the Shah took refuge at the Russian Legation, where he was taken undei^ Anglo-Russian protection.

As the Shah was, for Ms peisonal safety, a refugee at the Russian Legation under the protection of Great Britain and Russia, it was therefore requested that the representatives of the two Rowers should appoint au hour on the 18th Julv when the deputation could see the Shah, n Sablme communicated the message to the fn .s J r WaS f- ready a '' are of the Proceed ings at the meeting m Baharistan and of the[ 3 ] choice of the people. His Majesty desired that the Sipahdar and the Snrdnr might be informed that he had already abdicated, had left Sultan- abad and therefore refused to receive the depu tation. On the same day, the Sipahdar, as Minister of War, and the Sardar, as AJinister of the Interior, issued a proclamation to the effect that the Shah had spontaneously abdicated, and that the Vali And, Sultan Ahmad Mirza, had been “ appointed ” the new Sovereign by a Grand Council which assembled at the Baharistan on the loth July. Pending the convocation of a Parliament, Azad-ui- Mulk, head of the Kajar family, was to be the Piegent. The Legations were officially notified on the 17th July of the accession of Sultan Ahmad Mirza to the throne. The young Shah, escorted by an Anglo-Russian guard, proceeded to the Sultanabad palace, where he was received by a deputation of the Grand Council, and, on his arrival at the palace, he ceased to be under Anglo-Russian protection. Under instructions from His Majesty’s Government and from the Government of the Czar, Sir G. Barclay and M. Sabline notified, on the 21st July, the recognition of Sultan Ahmad Mirza as the Shah of Persia. On the 22nd July, Sir G. Barclay was asked, if he saw no objection, to convey a suitable message from His Excellency to the young Shah. The refugees in Situation in Azerbaijan. the Turkish Consulate- General continued to be a source of general uneasiness. Mr. Wratislaw reported on the 17th June that the refugees had called a general meeting in the Turkish Consulate-General, where three of the Local Assembly were present, and violent speeches were made against Russia and England. Mr. Wratislaw thought that the Turkish Consul-General had exceeded his rights by allowing his house to be put to such uses. On the 18th June, the refugees wired to the Turkish Parliament asking for help to get rid of the Russians. Respectable people were being induced by threats to sign a petition in the same sense with a view to hav ing the bazar closed. Mr. Wratislaw tried his best to counteract these intrigues and he and his Russian colleague wrote to the Turkish Consul-General pointing out the abuse of the protection he was affording to the refugees. Sir Edward Grey telegraphed to Sir G. Lowther on the 26th June desiring him to support his Russian colleague in strongly urging upon the Porte the despatch of immediate instructions to their Consul-General at Tabriz to cease from permitting the Con sulate to become a focus of disturbances on the part of the refugees there, for whose asylum no sufficient justification existed. There was no ground for agitation among theNationalists, as the Shah had agreed to the pro gramme of reforms and the.electoral law had been published. The withdrawal of the Russian troops had already commenced and the evacua tion would be completed as soon as a Governor-General had arrived there, and would only be retarded by disorder. Sattar Khan and Bagher had nothing to fear from the Russian authorities and had already secured guarantees for their safety in the event of their desiring to leave Persian territory. Sir G. Lowther reported on the 28th June that the Turkish Minister for Poreign Affairs had assured him that stringent orders had been sent to the Turkish Consul-General at Tabriz to abstain from any action calculated to support the agitators and from connivance and part in the internal affairs. Sir G. Barclay reported on the 1st of July that all, excepting Sattar and his brother, had left the Turkish Consulate- General. Later, on the 5th July, he reported that M. Sabline had instructed the Russian Consul-General at Tabriz to concert with Ms Turkish colleague for the departure of Sattar and Bagher. The Russian General was to guarantee their sale conduct to Batoum. After Tabriz had been evacuated by the Russians safety of both these individuals would be guaianteed as lar as Julfa on their wav back tr* Tabriz. It was left to the Turkish Consul and the Persian authorities to settle among them selves the question of the guarantees 'for the safety of their properties. throughout June the Nationalist agitation for the withdrawal of the Russian troops from Tabriz continued. On the 20th, two companies of infantry with a howitzer battery were recalled to Russia, but the majority of the garrison remained, despite the representation of the British Minister. The Persian Govern ment continued to press on the Russian Lega tion the necessity for an immediate and substantial reduction of the troops, but without effect. The Russian Government justified their action by calling attention to the situation at lehran and the possibility of the recrudesence of anarchy in Tabriz if the troons were withdrawn. ^ t Mi r ,y tele g l ’a phed, on the 11th June, that the Kurd forces referred to in the Journal for the last month as being in the neighbourhood of Saujboulak had retired. Major Cox reported, on the 6th July, that Situation at Bushire. ^ ie I’CCGiVed a COm- , . . . munication from the local Anjuman, signed by five leading clericals and five principal merchants, saying that, having regard to untoward incidents occurring elsewhere in Persia it had become necessary that the Anjuman should forthwith assume control of all the •Departments of the Government including the7/&gt; [ 5 ] Customs Department, the receipts of which should be deposited in the Imperial Bank of Persia in the name of the nation with the cognisance of a selected number of the Anju- man people. The Anjuman undertook to recognise the claims of the British Government on the Customs Department on the production of documents, and to arrange for payment to the British Consul-General of such share of interest and principal as would fall rateably on Bushiro and Bunder Abbas. No mention was made of Lingah, but Major Cox thought that the place was presumably included. They also undertook scrupulously to observe all obligations to the British Government, such as the honourable treatment of British officers and the Consulate, the protection of the lives and the property of British subjects. In con clusion the Anjuman asked generally for the co-operation of the British authorities in the preservation of the rights of the Persian nation, and particularly for concurrence in the above arrangement. Major Cox further reported that it appeared that the above communication was the result of instructions received from the Ulema of Nejef and from Tabriz, delivered by Saiyid Assadulla, a Nejef emissary. The Darya Begi confidentially informed Major Cox that the .Nationalists contemplated an absolute boycott of Russian subjects, goods and ships, but that he had induced the Anjuman not to mention in their present communication any thing about the subject. The primary object was that Tehran should not get customs receipts. The Darya Begi wished to know what Major Cox thought of the Nationalist communication and also asked his personal advice as to the best line of conduct for himself in the difficult posiiion. Major Cox replied that he could not give an official reply to the communication from the Anjuman* before consulting higher authorities, but personally he thought that the action of the Anjuman was precipitate and calculated to bring about the very results which they all wished to avoid. Major Cox reminded him that there was no reactionary element, nor possibility of any reactionary opposition in the Gulf ports, and consequently the constitutional party would lose nothing by waiting to see the outcome of the endeavours already in progress at Tehran. Personally he advised the Anjuman to post pone the line of action contemplated by them. On the 7th July, a report was received to the effect that it was believed that Saiyid Assadulla had, on behalf of the Anjuman, sent a long tele gram on the night of the 6th July, to the Ulema of Tehran, for communication *to the Cabinet. The telegram said that the people of the Gulf would not recognise Tehran any longer if a single Russian soldier remained on Persian soil, but would assume control, as an independent people over all the Departments in the Persian[ 0 J Gulf. On the 11th July, Sir G. Barclay tele graphed approval of Major Cox’s informal reply to the Anjuman and his advice to the Darya Begi, but recommended that no reply should be given officially. The boycott of Russian goods, Sir G. Barclay thought, was only too likely to defeat its own object, and he hoped that Major Cox would do his best to discourage it. lie saw no objection, as regards the customs, to the action proposed by Major Cox, provided no money was withdrawn without the consent of some one in whom Major Cox had confidence. He added that Major Cox might intimate to the Anjuman that they could in any case count upon monthly instalments being used for the purpose pres cribed in the agreement concluded by the Legation under instruction from His Majesty’s Government, with the Persian Government. Major Cox was further asked to lose no opportunity to remind the malcontents of Russia’s repeated declarations as to the temporary character of the Russian occupation. In view of the Bakhtiari and the Fedai advance on Tehran, and solely for the protection of foreign interests, Russian troops were expected to be despatched to Persia, but they would not advance beyond Kazvin unless required in the capital for the purpose for which they would be sent. Later the same day Sir G. Barclay telegraphed to Major Cox that the news that the Bushire people had telegraphed an ulti matum to the Cabinet made the Anjuman communication appear more serious, and he thought that it would be better to reply officially to the Anjuman pointing out that there was clearly no excuse for the local Assembly to usurp the functions of the Gov ernment, after the Shah bad restored the constitution and preparatory work for the convocation of the Parliament was proceeding, and a liberal electoral law had been promul gated. Further that it was much in the interests of the integrity of Persia that Bushire should loyally co-operate with the Central Government in giving the restored constitution a fair chance, and should not again throw off its allegiance. Situation at Shiraz, The situation at Shiraz went from bad to worse during the month, Mr. Bill reported on the 11th July that some danger existed of the arrival, at the invitation of the Governor^ General, of the Lari Saiyid with a force to attack the Kavam. In view of the Saiyid’s irrespon-* sible and violent character, there would be great danger if he were to come. As the Saiyid might move without warning, Mr. Bill enquired if he could expect reinforcements from Bushire if urgently required. Major Cox stated on the 12th July that in case of extreme urgency a party of 25 to 30 sepoys with a native officer could besent from Bushire. But, if the country side rose up in arms, so small a party might not be able to get through without a British officer, as the men were new to the country and to the language. Captain Trevor reported on the 14th July that he had been informed by the Senior Naval Officer in the Gulf that His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief had no objection to a maxim gun being despatched with the proposed party. The Government of India informed Major Cox on the 16th July that the military authorities considered that, in the event of it being necessary to send troops from Bushire, at least half a company with a British officer should be sent to Shiraz, and consequently, as the necessity to move troops to Shiraz might be sudden, they suggested that Bushire should be reinforced by half a company and a British officer at once. Major Cox replied on the 18th that he could send 40 sepoys and 5 sowars, practically half a company under Lieutenant Crosthwaite, in order to meet the views of the military authorities and that a naval officer ■with six marines and one maxim gun would accompany the party. In view of the presence of His Majesty’s ships, there seemed to be no need for the despatch of another half company from India. Pending the receipt of final orders he was holding the force in readiness, but he hoped that authentic news of the con firmation of the Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment would have a deterrent effect on the Lari Saiyid. He wished to draw particular attention to the fact that, but for the abandonment of neutrality by Russia in assuming protection of Nasser-ed-Dowleh—a course which obliged the British Consulate to share the danger and odium which was resulting to the Russian Consulate, the prospect of the necessity for the despatch of this force to Shiraz would, in all probability, never have arisen. Mr. Bill reported on the 18th July that telegrams announcing the deposition of the Shah had been received in Shiraz, and that the Governor-General had refused to quit his post on the ground that the appointment of the Zil-es-Sultan was made by a defunct rtgimey while the new Deputy Governor hesitated to exert his authority derived from the Bakhtiari Khans. He, in conjunction with his Russian colleague, was informing the Deputy Governor that they held him responsible, but there was a state of anarchy and the tribal levies were patrolling. The Saiyid was making hasty purchases of am munition. The situation was thus serious, and Mr. Bill considered that, unless the existing appointments were confirmed by de facto authorities at Tehran and peremptory orders reached the Governor-General to proceed to the capital, reinforcements should be sent.[ a 1 Sir G. Barclay reported on the 19th July that he and Ins Russian colleague had approached the Minister of the Interior tvitli a view to recalling the Governor, and Confirming the appointment of the Zil-es- Sultan in his stead, to send through the British Consul at Shiraz urgent orders to the Lari Saiyid not to advance and to send telegraphic instructions for the dismissal of the tribal levies. The new Government expressed their wish to retain the Governor for the present and not to confirm the appoint ment of the Zil-es-Sultan. They, however, ordered the Lari Saiyid by telegram to keep quiet and also requested the Ulemas to tele graph to him in the same sense. This was soon followed by the announcement that Ala- ed-Dowleh was appointed Governor-General of Bars. On the 24th July, the Secretary of State was informed by telegram that Major Cox had reported some improvement in the situation, and that therefore there was no immediate necessity of sending reinforcements to Shiraz. The Government of India fully realised that, in view of the unpopularity excited by the Russian action in Northern Persia, it was politically desirable to defer moving troops so long as possible, but owing to the anarchy prevailing in Persia, an emergency might arise at any time which would necessitate the despatch of reinforcements. The military authorities in India strongly deprecated the movement of small isolated detachments, and recommended that in case of emergency, a force sufficient to guarantee success should be employed, as otherwise there would be a risk of regrettable incidents occurring which might result in operations on a larger scale. They thought that the loss of popularity consequent on armed intervention would probably be much the same whether the force sent was small or large. The Government of India consequently suggested to the Secretary of State that not less than one regiment should be sent to Bushire, should the necessity again arise of sending re inforcements to Shiraz, and expressed their inability to suggest any other possible action. The British Consul at Shiraz reported on the 25th July that the tribal levies in the town had expelled the representative of the new Governor from the Government house, and that he had learnt from the Telegraph Office at Abadah that Soulat-ed-Dowieh had started for Shiraz with a force of 10,000 men. He asked for the immediate despatch of re inforcements from Bushire. On the night of the 25th July, 50 men with a maxim gun consist ing of one naval Lieutenant, 5 Royal Marines, 36 sepoys, 5 sowars, one native officer, one British Lieutenant and one Assistant Surgeon started from Bushire for Shiraz. c73 • [ 9 ] Major Cox reported on the 26th that the Kashgai Chief, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, objected to the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh as Governor of Fars, and had sent one force to bar his passage from Tehran and was himself marching on Shiraz witli another force. Major Cox was asked whether, in view of fresh developments, it was desirable to send reinforcements to Fushire. He replied that, unless foreign repre sentatives displayed apprehension, there was no present need of reinforcements. The leading members of the Assembly, the Governor-General situation at Meshed. of Kkorasan, and the British and Russian re presentatives met at the British Consulate- General on the 2nd July 1909. A reconcilia tion was effected and disarmament agreed to, and the Governor-General returned to the ark after the arrangements had been ratified by the Assembly. On 10th July both the Assembly and the Governer-General were reported to be co-operating for peace with considerable success. On the 19th July, the news of the accession of the new Shah n as received with general rejoicing. The Assembly have accepted the Governor-General, and peace has once more been restored. Major Ducat reported on the 11th July ^ that the Baluchis were said to be preparing to march against Bam and Kerman. His inform ant stated that the Russian Consul at Seistan had written to the Baluchis offering to give them money if they would make an agreement with the Russians. The disquiet in Balu chistan was attributed to Russian intrigue. Major Ducat thought that, in the circum stances, the Affshars would certainly anticipate the Baluchis and take Kerman if the latter reached Bam. Both the tribes would then get out of control and the situation would become dangerous to all. Major Kennion reported on the 16th July that he was ascer taining the facts, but that, in his opinion, the news of the Russian intrigues were almost certainly untrue. Sir G. Barclay proposed to instruct Major Kennion to convey a warning to the Baluchis that the disorders apparently contemplated by them would probably lead to intervention, and to remind them that the revolutionary movements had already neces sitated the despatch of Russian troops into Persia. He also proposed that the Government of India might similarly instruct the Political Agent at Chasai if he was in touch with the Persian Baluchis. The Secretary of State for India telegraphed on the 16th July that Sir Edward Grey had approved of the instructions proposed by Sir G. Barclay to Major Kennion, and he desired the Government of India to\ r 10 j send instructions in the sense indicated by Sir G. Barclay and to suggest any further action that might be taken. Enquiry was also made whether, in the event of danger to Kerman, Major Ducat could withdraw to Bunder Abbas, Birjand or Yezd. In reply to a reference from the Government of India on the subject, Major Cox telegraphed on the 19th July to say that he thought it was possible that a peremp tory message to the headman of the Alfshars from the new regime at Tehran would have a useful effect. Frima facie, the Baluchis would endeavour to avoid harming British interests, hut he was telegraphing to Charbar a message to Sardar Saiyid Khan. In this message Major Cox was communicating the establish ment of constitutional Government at Tehran and strongly advising him to refrain from the movement attributed to him, and warning him that he would have to reckon with the British authorities if any harm resulted to British interests. The withdrawal of Major Eucat and the European community from Kerman was, in Major Cox’s opinion, out of the ques tion. There were some 25 Europeans, includ ing several ladies, at Kerman and their journey to Bunder Abbas or Yezd at the season of the year would be exceedingly trying if not actually dangerous to life. If the solution of the crisis at Tehran had no quieting effect and Major Ducat still reported danger and asked for urgent reinforcements, the most expeditious means of securing safety of the British community would be to send np half a squadron of cavalry from India via Bunder Abbas. The Political Agent at Chagai had also sent warnings to Sardars l ahrarn Khan and Saad Khan and also to the tribes which took part in the recent raids on Karmasbir. Sir G. Barclay agreed with Major Cox, but hoped that the situation would quiet down in view of the establishment of a consti tutional Government at Tehran and the messages from them and Major Cox to the Baluchis. Major Ducat reported on the 20th July that he had sent a warning to the Baluchis in the terms of Sir G. Barclay’s instructions and hoped it would prevent their movement. The Affshars were friendly cm the whole, but were very wild and might easily get out of hand, in which case the Europeans, owing to their houses being in the southern quarter, would be in the midst of the worst looting. Danger from them was not however pressing. On the 22nd July, he reported that the air of unrest had quite cleared and Kerman would be normal unless Tehran was again disturbed. With a consti tuted authority re-established and the arrival of a new Governor there would be no cause for anxiety. The Government of India reported to the Secretary of State on the 24th July the) « { n ] action taken by the Political Officers and their views that the situation at Kerman had improved and quiet had been restored, and there was therefore no immediate necessity to send reinforcements. In the event of any future emergency requiring the despatch of troops to protect Kerman, not less than one regiment should be sent to Bunder Abbas. The withdrawal of the Consul and the European community to Bunder Abbas, Birjand or Yezd would be impracticable in any case. 2. Mr. Bill reported on the 1st of July that Nasser-ed- Dowleh, the younger Kavami brother, had been appointed Russian Shiraz. He strongly Appointment of Nsssor-ed-Dowleh as Russian Consular Agent at Shiraz. Consular Agent at deprecated this action on the part of Russian authorities and described it as an important move towards the establishment of predomi nance of Russian influence in the neutral zone. The nominee owned large estates in the province, and thus very important and large interests would come under Russian influence and protection. Sir G. Barclay interviewed M. Sabline and deplored the action. He expressed his surprise that neither the British Consul at Shiraz nor he himself should have been informed of the matter, while the action had been in contemplation for some six months. Sir G. Barclay was of opinion that his Russian colleague had not apparently realized the gravity of the action before repre sentation was made to him, but promised to give full consideration to the matter. On the 7th July, Mr. Bill reported that Kavam-ul-Mulk, the elder brother of Nasser- ed-Dowleh, had applied for British protection. Sir G. Barclay considered this bid for British and Russian protection as deplorable, and instructed Mr. Bill to refuse the application. A reference was made to the Russian Government on the subject, and the Minister for Eoreign Affairs sent instructions to M. Sabline to examine carefully the question of the appointment in conjunction with his British colleague. Sir G. Barclay reported on the 7th July that he and M. Sabline were agreed that the two Kavami brothers should be removed from Shiraz, and that they would press for this as soon as there was a less demor alized Government in Persia. 3. { Vide 'paragraph 2 of the Memo* The zil-os-Sultan. rmnlumfor June 1909.) It was found desirable that the Zil-es-Sultan, who was reported to be on his way back to Persia, should be dissuaded from returning, till the crisis was over in the country and favourable conditions prevailed. The Russian Government desired that the British Representative at Vienna should join his Russian eolieugue in urging the desirabilityt 12 ] of the above course to the Zil, and Sir I\ Cartwright was instructed accordingly. A hope was expressed by Sir G. Barclay that the announcement of the appointment of the Zil-es-Sultan as Governor of Fars might improve the general situation at Shiraz, but latterly it was found that he was not accept able to the new Government, who evidently feared him. In the circumstances, Sir G. Barclay did not press the Zil’s confirmation on the new Government. 4. {Vide paragraph 3 of Memorandum The Cossack Brigade, 1909.) Sir A. JNicolson reported on the 29th May that he was informed by M. Tcharykow that the Russian General Staff did not consider Colonel Margani scientific enough to take the place of Colonel Liakhoff, and that therefore he would not get the appointment. The General Staff would send one of their own members for the post. 5. {Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- Telegraphs in Persia. r ^ 0r ^ une m 1909.) In regard to the four points raised in the Russian Memo randum {vide second clause of paragraph 14 of the June Memorandum), Sir A. Nicolson was informed by Sir E. Grey on the 11th June 1909 (1) that as regards the future employment of Russian signallers on the Arabistan system, it was understood that the arrangements proposed would entail no expense on the Indo-European Telegraph Department, (2) that there was no objection to the immediate construction of the second wire from Tehran to Shahrud, (3) that there were no accounts between the Persian Gov ernment and the Indo-European Telegraph Department respecting the Tehran-Khanikin line, as the line was worked entirely by the Persian Telegraph Administration, and (4) that in regard to the proposed exchange of telegraph lines, the British Government would prefer that the question should be deferred until the Arabistan Convention had been rati fied by the Assembly. As, however, Sir A. Nicolson represented that Russia might consider that this last question was continually being postponed, it was decided by His Majestv’s Government on the 17th June 1909 to say no more on the subject to that Government. Sir G. Barclay could decide as to what would be the first favourable opportunity of raisin^ the question with the Persian Government 5 , and could be trusted to make every effort to prevent the Russian Minister from taking any premature action should he show any dispo sition to do so. Sir G. Barclay observed that he would do his best on the lines indicated, but that anti-Russian feeling was now (19th June) so strong that for fear of the Assemblyn5 [ 13 ] no Minister would dare consent to an ex change of telegraphs, and that the scheme must consequently be postponed, as otherwise the Arabistan Convention would certainly fall through. The Arabistan Convention was signed on the 17th June. The following is the text:— Article I .—To improve the telegraphic communication between Borazjun and Moham- merah, and Borazjun and Dizful, it is arrang ed that from the date of this agreement until January 1945 the above-mentioned telegraph lines shall be under the control and supervi sion of the British Government Telegraph Officials now controlling the International lines in Persia. Article II .—The British Government agrees to pay for the cost of the construction and the establishment of the above-mentioned lines, such as iron posts, wire, insulators, &amp;c., which may be required, up to £5,000, and also to pay an annual sum of £300 on account of the maintenance of the above-mentioned lines, and the pay of a mechanician up to the year 1945. Other expenses, such as the changing of the wooden posts for iron ones, and the annual expenses of the maintenance of the above-mentioned lines, which may be in excess of the £5,000 and the annual amount of £300, shall, after the completion of the work and the submission of the accounts, be paid gradually to the British Telegraph Depart ment by the Persian Government. Article III. —In return for the expenses incurred gratis by the British Government, and referred to in Article II for the construc tion and maintenance of the above-mentioned lines, the Persian Government agrees to con sider the following Conventions to be in force and binding up to the 1st January J 945 :— the Telegraph Convention of 2nd April 1868; the Telegraph Convention of 2nd December 1872; the Telegraph Convention of 16th August 1901. Article IV. —The pay of the telegraphists and other workmen, such as gholams and farrashes, batterries and instruments, and the hire of telegraph offices, will be borne by the Persian Telegraph Department. Article V. —Guards and telegraph gholams, who must be Persians, will be re quired for the maintenance of the above- mentioned lines ; the control and payment of these will be in the hands of the Director and British Staff. Article VI. —In order to ensure the pro per working of these telegraph lines, the British Director will be at liberty to station British telegraphists, at the expense of the British Government Telegraph Department,[ H ] at any telegraph office on the above-mentioned lines which he may consider necessary. Article VII .—In case of necessity, and with the permission of the Persian Government Telegraph Department, the British Govern ment Telegraph Department can join the above-mentioned lines at their eastern extre mity to the line between Tehran and Bushire. Article VlLl.—li the British Govern ment Telegraph Department considers it necessary, it can, at its own expense, add a second line for its own use to the above-men tioned lines. Article IX .—The Persian Government agrees not to employ in the telegraph offices of the above-mentioned lines, without the concurrence of the chiefs of the British Telegraph Department, any one except Persian subjects or members of the British Government Telegraph Department. Article X .—It is agreed that, should the Persian Government in the future wish to extend the above-mentioned lines in any direction, the co-operation of the Indo- European Telegraph Department in the con struction and maintenance of such extension will be asked for. An exchange of notes was at the same time made with the Persian Government, to the effect that the Convention would require the approval of the Persian National Assembly. Sir G. Barclay drew attention to the fact that the share in the cost of the construction and maintenance of the Arabistan lines to be borne by the Department, fixed in Article II at £5,000 towards the construction and £300 a year towards the maintenance, was considera bly less than the Department was prepared to spend {vide paragraph 11 of the Memorandum for February 1909), and that the credit for this satisfactory arrangement belonged to the Director of the Persian Section of the Depart ment and to Mr. King-Wood, who had con ducted the negotiations with the Minister of Telegraphs with much skill and patience. He also recorded his appreciation of the sensible and conciliatory spirit shown throughout by the Minister of Telegraphs, Mukhber-ed- Dowleh. The Russian Bank in Seistan. 6. {Vide paragraph 5 of the Memo randum for June 1909.} The Manager of the local branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia has informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed that his head office appears to be trying to make terms which are not likely to be accepted. The Government of India have telegraphed to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed for further information.7. {Vide paragraph 7 of the Memo* Proposed establish- randum for June ment of a customs 1909.') His Britannia bureau at Birjand. , r , 3 -uiiLaumc 0 . 4 4 , Majesty’s Consul, oeistan, took the opportunity when passing through Meshed, in June 1909, of speaking to M. Kornelis about the proposed establishment of a customs bureau at Birjand. M. Kornelis told Major Kennion that he had only recently brought to notice certain objections which existed to having a bureau so far from the frontier as Meshed, which he believed resulted in many malpractices, and that he could not therefore recommend the introduction of a similar system in Birjand. The chief of these malpractices was the smuggling of arms into Persia. The arms, he said, are imported under the description of glassware or some such heavy goods and are sealed at the frontier without examination, for transit to Meshed. At this place, the seals are found broken, the arms having been extracted en route. The importer, M. Kornelis observed, was never at a loss to produce technically satisfactory evidence as to how the seals had got broken ^ ^ r ? ,ns ^» an d under the present system no effective action could be taken to stop the abuse* The Director of Customs had, however, a suggestion by which, if carried out, the risk of fraud could practically be done away with. This was that the importer should in each case be bound to declare the nature of his goods^ at the frontier, and that a summary examination of the goods should then be carried out. This apparently cannot now be done. For this examination M. Kornelis said that perhaps 5 per cent of the packages in each consignment would be examined. If this vere allowed, M. Kornelis said he would have no objection to the continuance of the present system as regards Meshed or to its extension to Birjand. As regards the establishment of a bureau at Birjand, there was one other point M. Kornelis had to raise. This was that the* Customs Department had need of money in Seistan, and the change suggested would have the effect of diminishing their receipts at this place ^ to an inconvenient extent. Major Kennion pointed out that the Seistan Branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia was in the habit of remitting a good deal of money in specie to Meshed by caravan or post, and that they would almost certainly be able to effect the transfer of the Birjand customs receipts to Seistan at par. M. Kornelis accordingly promised to recommend to his Government the establishment of a bureau at Birjand on the conditions referred to, viz., that we should not object to a summary examina tion of goods to be sealed at the frontier and that the remittance of customs receipts fromt 1G ] Birjand to Seistan would cause his department no expense. 8. {Vide paragraph 17 of the Memo- ^ randum for May 1909.) Seizure of a Maskat t t. -d dhow by the Italian In June the Political authorities on the Be- A^ent, Maskat, for- nadir Coast. warded a letter, dated the 20th May, from the Italian Consul-General at Aden in which the latter asserted that the seizure of the dhow was perfectly lawful, that the Nakhoda ran away from Aden, and that it was not the Nakhoda who called at Aden but a messenger from the Sultan of Maskat who had no authority in the matter. Mr. Holland quoted from previous letters from the Consul-General to show that his statements were inconsistent, and stated that the failure of the Italian Consul-General to hand over the dhow to the new crew sent to Aden would entail further heavy expenses on the owner. He hoped that it might be possible to claim the sum also from the Italian Government. On the 18th June, His Majesty’s Secretary of State telegraphed that instructions had been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Rome to urge the Italian Government to give immediate orders for the release of the dhow, so that it might be taken to Sur by the owner before the commencement of the monsoon. It was added that, if a settlement had not been arrived at locally between the Italian authorities and the British Officer re presenting the Sultan, the details must, on receipt of fuller reports, be considered by the two Governments. Major Cox was informed accordingly. On the 8th July, the correspondence re ferred to above was forwarded to the Secretary of State by despatch and attention was invited to Mr. Holland’s view that, as the Italian Consul-General had failed to make good his offer to deliver the dhow to the owner, the claim for compensation from the Italian Government should include the expenses incurred by the owner in sending a new crew to Aden. On the 16th July, His Majesty’s Secretary of State telegraphed that the British Ambassa dor at Rome had telegraphed the gist of a long report furnished by the Italian Government traversing our statement of facts, and adding information justifying the seizure, but, in deference to the Sultan, offering to release the dhow if the Sultan and the owner, who should acknowledge the legality of the seizure, accept ed the amicable solution proposed by the 15th July; otherwise the case would have to be dealt with by the judicial authorities at Massowah. The report also stated that, after explanations given by the Italian Consul-General at Aden, the legality of the Italian action had been recognised by the “ local authorities ”, and the Political Agent, Maskat,77, f 17 3 had been urged to persuade the owner and the Sultan to accept the solution proposed. The Itesident at Aden was asked to state whether the Italian statement was correct. His reply is awaited. 9. (Vide paragraph 10 of the Memo* Anglo-Persian Oil randum for June 19090 Company. 0n the ^ JuIy; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf intimated that the agreement between the Oil Company and the Sheikh of Mohammerah had been signed. All essential conditions were maintained, but some alterations were made in less important details. It was also found necessary to give the Sheikh a separate confi dential assurance to the effect that if, when the Concession expired, the Persian Government claimed the buildings, machinery, &amp;c., on the land leased from the Sheikh, he would be assisted to arrive at a favourable settlement with that Government by His Majesty’s Gov ernment. As the Sheikh is apprehensive that he may incur the hostility of the present National leaders owing to the execution by him of such an agreement with a Foreign Company, the Oil Company have agreed to maintain secrecy as to the terms of the agree ment, until the crisis in Tehran is over, and, as far as possible, to delay the commencement of operations at the Mohammerah end. It will, however, be dilficult to maintain secrecy foi long, one-half of their pipe-line being expected to arrive in September. . The following is the text of the principal articles of the agreement:— (1) The Sheikh undertakes to hire to the sajd Company an area free of date trees of 650 jaribs of 4,659 square yards per jarib, on Abadan island, situated between the village of Baraim on the north-west and Buwardeh on the south-east, having a frontage of about 2,000 yards on the Shatt-al-Arab, and also a strip of land not less than thirty yards in breadth for a right of way connecting the land above-mentioned with the Bahmanshir River; but the public rights of way must remain. (2) Should the said Company find the ground selected as above, after further examin ation not suitable for their requirements, they should have the right to select other sites of the same area and same description. Should the Company require more land, free of date trees,^ adjacent to the lands leased to them, the Sheikh undertakes, in case the Company asks for such land within a space of two years from the date of this agreement, to grant them land not exceeding one hundred jaribs in area, at the same moderate rate. If the said Com pany ask for more land after two years from the date of this agreement, they shall pay rental at the fair current rate of the time for similar land in those localities.[ 18 ] (3) The Sheikh further undertakes to grant free of charge to the Company a strip of land for the laying of such pipe-lines as may be necessary, above or below ground, situated in his lands or in those lands for the time being under his jurisdiction, or leased or purchased by him from others, with access thereto; and also to grant free in connection with the said pipe line, such uncultivated land as may be needed by them for telegraph or telephone stations, or pumping stations or quarters for line inspectors and stalf, having an area of three jaribs for each pumping station, and one and- a-half jaribs for each of the other stations. It is to be understood that, at the expira tion of the concession, or of any extension or renewal thereof, the Company shall relinquish every pumping or other station that may be erected on these lands, and shall not be entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this con nection. It is agreed that in places where the pipe line is exposed, guards shall be appointed. Eurther, that the Sheikh will exert himself to the utmost to prevent the wilful setting fire to the oil in the pipe. In the event of such a contingency occurring he will endeavour to the utmost of his power to trace and punish the offenders and, if they possess anything, to recover compensation, but the Sheikh does not accept personally any pecuniary liability for loss which may accrue tc the Company from this cause, and will not pay cornpen-^ sation. (4) The Sheikh further undertakes to hire to the Company an area or areas, aggre gating ten jaribs, at Ahwaz and Nasiri, having frontage on the eastern bank (edge) of the Hiver Karun, for the storage of material and building of store-houses, and such other buildings as are needed for the Company’s business, at a rate of £1 sterling per jarib per annum, i.e., that the yearly amount of the rent thereof will be £10 sterling. The Company have power to select a site or sites on the eastern edge of the Karun, located opposite the island in the river, upstream from the garden adjacent to the landing place used by steamers plying on the Upper Karun. Should*the Company find the ground selected as above, after further examination, not suit able for their requirements, they shall have the right to select other sites of the same area and description : and whatever buildings there shall he on these areas shall be left by the Company on the expiry of the lease or of any extension or renewal thereof, and they are not entitled to demand any refund of expenses in this connect tion. (5) In order that the Company may be seitished that it has received from the Sheikhgood and sufficient title to these lands, and that no one in future can put forward any claim in regard to the lands, the Sheikh undertakes for the complete validity thereof to cause this document to be signed and sealed by the elders ot his tribes. (6) (Article G relates to the appointment of watchmen by the Sheikh, and their payment by the Company.) (7) (Article 7 governs the Sheikh’s responsibility in the matter of losses sustained by the Company, through theft or otherwise, and the punishment of the offenders.) (8) The Sheikh further grants the right to the Comp :ny to make all burnt and unburnt bricks and tiles required by them in the lands for the time being in the bands of the Company, and also to erect on the lands occupied by them in accordance with the articles of the Agreement, all buildings, structures and machinery as may be needed by them for the proper execution of their business. The Company undertakes that on the expiry of the concession, or of the period of the extension or renewal thereof, all these lands which have been acquired from the Sheikh on lease or free of charge, shall be abandoned and 8 hall be given back into the hands of the Sheikh, and the said Company will have no further rights in them. (9) This lease of land, and all the condi tions pertaining thereto, shall remain in force for the full period of the concession granted to Mr. W. K. D’Arcy by His Imperial Majesty the Shah of Persia, dated 28th May 1901, and of any extension or renewal thereof. 13ut on the expiration of the original period, in the event of there being an extension or renewal of the concession, the rent shall be fixed at £ 1,500 sterling per annum, payable annually in advance, and the' Sheikh ‘shall have no right to demand any further increase. If in consideration of the exigencies of their business, the Company should wish to curtail the period of their lease, in that case twelve calendar (Christian) months’notice of their intention must be given in writing to the Sheikh prior to the termination of ^the lease. Such notice will be sent to the Sheikh through His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah. If the lease should be thus curtailed, the Company shall make no claim for refund of money that has been paid in advance on account of rent, and the Sheikh likewise shall make no claim for rent for the unexpired period of the lease. (10) If at any time the Company desire to acquire land on the Karun or Shatt-al-Arab at Mohammerah or Ahwaz, or any other point anywhere in the country under the Sheikh’s jurisdiction, for wharves or warehouses for the{ 20 ] purposes of their business, the Sheikh under takes as far as possible to assist the said Com pany in procuring the said land at favourable rates of lease. It is to be understood that such rent will be paid by the Company them selves. (11) In consideration of the lease of the lands mentioned in paragraph 1, the Company undertakes to pay rent at a rate of £050 sterling per annum j such rent to be paid in advance €very ten years, namely, the amount due to be paid to the Sheikh by drafts of the Company: such payment to be made through His Britan nic Majesty’s Consul at Moharamerah, in ^exchange for the receipt of the Sheikh. The first payment shall be made by the Company within three days of notice ^ being received by the Directors of the completion of this Agreement. (12) The Company on their own^ part agree not to engage, without the cognisance of the Sheikh, tribesmen for their work, or in any way to interfere in tribal matters. (13) The Company as lessees of these lands agree that all treasure-trove throughout the lands leased to the Company and other lands given under this Agreement, belongs to the Sheikh alone. By “ treasure-trove” is meant coins, jewellery and objects of antiquity. (14) '(Under Article 14 the Company bind themselves to employ only such guards and watchmen as the Sheikh or his representatives may select, and to comply, under certain con ditions, with the Sheikh’s demand for their dismissal.) (15) (Article 15 fixes the scale of pay ment of guards and watchmen.) (10) (Article 16 provides for the giving of one month's notice prior to leaving, on the part of the native employes, on pain of forfeit ing 15 days’ pay.) (17) (Article 17 governs the punishment of the Company’s native employes.) (18) This Agreement and all the Articles therein are accepted by the Sheikh and admit ted to be binding on himself and heirs and successors and on his tribesmen, whoever they may be. (19) This Agreement is considered to be in force from the date on which it is sigaed, from which date the Company become liable for the abovenamed rental. (20) (Article 20 governs the settlement of differences between the Sheikh or his rep resentative, and the Company or their rep resentative.) 10. {Vide paragraph 12 of the Memo- Kfirun irrigation con- VCindum f OV Jline IHUD.} cession. In view of the difiicul- ties which in Sir G. Barclay’s opinion might arise in the way of giving effect to the Sheikh's7f. [ 21 ] proposals as they stood, and, as it might prove inconvenient hereafter to have given too definite pledges to the Sheikh, it was decided that he should merely he informed that the British Government had taken note of his assurances both as regards the minor schemes and also in regard to the scheme for the construction of the Ahwaz dam, and that, when a suitable opportunity presented itself, they would give him their approval and support in applying for a concession for the construc tion of the dam. With reference to the Kerkha irrigation project, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was authorised to send Lieutenant Wilson’s report to Sir William Willcocks, who replied that the project seemed very easy and likely to prove remunerative. Sir William also gave instructions for certain preliminary work to be carried out by Lieutenant Wilson, and said that when this was completed he would visit the locality in October or Novem ber and then give his final opinion. 11. On the 18th March, the Government Increase in the salutes rec ® mI11 &gt; eri ded accorded, to the Sheikhs to His Majesty’s merahand B a h“ta am ' f^retary of State for India a proposal made by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to increase the salutes of five guns accorded to the Sheikhs of Mohammerah, Koweit and Bahrein. The Government of India expressed the opinion that, in consideration of the enhanced importance and prestige which these three Chiefs, especially the Sheikhs of Moham merah and Koweit, enjoyed owing to recent political developments in the Persian Gulf, a salute of five guns was no longer adequate. They agreed with Major Cox that a salute of 12 guns might appropriately be accorded to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammerah and one of 11 guns to the Sheikh of Bahrein. If these proposals were accepted, they recom mended, as suggested by Major Cox, that the eldest sons of the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit should receive a salute of five guns, and the eldest son of the Sheikh of Bahrein one of three guns, on the occasions when they visit one of His Majesty’s Ships as their fathers’ representatives. The Government of India were also of opinion that the increased salutes should, in each case, be personal to the present Chiefs, and that it should be explained to them that it was within the discretion of the Government of India to continue it, or not, to their successors. They further suggested that, should these proposals be sanctioned, it should be left to the discretion of the Political Resi dent, in consultation, if necessary, with His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, to decide when it would be opportune to make the announcement to the Sheikhs concerned.r ■ j m [ 22 ] On the 25tb June, His Majesty’s Secretary of State communicated the approval of Bis Majesty’s Government to the proposals. In concurring with the suggestion of the Govern ment of India to leave it to the discretion of the Political Kesident in the Persian Gulf to decide w r hen it would be opportune to make the announcement to the Sheikhs concerned, the Secretary of State for India considered it desir able that Major Cox should consult Sir G. Barclay, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, as to how far the proposal to in crease the salute of the Sheikh of Mohammerah was affected by the Sheikh’s position as a Persian subject. He asked to he furnished with a further report on the question in due course, as the Admiralty wished to be officially informed of the date when the arrangements came into force. The Naval Commander-in- Chief, East Indies Squadron, had been directed to instruct the Commanding Officers of His Majesty’s Ships in the Gulf to act on the above scale of salutes when requested to do so by the Political Itcsident. Major Cox was informed in the above terms on the 26th July and he was asked to submit a report of his proceedings in due course. 12. {Fide paragraph 22 of the Memo- Loan to the Sheikh of randum for May 1909.) Koweit The Sheikh of Koweit, in June last, expressed his gratitude for the grant of the loan and accepted the conditions attached thereto. 13. (Vide paragraph 15 of the Memo randum for June 1909.) Abu Musa red oxide. The Secretary of State intimated on the 1st July that the German Government had been informed that the mining operations complained of were for the extraction of a few hundred tons of oxide as a sample for a firm interested in the trade and “ had now ceased ”, that the German Embassy had enquired orally as to whether this meant that the oxide would not be shipped, and stated that, if this was not meant, the German Government protested against the shipment, and asked for it to be stopped. In reply, the Embassy was informed that the words in question meant that the mining operations had ceased, but not that the shipments had been stopped. The shipment, it was added, had presumably already taken place. The Secretary of State asked for a report on the facts of the case. On the 3rd July, the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf reported as follows On the 15th June, the steamship “Gulistan” arrived at Abu Musa and left on the ] 9th June, alter shipping as much of the specially mined sample oxide as the liesidency Agent had ^ tbeen able to transport to the beach, namely, about 428 tons. About 170 tons of the sam^ lot still lie at the mouth of the pit and will remain there. On receiving the Residency Agent’s report of the successful conclusion of shipment, Major Cox instructed him to dispose of trans port animals, cease operations and submit his final account. On the 6th July, the Secretary of State was informed accordingly. On the 16th June, Abdulla bin Hassan, one of the ex-concpssionaires, brought over in a dhow Haji Ali Germani and Messrs. Wonckhaus’s German representative, to the island. They landed and tried to engage the Residency Agent and Sheikh’s man in an altercation, but eventually returned to their dhow where they remained until loading oper ations had been completed on the 19th June. They set sail for Lingah on that date. On the 13th July, the Secretary of State informed the Government of India that, pending the settlement of the case, the German Government asked for an under taking that there should be no further mining. His Lordship added that the question of giving ^ pledge was under consideration, but that, in any case, the controversy had reached a stage at which no further operations could be allowed by us in practice, and asked that instructions might be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Major Cox was instructed accordingly on the 14th July. 14. (Vide paragraph 18 of the Jlfeyno- randum for June subject!

On the 27th June, the Political Death of the Chief of Resident in the Persian Gulf reported that Sheikh Zaeed bin Khalifa, the aged Sheikh of Abu Thabi, had died on the 19th May last, and that the succession had passed to his second son, Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zaeed. The latter wrote to Major Cox informing him of his assumption of the Chiefship and express ing his determination to maintain the close relations which have existed between his ancestors and the British Government.

Memorandum of information received during the month of August 1909, relating to affairs in Persia, and on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. [Note. —This memorandum ia based upon reports, the accuracy of which it ia not always possible to guarantee.] PERSIA. 1. (Vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum Situation in Persia. f On the deposition of the Shah, Muhammad Ali, the control of affairs in Persia was entrusted to a directory of twenty persons including the Sipahdar, Minister of War, the Sardar Assad, Minister of the Interior, Nasr-ul-Mulk, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, Minister of Finance, and Pirman Eirma, Minister of Justice. On the 26th July Sir E. Grey requested His Majesty’s Ambassador at Paris to convey to Nasr-ul-Mulk, who was still in Europe, though he had announced his acceptance of office, the earnest hope of His Majesty’s Gov ernment that he would enter on his duties with out delay. On the 30th July it was authorita tively announced that Colonel Liakhoff, Com manding the Cossack brigade, was relinquishing his post. On the 21st July Sir G. Barclay tele graphed that so far as he could judge by the reports he had received, a very good impression had been produced by the change of Rulers. Elections for the Assembly at Tehran, to be held under the new electoral law, were fixed for the 6th, 7th and 8th August. The new Persian Government issued a circular enjoining upon provincial assemblies the necessity for doing their utmost to calm down anti-Russian agitation. At the same time the Persian Minister at St. Petersburgh was directed to enquire whether Russia saw her way to withdrawing Russian troops located in Persian territory. He was informed in reply that this could not be done until it was clear that order had definitely been re-established. On the 6th August it was reported that a special tribunal, which had been constituted to deal with political offenders, had been dissolved, after ordering four executions. Excellent order was being maintained in Tehran. Meanwhile, the attention of the Persian Government was occupied with the question of the disposal of the ex-Shah. His Majesty’s continued presence in Persia was recognised by them and by the two Powers to be undesirable, as he formed a centre for intrigue and appeared to be encouraged by his adherents to believe that Russia would replace him on the throne, an i2 idea which His Majesty the Czar attempted to dispel in his reply to a telegram despatched to him by the ex-Shah shortly after his deposition. On the 24th July a deputation from the Nationalist Committee waited on the ex-Shah with a view to obtaining possession of the Crown jewels, and to offer him a pension of 25,000 tomans annually. No settlement, how ever, was arrived at. On the 3rd August, as the result^ of negotiations entered into by the two Legations with the ex-Shah and members of the Nationalist Committee, a protocol was signed by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, certain members of the Nationalist Committee and the dragomans of the Russian and British Legations, under which it was arranged that all jewels found, after enquiry by represent atives to the two Legations, to belong to the Crowm, and all documents relating thereto should be given up by the ex-Shah, who was to leave Tehran by the 17th August. In return the Persian Government offered to give him a pension of 75,000 tomans annually. On the 4th August the investigation referred to in the protocol was held, and, under great pressure, the ex-Shah handed over a large quantity of jewels which he had hitherto maintained to he his private property. On the 12th August Mr. O’Beirne reported that the Czar’s assent to the ex-Shah residing at Kieff was likely to be given next day, but that one difficulty in the way of his departure from Persia still existed in the debt of three million roubles owed by him to the Russian Bank. For this debt it appeared that the Shah’s private property was mortgaged to the Bank. The Russian Gov ernment wera unable to assent to the ex-Shah’s departure until the Persian Government should guarantee payment from the income of the ex-Shah’s estates in Azerbaijan. Meanwhile they were keeping a ship ready to convey him to Petrovsk. Early in July anti-Russian agitators at situation in Azerbaijan. j-abriz held a meeting at the principal mosque at which the boycott of Russian goods was advocated. The more respectable inhabitants did not attend and the meeting proved a failure. The Russian Government, however, regarded the situation as unsatisfactory, Sattar Khan having announced that he was to be made Governor-General and the agitation against the presence of Russian troops being continued. The Russian Charg6 d’Affaires at lehran was accordingly instructed to press on the Persian Government the necessity of sending immediately to Tabriz a Governor- General with troops, in default of which Russia would herself take action. On the 19th July the Turkish Ambassador at St. Peters- burgh stated that orders had been sent to the Turkish Consul-General at Tabriz that Sattar3 1 1 and Bagher Khan should no longer be afforded bast in the Turkish Consulate-General. On the 20th July it w as reported that Mukhber-es- Sultaneh, whose appointment would be very popular in Tabriz, was to be appointed Gov ernor, and two days later Sir G. Barclay joined with his Russian colleague in urging on the Persian Government the necessity of sending to Tabriz a Governor with a suitable escort. On the 25th July it was reported that the Turkish Consul-General had left Tabriz, but without Sattar and Bagher Khan who were being encouraged by the Nationalist Com mittee at Tehran to come to the capital. On the 29th July Mr. Wratislaw communicated the information that the Russian troops were considering the preparations necessary for a prolonged stay in Tabriz, but on the 7th August he stated that two companies of infantry and one field battery, in all 700 men, would shortly be withdrawn. Situation at Shiraz. {Vide paragraph 1 of Memorandum for July 1909.) Soulat- ed-Dowleh, the Kash- gai Chief, who insisted on the cancellation of the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh to the Governorship of Ears and who was actually on the move with a following of at least 2,000 men, was interviewed by Mr. Bill outside Shiraz and prevailed upon by him to agree to a halt of three days. Subsequently there was some improvements in the situation though some anxiety continued to be felt owing to the uncertainty as to who was to be appointed Governor of the province. As a result however of the strong opposition of the Kashgais, Ala-ed-Dowleh’s appointment was cancelled, and Ain-ed-Dowleh was announced to be the governor-designate. But, with the arrival of Taki Zadeh, Ain-ed-Dowleh’s appointment was revoked, and Saham-es- Sultaneh was nominated to the governorship of Ears. The new incumbent has hitherto only held minor governorships. The small reinforcement, which left Bushire on the night of the 25th July, arrived at Shiraz on the 2nd August. Their arrival was received quietly. Two sepoys succumb ed to heat apoplexy en route. Major Cox reported on the 7th August that the anxiety regarding Shiraz seemed to have passed for the present and that Mr. Bill was prepared to dispense with a portion of the reinforcements. Sir G. Barclay authorised the proposed reduction and hoped that the main body would be able to return on the arrival at Shiraz of the governor-designate. (Vide paragraph 1, page 10 of Memorandum for July 1909.) In reply to the telegram from the Government of India of the24th July, iustractions were received from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for troops to be held in readiness for despatch to the Persian Gulf in case of need. The measure was purely precautionary and no further action was to be taken without definite orders. Arrangements were made accordingly. On the 20th August His Majesty’s Consul, Kerman, reported that the Kawamis intended to overrun Kerman, Khorasan and Yezd. Pour days later Kafsinjan was hotly attacked by 800 robbers; the situation was most serious owing to the temper of the tribes being reckless and two telegraph employes, Messrs. Wright and James, were in grave danger, being in the midst of the fight ing. The former was captured on the 19th August by Arabs near Kamalabad, one of his escort being shot, but was released on the 22nd after being stripped. The brigands then left the vicinity moving towards Pars. On receipt of information regarding the serious situation in Kerman, the Secretary of State was informed on the 25th August 1909 that a force was ready to move at a moment’s notice and that instructions were awaited. But the danger to Kerman passed with the dis appearance of the robbers and subsequently comparative quiet was restored. The Secre tary of State replied that no troops from India would be required, as they would arrive too late to prevent a temporary raid of this nature. 2. (Vide paragraph 3 of Memorandum The Zil-es-Sultan, The Zil-es-Sultan, m spite of all the efforts of the British and Russian Ambassadors to dissuade him, left Vienna on his return journey to Persia on the 30th July 1909. The Constantinople Anjuman tele graphed to Samsam-es-Sultaneh urging upon him to frustrate any attempts of the Zil-es- Sultan to obtain the Regency in the place of the Azad-el-Mulk. The Russian Minister seemed to apprehend that, if the Zil-es- Sultan returned, the provisional Government might place him on the throne. He wrote to Sir G. Barclay to say that) such a selection “ would make the position of the Russian Minister for Foreign Affairs intolerable and might even jeopardise our accord”. Sir G. Barclay thought that, though it was not the most probable development, the selection of the Zil-es-Sultan could not altogether be excluded. No sooner, however, had he entered Persian territory, than he was stopped near Mangel by the Persian Government and subsequently taken in custody to Resht. His sons appealed to the British Minister to obtain his release, but Sir G. Barclay refused to intervene. A direct appeal was then made to His Majesty’s Government, and telegraphing on the 10th of August on behalf of his father, the Zil,Akbar Mirza, stated that, though the latest assurances regarding the Zil’s property were annulled by his return to Persia contrary to the advice of His Majesty’s Government, he believed that the older assurances, promising protection to his life, honour, and family should he remain loyal to the Shah, still held good, and he begged that, if this view of his w r as held by His Majesty’s Government, Sir G. Barclay might be instructed to help him to return to Europe safely. Sir E. Grey proposed to reply to this communication that, though His Majesty’s Government were dispensed from all guarantees when the Zil-es*Sultan returned to Persia against their advice, the British Government would do what they could to facilitate his exit to Europe. Sir G. Barclay who was again approached by the sons of the Zil -es-Sultan, though he was of opinion that the latter by neglect of the advice which had been given to him, had forfeited all claim to our intervention based on the assurances given by His Majesty’s Government, proposed to express to the Persian Government his hope that the Zil would be allowed to return in safety to Europe, and to ask his Russian colleague to join with him in the re presentation. 3. {Vide paragraph 5 of the Memo- Telegraph, lines in randum for July 1909.) 1&gt;er8ia - On the 2nd August 1909, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, reported to His Majesty’s Government that the new Persian Minister of Telegraphs had asked the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment to erect the second line from Tehran to Shahrud in the autumn. Sir G. Barclay suggested that a definite reply should be avoided as long as possible, in view of the connection between this and the question of the exchange of telegraph lines; and of the necessity of postponing the latter question until the Arabistan Convention had been sub mitted to the Persian Assembly. 4. ( Vide paragraph 6 of the Memoran- The Russian Bank in duM for July 1909.) Seistan. local Manager of the Imperial Bank has informed His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed that the question of the transfer to the Imperial Bank of Persia of the liabilities of the Russian Bank in Seistan has fallen through owdng to the departure of the former Manager of the Russian Bank; but that, should he return, it will possibly be re-opened. 5. {Vide paragraph 7 of the Memo* Proposed establish, randum for July and ment of a Customs paragraph 4 of the Bureau at Birjand. Memorandum for June Persian Customs Department6 have informed His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that, before definitely considering the question of a Customs Bureau at Birjand, they are desirous of seeing some further progress on the Palang Koh route, which, they say, is not generally open to traffic. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, has informed Sir G. Barclay that the Palang Koh route requires further work to make it a good road, but that it is now in general use, being up to the standard of other roads in that part of Persia and better than the Koh-i-Malik-Siah-Seistan road. 6. {Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo- The Russian Consular vandwiljor June 1909 Staff in Seistan. j) r Kosminsky has informed the Consul, Seistan, that the Russian Vice-Consulate in Seistan had been definitely and permanently extended to embrace Kain, which had consequently been separated from Turbat-i-Haidari. The Seistan appointment would, he said, remain a Vice-Consulate, but Baron Tcherkasoff, who had been appointed to hold it, would have the rank and status of Consul. Hr. Kosminsky added that neither be nor Dr. Otto had any powers, but the flag was being flown at his house as the records were there. Dr. Otto was himself uncertain as to his position, as he informed His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Seistan, that his one difficulty was now whether he w T as acting as Russian Vice-Consul or not. Baron Tcherkasolf arrived at Birjand on the 18th July 1909. 7. {Vide paragraph 6 of the Memo- Colonel von der randum for April Flaas, Russian Military 1909.) Colonel von Attache in Seistan. der Military Attachd in Seistan, has told His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul that he hopes to leave Seistan shortly to take up the command of a regiment in the Pamirs. It is also reported that Colonel von der Plaas is making enquiries regarding troops, arms, equipment, &amp;c., in the Perso-Afghan frontier districts. A long list of queries is apparently being confidentially circulated by Russian Agents and rewards offered for the necessary information. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul reports that the list seems hondjide and includes queries such as length of bayonet, weight of rifle, how repairs are effected and the locality of workshops, supply of uniforms, transport arrangements, &amp;c. 8. {Vide paragraph 8 of the Memo Seizure Of a Maskat July 1909.] dhow by the Italian On the 5th August, tin Bonad?/coast! ° n * he Eesident at Aden tele. graphed that the Italiar statement that the “local authorities” hac recognised the legality of the seizure, was incorrect. On the 11th the Secretary of State£6. 7 telegraphed the gist of the Italian statement of the case. The only fresh statement of facts were that the Sultan’s flag was not torn up and that the dhow-owner was released on condition that he signed a written decla ration that his rights in the vessel must be regarded as having lapsed, in the event of his not surrendering himself to the Italian authorities, and that the dhow would then become the absolute property of the Italian Government. The Italian note repeated the offer to release the dhow if the Sultan and the owner recognised the legality of the seizure, but took no notice of the statement that His Majesty’s Government would refrain from formulating a definite claim for compensation until they knew what action the Italian Gov ernment had taken. His Lordship enquired how the matter stood locally and stated that no reply would be sent to the note pending a reply from the Government of India. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was asked for a report. Later in the month a report was received from the Political Agent, Maskat, stating that another dhow had recently been seized by the Italian author ities and that the Sur dhow owners were very anxious about their vessels trading with the African coast. The owners intimated that they proposed to go in force to Maskat to ascertain what the real nature of the difficulty was, and that, if something was not done soon, they would take the law into their own hands and deal harshly with any dhows flying the Italian flag in Oman waters. The Political Agent was of opinion that the trouble would grow until something decisive happened. On the 24th August, the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf was asked to telegraph his views on the Italian statement. 9. {Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- it would be desirable to settle the question of the American dispensary at Mutrah before the arrival of an American, named Ray, who had been appointed Consul at Maskat. The Poli tical Resident, Persian Gulf, added that the Consul was being sent to settle the question, and that the Sultan should be informed as soon as possible whether or not His Majesty’s Government could support him in maintain ing the attitude he had taken up. On the 17th August, the Secretary of State was asked whether the desired assurance could be given. American Mission at the Political Agent,’ as at Maskat, reported that8 10. {Vide paragraph 16 of the Memo- Persian claim to ratidum for June sovereignty over 1909.) On the 13 th a rein ’ May, Sir G. Barclay addressed a note to the Persian Government informing them that His Majesty’s Govern ment had approved his action in accepting the amended note sent him by the Persian Government in January last {vide paragraph 16 of the Memorandum for March 1909), but that they maintained, as regards the status of Bahrainis in Persia, the attitude explained in Mr. Marling’s note, dated the 30th March 1908, viz., that the island of Bahrain and its inhabitants were considered to be under British protection. Sir G. Barclay added that His Majesty’s Government would be guided entirely by their own views of the position should any action of the Persian authorities make representations necessary. In forwarding a copy of this note to Sir E. Grey on the 4th June, Sir G. Barclay explained that, as the wording of the commu nication had been left to his discretion, he bad omitted the words “ His Majesty’s Govern ment cannot consider this arrangement as final ’ {vide paragr jph 17 of the Memorandum for April 191)9), as he thought that these words might provoke a reply and that the moment was inopportune for pressing the Bahrein question to an issue. His Majesty’s Government approved the terms of Sir G. Barclay’s note to the Persian Government. 11. {Vide paragraph 19 of the Memo- Kejd affairs. randum for June 1909.) JMejd continues in a state of turmoil owing to the quarrels of Ibn Saud and Ibn Sebhan, the guardian of Ibn Bashid, ^ rival claimants to the Emirlik of the Nejd. After the counter raids of Pebruary last {vide paragraph 18 of the Memorandum for April 1909), Ibn Saud returned to Biadh with a slight wound in his leg and caused rumours to be circulated among the tribes that he had subsequently died. Zamil-ibn-Sebhan, having heard this neAvs, concluded that there was no necessity for keeping any further a large force under arms, and disbanded a great part of his men. He then camped at the western frontier of Kassim, encouraging his rival to emerge from concealment at the head of a large force chiefly of the M/uteir tribe and Eassim people. Ihese made a raid against the Shammar and Harb tribes in Jebel Tai from which Ibn Saud returned with an enormous booty. On his way back, however, to Kassim he was confronted by Ibn Sebhan and his allies, and a fierce engagement ensued with considerable loss on both sides, while much of the booty was re-taken.. 9 12. In March last, the Political Resident Attempt by the in the 1 ersian Gulf re ported that the Sheikh of Koweit had pur chased certain property Turkish ^ w the Turkish authorities at Basrah to register the Sheikh of Koweit as a Turkish subject. in the Vilayat of Basrah and that the Turkis authorities at that place had refused to register the transfer of the land unless the Sheikh was described on the transfer papers as an Ottoman subject. Major Cox suggested that His Majesty’s Government should be moved to take steps to induce the Porte to discontinue this demand for the independent registration of Koweitis as Turkish subjects and to bring about an improvement in the attitude of the Vali of Basrah. On the 3rd July, the Government of India asked Major Cox whether the question was still acute, whether any further develop ments had occurred and whether he still considered it desirable to represent the matter to the Porte. It was thought possible that the appointment of a new Yali at Basrah, which had taken place in the meanwhile, had affected the position. On the 17th August, Major Cox replied that it did not seem necessary to make any representations to the Porte, as the Sheikh had come to an understanding with the newly- appointed Vali. 13. (Vide paragraph 14 of the Memo- randum for July 1909.) On the 20th August, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Britannic Majesty’s Murder of certain subjects of the Chief of Abu Thabi by residents of Taona. telegraphed to His „ „ Minister, Tehran, that the new Sheikh of Abu Thabi had refused to accept responsibility for the safe custody of the pirate on the grounds that the relations of the murdered men then in Abu Thabi would make trouble if the prisoner were not delivered into their hands. Ho was, therefore, for the time being left in the custody of the Political Agent, Bahrein. On hearing of the capture of their brother, the other two brothers fled to the mainland and the Sheikh of Charek promised to do his best to effect their apprehension. Major Cox, however, was doubtful of success and added that H. M.’s Ships would not be able to act again for some time. As the prisoner would, in all probability, be allowed to escape, as one brother did from Shiraz, if he were handed oyer to the local authorities, Major Cox asked His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, whether he saw any objec tion to the retention of the prisoner by the Political Agent, Bahrein, for the present.
