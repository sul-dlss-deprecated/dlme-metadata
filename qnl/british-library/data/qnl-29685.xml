The Count de Prorak accompanied by his wife and an Italian named Tuolli Pastori arrived in Muscat from Aden on 14th April. The latter, who is described on one of hispasspofts as a geologist, announced that the object of his visit was to recruit labourers for Eritrea. This was reported to the Sultan who refused to countenance any such idea, and Pastori left again for bunder Abbas on 21st April. It has since transpired that he was travelling with two passports as the one produced at Bunder Abbas in no way agreed [with the one produced at Muscat. Meanwhile the Count, who is a naturalised American subject though of mixed Polish and Hungarian origin, endeavoured to get permission to visit the interior of Muscat and Oman ostensibly representing an American Archaeological Society. The Sultan, however, who was incensed at not having received any advance information of the expedition, refused to grant hir an interview or to let him proceed into the interior. He and his wife, therefore, left for Bahrain on 29th April. Though the Count appeared to be a genuine archaeologist there are strong grounds for believing that both he and Pastorj were really connected with Italian Oil interests, this belief is substantiated by a report from Aden where their activitiesi.Z.590S/3?* iuxjia ocpics, *HIT3HAU., S.iSf.l l^-tb septeabor, 1837.

Dear Mr. Clauson, j- find your letter of July 28 awaiting me when I return after a few days absence. The position of de Prorok in regard to the Society is as was stated in my letter to the Foreign Office which you quote. He was at one time a Fellow.of the Society, but ceased in 19«32. I had not seen him for ten years when he called upon me about a fortnight ago. He then asked my advice whether to approach the British authorities or the representative of Saudi Arabia in regard to organizing an Aufgust 4th, 1937. expedition from Muscat territory. I had no hesitation in advising him to approach the India Office, who I thought at least would like to know what was in the wind, and I telephoned to Rumbold to make an appointment while de Prorok was with me. I think that is all I can usefully say. I made a few notes on my interview with him, but I expect that he^v/^v7 i * oJjijL N. X. D. 1449/37.

Assisted, by ur* Harrison of tne American Mission whose guest he was, Count Prorok made several attempts to obtain an interview with the Sultan, but His Highness, who was thoroughly incensed at no previous permission having been asked for or even a reference being made to him beforehand by the expedition, refused to see him or allow him to proceed anywhere into that part of the interior under his control, i*e. the Batijiah and near neighbourhood of Muscat and Matrah.

Soon after his arrival he began to make inquiries about obtaining a guide for the interior and gave out that he was prepared to pay some Rs.2000/- for a suitable man. He also mentioned that he was prepared to give £3-4000 as a present to vhe Sultan in return for being allowed to move about the country freely and pursue his archaeological investigations. It seems probable that the Counts real object in visiting Muscat is in connection with certain Italian Oil interests and this belief is supported by a telegram received from the Aden Government on 21st April in which they stated that Prorok and Pastor^s activities while in Aden had given rise to the same suspicion.Coni' iaent ial Buanire, tne 30tn June, 1^37• D.O »NQ&gt; 004-3 f'f \ Coula you please rei'er zo foreign OH ice letter no.

They had been sent on from the Royal Geographical Society, where they had made enquiries about the possibility of a journey into i Arabia. They said that their^object was to find out how they should set about obtaining permission for an archaeological exploration which, so far as I could make out, would be in an area somewhere to the south of Sharjah. They seemed extremely vague as to where exactly they wanted to go, but apparently their idea was to start in from the Trucial Coast. I explained that the Sheikhs in this area are in special relations with H.M.G., and that the proper way of enquiring about facilities for travel in that area v/ould be to write to the India Office explaining what they wanted to do. I said that, as they were probably Jr aware, is not a part of the world suitable for anybody except the most experienced travellers, and that in any case H.M.G., in view of their responsibilities, would have to considei the/ jr nrn mo-int d the ratter fron: the n om n+ , ' ^ ■ &lt;7 ■// There would also, of coarse, have to be consultation with the local authorities. I nromised, however, that any cormunication which they night send to the India Office would be treated with every sympathy and with as little delay as possible. They quoted you, of course, as an old friend, and they said that the Royal Geographical Society would be only too gls.d to give us'full information about them. I refrained from tellia them that we already had quite enough information without asking for any more. I have heard no more from them since their call (which was about a week ago), so perhaps they are not pursuing -heir idea. They also sj&amp;es'. to have in mind some scheme for travel in the adramaut, and they may have transferred ::eir attention to that. Incidentally, saw them the other day at Philby’s lecture at the Royal Central Asian Society about his trans-Arabian journey ending, ir. the “adramaut (about which Lady Fowle has no doubt told you - it was an amusing evening). I send you this line in case we may have to consult you, on the basis of an application from them, as to the best meais turning it down.

(SJctSd During the Italo-Abyssinian War, Count de PROROK was sus- of being concerned in gun-running activities in the Red Sea. Secret information received about that time suggested that the French suspected de PROROK of being an Italian agent and that the Italians suspected him of being a British agent. On 9.2.37 a certain Colonel N. KORDASHEVSKI of Jerusalem, was in touch with the Count,who was then at 32, Sharia Antikhana Cairo, regarding a proposed trip to discover a hidden city in Arabia, apparently Sheba. According to available information from Palestine, this KORDASHKVSKI claims to have participated in a number of adventurous expeditions, including the ROERICH expedition to Tibet in 1927/28. The India General Staff Summary of Intelligence for the week ending 29.5.28 shows that a Colonel KORDASHEVSKI did in fact accompany the Roerich Expedi tion. He carried letters from General Knox to the effect that his sympathies were pro-British. De Prorok and his wife left for Karachi by the s.s.'Volpi” on 3.4.37, the latter stating that she was proceeding to the Deccan. They were accompanied by Tullio PASTORI and took with them a car and a Dodge truck with a body specially adapted for desert work. Prior to their departure from Aden, de Prorok and Pastori confided to a reliable source that it was their in tention to meet friends at Muscat and to make arrangements to penetrate Rub* al Khali in the autumn, where they intended to search for traces of an ancient civilization. As regards Tullio PASTQRI . he is an Italian trader of about 50 years of age, who' has spent the last 20 years 'living rough' in Eritrea, Abyssinia and the Sudan. He at one time became bankrupt in Eritrea and got into disfavour with the Italian authorities who refused him an Italian passport and re-admis sion into Eritrea. On another occasion, however, he crossed the Sudan border and visited Tessenei, where he was entertained by Italian officers. More recently, whilst in Aden, he was apparently refused permission to visit Addis Ababa. During their stay(from 8.4.37 to 11.4.37) in Karachi, the de Proroks and Pastori did not come to unfavourable notice. They gave out that they were archaeologists. Their passport particulars were as follows: Count Bvron Khun de PROROK: American passport No. 535, issued in Paris, 11.9.36., visa No. 274 issued Aden 3.4.37. Wife* British passport C/31921, issued Paris, 20.11.36., valid for B.E. aged 25. b. Horseforth, England. Tullio PASTORI. Passport No. 389726, issued Bucekhrest, 28.3.34. (Italian). Visa No. 5. issued Aden, 2.4.37. b. Padua, Italy, aged 52.Could you please refer to correspondence ending with my Express Letter No*c/100, dated the 28th April, 1937, on the subject of L*affaire Prorok. ^ 2* Watts and I had an amusing time during their stay here* As you may have guessed the Sultan f s refusal to let P- travel in his dominions for 'archaeological' investigations was not entirely unconnected with certain subterranean activities emanating from the Agency. Most fortunately P- played into our hands all along by annoying the Sultan etc. He (P-) may be a good archaeologist, but he f 8 a very indifferent oil-agent - not in the same class for instance as the redoubt able prank Holmes. - Even so it was rather a near thing and we breathed a sigh of relief *hen the B.I. mail carrying P- and his countess finally sailed out of Muscat harbour. 3. Personal relations between Watts and myself and the Prorcks were most amiable. This desirable state of affairs was made easier by the fact that our activities already referred were (l think) sufficiently 'under cover' to have escaped their notice, and that - apart frcm their suspected oil connection - the Proroks are a pleasant and intelligent couple, the countess herself being distinctly attractive. They spent not a little of their time in Muscat on the Agency terrace consuming Watts* beer, and pewiring into our sympathetic ears the tale of their troubles. Considering the part that M.J.Clauson Esquire, The India Office, London* *- /W- and I had played in these troubles we felt every now and then a twinge of conscience* However, all is fair in Love, War end presumably Oil* We parted from them with mutual protestations of esteem and regard, and hopes of another meeting in Paris, where they have their headquarters, London, or elsewhere. 4* If only political life in the Gulf were all drinking beer on terraces and conversing with attractive Countesses how easily one would earn one's pay* « I am sending copies of this letter to Reilly, Hay&gt; Watts, Hickinbotham and Stewart (at Kuwait)* _ c ( ' c - ♦ sent under Printed letter No.c/l02 of 29th April 1937.oonl'ldential.

My dear Sir Percy: I see by an International News Service press dispatch dated Pebruary 20th that Count Byron de Prorok Is now on his way to search for the 'long lost capital of the Queen of Sheba** somewhere to the East of Sana. As you know this is one of the most important archaeological problems of the Near East and one which deservea the most careful and delicate handling in view of the local political situation. According to this dispatch 'members of the 'I’rocadero Museum of Paris, which is sponsoring the expedition, will accompany de Prorok'. I have written to Dr. P. Rivet at the Trocadero as I am confident that this is inaccurate in view of his bad reputation on French soil. You will no doubt recall that the 'Count** has posed as a Fellow of the Royal Geographic Society and that hie last expedition was said to be sponsored by the Royal Italian Geographical Society which was earnestly denied by their President. I am sure you will agree with me that everything should be done to prevent this charlatan from doing any damage which will prejudice the local governments against further scientific exploration or archaeological investigation \ and I should be very glad if you would investigate the matter and request the Foreign Office and Air Ministry to act as they see fit in this matter. I am perfectly prepared to have you quote/ Sir Percy Cox, President, Royal Geographical Society, Kensington Gore, London, England.quote me in confidence to the Foreign Office or to the Air Ministry, hut I naturally rely on you to treat this letter in confidence. With all good wishes, Youra sincerely, (3d) IffiHRY FISLD.COPY (L 266/265/406) ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE, 62, Upper Bedford Place, London, W.C.I. 11th January, 1934. 31r # The &amp;&amp;yptian Gaaette of (about) December 14th, 1953, contained an article describing 11 one of the largest scientific expeditions of recent years”. The party is said to be under the leadership of Count Byron de Prorok, P.R.G.S., and 'under the auspices of the International Anthropological Institutes of the British, French, Italian, Egyptian and Ethiopian Governments.' Among other things, the expedition Intends to search for the body of Alexander the Great and King Solomon’s Hines, and will also seek proof of the Atlantean theory of the origin of man.” I should like to say that the sol-diaant Count Prorok has no connection whatsoever with this Institute. His expedition has received no support from us. We are informed by French Anthropologists that Count Prorok is not a Count and that his name is Cohn, not Prorok. We are of opinion that the Sudan Government should be advised to keep a close watch on this man’s movements and that he should be prevented from excavating and collecting surface material. The article in The Egyptian Gazette states that the expedition will proceed from the Sudan into Abyssinia to/ The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.to Investigate 'the strange Dolmens', and suggests that it will observe the slave trade which 'rumour insists' is still in existence. It is added that in nearby Somaliland the expedition will have an opportunity also of observing the effects of 'the hashish trade, also said to flourish through secret channels,' It is not for me to comment upon some of these statements, but I should like to be permitted to say that as a scientific Institute we view with grave concern the harm that may be done in Abyssinia by incompetent handling of the megaliths. rWe venture to hope that it may be possible to inform the Abyssinian Government, through the British Minister, that this expedition is not, in any way, connected with this Institute, I have, etc*, (3d) Edwin W.

His Majesty's Minister at Addis Ababa was also informed of the facts by telegraph and instructed to inform the Ethiopian Government unofficially that Mr. de Prorok has no connexion with either the Royal Geographical Society or the Royal Anthropological Institute. 3.
