Bahrain consists of a group of small low-lying islands situated half-way down the Persian Gulf some 20 miles off the eastern coast of Arabia. The largest island which is known as Bahrain Island. Muharraq Island, the next in size, has an area of only 5 square miles. The two chief towns are Manamah in Bahrain Island, and Muharraq in Muharraq Island. The total population is about 100,000 persons including 16,000 foreigners Bahrain has a good water supply. There are nearly 200 fresh water springs in the island, and many artesian wells have been dug by cultivators. Communications . There are about 120 miles of roads bjit no canals, rivers or railways. Vehicles registered with the Traffic Department of the Bahrain State Police on 31st March, 1949: Taxis 124 Taxi buses 52 Taxi lorries 44 Private cars 355 Private lorries, station wagons, pick-ups, etc. 420 Private buses 43 Special type vehicles 63 Tractors 65 Motor Cycles 68 Total 1234 Bahrain is in telegraphic communication with other countries and telephonic communication with the United Kingdom. The island has an automatic telephone system with about 300 subs cribers. Bahrain is an airport for the B.O.A.C. and other ser vices . B.I. steamers call on their way to Bombay and Basra. Bahrain has a British Post Office. Agriculture. About a twentieth part of Bahrain Island is cultivated; dates (about 4,000 tons a year), citrus fruits, and lucerne are the chief crops. There are a few cattle, goats, camels, donkeys and poultry, but no bees. Meat on the hoof is smuggled across from Persia. Fishing . Fish used to be the staple diet of the poor but of late years it has been in short supply possibly because of diversion of labour to the oil fields. IndustriesI (i) Petroleum. In 1932 petroleum was discovered by the Bahrain Petro leum Company. Its production is now the only big industry in the islands. In 1948 the Bahrain Refinery handled 10,914,905 net barrels of Bahrain Crude Oil and 43,959,101 barrels of Arabian Crude. A total of 50,121,969 barrels of refined oil was exported including 103,497 barrels of aviation gasoline imported partly from the United States of America and partly from Abadan. The Company pays royalty at a basic royalty rate of Rs.3/8 per ton. In 1948 royalties totalled Rs.48,74,829/13/9. Two-thirds of the oil royalties go to the Bahrain Government and one-third to the private purse of the Shaikh. (ii) Pearling. Bahrain formerly subsisted exclusively on the pearl the trade trade but/primarily from the loss of the Indian market although the advent of the cultured pearl and the drain of labour to the oil fields have both helped to depress the trade. (ill) Minor Industries. Minor industries are boat building, the manufacture of sailcloth and reed mats. Labour. A strong demand for labour from oil companies, shipping companies, building contractors and others keeps wages high for all classes of labour. There is an unsatisfied demand for skilled labour among the oil companies including those on the mainland and a hitherto insatiable demand for Arab clerks. Most of the existing clerical labour is imported from India and Pakistan. Trade . Bahrain has a flourishing &gt; entrepot trade Chief Imports (1946-1947)« Rice * Bs. 3,682,420 Wheat N Rs. 5,196.490 Flour Rs. 41,960 Mixed grains Rs. 1,342,800 Coffee Rs. 1,849,240 Dates Rs. 1,078,740 Sugar Rs. 947,580 Tea Rs. 1,354,330 Cotton plecegoods Rs. 3,231,060 Woollen plecegoods Rs. 913,440 Cigarettes Rs. 1,380,680 Chief Exports (excluding oil shipments) (1946-1947)* Pearls Rs. 676,290 Sugar Rs. 931,020 Tea Rs. 1,310 890 Rice Rs. ... ,374,440 Wheat Rs. 2,276,390 Barley Ss. 32,680 Cotton piecegoods 8s. 910,970 Banking■M ■■■ 3 Ranking . There are two banks, the Eastern Bank Ltd. and the British Bank of Iran and the Middle East, both with offices in Manamah town. Hitherto the Bahrain Government seem to have been haunted by a future when the oil supplies of the island will be all exhausted. The fact that these supplies now promise to last longer than was originally anticipated gives the Bahrain Government breathing space during which it may be relied on to continue the steady amelioration and development that has earned it the praise of being the best administered State in the Gulf. If, when the oil runs out, Bahrain will be thrown entirely on its own resources it is manifestly unwise for the Government to launch out into extravagant projects that may eventually be unable to maintain. Its resources are not unlimited and its future is uncertain so that its best policy would seem to be an advance on lines that will make it fitter to be as self-supporting as possible by the time the oil windfall ceases. Finances* In the 1934 the total revenue was Rs.726.560 and total expenditure Rs.730,800. In 1948 revenue had risen to Rs.10,329,552 and expenditure to Rs.7,547,896. By conservative budgeting the State has now reached a position where it has over Rs.267 lacs in the Reserve Fund, in cash, and in capital works, including revenue-producing schemes. In 1946 the Bahrain Government was informed that the Bahrain oilfield was estimated to last for another 50 years and it was adtised to adopt a more liberal financial policy. Agricultur e(and water resourcs&amp;l- The Shaikh has often been warned that the unrestricted digging of wells and waste of water constituted a serious threat to the cultivated areas and the water resources of the island and at the suggestion of the oil company a water con servation committee has been set up including one or two geo logical exuerts from the Company. This committee examines all applications for the drilling of new wells. The source of Bahreini underground water supply appears to be rainfall on the Najd plateau. The supplies should be adequate for all purposes if properly regulated. In March 1949 Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office, visited Bahrain and expressed the opinion that because tow of the limited local scope Bahrain should concentrate on intensive and highly-paying crops of which a number were already grown in small quantities on the island. The number of livestock was limited by the amount of fodder available but he recommended the founding of a small dairy herd. The Government already has a small experimental farm. Fisheries . The possibility of increasing catches by trawling in local waters are not bright and the cost of fitting up a re frigerated ship for work outside the Gulf is considered prohibitive.4 Manaraah pier * § There have been two extensions of Manamah pier, the first in 1939, the second began in 1946 and completed in 1947, on land reclaimed from the sea. The pier now goes out into deeper water and so gives room for the erection of new Customs sheds replacing the former sheds in the SJanamah bazaar. The only unloading equipment is an ancient hand crane though a 10 ton r, 0Iniths ,, shunting crane is on order. The fact that Bahrain is not a harbour but an open roadstead and that cargo from ships must be brought to the pier by lighters or launches presents opportunities for* much pil ferage of cargo. Manamah - huharraa Causeway. This is the most important public work to be under taken by the Bahrain Government. It includes a swing bridge that is opened twice a day for launches and other craft to pass free of charge between Sitra and Manamah. At other times a toll is charged for opening the bridge. The causeway ensures direct road communication with the Muharraq aerodrome. Hoads . Most of the 120 miles of roads in Muharraq and Manamah are unmetalled but the roads between Muharraq and Manamah and Manamah and the oil camp at Awali and the oil port at Sjtra are in good condition. The Government has a considerable building programme on hand as have many private firms. It can be assumed that the face of Manamah will change much during the next few years. Big business firms are rebuilding their premises and there arelarge residential developments in many districts. Doubtless however it will never be possible to sweep away entirely the native reed huts that are dotted about the towns and islands. Electricity. The electrification of Manamah town was begun in 1927 and the power house opened in 1929. In 1930 the supply of electricity was extended to Muharraq town. Increase in demand has always outstripped the supply but the Government now seems to be well on its way to coping with the situation.

Pear Sir Rupert, V f J As was explained in the covering note the report sent to the Residency under No.C/R-359 of August 29 was very hastily contrived. 2. Row that I have had a little time for reflection it occurs to me that we might reasonably press for very much more attention to be given to agricultural develop ment in the Gulf and this from two points of view (1) world food and population (which is attracting so much international attention at the moment) and (2) finding suitable outlets for the expenditure of oil royalti (which was the burden of Weight*s recent report). 3. Reading again Sir Herbert Stewart*s report with these two points in view I was much struck by the ap parently undeveloped agricultural possibilities of Bahrain of Y/hich he mentions Para 15 (ii) appreciable volume of water that flows into the sea unused 28 high variety of profitable crops available for extended cultivation 31 possibilities of improving milking ca pacities of cows 52 desirability of acquiring expert services. These are comments that struck me in reading but I have no doubt that if one went through the report with an eye to picking out all the possibilities one would find very much more to quote. 4. His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., » Political Resident, Persian Gulf, -&gt; S&gt; t? o xi c ^ 2 Bahrein.2 4. It has also struck me while walking in the island that it might be possible to do something in the way of soil reclamation. For instance to the east of Jufair, leading into the Khor al Kab, is a salty marsh surrounded by date-gardens. Fresh water runs into the marsh unused and my inexpert eye tends to see reclamation possibilities there. Perhaps other marshes might also be reclaimed. The trouble seems to be that no-one with the requisite knowledge has ever got down to the task of undertaking serious local agricultural development. 5. If I may for a moment step outside my brief I should say that the same applies to the rest of the Gulf. Sir Herbert Stewart’s references to Kuwait, Qatar, Trucial Coast and Muscat (and the soil of Bahrain) are necessarily scrappy. But if dust-bowl conditions exist in Kuwait could not soli erosion be stopped there by planting suitable grasses as has been done in the United States? Qatar looks an arid land but now that money Is to flow there the agricultural possibilities ought to be explored and If possible developed. Si milarly for the Trucial Coast and Muscat. 6. It looks to me as if a start ought to be made by the employment by the Bahrein Government of a full time British agricultural expert (query: Hills of the P.W.D. who according to Sir Herbert Is basically a gra duate in agriculture of Cambridge?)I A »(THIS DOCUMidT lb THi, i-^Ori^iTY OF HIS BHITAHHIC MAJESTY'S GOVEHHMENT) CQHFIDEuTIiiL k.x,.

It was communic ated to the State Department, who expressed full agreement with it, and who subsequently transmitted it to the recent conference in Istanbul of Lnitea States heads of Missions in the kiddle East. (signed) T.E. EVANS M.M. du MERTON CABINET OFFICE, S.W.l. 8 th December, 1949.The Social ana Internal Political Implications of Economic Development in the i^iadle uast. Our primary aim in promoting economic development in the kiddle mast is to raise the standard of living of the masses of tne people. This is of the utmost importance, both from the humanitarian point of view and also in order to ensure internal political stability, which is the only effective bulwark against the threats of Communism or Fascism. hconomic development, as such, is thus a means to an end rather than an end in itself. 2 # On the other hand, economic development along sound lines is the essential basis for social progress and political stability. Without it the countries of the kiddle mast cannot, generally speaking, become capable of affording the cost of social development. 3. The middle mast Governments are, in general, enthusiastic about the idea of undertaking development projects. They ao not, however, appear fully to realise that such projects cannot in themselves provide social and political stability. It will be essential to ensure (a) that wealth resulting from the projects is equitably distributed ana used to the advantage of the whole community and (b) that tne financial resources of the State are not unduly deployed on economic development, thus leaving no resources available for expenditure on social progress while the projects are being carried out. Failure to meet requirements (a) and (b) might well be to increase existing social inequality and discontent. Moreover, unless the application 01 modern scientific and engineering methods zo the exploitation of a country f s /resources© resources is accompanied by the development of a 'modern'’ mentality and consciousness in that country, it may largely defeat its own ena. The projects involved will be improperly or not fully utilised ana inadequately maintained. Finally, the impact of Western scientific materialism unaccompanied by Western idealism, on conservative and ignorant peoples, may have a powerfully disintegrating effect, ana serve to foment social disorder. 4. For these reasons, it is of the utmost importance that economic development projects in the Middle East should be accompanied by comprehensive measures of social development and reform - ana these in their turn will be the essential background for political development. Expenditure on development projects (which are expected to yield financial returns) and on social services (which cannot, of course, yield any material returns) must be carefully balanced, and if necessary the pace of economic development must be slowed down in order to provide for social development. The latter will comprise: (a) Land tenure reform 5 (b) Fiscal reform, involving more equitable taxation 5 (c) .administrative reform - improvement of central and local Government services; (d) Improvement of health services; (e) development of education; (f) introduction of progressive labour policies; (g) development of social insurance; (h) development of co-operation; (i) development of public utilities and social amenities - electricity, housing etc. /55. These various aspects oi social development will have, in their turn, to be carefully balanced as part of an overall programme. It will, for instance, be unwise to embark on a complex system of social insurance (as is proposed in the nebanon) without some measure of administrative reform to ensure its effective execution. The development of social amenities may not succeed in allaying social aiscontent unless accompaniea by an enlightened labour policy (compare the work in both these directions of the Oil Companies in Persia and Iraq). Moreover, since the social problems of no two countries in the Middle Mast are the same, the emphasis which it is desirable to place on the various aspects of social development will differ from country to country. In Mgypt for instance, where the outstanding social problem is that of over-population, the improvement of health services,may merely aggravate an already serious situation. In Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, the outstanding need is probably to establish the basis of a modern fiscal and administrative system, since without these, social policies cannot be put into effect. 6 . In all these countries, however, education may be considered to be the key to social and political progress. Without it, all reforms ana all development will be based on an unsound foundation, since they will be imposed on uncomprehending and inarticulate people. With it, the active and intelligent co-operation of the people in their own development will in the long run be assured. education will enable the nrab world to overcome its sense of Inferiority towards the Western worla, to assimilate the benefits which that world has to offer, and to reject its disintegrating /influencesinfluences. It may even prove to be the one satisfactory long-oerm solution to i^gypt^ over-population problems. The pace and scope of educational development will, however have to be carefully regulated, since were it greatly to outstrip other aspects of social progress, the result would again be mass uisccntent. It is also most importat that the development of education should be related to the general plan ol economic and social development, and that the right balance should be struck between primary, rural, technical and nigher education. Broadly speaking what Middle mast countries need most for successful development are a few good statesmen and a lot of good foremen. The present educational systems are producing neitLei, but only a mass ol second rate lawyers and politicians. 7. An outstanding opportunity for promoting social uevelopment in the Middle East is offered by the proposed large-scale development of 'new' areas, e.g. the Jezira area in Syria and Iraq, the irrigable areas in Iraq' and in the Jordan valley, and possibly certain parts of Persia. In the Sudan, a system of tripartite organisation, involving a corporate venture on the part of Governments, tenant farmers and commercial interests, has been adopted in such areas with outstanding success. In this way the tenants may be gradually educated in modern techniques and enabled, in due course, to tame over the management themselves. The establishment of such organisations in the new areas would not only ensure their sound development but would probably also provide a great stimulus to social progress in other areas of the countries concerned.8 . I'he following are the ways in which His Majesty f s Government can promote social development in the Middle riast: (a) By the offer of advice through the British Middle East Office and the British advisers employed by the Governments concerned (we are now hoping to increase the number of such advisers by a policy of loaning officials in cases where the Governments cannot pay adequate salaries). (b) By the example set by the social and labour policies of British Companies &gt;(in particular the Oil Companies); (c) By the example set by the administrations of Cyprus, iiden and the budan (The former is being increasingly visited by Middle East authorities to inspect e.g. co-operativ development, malaria control and forestry training). (d) By promoting the provision of education by (i) British private schools; (ii) the nritish Council, and (iii) the supply of British teachers to non-British schools in the kiddle i^ast. (Considerable numbers are employed in Iraq and mgypt). (e) By attaching when possible suitable conditions - e. fa . regarding fiscal and administrative reform - to any loans for development which we may make. (f) By co-operating fully in the work which W.H. 0., E.a.G. , I.L.O. , ana U.h.E.S.C.O. are doing to promote social development in the Middle jiast. 9. indicated in paragraph 4 above, social reform is the background to political development, and it may well provide the impetus for such development. Social and polit ical reforms, introduced too quickly or too drastically, might well prove explosive. It is tnerefore essential that progress should be cautious and should follow the lines of genuine organic growth.BATtRArX RECEIPT.

(Signed) T. E. EVANS M. M. du MERTON. CABINET OFFICE, S.W.1. 19th December. 1949 .(9 THE PERSIAN GULF STATES I. INTRODUCTION : POLITICAL STATUS OP THE PERSIAN GULF STATES 1. With the exception of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, which is an entirely independent State-, the Persian Gulf states are considered to be under the protection of Kis Majesty 1 s Government, who are responsible for the.conduct of their foreign relations but are not directly responsible for their internal affairs. In Muscat His Majesty's Government enjoy considerable influence by reason of their long association with the Sultanate, II* gSSCRIPTIOU OP THE PERSIAN gulf STATES 2, (aN Muscat . The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman consists of the main 'body of the State lying around the Hajar range in the South-East corner of Arabia, and of two appendages - the coastal plain of Dhufar and the port of Gwadur. on the Makran coast. The only towns of any size are the ports of Muscat, Matrah and GWadur, and of these Matrah, v/hich is 'the largest,- contains only 9 &gt;000 inhabitants. The main occupations of the.. State are fishing and agriculture. The Muscat fisheries (comprising sardines, tunny fish, sharks, etc.,) are among the .richest of their kind in the. world. In 1947 Dr. G.L. Bertram of St. Johns College, Cambridge, carried out a survey of the • fisheries for the Sultan. He estimated the present annual catch to be about 100,000 tons,' of v/hich about 40,000 are exported, and recommended that the. fisheries couldbo developed along modern lines by eliminating present v/asteful methods of- use and establishing modern methods of preservation and of utilization of by-products. Captain Charles Kendall .and Partners, who are employed by the Sultan of Muscat as his •purchasing agents, are now considering the possibility of forming a company with local participation and of obtaining a concosaion from the Sultan for the development of the fisheries, 3* Apart trom fish, the State’s economic resources are slight. There are certain possibilities of agricultural development which have been and are being surveyed for the Sultan by Mr. Hartley, Director of Agriculture in Aden, involving expanded irrigation, improvement of date cultivation and introduction of new crops such as sugar. Muscat also possesses, in the province of Dhufar, mineral resources of limestone,- • gypsum, talc and lead, and Sir Cyril Fox, formerly the director of the Geological Survey of India, who surveyed the proyince for the Sultan in 1947, -considered that it might be possible to utilise these resources for the' development of a chemical- industry. There arc also very small and hitherto unexploited coal deposits at 3ur. \ 4* So far, oil has not been discovered in Muscat. Petroleum Concessions, Limited, one of the I.P.G. Group of companies, have recently completed a geological survey of Dhufar, and are anxious to begin operations in the South Coast of Oman, v/hich is, however, at present politically unsafe for penetration. Unless- and until oil is discovered or the fisheries can be- exploited on an important scale, Muscat will lack the.financial resources for development, and its economy will remain' a po.or and primitive one. ' \ 5. .(b) B ah rein This State consists of a gfcoup. of small low-lying islands situated half-way down the Persian Gulf, some • • 20 - ; .20 miles off the Eastern coast of Arabia* The total, population is about 100,000. The State formerly subsisted almost entirely on its entrepot trade and on its pearling industry, which today is moribund. Apart from oil (see below), the State possesses no economic resources* About one-twentieth of its area is cultivated under irrigation, and recommendations for intensifying and improving the State*s agriculture have recently been made by Sir Herbert Stewart, Agricultural Adviser to the British Middle East Office* 6 . In 1932 oil was discovered and is now being exploited by the American—owned Bahrein Petroleum Company* tfro-uction is at present^static at .about 1.5 million tons per c.nnum, and it is estimated that the present proven reserve will be exhausted m about 50 years. The Bahrein rermery handles a throughput of ^about tons of crude oil per annum, of which 5j3 mil lion tons is imported from Saudi Arabia* 7# For the past 14 years Bahrein has received oil royalties a.mounting to about £ 250,000 per annum, which were increased in 1948 to £ 365,000 per annum and which will probably now be further increased as a result of the current oil' royalty negotiations. These royalties o.ccount for-nearly half ol the State*s revenue, the balance being derived mainly from customs duties. For over 20 years the State has been administered by Mr. Carol Belgrave, the Sheikh*s British adviser, and under his sound guidance it has become probably the best administered non-British State in the Middle East. Haunted by the prospect of the exhaustion of the oil reserves, the Sheikh and Mr. Belgrave have agreed in pursuing a conservative financial policy. The oil royalty income (apart from the Sheikh*s share which is one-third of the total) has boon allocated partly to ca.pita .1 expenditure on revenue- producing schemes and partly to a reserve fund which now amounts to about £1 million. This fund is invested mainly in Government of India securities on which a return- of 2-g to 3$ is received. The Government of India have so far refused permission to the Bahrein Government to sell these securities* 8 . Although under Mr. Belgrave*s administration much development of public amenities - schools, hospitals, roads, electricity, telephones, etc. - has already taken place, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf considers that there is considerable scope for further development to improve the amenities and social conditions in the State, and.that such development could absorb the oil royalty revenues' for soma years to come. m * 4 . This State is situated at the North West corner or the Gulf, and consists of a waterless desert which is roughly a square of 90 miles in each direction. The total population is estimated at about 150.000. of which 70,000 live in the town of Kuweit. Apart from oil (see below;,^the State’s cc^n^my is based upon its entrepot trade and ship-building industry. It is the natural port of North- East Arabia and trans-shipment port for the produce of the smaller Gull ports pnd of India, Kuweit is famous throughout the Gulf for the ship-building of native craft (dhows), for which the timber is imported from the Malabar coast. Owingdevelopment 01 water resources&gt; which may be possible on a small scale, and fishery development which might be undertaken in conjunction with the Muscat fisheries. lllt utilization OF OIL ROYALTIES 14«* ^From tne above brief description of the economic situation in., each of the Persian Gulf States, it will be seen that an unusual and. remarkable problem is presented. In these States (except to a limited degree in Muscat) there are virtually no possibilities for any major long-term development of natural resources, other than oil where it exists and development of oil does not require artificial stimulation. The lines of development can therefore only lie in the provision of public amenities, the improvement of social conditions and certain very limited agricultural improvements. Yet three of these states - Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar - are earning, or are-about to-earn, sterling and dollar revenues on-a scale out .of .all proportion to their current needs for financing d.eveloprfient on chese lines. In the Trucial Sheikd.oms, there is a reasonable prospect that oil will be discovered. There is, perhaps a certain irony.in the fact that in the last state. Muscat, which is the only state that pc^soescs- --dsounces that might be capable of reasonable, development (fishing, agriculture'and minerals) no oil has yet been found and the. .prospects of finding it are considered uncertain* rin ,. ion .J° th ? 611 royalty revenues which are pap. to tne Sheikhs, the oil companies are expending large Bah ^ in I K » weit and-Qatar. A condition^ infldtion m^y thus develop, in these states, and the time ^ S ,?r^5 1 L n0W come when v/ ov.ld be advisable for the Sheikhs (if they could be persuaded to do so) to introduce taxation - direct or indirect - in order to mop up excessive purchasing power. Such a policy would., however, lncrea.se tne already surplus. Government revenues. 4 d’he outstanding problem intho Persian Gulf States is therefore that of investing wisely the surplus revenues of those States which possess oil resources. The.first charge on those revenues must obviously be the development of the° States themselves on the linos indicated above. Such development will Involve: (a) revenue producing capital development projects - e.g. power stations, harbours, etc., and (b) non-revenue producing capital development projects - e.g. schools, hospitals, etc. As regards (b), It has been ^ g f e ^ tGd o? y .^ e Treasury representative in the Middle East that 'the Sheikhs concerned should be encouraged to pursue a policy of ^ endowment, involving the investment of a capital Government securities to produce an income cover the estimated annual recurring• expenses the . iT } s 3 ltlvclol }g concerned. Such capital sums would be allocate'., to specific objects and schemes and administered by a Trust. ^ 17^ No attempt has exactitude the extent to States can be wisely rV.r so far been made to assess with any which the oil revenues of these - - _ ted to local development. It is clear, however, that Kuweit and Qatar at any rate will, during dispose of’ a' larger* revenue than that the next few yc- requiredrequired to finance development programmes conceived on sound lines and adapted to their needs. The possibility therefore arises of securing the investment of these funds in some way which would utilize them for development in other Middle East countries where great resources exist but funds to exploit them are lacking - e*g. Syria, Jordan and possibly the development of the Muscat fisheries. This suggestion has been informally put to the Sheikh of Bahrein by Mr, Belgrave, his British adviser. The Sheikh has indicated that he might agree to invest his reserve (if he can succeed in selling out his Government of India securities) in some form of Middle East Development Corporation, provided such a Corporation had the support, if not the guarantee, of the British Government, In the case of Kuweit it is considered that it would at present be premature to make a similar suggestion to the Sheikh but it is hoped that the Financial and Commercial Secretary, who is shortly to be appointed to the Residency at Bahrein, will be able to influence the Sheikh to adopt a sound financial policy and in due course to raise the question of the investment of his surplus revenues with him. In the case of Qatar, the approach to the Sheikh will similarly have to wait until his British Adviser has been appointed and has established his position in the State, IV. RECOMMENDATION S (a) We should exert our influence to tho fullest possible extent to persuade rulers of the states which have, or shortly will have, substantial oil revenues - i.e, Bahrein, Kuweit and Qatar to conserve their surplus incomes wisely until plana for the sound utilization of these surpluses have been formulated. (b) We should encourage the rulers referred to in (a) to prepare plans primarily for the improvement of the lot of their peoples. These plans should be carefully balanced in the light of available financial resources and of the requirements of the states between: (a) Non revenue - producing capital development projects - schools, hospitals, etc. (ii) Revenue - producing capital development project# communications, improved water supplies, etc. The plans might include provision for the endowments of certain projects under (i) above, possibly by investment as in (c) below. (c) It is clearly desirable that if possible ways and means should be found in which oil revenues surplus to the re««* quirements described in (b) above could be invested and utilized for development in the Middle East, A separate study of this problem should be undertaken by the Working Party, (d) We should encourage the. development of resources other than oil (e.g. fisheries) when such development is economically sound; and should guide economic and social develolment on the right lines by assisting and advising the Gulf States in measures required to improve their standards of administration.N INDIA OFFICE records</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000df_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/800</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000df</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/800</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 30/7 Review of Middle Eastern Economic and Social Policy'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1949/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-20T10:44:18</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (25 folios)</extent><extent>The papers in the file are arranged chronologically from the front to the rear of the file.
