We feel that everyone will enjoy riding our boats, because they are not only very fast, they are extreme ly comfortable, and equipped with every modern conven ience we could think of. Attached hereto is complete information about this new passenger service. If you have any suggestions re garding any phase of the operations, we shall be glad to hear from you. cc: HBM*s Political Agent The Agency Manama.

Murcury Boat Lines, of Manama, on the subject of the allocation to them offrequencies and call-signs for wireless operation. However, our latest communications have not received any reply. Becently a member of the Residency Staff was informed that the firm was now no longer in business, and if this is the case, it would explain our failure to elicit reply. Y/e should accordingly be grateful if you would confirm whether or not the firm is still operating. Yours ever, Political Agent, Bahrain.
