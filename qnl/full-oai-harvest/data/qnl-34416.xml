                           A Collection of Treaties, Engagements and Sanads Relating to India and Neighbouring Countries), with revised narratives for each geographical area covered, incorporating the principal events that have occurred since the publication of the previous edition in 1909.The part concerns the revised narrative for the section regarding Persia [Iran], Seistan [Sistan], Kerman and Persian Baluchistan, and includes extensive interdepartmental correspondence (most of which is dated 1929-1931) discussing the contents of the revised narrative, as well as the question of which treaties and agreements to include alongside it.The correspondence goes on to cover the requirement for a fresh proof of the revised narrative, following the Government of India's decision (made in consultation with His Majesty's Government) to defer its publication, in order to include references not only to recent events but also to further developments that are expected in the near future.Most of the part is made up of a copy of the second proof of the revised narrative (ff 24-41) together with copies of numerous related treaties, agreements and correspondence covering the period 1763-1928 (ff 42-216), of which a significant amount is written in French.The main correspondents are the following: the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India; the British Legation, Tehran; officials of the India Office, Foreign Office, Colonial Office, and the Government of India's Foreign and Political Department.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Kerman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100084818291.0x000002#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100084818291.0x000002#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100084818291.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
