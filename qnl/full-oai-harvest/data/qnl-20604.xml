Kemball writes that he has received ‘evasive answers’ from both Muḥammad bin ‘Abdullāh and Humud bin Mujdel [or Humeed bin Mujdell] over the restitution of boats seized from Bahrain. To this end, he has despatched Commodore Robinson to Dammām to assist in the retrieval of the vessels in question. As a result of Humud bin Mujdel’s retreat to Katiffe [Al-Qaṭīf], Kemball informs Anderson that he has written to the Wahabee [Wahhābī] ruler Ameer Fysul [Fayṣal ibn Turki], seeking his cooperation in bringing Humeed bin Mujdell to account for his actions.Two enclosures are included with Kemball’s letter:1. A translation of the aforementioned letter (folios 102-03) from Kemball to Fayṣal ibn Turki, dated 26 August 1854, seeking his cooperation in bringing Humeed bin Mujdell to justice;2. Letter no.133 of 1854 (folios 104-05) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 28 August 1854, discussing the pros and cons of either attacking and destroying, or blockading into port, Humeed bin Mujdell’s boats.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x000011#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
