Yours sincerely, Major A.L.A. Dredge, M.B.E. First Secretary, Residency, BAHRAIN.MUSCAT 20th February, 1950, r The Sultan has asked me to go down and stay with him in Salalah next month any time after the first week. It would be a great help if I could be assisted to get there either by R. A. F. from Masirah or by tanker from here. If I could get a berth on any passing tanker it could be arranger for me to go out in one of the H. D. M. Ls and meet it; in this way the period for which it would have to halt would not be long. At Salalah a similar arrange ment could be made and contact between the ship and the shore worked through the local R. A. F. wireless. I should be most grateful for any help that could be afforded on these lines as it would save a long launch journey all the way to Salalah. Major F. C. L.
