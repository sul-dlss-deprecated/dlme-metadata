To The Political Agent, BAHRAIN# Your letter No# 2086-12/7 dated the 13th August 1936* above. I have the honour to refer to your letter cited 2# The exporter of the goods in question had entered into a bond binding himself to pay twice the amount of duty leviable if the goods were not landed at the port of Quatar or were not otherwise accounted for to my satisfaction. In view of the result of your enquiries communicated in your letter above, I was not prepared to hold either that they were landed at Quatar or that they were otherwise satis factorily accounted for# I therefore decided to enforce the terms of the bond and informed him accordingly. 3* The exporter through his legal representative still maintains that the goods were landed at Quatar and in support of his contention has produced the following documents:- (a) A certificate by Husein Nama, the Customs Official at Quatar, issued by him in respect of some other cargo on or about the 6th December 1936, i#e# a date later than the one on which he endorsed the Export General Manifest for the Bombay cargo in question. It is claimed that this2 - (D this document proves the Customs Official at Quatar to be still in service and holding the same post, (b) an affidavit sworn to by the Tindal of the vessel before the Ruler of Koweit - where the vessel proceeded from Quatar - affirming that the fifty-four cases of silk were landed at Quatar and that thereafter the vessel sailed for Bahrain, (c) statement on oath of the crew of the* vessel, (d) letter of the consignee advising receipt of the cargo, and (e) sanitary certificate of the vessel at Bahrairu I enclose copies of all these documents* 4* You may be aware that a large proportion of silk and art. silk goods shipped from bond to ports in the Persian Gulf or on the Makran Coast are smuggled into British India across the Sind-Baluchistan frontier. It is therefore not improbable that the whole of the evidence tendered by the Exporter is unreliable. I would however request you to be so good as to enquire into the matter further and favour me with the result. I have the honour to be.

Landing certificates - counter attestation by Political Officers of. I have the honour to address you on the above subject. 2« Sugar, piecegoods and spices are the principal articles frequently re-exported from Bombay by country craft to ports in the Persian Gulf. It was considered that the high rates of Customs duty to which the articles were liable in India offered considerable inducement for smuggling them back into the country. With a view, therefore, to preventing such malpractices, a procedure was devised in consultation with your predecessor in 1924, whereby, immediately after the shipment of such goods for Persian Gulf Ports, this Custom House sent an advice to the Political Officer at the port of destination requesting him to certify the arrival and landing of the goods at such port. It was also agreed at the time that the Political Officer concerned should satisfy himself, before counter-attesting a landing certificcite, that the goods in question had actually been landed at the port mentioned. I enclose copy of tho relevant corres pond ence. 3* Recently, there arose an occasion to enquire from the Political Officer at Muscat whether such shipments to Dhofar should be permitted at the discretion ot % the Custom House and, if so, whether the British Consular Authority would he able to obtain evidence of landing in each case. In reply he stated that the evidence of landing of the cargo would be entirely dependent on the s+atement of the local administration for which no responsibility could be accepted. A copy of the relevant correspondence is enclosed. 4 ‘ Tt rA11 ^ agreed the t the evidence so flemished will be of little value as establishing beyond reasonable doubt that the goods in question have actually been landed at destination in the Persian Gulf and have not been smuggled back into India.vy The only other alternative for this Cuotom House nould he to refuse permission for such shipments. But such drastic action ■would have the effect of depriving certain provices in the Gulf of some of the necessaries of life for the supply of which they are dependent on Bombay, and is bound to hamper trade and to be contrary to public interests and policy. 5. Bince the time the procedure was introduced, landing certificates have been regularly received by this Custom House duly countersigned by the other Political Officers concerned. None of these Officers has made mention of any difficulty experienced in verifying the actual landing of the goods. 6. In view, however, of the reply of the Political Officer at Bhofar, the questions which arise for consideration are whether the position at the other ports is the same as at Bhofar, whether the certificates issued by the other Political Officers are based on statements of the local authorities, if so, whether certificates issued on the basis of ouch statement a can be accepted as establishing beyond any doubt the arrival of the goods at the port of destination and whether the procedure agreed upon in 1924 and now in vogue should not be re-examined to see whether it really fulfils the object and offers the security for which it was devised. 7 * 1 should be much obliged if you could kindly have this matter thoroughly examined and considered in respect of the points mentioned above.&lt;§&gt; Copy of letter Ho.3 Confl. of 1924, dated the 23rd February, 1924, from A.M.Green, Esquire, H.A., I.C.S., Collector of Custons, Bombay, to the Political Resident, Bushire. I have the honour to state that it has recently come to ray notice that dutiable goods are transhipped at, or goods from bond or goods on vhich a drawback of duty has o#-duty has been allowed are exported by country craft from this port nominally to some port in the Persian Gulf. The boat sails and either goes o-i raight to Cutch or Kathiawar or calls at the port named and brings the cargo straight back to Cutch or Kathiawar (where it is believed improper rebates are obtainable). Free transhipment or roshipment of bonded or drawback goods to Cutch is inadmissible and hence thiamethod in adopted to evade the prohibition. 2. The only safeguard against such evasions in to require the shippers to execute a bond under Section 138 of the Sea Customs Act in a sum equal to twice the amount of duty leviable on the goods for the landing of Ihe goods at the port of desti nation or otherwise satisfactorily accounting for them. When the bond is furnished an intimation is sent to the Political Agent or other British representative at the port concerned and he is requested to inform us of Ihe arrival of the vessel at his port and of the discharge of the cargo there, and on receipt of his reply to this effect the bond is cancelled. The Political Officers have apparently to depend on the reports or certificates of the local Customs authorities. I am however doubtful whether the landing certificates issued by ihe Gulf Customs authorities can safely be accepted as reliable. I should therefore be much obliged if you could see your way to issue instructions to all the officers concerned that they should satisfy themselves before sending an advice to this Custom House or countersigning a landing certificate brought to them for this purpose that the goods covered by it have actually been landed. 30 1 enclose for your information a list of the principal ports in the Persian Gulf and Arabia to which shipments are made by country craft.List of principal ports in the Persian Gulf and Arabia with which trade is carried on between Bombay and those ports. 1.

I have the honour to refer to your letter cited above and to enclose, for ready reference, copies of your previous letters on the same subject. 2. As you are aisare, the object underlying the ay a ten of aending intinatlone of transhipments at Bombay is to ensure that the goods permitted to be transhipped are not smuggled back into the country to the detriment of Revenue. From your letters in 1933, it was clear that the ports of Rheher, Dhofar and Oisean were unrecognised ports, and therefore the Custom House had no alternative but to refuse Pemission to transhipments these ports, .his refusal led to a representation in 1934 , from His Highness the Sultan of Muscat to the Government of Bombay, ^he entire province of Bhofar, - so it was represented, forming part of His Highness's dominion was entirely dependent on Bombay for certain of its supplies. It was therefore urged that the prohibition of transhipment deprived the inhabitants of certain necessaries and that it should therefore be with- drawn. 3 * SU(?ar * 00tt ° n and 8ilk »ie=e- g oods, oa88iil i, lgRea , and spices are the commodities for which permission is sought for transhipment to Bhofar and Giesan, and though the frepuency of such applications suggests that these are fairly considerable Ports open to foreign trade, yet they have been reported in your previous letters to be unrecognised ports.

A I have the honour to refer to your letter No.C.410/37 of 7th April 1937, and to forward the following replies to the questions raised in your paragraphs (a) 1. Sheher is a port in the territory of the Sultan of Moicalla, and Gissen in that of the Sultan of Socotra and do not concern this Agency. Any question aff/ect- ing these two places should be referred to the Secretary to His Excellency the Governor, Aden, who exercises political control over the territories of the a Dove na me d Rule rs. 2. Dofar is a province of the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and has two recognized ports, Salalah and Murbat. Transhipment of cargoes should be permitted at your discretion but as regards the obtaining oy ms, as the British Consular authority concerned, of evidence of the landing of cargoes in Dhofar or any other ports of the Sultanate, this is entirely dependent upon the statements of the Muscat Government authorities for which I can accept no responsibility.Political Agency, Bahrain, the 3rd January 1939 To The Residency Agent, Sharjah. Memorandum . A point has been raised by the Collector of Customs, Bombay, with regard to the certificates of landing of cargo shipped from Bombay to Gulf ports. The object of these certificates, as you realise, is to prevent the smuggling back into India of cargoes manifested out to Gulf ports, on which a draw-back of customs duty has been obtained at Bombay. The essence of the point raised by the Collector of Customs is to what extent the countersignature of Political Officers on these certificates represents direct knowledge of the landing of the cargo, or whether it is based on the signature of the local customs authorities and is little more than an attestation of r the genuineness of that sign^ure. 2. Vhich is the position in the case of the landing certificates which you countersign? If the latter, to what extent can the system be regarded as adequate to secure the object for which it was designed, viz. the prevention of smuggling into India? In other words, what is the value of /£t signature of the local customs authorities? 3 I presume Dubai is the port on the '^Vucial Coast mostly concerned? 4* If you consider the present system inadequate, have you any suggestions to offer for its improvement? for Political Agent, Bahrain.m—m m. 1 ii ML.

I certify to the authenticity of the Ruling Sheikh's * signature or seal on the document and not to the correctness of the statements made on or entries in landing certificates® 3* As the Customs on the Trucial Coast are run by the local authorities, it is difficult to rely on a certificate issued by an official of an individual Shaikh. Even if the goods were landed and a correct landing certific .te was issued it would not prevent smuggling into Iddia owing to the fact that Customs ch rges on the Trucial Coast are very small and merchants can re-export the goods without incurring extra lack of expenses. Owing to/proper supervision and Customs control such ^oods can be exported from any place on the Trucial Coast with out being checked or noticed® 4. Dubai is the important port and distribution centre on the Trucial Coast, but goods can be smuggled into India in om any ^ort on the Trucial Coast or even transhipped at sea from small boats into large ones. As smuggling of goods into India takes place from all ports in the Persian Gulf. I do not think that restrictions in £ particular place would prevent smuggling. About 75 per cent of the piece goods imported into the Trucic 1 Coast are si gled into / . )into Iran end only pert of the China silk is smuggled into Inula * therefore, no Shaikh would agree to impose restrictions on exports from his country. Should any Shaikh agree to impose restrictions, I am sure that, in practice, he would not xarthfully carry out his promise. To avoid interfering in the internal affairs of the local utliorities,which might lead to complications, I suggest that it would be better if no transhipped or ex-bond goods from India are allowed for the Trucial Coast. 6 . In this connection kindly refer to the correspondencePolitical Agency, Bahrain, the 21st February 1939• tot \ The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject :- Landing Certificates - Counter-attestation by Political Officers. Reference your Printed letter No. 2079-36/86 dated the 30th November 1938 on the above subject. 2. It is a fact that the certificates issued by the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah are based solely on the statements of the local authorities. In fact as far as the Residency Agent is concerned he is cer tifying only to the authenticity of the Shaikh’s seal or signature on the document. 3. So far as Bahrain is concerned there is an efficient Customs organisation working under the control of a British official and the certificates furnished by him can be accepted without question as correct. 4. As for Qatar there is little direct traffic from Indian ? ports and normally cargoes for Qatar are transhipped at Bahrain, though in the existing situation transhipment is effected at Dubai. In any case in which there is direct shipment to Qatar, the Political Agent is able only to make enquiries from the Shaikh of Qatar, since he obviously cannot spend three days on the journey to and from Dohah to verify the Shaikh’s certificate. In point of fact the Shaikh of Qatar has a Customs Department of moderate efficiency and I do not think that any anxiety need be felt in regard to this Shaikhdom. 5/- *- 2 - 5. As for the Trucial Coast, Dubai is now the principal port and I have been encouraging the Shaikh of Dubai and his new Council to tighten up and improve their customs organisation. In view of the superior attractions offered by south-east Persia as a destination for smuggled goods I should not believe that Dubai represents a danger spot from the Indian point of view, with the possible exception of smuggling of silk piecegoods. I base this information partly on local knowledge and partly on my experience of smuvgling activities along the Las Bela and llekran (Kalat) Coasts; but before offering final views on this matter it would be an advantage if I could be informed of the quantity of silk piecegoods normally transhipped to .Dubai. With this possible exception I should say the withdrawal of transhipment or drawback facilities at Indian ports on goods for Dubai would be unjustifiable interference with normal trade. 6. The remarks made in the immediately preceding paragraph about Dubai apply also to the other Trucial Coast ports though their trade of course is on a very considerably smaller scale.'■NHR Vessel’s Name Agent’s Name n The above vessel has this day cleared for Lc with the below mentioned 1in ^^ cargo. 2.

The Collector of Customs,Bombay,in his letter No.780/S6,dated 17 r 5-S7, maintains that enquiries made at this end proved that the goods in question were not landed at Qatar.In view of this he has decided to enforce the terms of the bond against the exproter of k the goods. The exp. rter with a view to safeguard himsel4 against the terms of the bond has produced certain documents to show that the goods In question were landed at Qatar but the Collector of Customs considers this evidence as unreliable. Therefore with a view to establish the authentici£j of the information given to him from this end and prior to the enforcement of the terms of the bond against the exporter the Collector of Customs,Bombay,wishes us to make further enquiries into the matter end let him know the result.

The Director of Customs here confirms that the goods mentioned n have been landed and cleared”. We pass on this information to the Customs authorities at Karachi/Bombay. We address the Ruler who returns the export manifest which has been endorsed by his Director of Customs (vide p. 76). We forward this to the Customs authorities in India with the remark ' the endorsement is genuine and may be accepted as prodf of the landing of the cargo”, (see p. 77). We enquire from the Residency Agent, Shar jah, who certifies the certificate of landing of the goods granted by the local authorities to be genuine. This certifi cate is returned to Karachi/Bombay p. 84) 2. If the goods have not arrived at the places mentioned above / and on hearing to this effect from the authorities whom we address, the Indian Customs auth orities are informed accordingly. k 4 A/J U^CTA^-l/kk ^-v.„ O-'I^., V,Vf The P.U.^. refers to extracts of manifests of dhows destined for Bahrain and the rriWal ^oast sin^e 1942. Karachi Customs now state that these manifests have not been returned to them after verification and ask for their return or if not possible, at least a ^ertitivate to the effort that these dhows have arrived &lt;.it the^r destinations and discharged the^r cargoes as manifested. uut of the 164 manifests listed only 5 of them refefs to Bahrain and the rest relates to Shariah,Dubai. Qatar etc. ^ 7 * The procedure followed in this office has been that as soon as we receive these manifests we pass them on to the Bahrain Customs or K.A. Sharjah as the case ffisy be for veriiication and on their return we re transmit them to the Karachi Customs. ^ it is not certain that we have received all these manifests, as they ore never forwarded to us wTTK any covering letters. But we have always returned to them those that were received, under cover of Printed betters 01 which we have records in our file. The list contains many manifests which we have in fact returned to them as shown by our records. + , . xhe ^rachi customs have raised this question after of wel1 over years and it is not known whether even the Customs at Bahrain, Sharjah and Dubai ill be in a position to give at this distant date the information called for.

The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘File 12/7 I Shipping. Arrival of Sailing Crafts at Qatar and other places with Cargo.’ (IOR/R/15/2/1375). The file’s principal correspondents are: the Collector (and Assistant Collector) of Customs at Karachi; staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain; the Director of Customs at Bahrain (Claud Cranbrook Lewis DeGrenier; George William Reginald Smith); the Ruler of Qatar (Shaikh ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī); the Ruler of Dubai (Shaikh Sa‘id bin Maktūm Āl Maktūm).The correspondence chiefly concerns routine enquires made about specific vessels travelling from India to the ports of the Persian Gulf, and involves the delivery and return of export manifests. The enquiries begin with letters from the Collector (or Assistant Collector) of Customs, or other administrators, at Indian ports (Karachi, Bombay, Veraval) informing the Political Agent at Bahrain of named vessels travelling to ports in the Persian Gulf, with details of their cargo and cargo markings, and requesting confirmation of their arrival and the landing of their cargo. These letters are followed by enquiries made by the Political Agent to the Director of Customs at Bahrain (for vessels travelling to Bahrain), the Residency Agent at Sharjah (for vessels travelling to the ports of the Trucial Coast), and the Ruler of Qatar (for vessels travelling to Qatar), with further correspondence, including replies from the Residency Agent at Sharjah (in English and Arabic) and letters from the Rulers of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Ajman, and replies from the Ruler of Qatar. Correspondence is concluded with a letter from the Political Agent at Bahrain, back to the Collector of Customs at Karachi, confirming the arrival (and sometimes non-arrival) of named vessels.Other papers in the file include:correspondence in response to an enquiry made by P N Candavarkar, Collector of Customs at Bombay, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, dated October 1938, relating to the status of the customs administration at the port of Dofar [Dhofar], prompting broader questions, answered by the Political Agent at Bahrain and the Residency Agent at Sharjah, of how certificates for the landing of cargoes are managed in the ports of the Persian Gulf. This correspondence includes copies of earlier papers, dating from 1924 (ff 95-110);a copy of an export general manifest, dated 1941 (f 237).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Dubai, Āl Maktūm dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs duty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Maritime legislation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Trade (practice)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Transshipment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00006f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
