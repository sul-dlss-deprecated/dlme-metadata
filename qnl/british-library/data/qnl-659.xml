Apart from the Sultan's wishes in the matter, it is of course desirable that the Political Agent, Muscat, or »; - _ *-** P other Government representative should be present during any discussions on oil matters between His Highness and r, Longrigg. If io is thought unnecessary for the Political Agent to accompany the Sultan to India, I assume that the Government of India will arrange for some other official to be present at the disouaeions.

In accordance ^/ith instructions contained in your telegram No.10^3 of 27th October 1337, I gave the Sultan in Bombay a copy of the Draft Political Agreement together with copies of the letters drafts of which numbered 1 and 3 respectively were enclosed in India Office letter No.P.Z.4633/37 dated August 7 133/ and modified in India Office telegram No.509s') tf j of 27th October 1937. V 1 . it,;' 3. The Sultan’s reaction was startingly hostile. After giving a hasty glance at the letters he became very excited and declared that it would be quite impossible to go through all the numerous questions arising out of the draft agreement in the short time left before his departure from India. I then asked hi t whether he would have liked me to have taken up this matter with hire at Delhi while he was there or during the two weeks prior to his departure from Muscat when we were occupied in negotiations over the new'Treaty. The Sultan agreed that neither of these times would have been suitable for consideration of this question. I pointed out that there were four complete days left before the date of his departure from Bombay and that this would give more than sufficient time if he would peruse the two letters and the draft quietly with me he would find them both short and perfectly easy to understand.2 . 4. Tlie Sultan by this time was nearly in tears exclaiming that his subjects would nave smaxl respect for him if he decided such an important question in four days* I pointed out that he had completed the —— whole of the Oil Agreement with Petroleum Concessions Ltd. in 9 days and this was far more complicated, difficult and longer than the Political Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government to v/hich he was now being asked merely to give his concurrence* The Sultan replied that whereas the Agreement with the Company was merely one concerning money the Political Agreement involved matters affecting his control over his state. 5. After some further discussion I persuaded the Sultan with difficulty to read the Draft Agreement with me. The first point he raised was to ask what was the ’Hinderstanding” referred to in paragraph 1 of my letter ( Draft Ho. I vide paragraph 1 above). I replied that I thought it was clear that this understanding referred to the communication I had made verbally to him at the time when negotiations for the oil concessions were being carried out in liuscat in June of this year that any concession to Petroleum Concessions Ltd. would be subject to a Political Agreement to be concluded between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. The Sultan excitedly exclaimed that all he understood me to say at that time was that there would be a Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government anc the Company but not that the Commercial Agreement would depend for its approval upon it. I replied that I remembered very clearly what I had said which was that I had reminded him of what I had already mentioned5 on a previous occasion at Dhofar that any agreement entered into between the Sultan and Petroleum Concessions Ltd, would have to be approved of by His Kajesty’s Government who would make a separate Political Agreement with the Company. I added that 1 had mentioned this matter on a second occasion during the negotiations at Muscat when Hr. Permitte the Representative of the Company was present and that I felt certain that the latter would support my statement. The lultan persisted in maintaining that he had understood ray remarks in quite a different sen se. 6. This is not the first time that the Sultar^s memory and under standing has become conveniently defective. During his recent visit to Delhi he informed me that at an interview with H.D. the Viceroy the Foreign 3ecretary / 3ir Aubrey Metcalfe ; had informed him definitely that the Arms Traffic Subsidy would be restored if the Sultan made a written official request for it. when I asked the Foreign MaCfea/Gl: Secretary the following day whether the Sultan’s statement was correct he entirely repudiated it and explained what he actually had said which was quite a different matter. (In this connection please see my ^express letter lTo.T/92 dated November 26. 1937. ) In ray opinion there is no question of the Sultan having so completely misunderstood the sense of what I told him in Muscat regarding the political Agreement. He was anxious at the time not to raise any obstacle which might result in delaying the advance payment of the money coming to him under the terras of the Commercial Agreement and readily accepted what I explained to him quite clearly of the necessity of obtaining His Majesty’s Government’s——— 4. r * approval of that agreement. 7. The Sultan after I had calmed him down a little, asked what was the object of having tnis Political Agreement JMiown him at all* T Te would nave, he saia, no obj ection to any sort of agx ecrneno ..hich lie liajesty’s Government might desire to enter into ..ith the Company so long as it would not adversely affect his interests. I pointed out that his query was exactly answered in paragraph 3 of the letter given him (Graft letter ITo.I) unc 1 all other matteis on which His Majesty’s Government desired their interests to be safeguarded were fully explained and set forth in the various articles wf J /? nment itself. The Gultan then exclaimed that he could not understand the Agreement, so I asked to toll what points in it were puzzling him and I would endeavour to clear them up. We then read over a portion of the Agreement the 3ultan raising numerous objections to the various matters dealt with in the different c.rticles. I do not propose,uni css you so desire,to give now in detail his objections since I found that during the discussions we had on the subject on three successive days what the jultan completely acquiesced ^ I in one day he violently objected to the next and vice versa and ir #^s reply which he has promised to send from Singapore to my letters mentioned in paragraph 2 above he will quite probably have altered his idea/ once c ... iff objections. ..hen his letter is received hich should be shortly as he said he would despatch it by Air Mail before his departure from Singapore on December 14th, I can then, when forwarding it to you, comment if necessary on the various points he may raise with a — ' ™ ~ — — —6 S view to elucid&amp;tfcnc where ^oesible the reasons for -no o'bjoctiun^ tlieretc. o ;# v/oeo apparent during the negotiations over revision of the 1331 Treaty the iultan is inordinately sensitive and suspicious of agreeing to any thing which may in ills opinion curtail ills fdll and complete sovereign powers as an independent Ruler anti 1 gathered that it was some such fear that has maus him so strofagly hostile to the Political Agreement. As mentioned by you in your recent despatch giving an appreciation of his character the 3ultan is not always as ready to cooperate with f as he is to ask fur assistance and privileges from r is ] aj esty ’ s Government. 3, The Guitan asked me whether it would he possible for him when in England to call at the India Office and discuss this matter of the Political Agreement, ByA that time, he said, he would have been able to think over things and clarify his ideas on the subject. I replied that I did not think there would be any objection to his doing so but that I should have of course to refer the matter to you. J rh^' ruin. 1 * i'i cj-To, Political Resident in the Persian Rulf, at B&amp;-' 1 air # Dated 8th December 1937 Po.T/102 I forward herewith a note on the discussions between the Sultan of I'us cat and Hr. Longrigg of V -xr\ interview^ fild at hornbay on November 24 at which I was present. 2 # As will be seen therefrom the result discussions was mostly a iMfcgatiire one since refused to commit himself to statina wnetner of the the jultan those parts of his :'o inions in which the h- • j iat or ost ed Itf^he \.'est ern foothills of ohe Oman mountain range could be visited by geologists under arrangements to be made by him or not. The reason fox Sultan's attitude is, of course, that as he has no the control whatsoever over the Oman he is not in a position at present to say whether he will he able or not to arrange for the Company's employees to prospect there for oil. 3. According to the Sultan in recent conversations I had with him shortly before leaving Muscat the authority of the Imam over the Oman is dwindling and I think that the Sultan has hopes that when he returns from his world tour next year he ma y b e able to e,et into direct touch with man y of the tribes now controlled by the Imam and arrange with them to all. •• prospecting parties to explore their terntoiy. (I a™ submitting a separate report on the situation m the Oman on outcome of my return to Muscat.) Whatever may be the the Sultan’s intrigues with the Omantribes I think there is no Eoubt that at present none of the Company’s employees could visit or prospect in that region without the sanction and good offices of the Imam himself vide paragraph 2 of ray tplegraga Ho. 106 dated 13th October 1937. ,j| p 1 4. LLr. Longrigg expressed himself as disappointed at the negative result of his discussions with the 3ultan but I pointed out that his Company by the insertion in their own Agreement of article 12 ^ ently aware of the fact that certain areas of the Sultanate were not under the control of the lluscat G-oveinra ent. 5. prior to our meeting with the Sultan Mr. Longrigg and myself had a short talk in which I gave him a general idea of the Political situation in the Sultanate. Mr. Longrigg asked me whether I thought it advisable for him to discuss with tne Sultan the question of his meeting the Imam. I said that in view of the Sultan’s very strong objections to this proposal (Vide paragraph 1 of ray telegram Ho. 106 of 1 -tn ^ October 1937 ) I saw no useful purpose in it being raised. Mr. Longrigg agreed and the question was not mentioned at all during the interviews with the Sultan. 6. Although nothing definite was accomplished at this interview one useful result was, I tnink, brought about in making a Re presentative oi Petiole Concessions Ltd. realise the situation prevail S in the Sultanate. It also enabled Mr. Longrigg acting on behalf of his Company to make personal contact with the Sultan who expressed himself very pleased at making his acqaintance. He was still more pleased when on saying good bye Mr. Longrigg presented him with an expensive camera for use on his world tour which present was particularly gratifying to the Sultan who is keen photograpnei. ^ iti u A ft i Cr^yU.&lt;f\ llote on discussion at meeting held at Bombay on November 24th between H.3. the Sultan of Muscat and Hr. S.H.Longrigg of Petroleum Concessions Ltd. at which Major H.r.7atta political Agent, Muscat was present. Mr. Longrigg first explained to the Sultan what area*in the Sultanate nis Company considered, from information available, were the most likely to be of geological interest. He said that the coastal region lying between the mountains and the sea north of Muscat known as Bat in ah was of little interest to the Company also the extreme north of the Mussandum Peninsular. The coastal region south of Muscat more especially that between Has al Had upto Ras 'Dhabit Ali might be o^. somewhat more interest and the Company desired to carry out exploration of those parts. The portion of the Sultanate, however, which the Company cons idere d, to be best deserving of exploration was, Mr. Longrigg declared, the western foothills of the main Oman mountain range. 2. Hr. Longrigg asked whether the Sultan could !iake arrangements for prospecting parties to visit and explore this region whenever the Company desired and provide measures to ensure their safety. Trie Sultan replied that at the present moment he was quite unable to state in any definite manner whether suitable arrangements could be made or noo. He would of course as provided under article^ 12 of the oil concession use his : f ood offices to provide for the safe conduct of the personnel of the Company visiting any place in hio dominions, but owing to the peculiar conditions prevailing in the Oman it would be necessary for him to make careful inquiries into the matter before ne could commit himself to saying whether he could aiiange for such a reconnaisance in those districts or not since he would not be returning fiom hio woild9 until May of next year soiae time must elapse before lie could give a definite answer to this question. Mr. Longrigg said that though the Company did not intend to carry out any active work until the autumn of 1933 they desire^to know as clearly as possible, in advance, what programme could be made for their prospecting parties in order that the nunrous arrange ments and preparations necessary might be put in hand at an early date. The Sultan said that at this time he was quite unable to commit himself to any sort of definite reply as to what portions of the territory mentioned by Mr. Longrijg as being of interest to the Company could be visited. 3. As regards the south eastern coastal portion of his territory i.e. that between Has al Had and Has Tftiabat Ali the 3ultan said that he thought there would be no difficulty after his return to Muscat next year, in arranging for the Company's employees to travel and prospect from the coast as far as the western limits of the Sultanate i.e. the beginning of the (Jreat 5ands and as far as the territory belonging to Ibn Saud. Mhofar, the .Sultan declared, was well under his control and the only two important Sheikhs of the remaining portion of the coastal range were the Sheikhs of Mahut and Masirah with both of who# he was well acquainted and who were amenable to his authority. 4. Mr. Longrigg mentioned that his company might s desire to carry out some aerial reconnaisances of the Sultanate and asked whether the Sultan had any objection to their aeroplanes using the existing landing grounds made for the Royal Air ^orce. The Sultan said he had no objection but stressed the importance of ample notice being given in order thatthe Sheikhs and Headmen of the districts to he over should he aware of the identity of the visiting Upto . . aeroplanes./XfCKSK the present,the Sultan explained, only Royal Air Force Aeroplanes had visited his Arabian territories and the sudden appearance of another type of aeroplane and of persons not belonging to the Royal Air Force might lead to misunderstandings and perhaps unpleasantness from the local inhabitants. I r. Longrigg promised that as long warning as possible of all flights projected would be given. Ifr. Longrigg asked what would probaoly Happen if one of the ^ompanY’s aeroplanes was obliged ^o make a forced descent in the interior of the country. The Sultan said that though he sincerely hoped that no harm would come to the occupants of the aeroplane, apart from the coastal belt where he was able to exercise some control over the inhabitants, ne was qui^e unable to say what would happen and certainly coula accept no responsibility for ^ Ie e ty ^ ie ^ r .■Lj-.T.Pit* I£r. Longrigg suggested that it might be desirable to have a representative of the liuscat jovernment in the aeroplane when engaged on such flight s and the gulta n^ agreed saying for each dist rict visite ^ :i : t« the local tribe should be taken. 5. Hr. Longrigg called on the Sultan again on trie 25th accompanied by the Political Agent, to say Good bye as he was leaving for the ^ulf that evening. The only official subject spoken about was the question raised by Hr. Longrigg at the prior suggestion of the Political Agent of the degree of responsibility the 3ultan accepted for the actual coastal legion with particular respect to the safety of the personnel of any ail craft belonging to the company which might land there . The Sultan said lity went even in that so far as the landing grounds heBUSH1RE RESIDENCY.

The main factor is that until the Sultan can, somehow or other, arrange for the Company to operate in the Oooan hinterland, where oil is most likely to be found, he has no chance of drawing his royalties. This, of course, is a considerable inducement to the Sultan to make such arrangements, either through the Imam or otherwise.

Subject :- Muscat Oil * p. iv^ • Your telegram No.1168 of 18th December. The letter on the subject which the Sultan promised he would despatch from Singapore not having been received by the end of last month, in accordance with instructions contained in paragraph 2 of your telegram quoted above, I forward herewith a 0 f certain objections raised by the Sultan in Bombay against the Draft Political Agreement between His Majesty*s Government and Petroleum Concessions Ximited. ^ A. 2. The first objection raised^b, words in sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph 1* M whereas certain responsibilities will devolve on His Majesty*s Government”. The Sultan demanded to know how it could be said % that responsibilities devolved on His Majesty*s Government on account of any work carried out in his dominions. S. 6. T MFP—501 S&amp;P--(M-820)—23-7-36-300,000. |*&gt;b| e Sultan was to the-- 2 -- I replied that so far as I understand this since Petroleum Concessions Limited was a British Company who proposed to operate in a foreign territory, the question of looking after their interests and thei^ welfare of their personnel generally was a responsibility which devolved on His Majesty’s Government in the same way as that of all British subjects dwelling in Muscat limits was their concern. The Sultan said nothing further on this point but was clearly not satisfied with the explanation given. 3. The Sultan took exception to the second half of paragraph 3 of the Draft Agreement. He declared that as worded it would enable either His Majesty’s Government or the Company to get rid of all the Muscat! or neighbouring Arab State subjects employed by the Company under Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement on the grounds that their labour was inefficient. ^ S' I replied that Article 16(b) of the Commercial Agreement to which he had already given consent also laid down that if the Company found that the local labour was inadequate or unsuitable they should have the right to import labour. I added that the object ana meaning of this clause in the Draft Political Agreement was perfectly clear to me. Oil prospecting and oil boring operations were, I explained, a highly technical business of which all the specialised experts in the numerous branches thereof were not usually to be found in any one nation. It might well be found necessary to obtain the services of certain individuals who were neither British nor Muscat!• The Sultan however persisted in his objection. pointv 4 o- -5-- 51 4. Reference paragraph 4 of Draft Political Agreraent. The buitan said he failed to see why his Government should not deal with the Company direct in all matters without reference to the Agency or any other British Representative. He declared that at present he and his officials dealfdirect with British subjects when they had any business with them. I pointed out that this procedure was only observed in routine or unimportant matters which as expressly provided for in the Draft Agreement could also be conducted direct by the Muscat State authorities and the Company. The effect of this Article I said would be merely to bring the conduct of the Company’s affairs in line with what has been the procedure in the past for all dealings between British firms and subjects and the Muscat Government. The Sultan was unable to refute this argument but obstinately persisted in his objection to the proviso in the Agreement. (V VV p. ^ V 5. Reference paragraph 7. ' The Sultan objected to the inclusion of the words (in line 6 and line 13) 'or His Majesty’s Government” as giving the latter certain rights in his territory which would amount to an encroachment on his Sovereign rights. I replied that there was no question of any such encroachment of the Sultan’s rights being intended and obviously before His Majesty’s Government proposed to acquire the use of any area of ground in Muscat territory for any of the jjurposes named they would, as in the past, obtain the * Sultan’s consent beforehand. 6. Reference paragraph 9.^ The Sultan objected to the whole of this paragraph. He said that his concurrence as to whether a state of national emergency or war existed should be required and in any case he objected to the right under those circumstances of His Majesty’s Government to pre-emption of all oil produced in his country. As6 As regards the first ^art of the Sultan’s objection I ashed hijji whether he considered he was capable of judging the exact position of the relations which might arise between Great Britain and some Foreign Power and whether it would amount to a national emergency or state of war. The Sultan admitted he would not be able to judge. terms of the Agreement entered into between him and the Company all the oil found in the State belonged to the latter and what was .done with it was the Company’s concern. The Sultan had no answer to this argument but refused to fulfill his responsibilities for the protection of the Company” He accepted, he declared, no responsibility for any of the personnel of the Company when wording in his territory laid down this condition clearly in Clause 12 of the Commercial Agreement. I promptly produced a copy of the Commercial Agreement and showed the Sultan the .article to which he referred and also Article 17 in which I explained that as I understood the question his responsibilities were more or less defined. The Sultan persisted in maintaining that India Office letter Fo.P.Z 4683/37 dated August 7 1937 and modified in India Office telegram ho. 5098 of 27th October 1937, the Sultan declared he would not agree to the inclusion of any such restriction as was laid down in paragraph 3(A) of oncerning pre-emption I pointed out that under the agree to the Article. Reference paragraph 10. The Sultan became very excited when he read the 7. words ” In order that the Sultan may be in a position to or for that matter any person Muscati or Foreigner and had this Article imposed no responsibility on him. 8. as regards the Draft letter (Fo.i; enclosed with thethe said letter. I gathered that the Sultan this would he derogatory to his rights as an Ruler. considered^ indexjendent will be seen from the above record of the discussions on the Draft Political Agreement and Draft Letter referred to in the preceding paragraph that the Multan*s objections were neither valid nor reasonable and in fact at times rather fatuous. I have often noticed that His Highness when discussing any subject requiring concent ration becomes mentally fatigued very rapidly. At the second interview I had on this subject after we had discuss ed various points lor about one hour the Sultan suddenly seized his head with both hands and exclaimed 'My poor head, my poor heads I cannot understand all these difficult things ax ter this I found it was impossible to continue the discussion. •• As mentioned in my Express Letter No.T/iOl of Cth December 19d7 the Sultan had promised me in Bombay that he would send me a letter from Singapore, where he was to remain for a whole we eh, in v^hich he would set forth in detail his objections to the Draft Political Agreement. As stated above this letter has not xxxxxxx up to the time arrived ox writing^and I thinh that the Sultan has decided to wait and discuss the matter with his father Saiyid Taimur in Japan before replying. I received a telegram from His Highness on &lt;,4th December saying that he had arrived safely in Kobe and that a letter followed. The subject matter of this letter it was not mentioned but^is possible that it may refer to tbe Drai t Political Agreement and it is to be hoped that as a result of the wiser and more experienced counsels of the late Sultan the present Sultan*s somewhat strange objections to the Agreement as put forth to me in Bombay may be found to have been withdrawn.

The following comments on tne Sultan’s objections to tne Agent, Muscat* draft political Agreement may be of use wnen tne question is discussed witn His Highness in London* It is not certain tnat the Sultan will raise tne same objections there, or tnat he will confine himself to them, but it is probable that his objections will follow tne general lines of those ne has raised* 3.

(b) The sultan’s objections might be got over by substituting 'experts' for 'persona'. It could also be explained to the Sultan that the object of tnis clause is to ensure tnat the Company employs as few foreign nationals as possible. &amp;• Major ffatts’ ^araKra^n 4 . Jfr* om our point ta of view the chief use of tne local relations between tne Ruler and the Company being conducted tnrough the Political Agent is that we icnow wnat is going on. As far as tnese relations concern the implementing of the Commercial Agreement tnat is presumably a matter between tne Sultan and the Company. In so far as tnese relatione concern the implementing of tne political Agreement, they concern nis Majesty’s Government. But I do not think that there is any practical danger of collusion between the Sultan and tne Company for the evasion of the terms of the Political Agreement, and if tnere were such collusion this would come out sooner or later, and tne lack of previous knowledge on our part would not reduce tneir liability. Purtnerraore, in regard to ary important discussions between tne Sultan and tne Company, we can, I tninK, rely on tne latter to Keep us sufficiently informed. X am of opinion, \ tnerefore, that if the Sultan is obdurate tnis clause can be omitted. 6. Major Watts’ paragraph 5 . The present right of His Majesty’s Government to any areas for defence and tne otner purposes mentioned in this clause derives from separate agreements with tne Sultan, e.g. tne Civil Air Agreement.-3 If Hie Majesty*® Government require further axeas in the future, these can only Oe acquired from tne Sultan by similar agreement. Tnia being sol do not tninic therefore that the words 'or His jiajesty , 8 Government* strengthen our position materially, am I tninic that in trie last resort they might be omitt ed. ?• Major ffatts* paragraph 6, fnis clause, in my opinion, is essential and it snould be insisted on. I tninic, however, that tne Sultan will agree if an explanation is given to nim on tne following lines. That it is immaterial to tne Sultan wno purchases tne oil i.e. His Majeaty , s Government or any otner customer as in any case ne will receive nia royalty. That tne whole tenour of tne Schedule attached to tne pre-emption clause is in the direction of increasing oil supply and in consequence tne royalties wnicn will accrue to tne Sultan. The Sultan may prove difficult over clause (5) of tne Schedule but nere again it could be explained to nim tnat tne object is to ensure and increase tne supply of oil, with consequent benefit to nim. 8. Major fotta* paragraph 7. (a) The Sultan is of course quite wrong on tnis point. As Major Watts* pointed out to nim, under Article 17 of the concession he nas definitely accepted responsibility for giving the Company 'all tne protection in nis power'. This could again be explained to tne Sultan, and it could be pointed out to him tnat tne opening words of clause 10 strengthens clause i£ of tne concession in nis favour in regard to nis 'prior permission'. (b)/-4- (b) The Sultan did not apparently taice up with Major Watts the second point contained in tMa clause, which he might well have done, as to the reference for decision to the political Resident* Since this would seem to affect his sovereign rights to a greater extent than any to other points he raises I tninic it extremely probable that he will raise this point in London. From our point of view I think tnis provist should De omitted. If the Sultan declares tnat a certain area is unsafe, I do not see now tne Resident coiud poasiciy take tne responsibility of maxing a decision to tne contrary. It is true tnat tnis proviso does occur in clause 10 of tne Trucial Coast Political .Agreements out conditions in tnat area are Quite different from tnose prevailing in .-muscat. Any dispute t catween tne Sultan and the Company on this point should be dealt with by arbitration under Article 26 of tne conces- sion. This part of clause 10 would tnen read: r Vne .Suitan snail not unreasonably withhold such permission, and in any case in wnicn tne Company a eels tnat tne free movement of its personnel witnin trie concession area is being unnecessarily restricted tne matter snail oe referred to arbitration under Article 26 of trie concession*. M ajor Watts* paragraph b . This is in the nature of a general ijaleguara. It is possible, however, that if His Majesty's Government are prepared to concede the points I have suggested above, e.g. in my paragraphs 6 and « (b), an examination or the concession and the Political Agreement vili snow that no inconsistency or conflict is lixely to arise. In tnis case clause 3 (a) of tne latter might be omitted /35/164, 35/86 &amp; 86/12 Telegram From To Repeated Q, Secretary o r State for India, London* Secretary to the Sorernment of India, External Affairs Department, New Delhi* Political Resident on H.XS.

At'ter Compliments. There is no doubt YournHonour is aware of the matter and you will also hear from the Consul at Muscat of my reply to him with further explanations. As you will understand from the purport of my reply to the Consul, I never expected that such a matter as this would arise, after I had signed the agreement with the Oil Company, you had informed me that they would come to me to negotiate in respect of oil development in my state, and for that I thank you. But my requesting you to find me a British Company for oil development in my state was due to the old firm friendship existing between me and the Honourable friend the British Government. perhaps you will remember that when you visited Muscat in the month of April last, we discussed the matter of the lateness of the arrival of the Company*3 representative, whom you said would arrive at Muscat at that time to discuss oil affairs. You did not mention to me that the question of an agreement with the Company ypu had introduced could not be concluded except with the conclusion of a political agreement between them and the British Government and that X also would be involved in ^ this matiter. All these months have passed since concluding the agreement with the Company in June last in the presence of the Consul, when suddenly I receive tne letter in V question and the documents which the Consul sent to me and which I had never expected, because the Consul had never informed me. I did not al all understand that the )2 that the case was so* Had I known/what I know now, I v —^ would not have entered into an agreement with the Company without first asking you to let me know about the political agreement. Then when I had acquainted myself with it and seen what X considered best for my Government I would have intimated my views to you. As you are aware, entering into a commercial agreement is quite different trom enter ing into a political agreement with a Government. There is no doubt that the Government would not wish me to oe treated in a way which might bring trouble upon me irom a political point of view. I am not accustomed to such things* How was I to understand or to know what to expect when the Company approached me for negotiation? I have read the documents sent to me. I 1 rankly ^ay, as you know, I habitually treat you without rsereve in all matters which concern you, because I rely on my own firm friendship with you and your friendship towards me. I do not fully understand the sentences written nor their object, neither do I know what will be the result and effect to my Government in the future if I enter into an agreement such as this political agreement. I assure you that I was neither informed by the Consul nor did he write to me that this matter was dependent on conditions such as have now presented. Had I uten informed or received a letter earlier or had I notified in writing the Honourable Government in writing that I had been informed and had accepted such terms then there would have been no objection. Had the matter been as brief as I was led to believe from their Consul at . | .....

Letter to Consul Major R.P. Watts. A/C. On the 27th November, 1937, I have received from your hands at Bombay your letter dated 27th November, 1937, and I opened It in your presence and started reading its contents. I at once informed you that I did not understand its contents, because you had not informed me beforehand. And after signing and concluding the Oil Agreement *ith the Company *hich you brought me for that purpose, and as requested by me, and now I receive such a letter from you.* You neither said, nor wrote, nor did I understand from you, there were further conditions to be agreed upon between me and the Company for that question depends on what you mentioned in your aforesaid letter. But all I understood and noted was that the question was settled and there remained nothing to be added, let alone this Political Agreement etc. But all that was concerned with and requested hy me was as mentioned in the Agreement with the Company and accepted by me and the Company, and you, as Consul of the British Government, put your own signature as a witness to the Agreement in my presence and that of the Company’s represents- tive who visited Muscat. I must now therefore give full details from the time I asked you to find and select for me a British Company to approach me through you to negotiate about oil in a part of sy State, until I received the above-mentioned letter from you, for I am acquainting our friend His Britannic Majes ty’s Government so that there should be no difficulty about the matter. About three years ago, prior to my departure to Dhofar, in the end of 1935 ( ) X asked you to choose for me a British Company for negotiations about the Oil in my State.(TV) ir'l Ef v - * I gave priority and preference and wanted a British Company in view of the friendship which I entertain towards my Hon'ble friend the British Government which is not hidden to the Hon'ble Government. In 1936 when you visited me at Dhofar you informed me that you have procured a British Company willing to come to an agreement and that their representative would visit me. On ray return to Muscat I was pleased to hear this.In the beginning of the last year on my return to Muscat and your return from Karachi to Muscat in March of the same year, you delivered to me a letter from a certain man called Mr. Holmes. You said that he was representing the Company and he wished to come as early as possible for negotiations. I at once replied agreeing to his coming. He promised you that he would come as soon as possible. But he had not come as he had stated tc you before the Political- Resident in the Persian Gulf arrived at Muscat in April last. Discussions were held about the said man and the Political Resident said that he would arrive shortly. I was waiting for him but he did not come until I wanted to leave for India in June. A week before ny departure you called on me and informed me that you had received an intimation from the Company that a man named Mr. Lermitte would visit Muscat on the Company*s behalf in that week for that purpose in place of Mr. Holmes and requested me to postpone ny departure for another week until he had arrived and negotiations with him had taken place. In view of the interests I acceded to your request and postponed my journey. Mr. Lermitte arrived at Muscat and you wrote a letter to me informing me of the same and that you thought it advisable to send him personally to me as this was a private affair between me and a commercial Company and that you had nothing to dc with it. I at once replied to the effect that that would be quite impossible, because I did not know the Company and it was you who had/-3- &amp; had made the arrangements for me. I therefore asked you to come to me bringing with the man for introduction and then negotiations could be started between us. You approved of this and did as I asked you. After I had made the acquaintance of the Company’s representative, he proposed to me the Company’s terms and negotiations continued until we arrived at an Agree ment on 24th June, 1937. Before it was signed I sent for you and asked you to be present with us. You appeared and then we signed the copies of the Agreement to which you put your signa ture as witness in your capacity as Consul to the British Government. You then told me that our Hon’ble friend His Majesty's Government would conclude a Political Agreement with the Company because it is a British Company and as they had assisted in introducing the Company to me, they were obliged to bind the Company as their interests concerned the Government. You also said that had this Company not been British, the British Government would not have interfered in a matter such as this agreement. I did not hear or understand from you more than this. Afterwards I enquired whether this agreement concerned or affected the conditions of my agreement with the Company or had I anything to do with it. You replied assuring me that this agreement had nothing to do with me, that it concerned the Company and the Government. I replied that if that was the case then there was no objection. After finishing with the signing of the agreement, Mr. Lermitte said that he would sail with me in the same steamer in which I and you were going to Karachi, for the purpose of sending copies of the agreement to hie office in London for registration and also to pay to me the amount arranged to be paid on the signing of the agreement. He sailed with us on 25th June. During our journey I used to meet you and Lermitte and at one of our meetings we discussed the question of Oil in my country and in the course of/1937/ -4~ of conversation you spoke about the agreement to be concluded between the Government and the Company to the same effect as already stated and I did not understand or hear anything further about this. On our arrival at Karachi Mr. Lamitte became ill, but he recovered after a few days whereupon I called on you in the hotel in which both of you were staying. In your presence Mr. lamitte took from me a copy of the Agreement and the modifi cations I had made with him and which had been added to the terms and for which he gave me a receipt to the effect that he had received the same for the purpose of xniag sending it to London with other copies which he had with him as stated above. After wards we signed a document purporting the receipt of money and you attested the same. Then we went to the Eastern Bank at Karachi and he introduced me to the Manager, paid me the money which I credited to my account and closed the transaction. Afterwards I left for Kashmir for a change of climate and that was in the middle of July. After my return to Kuscat and your return many days passed and you did not mention or write to me anything in this connection. Before my departure to Delhi, Mr. Larmitte arrived at Muscat and brought with him the copies of the Agreement and asked me to sign some revisions made in the agreement and I signed them. Ho mention was made to the effect that the agreement depends on some other thing. The time of I my departure to Delhi came and/left, the visit ended and I came to Bombay. You met me for discussing some cases and interviewing Mr. Longrigg, one of the Managers of the said Company, who had come from London and had asked for an interview. We met in your presence, because you had brought him to introduce him to me and to speak to me for him on the subject he bad come for and you then left me. He called on sm me the next day and you were also there but did not say anything about these matters. On 27th Hovember,-5- A3&gt; 1937, three days before noy departure to India, you called on me and delivered the letter quoted in the beginning of this letter and asked me to send you a reply before leaving Bombay. I rep.iec that I was not able to reply because I did not understand then anything of the contents of the letter or the documents, neither had 1 expected to receive such a letter because I had not been forewarned of the matter contained in the said letter, and that it was necessary for me to explain everything to the Government in my reply to your letter after having thought the matter over which could be done on ny arrival at London, God willing. It was necessary to discuss with the Government the matters about which I knew nothing before entering into an agreement with the Company, because as you are aware the conclusion of a commercial agreement is different from the case of a Political agreement. In an important Political matter like this you should have written me a letter so that you could know from my reply whether I agreed or not# And as you are aware I do not wish to bind my Government to Political agreements concerning which I know not what the future effects will be. I am sure that the Hon*ble the British Government in London will be distressed that I should receive such treatment as I have received at your hands, espe~ cially as I have always treated, and will treat, you in all matters with complete frankness as is required of the firm friendship existing between me and the Hon*ble friend, the British Government. You neither wrote to me officially nor informed me verbally prior to the conclusion of the agreement with the Company of this matter that I might consider it and follow the best course for my Government. If the case is as stated in the body of your letter then I do not see why the Company's representative has signed, agreed to the conditions and paid the money nor why you have put your signature to the agreement. If the case were dependent on conditions other than those/- 6 - those concluded between me and the Company I would not have signed the agreement nor accepted the money in the uckk month of July. Since when I have received in advance the instalment which was due for the 1st half of this year. For the above reasons I am at a loss to understand how in this matter the considerations to which I am accustomed have not been accorded me, and request you to convey the text of this my letter to the Hon'ble friend, the British Government in London as soon as possible, so that they may know the real facts and for which I thank you. As you are aware I strongly dislike any misunder standing between me and the Hon'ble friend the Government, as such a thing is abhorrent to me, as I believe it is to the Hon'ble Government. I hope that the matter is now clear to you and that there is no confusion. On my arrival in London, I will inform the Hon'ble Government about this matter and will give them full information so that they may be aware of the real facts since I fear that a recrudence of similar treatment by their representatives in Muscat may jeopardise the friendship I hold for the Hon’ble Government. Yesj so far the Company have not returned my copy of the Agreement which they took from me for registration in London with a promise of its return, and I request you to ask the Company to return it to me because this took place in your presence at Karachi. It is understood that I will not agree to bind the Company to any condition beyond those mentioned in the agreement conclu ded between me and the Company last year in which they Company acouiscied and in accordance with which I will act as will the Company for their part.

The only point in the Sultan's letter which appears to call for comment is that he now admits that before the agree ment was finally signed I informed him that His Majesty's Govern ment would require the Company to enter into a separate Political Agreement with them. Actually I told the Sultan this not on the day the agreement was signed, as stated by him vide paragraph 3 of his letter, but several days previously, telecrsm HI of 27th June 1937. iP' r*7 S'© % Translation of a letter dated, ban Francisco tiie 2Utii Dhil Hijjah 1356, corresponding to the 21st February 1938, from his Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman to the political Agent, Muscat. After Compliments, On the 27th Hovember 1937 We received from your hands your letter dated 27th November 1937 in Bombay. We opened it in your presence and started reading it. ’we informed you at once that its contents were incomprehensible to us, because you had never informed us that We would receive such a letter from you, neither before nor after the conclusion and signing of the Oil Agreement with the Ccmpany, which you had at our request recommended to us for this purpose, fou had neither said nor written to us, and i t we had neither understood it from you nor had Zb eon one of the conditions agreed upon between us and the Company, that the matter was dependant upon the conditions mentioned in your letter quoted above. All that We had understood was that the matter .vas settled, and that nothing of the sort oi a i-olitical Agreement remained for us to enter into. All our interests, concerns and obligations were laid down in the Agreement with the Company, which were accepted both by the Company and ourselves, and attested by you, aa His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, by affixing your siganture to all the copies of the Agreement in the presence of Ourselves and the Company’s Kepresenta tive who was in Muscat. Accordingly, We must give a detailed account |,of the affairJ from the time that Vi8 made our request to you to select a british Company to approach us through you with a view to prospecting for oil in a portion of our territory until vVe receiveeUhe above- mentioned letter from you- We give the following detailed account ( of what happened) for the information of His Majesty's Government, so that no misunderstanding should arise2 ^rise in regard to tills affair. • Some three years ago, i.e. before our departure towards the end of 1935 to Dhofar, We asjced you to look for and select a .British company to search for oil in our territory. We gave priority to and preferred and wanted a -British company in view of the friendly feeling We bear towards our friend His Majesty^ Government which is not unknown to them. In 1936 when you visited us in Dhofar you informed us that you had found a British company who desired to maice an agreement with us. fou said that their representative would come to see us when We arrived in Muscat. We were pleased to hear this. When we returned to Muscat in the beginning of last year, and you also returned from Karachi in March of the same year, you delivered to us a letter from a Mr.Hounes. You said t-uat he represented the Company, and that he wanted to come as soon as possible to open discussions. We replied agreeing to his coming. He then promised to you that he would arrive as soon as possible, but he did not do so quickly as he informed you. In the meantime the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf arrived in Muscat in April when a discussion took plgjg about the said representative, and the political hesident^that he would come very soon. We remained waiting for him but he did not arrive until it was time for us to leave for India in June. One wee.*: before our departure you came to us and informed us that you had received an intimation from the Company that an employee of theirs named Mr.juermitte would arrive in Muscat tnat week for the same purpose instead of Mr.Holmes. You requested us to postpone our departure for another week until the man could arrive and discussions were With entered into with him. JKX our own interests in view We concurred to your request and postponed our departure. Mr.hermitte arrived in Muscat, and you wrote informing us of the fact and that you considered it suitable that he should come to us alone, it being a personal affair between us and a commercial company in which you were not interested. In reply We wrote to you, saying that that$3 m ) --3— ‘ t that was impossible, as We did not know the Company and it was you who recommended it to us. We proposed that you should come with the Company's Kepresentative to introduce him to us, and that We should then proceed to discuss natters with him . you approved of and acted according to Our proposal. Having been ‘ °duced to Us the Company's Representative put forth his Company's conditions and we proceeded with the discussions with him until We concluded the agreement with him on the 24th June 1937. 3. Before signing the agreement, however, we asked you to be present. When you came we started signing the copies of agreement, and you, as the British Consul, attested the copies, fou then said to Us that Our friend His Majesty's Government would enter into a political agreement with Company, it being a British Company, and that having helped the Company by recomend ing it to Us, His Majesty's Government considered it necessary to bind the former with certain ^.v, axxjDWj**** winch concerned them alone. You added that had this Company not been British, the British Government would not have made it their business to enter Into such an agreement. Besides this We heard nothing from you, 4 . Afterwards we asked you whether this agreement would interfere with or affect the conditions of our agreement with the Company, or whether it concerned Us in any way. Your reply was reassuring and to the effect that we would not be involved in the agreement which only concerned the Company and His Majesty's Government. VTe replied 'If such is the case there is no harm', 5. After signing the agreement Hr. Aermitte said that h was leaving by the same steamer as We and you were both leaving for Karachi, and that from there he would send copies of ;ne agreement for registration in his Company's Head Office in London, and also that he would pay us the amount then due on account of signing the agreement. He left with Us on the 25 thr 11 — 4— 25th June* During the journey We used to meet you and iar* ijermitte on hoard tiie ship. On one occasion tie talked about oil and our territories, and you referred to the agreement, which His Majesty’s Government proposed to conclude with the Company, and in effect your talk was the same as stated above. We neither understood nor heard any thing more from you. 6. On our arrival in Karachi nr. r*ermitte fell sick, but recovered after a few days, and accordingly we called on you at the Hotel where you stayed. In your presence Hr. Lermitte took the copy of the agreement and the altera* tions that *e have made with him, which have been included in the terms of the agreement, and gave no a receipt for them, because he /anted to send them to London, together with the other copies which he already had, as stated above. Then ;.e signed the money receipts which were attested by you, and We and Mr. Lermitte x&amp;kx together went to the Eastern Bank at Karachi, and the latter introduced Us to the Manager and paid Us the money which was credited to Uur account. Thus the work was finished, and w'e proceeded to Kashmir for a change in the nuddie of July. 7 # After Uur return and yours ^ to Man cat a consider able time pciaeed but you never said nor wrote anything in tlixs connection. Before uur departure to i&gt;eJLhi Mr. Lermitte arrived in ilusca t with the copies of the agreement, and s t asked Ue to sign agair^6certain alterations that had been made in the agreement. We signed against them, nothing was said to the effect that the agreement was dependent upon anything else. Tho time for uur departure to Delhi came and We left. an 8. When Uur visit came to^end We came down to Bombay and you also arrived there to discuss with Us certain matters and to arrange for an interview between Us and Mr. Longrigg, on 61 the Directors of the abovementioned Company, who arrivedt arriyed from jLondon and desired to see Us. He wae introduced by you aiid in your presence «/e discussed with, him the ques tion on account of which he had come to see Us. Next day he called in your company also, but you mentioned nothing at ail regarding this question. On November 27th, 1937, thx i.e. 3 days before we left Bombay you called on us, delivered to us the letter referred to in the beginning of this letter, and asked Us to reply to it before We left Bombay. We said that we could not write any reply thereto, because We could not then undertsand the contents of the said letter and the other documents, and that We never expected to receive such a letter, nor had We previously been informed by you of the purport of what you wrote therein. We added that We ought to explain everything to His Majesty's Government in a letter addressed to you, when we had time enough to think the matter over. when We arrive in bondon We will discuss with -^he- officials tnis question of which we had no knowledge before an entering intoZa&amp;reement with the company. For you are aware that to bind oneself in a commercial agreement is entirely different from binding oneself in a political agreement. In such an important political matter you ought to have written us a letter to find out from Our reply thereto whether We agree d to it or not. As you are aware We do not want to bind future ♦ our government by political agreements the effect of which We cannot foresee. We are sure that Hie Majesty's wi th Government would not agree that you should deal Us in this way. For we have always been dealing with you in the most this candid way, ancj^is necessary in view of our firm friendship with His Majesty's Government. You neither wrote to us officially nor told Us xax verbally of this question before the conclusion of the agree ment with the Company, in order to think over it and decide what was best for Our Government. If the matter had been as you stated in the beginning of your letter, why then did the Company's representative sign and accept the conditions andand pay the money, and why did you attest the Agreement? Had the question been dependent upon any condition otner tnan those laid down between us and the Company We would not have signed the Agreement and received the money in July and later an advance of the instalment due for the first hall ol this year. Therefore, We cannot understand any of these matters, lor they have been introduced to us in a way quite dinerent from what We have been accustomed to formerly. We, therefore, request you to convey the contents ol our letter to His A-ajesty s Government as soon as possible, so as to be acquainted with the real position of the affair. As you are aware We do not at all like that any misunderstanding should taice place between us and His Majesty’s Government - this is a matter which does not appeal to us, nor, We believe, to His Majesty’s Government. We hope now that the question is very clear to you and that there is no misconception about it. On our arrival in London, We shall inform His Majesty’s Government about this question and shall make known to them more of the reports We have got lor their information and clear understanding of the real position, for We fear the recurrence of such matters from their Representativej in Muscat. We shall affirm our true friendship to His Majesty’s Government. ^q o Further,so far the Company has not returned to us our copy of the Agreement, which was taken from us to be registered in London and returned to us. We would therefore request you to write to the Company and ask tiiem to return it to us, as it was taicen from us in your presence at Aar&amp;chi. It is to be understood that We shall not agree to bind ourselves to the Company by any further conditions than those contained in the Agreement concluded with it last year. We shall act # according to what we agreed to in the Agreement, and the Company on their part should fulfil their undertakings to us in that Agreement.

(Aitchison XI, p.319, No.XX) Sm Ti enchard Fox/le and I saw His Higlmess tne Sultan this morning. The Sultan had previously stated his -position, representing that it was not male clear to him before he signed the Concession given to Petroleum Concessions Limited that it was subject to the approval of His Majesty’s Government and that it would be accompanied by a 'Political” Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company which he would be asked to recognise in an exchange of letters. He had said that His Majesty's Government and the Companyi/iere free to make any agreement they liked on the matter, but that it was no concern of his* He would not admit that the position had been made clear to him by Major Watts. A. sir Trenchard Fowle explained to the Sultan that the basis for the procedure to which he took objection was the undertaking given by his father in his letter of 10th January, 1923, whicn with the other obligations descending from his father was accepted by His Highness upon his accession (in a letter dated 10th February, 1932). The Sultan said that he did not regard this undertaking as binding on him; the obligations he accepted in 1932 were those recorded on his files, and his files showed that his father, when it was explained to him in connexion with the possible termination of the Arms Traffic Subsidy that the grant of the subsidy was at the outset personal to Saiyid Faisal, wrote to the Political -igent to assert his view that if that were so then aiiy promises made by him to Government were personal to himself and did not descend to his successors. The Sultan therefore die. not regard the 1923 undertaking a s descending upon him. Sii T. i’ owle said chat to the best of his recollection he had not seen this letter, and the Sultan said he had no copy v/ith him. It was made clear to the Sultan that such a view V&lt;ri K-tl, undermined/— 2 . undermined the undertaliing given 'by him in his letter of February, 1932, and v/as entirely unacceptable. Further discussion showed that he did not feel really sure of his ground. 3 Sir Trenchard Fo' r le then proposed, leaving aside the question of principle, to ;,o through a revised draft of the political agreement and of a letter to be sent to the Sultan in connection therewith. These drafts were prepared, in consultation with the interested Government departments and with Petroleum Concessions Limited, with a view to meeting as far as possible the objections expressed by the Sultan to Major Matts last November in Lombay. The Sultan tool: exception to the Article]of the draft agreement relating to 0)the employment of personnel by the Company; he said he had no objection to the employment of skilled persons of nritish + Art. 16(b) or other foreign nationality, but he required, in accordance „ /t. 1© with the ^Concession, that the labourers to be employed should be his own subjects or drawn from the neighbouring Arao countries, since such persons would be under his jurisdiction. Otherwise he had no objection to the revised draft agreement. Nor had he any objection to the terms of the revised draft letter except the last sentence. There was no need, he said, for this reference to the apx^roval of His Majesty’s G-overnment, and he objected particularly to the statement that the Company would be informed of it. Muscat, he said, was independent, and it was called independent by Government, out if the approval of Government were required before he could give an oil concession then he 'was really not free, and it was made obvious to others that his independence was not a realioy. lie was told that there would probably be little objection to omitting the last sentence of the draft letter, but tha Is this Y/ould not alter the view of His Majesty’s Government tha c their approval of the Concession v/as required. Sir/( XCA ) ^ Sir Trenchard Fov/le then referred to the negotiations which were taking place in London with His Highness for the grant of a concession in G-wadur 5 and said that here t o His Majesty’s Government considered that the concession world require their approval. They had so informed the Companies. It was explained to the Sultan that a particular reason for this stipulation in the case of Gwadur a as the absence of a definite boundary between Gwsdur and Kalat* It would be essential to demarcate the frontier if an oil concession were to be operated. The Sultan agreed, and was willing that when a concession was granted the matter should be discussed and arranged between him and the Government of India (not between him and the Khan of Kalat). But there was no immediate need for it. Because of this obstacle of the necessity for the approval of Government he hadi decided not to proceed with the negotiations with the Burmah Oil Company and Indian Oil Concessions. He professed not to be disappointed if there were no oil concession in Gwadur (or in Muscat) and if no payments were made to him. He added however that of course he was entirely free to give any concessions he liked in respect of minerals (not oil), since Government could not point to any undertaking in that respect. (3d.) J.P.GIBSOK.P.Z.3179/1938. Muscat Oil Concessions’ Political Agreement. I called on His Highness the Sultan today in order to discuss with him certain amendments in the revised draft Political Agreement and draft letter suggested in order to meet the points raised by him on the 27th April. In place by telephone P the Company Concessions to import skilled and technical employees the might be expected 1 d Company shall not employ persons of other than British accept) nationality without the consent of the Sultan and of His Majesty’s Government (or the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf) 1 '. The Sultan had no objection to this alternative. As the understanding discussed below, to omit the second half of the last sentence (from the words beginning 'after which...'). The Sultan accepted this also. He also, on going through the drafts again, made certain minor suggestions on which I said I thought his wishes could be met. These were in the Agr eement: Article 5, omit the words 'and of the Political Officers subordinate to him'; Article 7, for the words, 'by or on behalf of the Sultan' read 'by the Sultan or by any person authorised by him'; Article 8, in the last line read 'by the Sultan or, with his permission, by His Majesty's i/ Government or their agent'; while in the draft letter he asked that the opening words should indicate by whom His Majesty's Government had been furnished with a copy of the concessions. &lt;2. As regards the last sentence of the draft letter I informed the Sultan that His Majesty's Government would consider it essential, notwithstanding the omission of the second part (■h^hich, 0 £ A r ticle 3 of the Agreement the following 4- was proposed: h^d been q ( lQ ascertained 'In exercising their right under Article 16(b; of their ^» of their regards the draft letter I said we were prepared, subject to of//\&lt;M i;&gt; y of the sentence, to send His Highness in due course a letter indicating that they had no objection to, or had approved, the concessions granted by him. Otherwise, I said, there would be nothing to show that the concessions had received the approval of Government as was required under his father's undertaking of 1923. The Sultan displayed a very strong objection to the sending of such a letter. He was, he said, quite prepared, subject to the minor points he had raised, to assent to the terms and conditions of the draft Political Agreement and letter, but he could not see why the subsequent letter of approval was required. Was it not enough for His Majesty's Government that he was willing to agree to the conditions laid down in the letter relating to the Political Agreement? That other sign of His Majesty's Government's approval was needed? Had not His Majesty's Government brought the Company to him and thereby indicated that they were favourable to the granting of a concession by him to the Company? I ex plaine d that this had shown that the Company was not disapproved of by His Majesty's Government, but there still remained the terms of the concession, as to which Government might wish to make some suggestions to His Highness, and there was also the necessity in the view of Government, that an understanding on certain matters (i.e. the Political Agreement) should be reached between His Majesty's Government and the Company. 3 The Sultan then said that he had not been told at the time of the negotiations that the approval of Government was required; mention had indeed been made of a political agreement but he had understood this was a matter between Government and the Company with which he was not concerned. He enrphasised that he had not asked for the approval of Government, and yet this was the procedure that should have been followed if the 1923 promise were regarded as binding on/3 . on him. The 1923 undertaking required that permission should be given by Government before the Sultan granted a concession; the proper procedure would therefore have been for him to seek approval before the concession was signed. If Government were now to send a letter intimating their approval of the concession the letter must be in reply to a request of his, but he had not asked for it and it was not he wh o had furnished a copy of the concessions to Governraent (cf. his desire to amend the opening words of the draft letter). [j I said it seemed that what His Highness really wished was to be released from the 1923 undertaking. He said he did not regard it as binding on him, and that it was not included in the obligations which he accepted on his accession. I said this was a view that Government could not possibly accept It would enable him to repudiate any of the obligations incurred by his predecessors whenever he thought it convenient; even a solemn treaty could be disowned and Government could not tell on which of the undertakings of his predecessors they could rely. The Sultan said that a treaty was subject to revision but the 1923 undertaking on our view would be perpetually binding on Muscat and he could not assent to that. He professed to draw a distinction between ooligations which were accepted by a Sultan on behalf of himself and his successors, and undertakings, like that of 1923, which were merely given by a Sultan in his own name. He referred again * to the letter his father had written. I said it could only affect the matter if the terms of the letter had been accepted by Government, and so far I had failed to trace the correspondence in our records. If His Highness wished to be released from the promise of 1923 it was no doubt open to him to pursue the matter with the Political Resident. For the present the view of Government was that the promise had devolved on him when he succeeded his father, and for that —_—~~— VdN'L’l, b Jr~\ reason they considered it essential that they should intimate their approval of the concessions. After further discussion the Sultan eventually said that he would agree to the exchange of letters relating to the Political Agreement and recognised that he would subsequently receive a letter informing him that Government approved* or did not object to* the concessions. This letter would not be sent in response to any request of his, and he would merely file it in his records and refrain from assenting to the procedure by acknowledging its receipt. (Sd.) J. P.

Before the Sultan’s arrival in London the drafts were examined in the light of the Sultan’s objections in consultation with the interested Departments with the object of reducing them as far as possible to a form which might perhaps be acceptable to the Sultan. For this purpose it was decided to have two Political Agreements, of which, dealing with pre-emption, would not be shown to the Sultan at all, and to omit from the exchange of letters the drafts relating to the establishment of a r Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE.,CSI.,MV0., bank/ ^ &gt; -U . ,-l i V W . , Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, SIMLA.O 'bank at Muscat. At a later stage the possibility was considered of concluding an agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government without bringing the Sultan into the matter at all, but as this course v/as felt to be rather a jois a Her, though not altogether impossible, it was decided, after hearing the Sultan’s views, to try to secure his assent to an exchange of letters relating to the revised draft agreement. I am now to enclose the notes of two discussions with the Sultan on the subject, together with a copy of a revised draft Political Agreement and draft letter in a form which the Sultan is prepared to accept. It is proposed, if the Foreign Office concur, to conclude two agreements with Petroleum Concessions Limited, one dealing with pre-emption, the other in the terms of the enclosed draft, and to carry out the consequent exchange of letters with the Sultan after his return to Muscat, concluding with a letter informing the Sultan, with reference to his father’s undertaking of 1923, that His Majesty’s Government have no objection to the concessions granted to the Company, As will be seen from the enclosures the root of the Sultan’s objections to the Political Agreement v/as his persistent refusal to acknowledge that the undertaking of 1923/i 1 1923 '.‘ r as binding on him.

Revised drafts of the Agreement and exchange of letters were prepared to meet the Sultan’s known objections as far as possible. He agreed to these, with some minor modifications, but persisted in asserting his view that his father's undertaking of 1923 was not binding on him and therefore that the concessions did not require the formal approval of Government. Obviously we could not accept such a view, but it is worth remarking that, so far as one could judge here, the Sultan seems to be actuated in this and other matters by motives of prestige rather than by any desire to embarrass Government by withholding his consent from any particular requests to which Government attach importance.^y/z.

As you will see, the Govern- / raent of India have taken the view that Sultan Talmur’s ' l^tteJo^Marcf 192^ does not justify the present Sultan's repudiation of his father’s undertakings, since that letter was never accepted by His Majesty's Govt, or the Govt, of India. I do not know, however, how far that argument would be valid and I have therefore examined as a natter of interest the other undertakings given by Sultan Taimur regarding which the present Sultan could take up a similar attitude. So far as I can discover from Aitchison’s Treaties the only other undertaking of a perpetual nature entered into by Sultan Taimur was No. XIX of the 17th Feby. 1921 adhering bo the Arms Traffic Convention of 1919. In - this undertaking there is no mention of the Sultan's successors, so that the position is precisely the same as in the case of No .XX regarding oil.

Letter Ho.I. 3. Powle has now produced a copy of sultan told Talmur’s letter'of'thVl9th :/arch 1923, which the present Sultan has quoted, but he has not commented on the effect which this letter has on the toltan’s repudiation of his father's obligations. It seems to the Government of India that the matter is not entirely free from difficulty, since It is 1 clear that Sultan Talmur in 1923 definitely declared that no agreement entered Into by him would be binding upon .his successors, unless the agreement Itself contained a mention of his successors. The undertaking regarding oil contained in the letter to Major toe of the 10th January 1923 (Vide* e (Vide Altchlson’s Treaties Vol.Xl page 319) Includes no mention of his successors, so that there is sole force In the sultan's argument that. In vies of his father’s letter, the undertaking with regal’d to oil did not descend to hlrn and was not covered by his own letter of 10th February 1J32. His itfcjesty’s Govt, can presumably reoly that the Political i^esldent of the time declined to accept Sultan Talmur's letter, and conveyed a personal message to the dultan through the Political Agent, 'uscat that It would be most inadvisable In the Julian's own interest for any such general declaration as Ills Highness proposed to(for.arded to Government. The Julian did not protest or Insist uoon his declaration being forwarded and since neither the Govt, of India nor His Majesty's Govt, were informed of the letter, they do not consider themselves bound by its terras. The validity of such a rejoinder Is perhaos onen oi , . to doubt, but it aooears from your letter i.Z.2210/38 of the 19th Way 1938 that His Highness the Sultan Is actuated rather by motives of prestige than by any desire to embarrass Government and if his M anour pnopre” is satisfied by the procedure now suggested by Fo*le f it is perhaps un- | necessary to pursue the Question further in connection with the undertaking of 1923 regarding oil.

Government however had now decided that the subsidy should cease when he ceased to rule. His Highness made no demur at the time but a few days later asked me if it was really the case that/ the subsidy had been personal to Saiyid i-aisal. X replied that I thought there could be no doubt about this but would look up the correspondence and refer him to the relative documents. 2. I have now studied the files at Muscat and at Bushire. It is clear that Government intended that the subsidy should be personal to Saiyid Faisal but it is not clear that this was ever ex plained to him. The referencestto it which I have come across make it seem that the point that the subsidy was to be personal to Saiyid n isul waajunnoticed or was|lost sight of.

(Prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938.)— (Received in Foreign Office, June 11.) G eneral. FOR the purposes of this summary the Arabian Peninsula may be said to lie south of a line joining Aqaba at the northern end of the Red Sea to Koweit at the northern end of the Persian Gulf. Included in this area are the following States, sheikhdoms or territories, in most of which petroleum concessions have been, or are likely to be, obtained :— (A) Under British sovereignty or protection— Koweit. Bahrein. Qatar. Trucial Sheikhdoms— Ajman. Abu Dhabi. Debai. Ras-al-Khaimah. Sharjah. ITmm-al-Quwaim. Aden Colony. Aden Protectorate. (B) Independent States— Saudi Arabia— (i) Red Sea Area. (ii) Nejd (a) Hasa. (b) Remainder of Nejd. The Yemen. Muscat and Oman.Q (C) Miscellaneous— Koweit Neutral Zone. Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 2. As Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are interested in the majoritv of the above-mentioned territories it has been thought worth while to include v in this summary a short note on the genesis and composition of the company. 3. The company, which was first registered in October 1935, is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the change of name was decided upon in order to facilitate the securing of concessions outside Iraq. The whole of the shares in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) are held by the same interests and in the same piopoitions as obtain in the Iraq Petroleum Company, and the boards of the two companies are similarly composed, except that the Board of Petroleum 0) His Majesty’s Government exercise by custom only a considerable degree of influence over the affairs of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 9918 [330 1—1] B2 Concessions (Limited) does not include an Iraqi Government Director. Lord Cadman is chairman of both companies. The shareholding of the Iraq Petroleum Company is divided as follows :—- British— Anglo-Iranian Oil Company 23 -75 Dutch— Royal Dutch Shell 23 -75 French— Compagnie Francaise des Petroles 23 -75 American— Near East Development Company (i.e., Standard Oil of New Jersey and Socony-Vacuum in the proportion of'50-50) ... 23-75 Participation and Investments (Limited)— 4. The concession for this territory is held by the Koweit Oil Company (Commercial Agreement, dated the 23rd December, 1934; Political Agreement^ 2 ) dated the 5th March, 1934), the capital of which is held jointly by the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Oil Corporation of America (Mellon Group). 5. One well was put down on the north side of Koweit Bay, but only small quantities of oil were found. Another well has been drilled at Burgan. south of Koweit Bay, and was successful in striking oil. Koweit Neutral Zone. 6. The boundaries between Koweit and Nejd were settled at the Uquair Conference of November 1922, when certain territory was recognised as common to these two States. Under this settlement the Rulers of Koweit and Nejd were to enjoy equal rights in the zone until such time as a fresh agreement should be arrived °t between them. Consequently, neither Ruler can grant an oil concession in the zone without the consent of the other. 7. Matters in regard to oil negotiations in the Neutral Zone have, in consequence, reached a deadlock. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) cannot move because the Sheikh of Koweit, to whom application has been made, refuses to grant an option in respect of his share of the oil rights in the zone, since he considers that he is entitled to all the rights in the zone and hopes to obtain them when Ibn Saud dies. Petroleum Concessions (Limited), however, have been informed by the Sheikh of Koweit that he will, if he changes his mind, inform them before any other company. On the other hand, Ibn Saud, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, who is now thought to favour exploitation of the zone by a British company, is committed to the Standard Oil Company of California by reason of a special agreement with that company, under which they received a preferential position in respect of Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone much the same as that which they received in regard to the unallotted areas in Nejd (see paragraphs 2U-28 below). 8. Oil development in Bahrein is being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company (Limited) under a lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein on the 29th December, 1934, and modified on the 3rd June, 1936. The lease covers practically the whole of the Island of Bahrein, and runs for a period of fifty-five years from the 1st January, 1935. Up to the end of 1937 58 wells had been drilled or were about to be drilled, 33 were producing, and 14 were shut-in Production during 1937 amounted to approximately 1,108,894 tons. concessionary company and His Majesty’s Government, to which the Ruler concerned is usually an assenting party, by which the company undertakes not to transfer the concession to non-British interests and to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government generally.

Negotiations in respect of the area belonging to the Sheikh of Bahrein, but not allotted to the Bahrein Petroleum Company in their lease, have been carried on between the sheikh on the one hand and both Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and the Bahrein Petroleum Company, on the other, but so far without definite result. 10 The Bahrein Petroleum Company was incorporated in Canada in 1929 the whole of the share capital being subscribed by the Standard Oil Company of California. In 1936 an agreement was reached between the Standard Oil Company and the Texas Corporation, whereby the latter company obtained a half interest in the Bahrein Petroleum Company. As the Texas Oif Corporation has markets in various Eastern countries, this arrangement secures an outlet for the refined products obtained from the refinery recently erected in Bahrein. Qatar. 11. The oil rights in this territory were originally granted to the Anglo- 1 ersian Oil Company on the 17th May, 1935. A political agreement was entered into on the 5th June, 1935. The agreement, which runs for a term of seventy-five years, was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) (the operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) in Qatar) on the 5th February, 1937° Geological survey work has been carried out and arrangements have been made to commence deep drilling operations in the autumn of 1938. ^ difficulty has arisen between His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government with regard to the boundaries between Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud claims a frontier which in effect overlaps the limits of the concession held by Petroleum Development (Qatar) (Limited) and indicated in the map attached to the concession. His Majesty’s Government do not admit Ibn Sand’s claim, but have offered him a frontier which, while lying to the south of the Qatar concession boundary, is nevertheless beyond what they legard as the legal limit laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The Tracial Sheikhdoms. 13. The position in the Trucial States is as follows 14 Ajman. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) held an option giving them the exclusive right to explore for oil in this territory for a period of two years The option period expired on the 22nd January, 1938, but the company have so far failed to induce the sheikh to grant an oil concession. Abu Dhabi. The option of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) expired on the 3rd January, 1938. Negotiations for a concession were recently suspended as the sheikh is proving difficult. 16. Debai.

An application for an oil exploration licence in respect of this territory has been made by Petroleum Concessions (Limited) and also jointly bv the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have priority, and the Protectorate authorities have been recommended to grant that company an exclusive exploration permit for a term of two years, after which the other companies could be given an exclusive permit in respect of the territory not retained by Petroleum Concessions (Limited). A draft of the exploration permit has been agreed between the Colonial Office and the [330 1-1] B 24 company, and sent to the Governor for consideration, in the meantime Peti oleum Concessions (Limited) have been given permission to send an exploiation pa it the Protectorate (see also note under “ Muscat and Oman ).

The concession runs for a P e [ 10 f, of /^ t y &gt;'f“ s and covers the whole of the Red Sea coast of Saudi Arabia o a depth of 100 ki (together with the Farsan and other islands and territorial waters). Prospec g work has been carried out by Petroleum Development (Western Arajua) (Limited) the local operating company of Petroleum Concessions (Limited) but w exception oAhe Farsan Islands and a very small stretch of the coast the results have been disappointing. Saudi Arabia: (ii) l&lt;Iejd. ^ 22. (a) Hasa. —The oil rights in this area were conceded to the ^nc ar Oil Company of California by Ibn Baud on the 27th May, l^-The con cession has since been transferred to the California ra mn , i Company, a subsidiary company, the share capital of whic is w Y • Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation equally, concession runs for a period of sixty years. The area of the concession as se ou in the relevant article of the concession agreement is as follows : “All of Eastern Saudi Arabia, from its eastern boundary (mcluding islands and territorial waters), westward to the westerly edge o, the J)ah ana, and from the northern boundary to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia provided that from the northern end of the westerly edge of the Lahana the westerly boundary of the area in question shall continue in a straight him north 30 degrees west, to the northern boundary of Saudi Arabia and f om the southern end of the westerly edge of the Dahana such boundary shall continue in a straight line south, 30 degrees east, to the southern boundary of Saudi Arabia.” 23. Drilling has been carried out by the company s o me found It has recently been reported that a well giving 3,400 barrels oil per d a v has been brought in. Some of the oil from Hasa is being taken to Bahrein tv refinin' It fs also understood that plans for the development of a port nn the Hasa coast are under consideration and that the necessary t la will shortly be prepared by the Admiralty on the basis of information supp ie bv the company as the result of a survey carried out by them. . , ~ 24 (b) Remainder of Nejd.—The position as regards oil exploration rigii in territory of Saudi Arabia not included in the Red Sea concessions referred to above, is uncertain. It was believed at the time that tl ^ Hasa concession agreement had been supplemented by a special agreement or “ secret clause,” giving the Standard Oil Company of California some km o an notion on this territory, but details were lacking. . . . 25 Information has recently been received, however, which points to the probability that on the 29th May, 1933, the Saudi Arabian Government and he roZany agreed upon a modified form of the concession signed on the OTftf M/referred to in paragraph 22), the modifications consisting of the addi- Uob o^twiextralrGcl s, numbered respectively 3 and 7, which have been mserted irtheir appropriate positions in the body of the original agreement of the 27th May, the subsequent articles being appropriately renumbered, and a revised version ofthe addi tional articles (or special agreement) is to accord to the Standard Oil Company of California— “a oreference right to acquire an oil concession covering the balance o Eastern Saudi Arabia extending as far west of the westerly boundary of the exclusive area {i.e., the Hasa concession area) as the contact between the sedimentary and igneous formations. HG Maiestv’s Government are not at present aware whether or where Sis ‘ ‘contact line ” has been established. There is presumab y an area uncovered by any “slonor preference rights between the “ contact line,’ wherever that may be, and the eastern boundary of the Red Sea concession.5 27. A further provision is that the Standard Oil Company of California shall have the right to recover “by means of deductions from one-half of the royalties due to the Government ' tlie amount of two loans totalling £50,000 gold received by the Saudi Arabian Government from the company. 28. On the same date as the conclusion of this modified agreement letters /ere exchanged by the company and the Saudi Arabian Government defining the company’s preference rights in regard to (a) “the balance of Eastern Saudi Arabia” referred to in paragraph 26 above, and (b) the Koweit Neutral Zone (see paragraph 7 above). The effect of these preference rights in (a) is to entitle the company to acquire an oil concession on terms equal to those which may be offered to the Saudi Arabian Government by another company. If the Standard Oil v ^ Company of California elect not to exercise their right, the Saudi Arabian Government is free to accept the other company’s offer. Otherwise, the Standard Oil Company of California’s preference right shall continue at least so long as the provisions of the special agreement remain in force. , Ir* The Yemen. 29. No concession has so far been obtained in this territory owing to the attitude of the Imam \ ahya, who opposes the exploitation of his country by foreign interests. The French interests in Petroleum Concessions (Limited) have, how ever, been successful in inducing the Imam to permit two geologists to visit the Yemen for a period of six months. Muscat and Oman. 30. Two concessions^) have been obtained from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman by Petroleum Concessions (Limited), one in respect of Muscat and Oman except the district of Dhofar and the other in respect of Dhofar. Both commer cial agreements are dated the 24th June, 1937, and run for a period of seventy- five years. The Sultan at first showed himself averse from being associated in any way with any political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the company. This question was, however, discussed with the Sultan during his visit to this country in April of this year, and the Sultan in the end agreed to be associated with such an agreement in a modified form. 31. An aerial exploration which it is hoped to carry out in the eastern portion of the Aden Protectorate will probably include the western portion of Muscat and Oman. Refinery Agreement with Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 32. A general Refinery Agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited) on the 5th February, 1937. Briefly, the agreement provides that whenever the production of crude oil in the areas over which the company hold, or may hold, oil concessions in the Persian Gulf area reaches a total of 500,000 tons per annum, the company shall erect, on a site to be agreed, a refinery or refineries with a total capacity of not less than 250,000 tons per annum, unless it can be shown to the satisfaction of His Majesty’s Government that this would be precluded by commercial considerations. The agreement also provides for a re-examination of the question of the refinerv capacity in the event of the total annual production exceeding 1 million tons per annum. Pre-emption of Oil in the Event of an Emergency. 33. The political agreements entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and Petroleum Concessions (Limited), in respect of the concessions secured by the company in Qatar, Debai, Sharjah and Ras-al-Khaimah, provide, inter alia, that in the event of a state of national emergency or war (of the existence of which His Majesty’s Government shall be the sole judge) His Majesty’s Govern ment shall have the sole right of pre-emption of all crude oil obtained under the concessions and of all the products thereof. His Majesty’s Government have also the right to require the company to the extent of any refining capacity it may have ( s ) A separate concession may be granted by the Sultan later for his Asiatic territory, i.e., Gwadur.in each State (but see the preceding paragraph defining the refinery position) to produce oil fuel that shall comply with the Admiralty specifications at the time, provided that the oil is of a suitable kind and quality for this purpose, and to take control of the company’s works, plant and premises. Similar provisions appear in the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Koweit Oil Company. In the case of Muscat and Oman pre-emption will nc^ be provided for in the modified form of political agreement with which the Sultan will be associated (see note under Muscat and Oman above) but in a separate agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions (Limited). 34. No political agreement was entered into between His Majesty’s Govern ment and the Bahrein Petroleum Company in respect of the concession in Bahrein (nor is pre-emption provided for in the lease granted to the company by the Sheikh of Bahrein), but in view of the sheikh’s special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government it is not anticipated that any difficulty would occur in securing the pre-emption of Bahrein oil in the event of an emergency.

The Company tell us that the Americans in question have been employed by them with entire satisfaction in Persia and the Hadhramaut, where they were said to get on well with the local population. In the cir cumstances, as as insistence on British personnel would have entirely upset the Company’s plans, we felt that we could not reasonably raise objection to their proposals. With the concurrence of the interested Departments here we have accordingly replied to the Company in the terms of the letter of which I enclose a copy. 5, cipies of this letter (and enclosure) are being sent to the Government of India and to the Political Agent, Muscat; you will no doubt retain a copy for the Bahrain Agency files.

( which he informed me he obtained ^ s A *75 1 p ' Ic&gt;(d from the first Draft Political Oil Agreement copy of which was given to him in Bombay vide my express letter No.T/101 of 8th December 1937), would appear to overcome .the difficulty and might perhaps be agreed to, if you see no objection. ,V ^ Major, I.A., Political Agent &amp; H.B.M’s Consul, Muscat.

We undelete,nd the nature of the Agreements as set out therein, and we are prepared to agree to them except Article 4 of the Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company. What we understand from he above Article is that the local employees, and these include subjects of our Government and persons under its control and administration shall have no ri^it to approach the Sultanate Authorities with their complaints and grievances except through the Chief Local Representative of the Company, who shall be a British subject. This is an objectionable point to us. Our subjects and those unler our Government's control and administration should have the rigit of a direct approach to the Sultanate Authorities with heir complaints and grievances so that their cases or interests may not be jeopardized by he circuitous way of representation. We suggest that the first sentence of paragraph 4 of the Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company be deleted and the following sentence be substitutedt- 'The Company except in unimportant or routine matters shall deal with the Sultanate Authorities through a Chief Local Representative in Muscat, who shall be a British subject.' The ren&amp;inder of paragraph 4 is not objectionable to us and may stand.

I concur with the Sultan that there should be no mention of '•local employees^ in the Political Agreement and that the word 'Company* should be used. I do not know how the term 'local employees ? came to be introduced into the Agreement, and I suggest it should be omitted. 3. With regard to the exception suggested by the Sultan for the channel for negotiating unimportant and routine matters, this seems to me unnecessary. The Sultan has probably taken his draft from the source indicated by yatts, but since then the suggested procedure by which important matters were to have been submitted through the {Signature) Political/ S. 44.

In fact by eubstituting 'Company* for 'looal employees' we insure that individual employees can approach 'the Sultanate authorities with their complaints and grievances' (vxde the sultan’s letter). The first sentence of the section in question should in my opinion therefore now read 'The Company stall deal with the sultanate authorities tta ough a Chief local Representative in Muscat, who shall be a British subject'. The remainder of this clause will read as at present. 4.

The purpose of such Option Periods, as Your Highness understands, is to cover the period of prelimi nary exploration. The purpose has been defeated by circumstances outside the Company^ control as our exploration plans had to be interrupted and postponed in 1939 by the outbreak of the Y/ar. Furthermore, the restrictions imposed by His Majesty f s Government upon the Company as regards any operations not directly in the war effort made it impossible for the Company to carry on work in Your Highness’s territory. 2. In these circumstances our Managing Director in England has suggested that Your Highness may agree that it is reasonable for the Company to apply to Your Highness for a further extension of the Option Period on the same terms to cover this postponement, such a period to consist of an extension up to five years after the date of the signature of an Armistice between Great Britain and Germany, Italy and Japan whichever shall be the later.

Ex t. 6666/43. Dear Mr. Harrison, Many thanks for your letter of the 8th. instant in which you give the text of a telegram from Packer. There is no necessity to call 1 or a repetition as the meaning is clear enough for the present purposes f The first portion, regarding an agreement between H.M.G. and the Ruler, obviously rei ers to C^atar and presumably we shall hear from you in due course on this matter. The remainder of the telegram refers to instruct ions sent by us to Packer regarding our Agreements with the Shaikh of Ajman and the Sultan of Oman and Dhofar. The Ajman Agreement, which gives us survey and exploration right only, expires in March, 1944 and we instructed Packer to endeavour to obtain an extension of the existing Agreement for a period expiring five years after the conclusion of an Armistice between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever shall be the later, on the gro»nds that our operations have been interrupted by reasons beyond our control. if, however, the Political Resident does not favour such an approach, we gave Packer instructions as to tne terms which he was authorised to offer the Shaikh for a 75 year Concession in exercise of our right under Article 3 of the existing Agreement. Either of these alfernative settlements are acceptable to us but we considered that the first alternative might be preferred by the lolitical Resid»nt who might not wishto have negotiations lor an ©il Concession opened at present time in the Persian Cull area. the A As regards Oman and Dhofar, we are prepared to accept either an extension of the ’option’ period or to take up the Concession in accordance with its terms. Here again, we feel that the interruption of our operations by the war might be considered by the Sultan as adequate reason and justification for the extension of the ’option’ period. i will keep you informed of any further developments which may be reported by Packer, Yours sincerely, (Sd.j H.H.

December last, I write to inform you that we have now received a telegram from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf regarding your Company 1 s agreements with the Sultan of Muscat and the Sheikh of Ajman. The Political Resident feels that the proposals suggested to him by your Comp^ny^ representative for the extension of the option periods with the Sultan of Muscat and the exploration agreement with the Sheikh of Ajman were not altogether satisfactory He recommends instead that agreements should be negotiated with the Sultan extending the option periods on the Museat-and-Oman and Dhofar concessions from 24th. June 1944 to 24th. June 1949 and with the Sheikh of Ajman for the extension of the whole agreement from 23rd. March, 1944 to 23rd. March, 1949, a provision being inserted in each case for the further extension of the agreements to allow your Company to continue their exploration for a clear five years after the conclusion of the war with Germany The five years to commence from the time that men and materials become available. Should any dispute regarding the interpretation of 'availability' 1 arise His Majesty's Government would be sole judge. We agree with the Political Resident's views and should be glad to know whether his proposals will meet the requirements of your Company and in particular whether you would have any objection to arbitration by His Majesty's Government in the event of a dispute about the availability of men and materials. If you have no such objection we should be glad to have your suggestions as to the drafting of the relevant clause. Your sincerely, (Sgd.) R.PEEL H.H.

Finally the former withdrew but there is no record here that I.O.C.( a company in which there is American interest) concluded any agreement. It appears however that they did at one time have a concession in Mekran and may still have it. 2. The two agreements with P.C.L# are for 75 years; there is also an 'option periodof 5 years, which a subsequent amendment made extendable by a further period of 2 years. In both cases, the Company have extended the option periods and these expire on June 23rd, 1944. It appears, therefore, that in order to obtain another extension,a further amendment to the agreement is required and it may be presumed that the Company will shortly let us know their intentions. 3. It is now necessary to discuss the Sultans powers to dispose of oil concessions. In 1923, his father agreed not to g£ant any Oil concessions without our approval. Shortly afterwardspe wrote to the then P.A.( Mr. Wingate) and said that none of his promises were binding on his successors unless the latter were specially raentioned / as a retort because his father's Arms Subsidy had been held as personal to his father and was not being paid to him. The then Resident (the late Sir Percy Cox) ignored the general question and in his reply confined himself to explaining Government's decision on the Arms Subsidy. It also appears that he did not report the matter to higher authority. 4. The present Sultan at one time took his stand on his father's letter but only a few days before the agreements were signed. His contention was not accepted. A few days later, H.H. took violent exception to the draft Political Agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company^the notes thereon to be exchanged between him and H.M.G. In the following year the question v/as discussed in London and in a note of a conversation between H.H# and Mr. Gibson of the India Office, iyvas definitely stated that H.M.G# did not accept the view that the Sultan was not bound by his father's agreement. A formula was then found to save the Sultan's 'amour propre', without relinquishing our position. . kitchison r ol.XI 5.

Dear Mr. Peel, Y, r ith reference to your letter of 24-th February, the proposala ua.de by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf for the extensions of the Ajman Agreement and the option periods in the Muscat/Oman and Dhofar Concessions are acceptable to the Company. He are also prepared to accept arbitration by His Majesty’s Government in the event of a dispute arising as to the date upon which men and material can be made available for the necessary exploration work, I enclose two draft agreements which would, in our opinion, cover the Political Resident’s proposals; the Dhofar .Agreement would follow the same lines as that for Oman. As regards the Ajman Licence, we have tel egraphed to our Bahrein Manager instructing him to apply to the Ruler of Ajman for the extension of our existing Agreement for a further year from 23rd March, 1944- in order to safeguard our rights ponding the conclusion of the proposed now agreement. The terns of the existing ...gr cement do provide for such a year’s extension if the Company has not completed its exploration work. This right, however, presupposes that the exploration work has actually been commenced in the previous five years but we believe that the Ruler will grant the extension as a matter of f .malty. From our point of view, we shall be in a better position if negotiating an extension to an agreement still in force rather than a renewal of one which has expired and. would give the Ruler the opportunity to ask for revised conditions of payment, etc. Yours sincerely, 3d.

July, Dear Prior The Petroleum Division have dravm'our attention to paragraph 3 of Muscat telegram No.C/lCf75 regarding Petroleum Conoossion Limited’s Muscat oil concession. They point out that the delay in developing this concession is due to the fact that at the beginning of the war His Majesty’s Government placed a ban on developments whioh were unlikely to contribute directly to the war effort in order to conserve dollar exchange and critical materials. In these circumstances the Company cannot justly be accused (at least in so far as the period of the war is conoerned) of causing undue delay. If the Sultan in fact feels any grievance ^ against the Company on this score, it would seem desirable if possible to disabuse him of the impression that the Company have been at fault in this respect. You would agree that it would be ^ unfortunate if he wore allowed to harbour a grievanco agamist a British Company through a misundorstanding of the position.

No S.2050.1401 Will you please refer to your endorsement No C/233 of the 5th September, ID44, on the subject of oil concessions in Muscat ? 2. I conveyed the substance of India Office letter No 3269/^4 of the 28th July, 1D&lt;±4, to His Highness who, in reply, said that he quite understood that developement might be difficult, and had no complaint on that score. His point was that the terms generally, and not especially rates, of the Muscat and Dhofar Concessions did not compare favourably with terms given in Iraq, what actual concession he was thinking about I did not enquire. r* 'll 3 # v In answer to His Highness* belief that Petroleum Concessions had not given him a fair deal, I told him of the vast difference between the two fields on the lines of your demi-official letter No C/128 of the 9th August, 1944, and added more besides. The Sultan was much amused at the term “wild cat 1 *. Finally I told him that, in my opinion, his criticism could not really be sound as it is not based on knowledge obtained from a geological survey or visual evidence of oil. I think it is fair to say that the Sultan now feels less strongly against Petroleum Concessions, but a rankling feeling probably remains. 4 . It is most undesireable that His Highness should feel that a British Oil Company has taken advantage of him in the matter of these concessions, and the only way to dispel this suspicion is for the Company to prove him wrong. I do not think words will ever do this satisfactorily, and so the obvious method of geological survey remains. Such work could not, of course, be undertaken at once, but the situation will probably have changed sufficiently by next winter to make the launching of a campaign possible. Perhaps, therefore, you would consider suggesting the undertaking of geological work in Muscat in the winter of 1945-46. The Hon*ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.

Copies of the two concessions can be found at folios 17-47.Included in the volume is correspondence relating to the political agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Limited including its presentation to the Sultan of Muscat; the Sultan’s concerns about the document and negotiation with the India Office in order to agree a suitably amended version that satisfied all parties, including the decision by the India Office to have a separate pre-emption agreement. Copies of the Political Agreement and Pre-Emption Clause agreement can be found at folios 93-98 and 132-135.Also discussed is the decision by Petroleum Development (Oman and Dhofar) Limited to take up in 1942 the option of an extension on their exploration agreement for two years owing to wartime conditions and further discussion regarding possible methods of extending the exploration agreement to the end of the war and a period beyond. The conclusion of the discussion being the decision by the Company to take up their concession rather than attempt to negotiate any further extension. Also discussed are concerns by the Sultan of Muscat that the Company did not really intend to explore and develop a concession in his territory and were only really interested in preventing other companies operating there. The concession with the Shaikh of Ajman [‘Ajmān] (Rāshid Bin Ḥumaid Al-Nu`aimī) is also discussed in this context as the exploration of that territory had also not commenced on the outbreak of World War II and extensions to the exploration agreement were therefore also required.Further correspondence relates to the Oil Undertaking made in 1923 by Sultan Taimur bin Faisal [Sayyid Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd], formerly Sultan of Muscat and father of Sayyid Said bin Taimur. The correspondence centres around the assertion made by Sultan Said bin Taimur that the undertaking was not binding on him as his father had written a letter to the political authorities in 1923 stating that any such undertaking would not be binding on his successors unless specifically stated in the contractual agreement. Further correspondence concludes that the letter written by Sayyid Taimur bin Faisal in 1923 was received by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf but was never responded to by him or forwarded on to the India Office or Government of India and that they were therefore unaware of any such opinion or response and that as a result were prepared to consider a re-negotiation of the Sultan’s treaties and undertakings.Also of interest within the volume are:discussions about the Muscat Arms Subsidy which was originally granted to Sayyid Faisal bin Turki [Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] including the conditions under which it was granted and the lack of clarity in the terms and conditions of the subsidy’s contract;discussions regarding the Oman hinterland which the Company were interested in exploring but which was under the authority of the Imam of Muscat and the decision to wait until the following year to raise the question again as the Imam’s authority in that area was considered to be dwindling and the Sultan hoped then to be able to make arrangements with either the Imam of the tribes living there;a memorandum prepared in the Petroleum Department, June 1938, looking at areas where petroleum concessions were mostly likely to be, or had been already been obtained, on the Arabian Peninsula (Koweit [Kuwait], Koweit Neutral Zone, Bahrein [Bahrain], Qatar, Trucial Sheikhdom’s, Aden Protectorate, Saudi Arabia, The Yemen, Muscat, and Oman) and looking at Petroleum Concessions Limited's refinery agreement and pre-emption clause.The agreements and correspondence with the Sultan of Muscat are in Arabic and English.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 264-276.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Development Oman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul, Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ajman, Āl Nu'aymī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Muscat</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhofar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Muscat</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Ajman</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Dhofar</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000292#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
