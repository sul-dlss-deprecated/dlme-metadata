No.550-EL; D.O. No.C/121; No.931-EL), two of which are confidential. The correspondence took place between William Rupert Hay (Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain), Cornelius James Pelly (Political Agent, Bahrain) and Charles Dalrymple Belgrave (Adviser to the Bahrain Government).The correspondence mainly concerns Belgrave's successful request to Pelly for help in sourcing Arabic type, for use in a new printing press due to be supplied to the Bahrain Government by Charles Kendall &amp; Partners, government procurement agents in England.The file cover is made up of two re-used sections from earlier file covers. From its markings, the back of the file cover was previously used for secret file no. 8/5-ii, entitled ‘R.A.F. Iraq Intelligence Summary, 1941’.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Government Printing Press</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Adviser to the Government of Bahrain</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">creator</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Propaganda</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public information</topic></subject><subject><topic>Intelligence operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00019d#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00019d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
