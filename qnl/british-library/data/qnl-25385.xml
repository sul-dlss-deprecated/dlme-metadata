With reference to the proposed vieit of the Political Agent at Bahrain to Calcutta, to confer with the Director General of Commercial Intelligence, I am directed to etate, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, that, in the opinion of thi? Department, it would be very useful if the opportunity could be taken to place the Political Agent in touch with Mr. Ainscough, His Majesty’s Trade Commissioner at Calcutta. As the Political Agent may visit India at an early date, I am to suggest, for Mr. Montagu’s consideration, that a request to this effect might be made to the Government of India by telegraph. I have the honour tn be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under Secretary for Sta.te INDIA OihelCE, _S ^ ■ ^ Comptroller-General.From—J. H. H; BilLj Esq., I.C.S., Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf, To The Hon'ble Sir Hamilton Grant, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Foreign” Secretary td the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department. I have the honour to forward, for the consideration of the Government of of India, a copy of a memorandum No. 256-115, dated the 28th February 1918, from the Political Agent, Bahrain, which contains certain suggestions on the important subject of the extension of trade to meet probable competition after the war. The principal practical suggestion is that the Political Agent should be allowed to proceed to Calcutta at any convenient moment to confer with the Director of Commercial Intelligence on the subject. If this suggestion, which appears to me to be a useful one, meets with the approval of Govern ment, I would suggest that a copy of the memorandum be sent to the latter, so that he might clear the various issues to be raised by direct correspondence with the Political Agent, Bahrain. I am not aware whether the Director spends the summer in the hills; if not, I would propose that the time spent in Calcutta should he additional to the recess, if the Political Agent wishes to spend the entire recess period in Karachi. There should, I think, he no obstacle to the Political Agent taking his recess this year, in which case August and September would be the most suitable .time. The present Political Agent would also have time to study the situation before his visit to the Director. I recommend, therefore, that the Political Agent should be permitted to proceed as suggested Whenever the local situation allows. Enclosure 1. Memo; No. 256-115, dated the 28th February 1918. From—The Political Agent, Bahrain, To— The Deputy Political Resident, Persian Gulf. v &gt; The elimination of Turkey from the Persian Gulf and the existence of otlt ^ chain of exclusive treaties with the Arab Chiefs, now stretching without a break along the whole length of the Arabian Coast, renders our position almost unassailable by other nations except by means of commercial competition. We have the lesson before us of the results of German efforts in this direction and it seems essential that, so far as our war pre-occupations w r ill permit of it, we should avail ourselves of the present absence of direct foreign competition to obtain for British trade as predominant a position as possible in order to stem the rush of competition which may be expected at the conclusion of hostilities. It will, I think, be conceded that the best and, in the long run, the only means of keeping our political position unimpaired is the retention of commercial supremacy. The creation of a strong commercial position at Bahrain is of considerable importance as it is the distributing port for Quatif, Hasa, Najd and Q,uatar: that is—practically the whole eastern side of Arabia. The attached sketch map illustrates this point. In this connection it must be remembered that the buyers of goods on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf are very conservative and will not readily buy articles of a new make when those to which they are accustomed are obtainable, it is, therefore, desirable to capture the market formerly held by goods from Austria and Germany before those countries can again compete and before the buyers have become used to similar goods from the Far East. To further this object I have devoted considerable time to studying local trade conditions and have taken the following action :— Firstly:—A comprehensive collection of samples of enamel ware, lamps, cutlery, haberdashery, tobacco and so forth has been sent with full details of prices etc., to the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence at Calcutta,* Who kindly defrayed the cost.Secondly :—The possiblity of introducing Indian tinware, china and glassware, matches and other products of the new Indian Industries are under investigation. • Thirdly :—Endeavours have been made to interest individual firms of known standing in particular lines and enquiries haye been made as far afield as British North Borneo for tobacco and Ceylon for cheap toys. Fourthly The influence of the Agency has been exerted as far as possible to discourage trade in articles jnoduced in Japan and other foreign countries • though it is, of course* net possible to do much in this direction. The larger items of imports in Bahrain—rice, flour, wheat and coffee— are at present all being brought from India and, as foreign competition is not for the present anticipated, detailed enquiry regarding them has been postponed though some preliminary enquiry has been made regarding Indian sugar. It may be mentioned that a proposal is under consideration for Messrs. Gray Paul and Company (Agents for the British India Steam Navigation Company, Limited, and the only British European firm in Bahrain) to get into touch with the Najd market through some reliable merchant recommended by Bin Sa’ud. During my work in the above field I have felt myself much handicapped by want of first hand knowledge of what India can or might produce to take the place of goods hitherto supplied by ioreign nations or to be introduced as new lines and I, therefore, venture to propose that the Political Agent at Bahrain be permitted to go to Calcutta for a period of about one month to confer with the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence who, I feel sure, would welcome and assist any effort on our part to get more closely into touch wdth his | Department. I am convinced that much more could be done by the Political Agent to encourage present and introduce new British trade if he had some personal knowledge of what information was required and what goods were available in India. No extra expense would be incurred by Government as the visit might be made in place of or at the time of the annual recess to Karachi and the cost of the steamer fare from Karachi to Bombay and railway from Bombay to Cal cutta (or a total of about 11220) could be borne by the grant for ‘ travelling allowance to officers In the last paragraph of my report to the recent Trade Commission (see enclosure to my memorandum 21-C of Eebruary 21st, 1917) I made a suggestion of a somewhat similar nature that it might be of advantage to officers before caving India for Persian Gulf ports to be placed in touch with commercial matters affecting their districts by the Department of Commercial Intelligence and I understand that it was view r ed favourably by the Commissioners. I may add that I have shown the above memorandum to my successor^ w o, as ai as he is m a position to do so under the circumstances, agrees wuth my views. ’ °FOREIGN OFFICE AND BOARD OF TRADE.

Dear Sir, Early this year we decided to send out a representative to open up 'brandies for us in the Persian Gulf (Basra and Baghdad) and were able to secure the services of Mr. Harry Osborne, who has 'been for 18 months at Basra. Mr. Osborne left England on the 10th February and arrived at Bombay about the 8th April, but was unable to immediately proceed on his journey being delayed in obtaining the necessary permit to travel there. - ow he has wired ua that although he has obtained a permit to proceed, after wasting eight weeks, the political Agent informs him that there is no accomodation. As you are no doubt aware, the bulk of the trade in Piece Goods for the Baghdad market is in the hanas of firms-who are Turkish subjects, also Assyrian and Baghdadian Jews, and our object in sending Mr. Osborne out was that hecould thoroughly study the question and develop purely British Trade in these markets. We shall he glad, therefore, if you will try and facilitate matters, as surely undue obstacles should not he put in the way of commerce.

Cox stated that Lord Iiiehcape had an agent at Bagdad, who was receiving al] the facilities, consistent with military needs and interests, that could at present be given him. It would have a bad effect if we appeared to be handing over the most profitable enterprises in the country as monopolies or quasi-monopolies to our own compatriots. The local commercial communities should have opportunities of participating. It was decided— That Sir T. Holderness should arrange for a meeting at the India Office in which Sir P. Cox should meet Lord Inch cape, and, if possible, settle the matter with him. made it clear that he asked for nothing in the shape of a monopoly, but had urged that the firm of Maclvay, Lynch, and Co., as registered before the war, should be allowed to open business at once at Baghdad. Sir P. Cox had concurred, subject to the approval of the military authorities in Mesopotamia ; he had pointed out, however, that Messrs. Lynch’s firm were already doing business at Baghdad in their individual capacity, and he asked whether their assent had been obtained to the proposed resuscitation of their joint Company (MacKay, Lynch, and Co.) which had been in abeyance since the outbreak of the war. Lord Inchcape undertook to approach Messrs. Lynch at once, and to communicate the result to the India [N.B.—A joint application has since been received, signed by Lord Inchcape and Mr. J. F.

Minute Pape FUTURE OF MESOPOTAMIA. ^ote by Political Department, India Office, on points for discussion with Sir P. Cox. III.—Commercial Developmlnt. 10. River Navigation.—Commercial and industrial development affords an important and (provided everything in the nature of exploitation of the country in outside interests is rigorously avoided) perfectly legitimate means of consolidating British influence in Mesopotamia. One question calling for special consideration is that of River Navigation. The Trade Commissioners (Messrs. Holland and Wilson) who visited Mesopotamia in the early part of 1917, expressed the view (paragraph 58 of their Report) that “in the first instance “ and for a considerable time to come, the main business of transport, both of “ passengers and goods, on the Tigris should be carried on by one Company, “ to be exclusively British in constitution ” ; and they recommended that this Company should be “constituted on the lines proposed in 1913, 1 with the “ omission of the Turkish and German elements, Lord Inchcape being “ Concessionnaire,’’ and Messrs. Lynch receiving an appropriate share. A similar proposal was made by Lord Inchcape himself, in a letter to Lord Hardinge, dated the 20th October 1917, in which he expressed the willing ness of his firm to start business, when the time arrived, “ as arranged before the war,” and sought permission to establish a house at Baghdad forthwith. Sir P. Cox, to whom Lord Ihchcape’s proposals were communicated, was of opinion (telegram of 28th December 1917) that it would be “contrary to the “ interests of the country that monopoly of shipping on river should be “ granted to any firm,” and that “ we shall be ’well advised to allow native “ Indian and British subjects to run steamboats on both rivers subject to “ suitable guarantees and payment of conservancy dues.” He urged that no assurances or undertakings should be given to Lord Inchcape, Messrs. Lynch, or anybody else, that would prejudice independent consideration of the whole question. It may be observed, parenthetically, that the proposed concession could not come into actual operation until after the war, as control over navigation must remain in the hands of the military so long as hostilities last. What Lord Inchcape had in view, in desiring to open house at once, was pre sumably the general advantage of being first in the field. The whole question was fully discussed by the Middle East Committee on the 18th February 1918. Opinions were somewhat divided, and it was eventually resolved “ that no steps should be taken to come to an arrangement with “ Lord Inchcape or any other firm until the views of Sir Percy Cox had been “ obtained regarding- the various points raised in the discussion.” Lord Inchcape has since (15th March) written again to Lord Hardinge waiving the question of a monopoly, but renewing his request for permission “to “ establish my organisation at Baghdad now, so that I may lie in a position “ to begin operations as soon as local circumstances permit.” lie has been informed in reply that the matter will be discussed with Sir P. Cox. 11. Banking.—Another question of vital importance to the future interests of trade is that of Banking. On this point the following extract from Lord Inchcape’s letter of the 30th October may be quoted :— “ At the same time it is very desirable that banking development in Mesopotamia should be imgood hands in the general interest of British trade, and not left too much to small fry such as small Indian 1 r rLf&gt; liintorv of the Concession negotiated in 1913 is stated in Appendix VIJ. (pp- ) lhe histoiy oi tnej^onoebb S the creation of an Anglo-Ottoman Comp n ; fjh L^IneCpe of the war. - —J3anks, and eventually i contemplate using my mduence towards the establishment of a powerful Banking Syndicate, in which possibly Indian and Australian interests as well as British might be associated. I consider this is really necessary, to counter activity of the German Banks in Turkey.” It seems clear that present banking arrangements in Mesopotamia will have sooner or later to be strengthened, and Lord Inchcape’s willingness to interest himself in the matter is a point to be borne in mind in considering the question of allowing his firm to obtain an immediate footing at Baghdad. 12. The early establishment of (1) a Commercial Bureau, and (2) an Agricultural Department in Mesopotamia, as recommended by the Trade Commissioners, are other points that might usefully be discussed.

To this 1 would raise no objection, but i appreeiate that in the altered circumstances, should they arise, it would be more in accord with British traditions and present ideas to throw open the navigation of these Fivers in which case my agreement would have to go by the board,and that there The Light Honourable rire Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, K.G, &amp;c.. Foreign Office,are objections to Government becoming associated with private enterprise, and I shall make no complaint. But 1 submit it would be only fair in view of the work and expense to which I have been subjected, not of my own seeking, that I should at least be permitted to establish my organisation in Bagdad now, so that I may be in a position to begin operations as soon as local circumstan ces permit, if this is not conceded I shall find myself in a very much worse position than would have been the case had the Turks remained masters of Mesopotamia^ In any case until the war is concluded, and no one can tell at this* moment ho* it will ©nd, I truet Government will hold on to the Uoncossion which was obtained from the Turks for a British Company to have the navigation ri f.U on the Tigris and Euphrates. If the Hivers come under virtual British control I want no monopoly and 1 ask for no Government help. 1 am perfectly prenared to paddle my own canoe, and if 1 can't stand up unaided a^inst (legitimate comnetitioi than 1 must go to the wall.

Lord Curzon stated thaf he gathered that the India Office took a favourable view of the proposal that Lord Inchcape should be given a monopolv of navigation rights of the River Tigris and facilities tor the immediate establishment of banking operations at Baghdad. so as to anticipate the creation of German and Japanese interests. Secondly that if any concessions were now to be guaranteed, Lord Inchcape’s firm had claims on the ground that such concessions as were now asked for had been nearly completed by negotiations with the Turkish Government in the summer of 1914. Printed for the War Cabinet. February 1918. : SECRET. WAR CABINET. MIDDLE EAST COMMITTEE. Present : There were also present : tosai was put forward on two giounds .- -jy it was desirable that British commercial and financial should be established in Mesopotamia forthwithOn the other hand, he felt bound to point out to the Committee that the proposed concession raised a question of high policy, viz., “ Was it either possible or desirable that His Majesty’s Government should take any immediate step which assumed continued British occupation of Baghdad after the War ? ” The fact that the future of^ Mesopotamia lay on the lap of the Peace Conference rendered hardly possible, even if desirable, that His Majesty’s Government should give monopoly rights to a British firm now. Further, in the event of questions arising in Parliament, it would be difficult to reconcile the proposed action with the war aims of the Allies as stated by the Prime Minister and President Wilson. The view might be expressed that we were prosecuting the war for British capitalistic expansion. He also understood that Sir Percy Cox, while he was anxious that immediate steps should be taken to open up trade and banking facilities in Mesopotamia, was opposed to the creation of a monopoly. Sir Percy Cox was now on his way to Cairo to discuss these and other questions with a representative of the India Office, and he therefore thought that it would be premature to give any undertaking or enter into any arrangement with Lord Inchcape, pending the receipt of the report from the India Office representative regarding his conversation with Sir Percy Cox. Lord Hardinge stated that the Foreign Office attached special importance to the opening up of banking operations in Mesopotamia. The Ottoman Bank at Baghdad was now closed, and such banking operations as were now being conducted were being carried out by the Eastern Bank Company, of which Lord Balfour of Burleigh was chairman, which bank had entered the field at the Government’s invitation. Mr. Parker, who had assisted Lord Inchcape on behalf of the Foreign Office, stated that the Inchcape navigation concession formed one of a set of twenty-two agreements negotiated in 1913 and 1914, two of which had been actually ratified, and all of which had been initialled. The present proposal of Lord Inchcape amounted to a monopoly of river navigation rights on the Tigris and Euphrates, but not to a monopoly of banking. Mr. Parker expressed his strong personal conviction that the sole effective means of preventing the capture by Germany or Japan of the river navigation, and the sole practical means of competing against foreign subsidies, was a well-controlled monopoly (v\ith proper safeguards as to rates and services) under British management. He mentioned that 50 per cent, of the original share capital in Lord Inchcape s Company was placed at the disposal of the Ottoman Government, and this share might now be transferred to the new Government, whatever that might be, in Mesopotamia. This would give that Government a large interest in the monopoly. As regards nan king, all that Lord Inchcape asked for was facilities to start operations, us soon as possible, at Baghdad. His idea w y as to promote a large banking syndicate to compete against such institutions as the Leutsche Bank. Having talked to Sir John Jackson regarding the control of the ligris, Mr. Parker gathered that Sir John Jackson took the view that navigation and irrigation in Mesopotamia were not necessarily conflicting, as contended by Sir W. Willcocks. Sir John Jackson also thought that, in view of the present wasteful ii rigation methods of the Arabs, with more modern methods there would be no difficulty in providing enough water both for irrigation and navigation purposes. Mr. Balfour did not share this view; he thought that the interests of navigation and irrigation were always like to be coincident. He agreed that the conservancy of the Biver Tigris should be placed under one authority, but doubted whether this authority could be vested in a commercial firm or syndicate. General Macdonogh stated that it is most desirable that such steps should be taken as were consistent with military exigencies aswould open up trade in Mesopotamia during, war. Fhe experience of the past has shown that the virtual monopoly of British trade and shipping interests in the Persian Gult in the hands ot the Britisn India Company, had been unfortunate. Lord Inch cape s film had been vmprogress.ve and had facilitated the growth of Geiman competition. This [jointed to the desirabdity of competition on the Tigris. Sir William Clark expressed the view that it the matter were left open and no agreement was made to encourage Lord Inchcapes powerful interest in Mesopotamia the Japanese would come m. In his opinion it would be better to give Lord Inchcape a monopoly tuan to bolster up the British trade in the future by means of subsidies Captain Lloyd stated that he thought it desirable that His Maiesty’s Government should take action at the earliest possible moment. As far as he was concerned, he was opposed to tne proposal which would give monopoly to any one British hrm, and thought that arrangements should be come to with other large British groups, and anything now arranged might of course be ma Q subject to whatever might be determined at the Peace Conference. He agreed that the loss of British trade in the Persian Gulf oeiore the war was largely due to the fact that Brdish direct trade with Mesopotamia had been neglected m preference tor the Indian trade. The openings which the Germans had got before the war w r ere due very largely to the narrow and unenterprising methods of toe Bntisn India Company, together with very inflated freight rates. He tnoug that the Government should reserve m its own hands tne control ot the conservancy of “the River Tigris. It was undesirable vO leave such rights to any company. The Tigris m Mesopotamia is like the Nile in'Ecypt, that is to say, the river is the country. Mesopotamian trade wilf be a most profitable trade, and enterprising firms would be only too glad to enter such a trade if given the right to go ther6 Sir W. Clark feared that if Lord Inchcape went out cj the business no one else would come in, and he doubted it ;d would e possible to get British capital invested on a large scale m a country such as Mesopotamia without some form of Government guarantee, such as would be given by a concession. • i i i. On the other hand, Captain Lloyd thought that provided i was made clear that the trade was not going to be handed ovei set of powerful hands, other firms, such as Stnck and Merman, would be only too glad to seek a footing. inn Sir Mark Sykes thought that, if we played our cards well an in accordance with the underlying political principles now current in the world we should have a good chance of remaining m co,lt !'J 1 of Mesonbamia after the war, but should we be charged with encouraging profiteering or establishing monopolies ^ should run • U ,-/ seeing Mesopotamia pass out of oui control at tne f’eace Conference. “The proposal put before the Committee was ecu' valent to handing over the future Mesopotamia and its mhabitants to Lord inchcape. Such proposal would be bowled down in the House of Commons.

While I fully appreciate the points you refer to, I hope you will not misunderstand me when I express a fear that the Departments are in no small danger of sacrificing the substance to shadows. If the principles of the concession are accepted, then the substitution of British authorities for Turkish, where the latter have ceased to exist, as well as the settlement of similar consequential changes, can merely be details of legal drafting. The essential thing, so it seems to me, is to start operations promptly before the Germans can begin again their attempts at commercial penetration, and before the Japanese, who are already casting covetous glances towards the trade of the Gulf, can consolidate their position. As for the question of monopoly:- (a) there always was one on these rivers from 1845 to 1910. (b) I had agreed to buy out at a fair price such small interests as, between 1910 and 1913 had established any recognised rights. (c) A monopoly is the sole effective means of excluding foreign intrusion. (d) The controller of the river navigation should (as recognised by the concession} also control the river conservancy. (e) The concession provides against excessive rates and inadequate services. (f) In my view a well-controlled monopoly will, in the special circumstances, undoubtedly se cure the best possible public service. (g) The Right Honourable Lord Hardinge of Penshurst, K.G. &amp;c. , FOREIGN OFFICE. 3. W. 1.(g) A monopoly on these rivers is no more open to objection than would be a monopoly conceded to a railway company. These considerations do not of course deal with my established claims. I wish as time presses, that you could see your way to arrange for me to meet Parker, who assisted me in all the previous negotiations, when 1 feel confident that I could allay any misgivings and reach a prompt settlement of the whole matter. The months are slipping by and we are losing a unique opportunity. I need scarcely say that in urging His Majesty’s Government not to treat as a scrap of paper the agreement which I made at their instigation in 1914 to undertake for British interests the navigation of the Tigris, I am not actuated by any sordid motives. If the year's labour which I bestowed on the negotiations and the outlay 1 incurred are lost, that will make no difference to me, but I shall be extremely disappointed if the object I had in view of establishing British influence and trade in Mesopotamia, and which would have materialised had Turkish rule remained in that part of the world, should be frustrated because Great Britain instead of the Turk becomes master in that part of the world.

While the importance was fully realised of pushing forward British trade intex*esos so soon as mixitar^ conditions permit, and I may add of welcoming the powei- ful support you yourself are able to give to this ooject, it was strongly felt that, in the existing and wholly unprecedented political situation, it was, not merely on local grounds but still more for reasons of high policy, eminently undesirable for His Majesty’s Government to commit themselves to the establishment oi a. monopoly oi river navigation without an exnausoive examination of the pros and cons. It was accordingly decided that no final decision could be reached at any rate until a full exchange of views had taken place with Sir P. Cox, who is shortly going to Cairo to confer with a representative of the War Cabinet* With regard to the concluding paragraph of your letter, I need hardly assure you that there is no ten dency whatever to regard your representations as prompted by sordid motives; indeed your interest in the develop ment of the trade of this region is looked upon as a valuable asset.

It is understood that the Board of Trade could probably nominate a suitable officer for the post of Commercial Adviser or Intelligence Officer, if the proposal commended itself to the local authorities and to His Majesjsy's Government. As regards agriculture, it is recognised that , during the continuance of the War, the activities of the proposed ^ Department would be limited. Bu t the agricultural j j uoilitj of Mesopotamia are so immense that it seems desirable to initiate with as little delay as possible the organised study of such important questions as the improvement of existing methods, the provision of suitable agricultural machinery^etc.. In regard to one branch of the subject - cotton- action has already been taken, and the whole question ,of-cotton cultivation in Mesopotamia is now under examination by bhe Empire Cotton Growing Committee* 4, it is most desirable that Use Officer who is to be sent out to cpnfer with dir P.

It is therefore suggested that the Secretary oi Spate for India should be authorised to telegraph at once to the Viceroy and Sir P.

SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS. 1 Just before the war the total sea-borne trade of the Gulf, excluding coasting and local trade, was valued at about 12J millions sterling, of which the British share was 70 per cent. The pecuniary value of the trade was no o-re at matter and its loss would not have seriously affected British commerce. Commercial success in the Gulf has, however, involved the assumption of political responsibilities and these cannot be lightly surrendered ihe Germans, realising that British political predominance achieved through commerce was vulnerable through commerce, set themselves to win a &amp; large a share of the trade as possible. Their commercial competition was the cutting edge of a vast political intrigue which was organised with the object of obtaining control over the railway route to the East and by this means exerting pressure upon the British Empire at a sensitive point. 2 If the war ends favourably for the Allies, British shipping and commerce will recommence operations 111 the Gulf under conditions which, nolitically, could hardly be more advantageous. . 1 ^ Nevertheless, it is too much to hope that the Baghdad luulway question w jU he eliminated for ever from world politics. No precautions should, therefore be omitted which might have the effect oi discouraging politico- commercial adventures. The obvious and effective means of defence would the closure of the Persian Gulf foi-a period of years to all ioieign shipping bv exoausion of the defensive declaration oi: EH)o. . , ' Political considerations will, however, doubtless militate against the adopt! n of this course and resort must, therefore be had to alternative methods in order to secure for British shipping privileges everywhere in the Gnll as compared with the shipping of other nationalities. At Maskat and the ArabTan ports in particular, advantage should be taken of the influence the Arabian poii require the Rulers to refuse to foreigners o« business. 'Special privileges should he arranged for British shipping at various ports, as circumstances peinnt. „ acmnimr -Next with a view to consolidate British commercial interests • J i?’tbe shippino'companies concerned should be organised so as against attack, the h W = , l ; 1 ; ca l serv ice possible as public carriers, to render the most e ^ JJYbng between the United Kingdom 2r between the main British shipping a ) ^ ^ 1 - ltieS ‘|f' p neg affording direct com- At the outset, a hue or a ^tmtUou ol lm^ ^ ^ provide munication between tne ” call tip at such frequent intervals as fiMgSCS&amp;S.'TK 0 . 1 —*«* “»&gt; M-nr *• 5±i competition can be excluded on thm route tl q “ from l nd ia should for favouring a monopoly. It ‘Sties .able rat co p benefit from a a vie, to meeting complaints from shippers and consignees. S 3 40 2/18 A4 Subsidiary Measures.-The subsidiary measures required for developing and safeguarding British commerce in the Gulf are discussed with reference tn each of the three spheres into which the trade currents flow, namely.-- (1) Mesopotamia ; (2) Persia ; , (3) the Ports on the Coast of Arabia. Mr. Lloyd in his report of 1908, described the dimensions and conditions - of British trade in Mesopotamia and drew attention to the danger to be anticipated from the rapidly growing German trade with -the advantage of subsidies and the cleverly devised system of through lates On tin v hole, British merchants seem to have retained the great advantage which they derived from their long start. German trade has now dropped to the bottom of the ladder and, if the Resolutions of the laris Conference are broimht into effect, it will be unable to start climbing again for a period of years' after the conclusion of peace. When this period comes to an end, however, it must he expected that German competition wall re-appear m Mesopotamia as in other places, assuming that the Persian Gulf will remain open to foreign shipping. 5. Commercial Bureau.—The contrast between the methods of the British and German merchants must be ascribed very largely to deep-seated causes and was not peculiar to Basrah. The German political organisation and their system of education must be held responsible for the high standard of business efficiencv maintained by the merchants. A few suggestions of a general nature are offered for the information of' British linns who con template opening business in the Gulf. Lor the proper enlightenment of Chambers of Commerce and individual merchants, it is essential that a commercial intelligence officer should be appointed in the occupied territories at the earliest possible date, possibly with an Indian attache. (3 Agriculture.—Commerce m Mesopotamia before the vai was ciamped and confined, owing, firstly, to the paucity of exports for which imports could be exchanged and, secondly, to the inadequacy and insecurity of the internal communications. The inefficiency of the furbish administration was ultimately to blame for the undeveloped state of the country. Scanty exports were due to the backward condition of agriculture, which, in itself, is attributable mainly to the uncontrolled vagaries of the rivers, coupled with scarcity of labour and insecurity of life and property. ^ The main agricultural products of the Basrah \ ilayot before the war were dates, rice, wheat, barley, millet, melons, vegetables, fruit. It is estimated that the total area cultivated was about 350,000 acres, of which 100,000 were under rice, 70,000 under barley, 30,000 under millet, 20,000 under wheat and 20,000 under vegetables. Date groves accounted for about 100,000 acres. These estimates must, however, be accepted with great caution, since the data on which they are based are by no means reliable. The rice crop is of great value and capable of much expansion. The wheat- exported came mostly from outside the Vilayat and the trade was subject to remarkable fluctuations, owing to the uncertainty of the water supply and the inadequate transport. Suggestions are offered with a view to improve ment of the existing system of cultivation and handling of the crop. In some areas, agriculture has suffered severely from the insecurity of the cultivators’ tenure, and the matter needs careful consideration. The institution of an Agricultural Department at an early date is recommended. There is every reason, however, to hope that Mesopotamia has a future not only for wheat but for cotton. The soil and climate appear to be suitable for the cultivation of fine cottons, and it is recommended that tests be made at an early opportunity with a view to ascertaining the suitable varieties for adoption. 7. Irrigation and River Control.—Next, with a view to the development of the agricultural possibilities of Mesopotamia, plans must be devised for the scientific control of the rivers, so as to prevent the damage now caused3 by inundation and to provide irrigation for the redemption of the deserts. . • The problem involved is three-fold. Firstly, the successful, but econo mical, application of the water for irrigation purposes; secondly, the preservation of the rivers as long ns possible for navigation ; and, thirdly, the drainage of the swamps now in existence. It is recommended that no far-reaching measures be decided upon until a body of information has been collected which may enable sound conclusions to be drawn. It would seem advisable that an Irrigation Board, comprising at least two highly-qualified irrigation engineers, should now be constituted for the collection of detailed information in regard to the rivers and the existing canal systems with a view to framing recommendations for a restoration of the regime of the rivers. In the meanwhile, there would probably be no objection to proceeding under the Irrigation Board’s advice with certain minor irrigation schemes which are not likely to prejudice the solution .of the main problem of the two rivers, e.g., the Akhdhar channel and the Mendeli, Duwairij and Tib streams. 8. Labour.—All schemes for the agricultural development and commercial exploitation of the country are, however, conditioned and limited by the capacity, temperament and character of the inhabitants. The two Vilayats of Baghdad and Basrah are thinly populated, possessing an average of nine inhabitants per square mile, which is inadequate for agricultural develop ments. Moreover, the population is of a motley type, including peoples of diverse races and religions. All the cultivable land within the Jezireh must, however, be regarded as in lire nominal possession or within the sphere of influence of some Arab tribe or other. For the. present, it would seem undesirable, from the local point of view, that Indian settlers should be introduced wholesale, and any attempt to do so might evoke a powerful protest from the Arab world. There does not appeay to be, however, any need for haste in adding to the population of Mesopotamia. Large irrigation schemes cannot be commenced for some years to come, and the existing population, supplemented from neighbouring sources, will be sufficient, to begin with, for minor works which it may be decided to undertake.. The pastoral population, which is the backbone of the country, must be' treated with special consideration, and irrigation schemes must be conceived so as to conserve for afforestation and pasturage large areas in addition to those under cultivation. Finally, the introduction of modern types of earth-working and agricultural machinery, worked under competent supervision b} skilled labour, will deprive the labour question of a good deal of its urgency and importance. Canadians and Australians might find m Mesopotamia a field peculiarly suited to their talents and experience. * Stress must be laid upon the organic connection which alieady exists between Mesopotamia and India. It is recommended that, after the war, o fficers of Indian experience should be appointed in Iraq, to whom Indian and Afghan pilgrims, residents and traders may report, if necessai 3 T , foi assistance. 9. Education—The employment of Arab labour for military purposes on a large scale and under organised conditions has thrown a good deal of new lio-ht on the Arab’s character and capacity for work. It seems likely that the indolence which has hitherto been one of his recognised characteristics w T as largely ascribable to environment. , f The development of the Arab will depend largely on the nature of the education provided in the Government schools, of which several have been instituted with the valuable assistance of the American Mission. In the HioL School, courses of vocational instruction are provided and m regard to this it is recommended that special efforts should be made to develop the commercial and agricultural classes. At present the control of education is entrusted to a revenue officer, whose other duties necessarily claim the greater part of his attention. It is recommended that, as soon as circumstances permit, education throughout the Basrah Vilayat should he •entrusted to a whole-time educational officer.4 10. Communications.—The disadvantages under which trade laboured before the war in the matter .of communications are well known. Tt is recommended that attention be concentrated, in the first place, on the institution of a regular and frequent steamer service between Basrah and Baghdad, affording reasonable freights and entirely in British hands. 'For this purpose a Navigation Company might well be constituted on the lines proposed in 1913 in regard to the Anglo-0 Woman Company, omitting the Turkish and German elements. In order to guard against the dangers inherent in a monopoly it would seem desirable that Government should either be represented on the Board of the Company or by some other means should exercise control over the maximum freights and passenger rates to be charged by the Company. Secondly, in view of the paramount importance of the Baghdad-Kermanshah trade a railway should be constructed between Baghdad and Khaniqin at the earliest possible moment. Railway con struction as a whole in Mesopotamia must be conditioned by the question whether connection is to be made with the Mediterranean either between Baghdad and Aleppo via Mosul or by the more direct southern route through Hit to a port in Palestine. Such railway construction as lias taken place in the occupied territories has been governed purely by military considerations, but post-war developments will require cautious consideration. It is therefore recommended, in the third place, that a Communications Board be constituted to work out schemes for the country as a corporate whole with a view to the co-ordination of traffic by river, canal, rail and road. Ro time should be lost in conducting a railway survey from Xasiriyah via Nejef to Kerbela and Baghdad, and also along the Hai river, with a view to estimate which route would be the more advantageous for the continuation of the existing line. Fourthly, special attention should be paid to the possi bility of canalising the River Tigris for navigation as far as possible along the stretches which are at present difficult to negotiate (e.g., the Narrows) and which may be expected to deteriorate further, as irrigation develops. 11. Economic Products: Silk. Oil, &amp;c.—There were no industries of import ance in Mesopotamia before the war, but the cultivation of the silkworm, formerly very successful near Baghdad, is capable of revival. The depu tation of a qualified silk expert is recommended. The preparation of hides and skins for export with the aid of tanning products from India should be. profitable. There appears to be good promise of a dried fruit industry, and the oranges grown in Upper Mesopotamia should be welcome in India. Expert investigation is recommended in regard to the possibility of producing a wine grape and of cultivating beetroot on a large scale for the manufacture of sugar. The possibilities of sheep farming in Mesopotamia are prodigious, since not only the wool but the skins are known and approved in European markets. There should be a large export of hides and skins. The oil “shows” in Northern Mesopotamia are very promising. It is recommended that the fields should be developed primarily for providing- oil for consumption in the country at a reasonable price, since otherwise the wells may be exploited lor the benefit oi existing oil companies. Tree planting on the banks of rivers and canals should be taken in hand at once, and an experienced officer should be deputed to report on the question of afforestation. 12. Openings for Trade.—Having regard to the anticipated opening for oil fuel, Mesopotamia should offer a wonderful field for engineering enter prise, and especially for the sale of modern ploughs and other agricultural machinery, for the use of which the country is ideally suited. The Arab’s standard of living is already rising, and aftei; the war there will be a large demand for domestic furniture and articles of personal apparel both for men and women. Cheap goods will no doubt hold the field for some time to come, especially as regards china, glassware, ironware, enamelware, paper and matches. Spades of the native pattern are in great demand, and also cheap lanterns and lamps. As the purchasing power of the people increases, a demand for better quality articles will develop. The sugar trade needs careful watching in view of the uses to which it was put by the Germans. Ihe Mesopotamian demand for timber, not only for date boxes but for oilh cases and for building, should be supplied from India. Important openings for trade may be expected in connection with town development—building materials, plant for sanitation, water-supply, electric lighting, &amp;c. s** 13. Foreign Competition.—The Mesopotamian markets are already flooded I with cheap Japanese goods and severe competition may be expected after the war. It is recommended that, if possible, foreigners, other than Persians, should not be permitted to reside in Mesopotamia for a considerable time to come. In addition, special facilities might be arranged for British slopping and merchants in connection with the management of the port administration; the customs warehouses and inland transport. British shipowners and merchants will doubtless be given facilities for securing the most'favourable sites available for mercantile purposes and British steamers might have preference over foreign steamers in the matter of berths or loading facilities. 11. Banking.—At present three banks are represented in Basrah and another Indian Bank proposes to enter the field. It was alleged in the past that English banks had failed to finance the exporter in the same way that German banks did, and it is understood that a British Trade Corporation is to be established with the object of developing British trade abroad. Agriculture in Mesopotamia will require careful financial' nursing, but, before any system of agricultural credit is created, it would seem desirable that the features both of the social structure and of the administration in Mesopotamia should be carefully compared with those obtaining in India and Egypt. 15. Currency.—Indian coin and notes now circulate on the same footing as in India. Great quantities of Indian notes have been absorbed. ' Incon venience has been caused owing to the temporary appreciation in the value, of the Persian kran. Owing to Mesopotamia’s proximity to India and the intimate business connections between the two countries, the Indian rupee should continue to be current with a gold standard, as in India, in the occupied territories, if not permanently, at all events for a longtime to come. It is advised that, as in Ceylon and British East Africa, Mesopotamia should have her own subsidiary coinage in the form of cents, and her own note issue.INDIA OFFICE, Whitehall, 3./. 1* 4th February 1918 /Y ^ Cu V There is an aspect of the Iviesopotainicin Question that I should like to bring to your special notice a of our discussion on Saturday. I mean the question oi trade. I think we were all agreed that it must be our policy so to fortify our position in Mesopotamia that it wiu remain proof against any theoretic concessions to the doctrine of local self-determination or to the claims of the Arab Kingdom that we may be obliged to make# From this point of view it seems to me all 7 important that we should set about the task of consolidating our commercial interests in the country; and I therefore venture to FPf J: i t t ry ,pr+ioned Report of the Mesopotamia Trade Commission (which I mentioned at the meeting on Saturday) should be brought before the Committee as soon as possible, with a view_to some decision being taken on the Commissioners recommendations.

Attention has been drawn., on numerous other files, to various passages and extracts dealing with particular c subjects such as cotton, dates, Japanese competition, railway construction, Mohammerah customs, etc., etc.^ but the report itself, as a whole, has not hitherto formally submitted to the Secretary of State. &lt; * The views of the Government of India and Sir P. Cox on the 'Report are still awaited. It is not proposed to summarise the I Commissioners’ recommendations in detail, as they have done this for themselves in paragraphs 127-150 of their Report, to which special attention is : invited, much of what they recommend must | necessarily stand over until the general military situation is clearer and the future political status of Mesopotamia less uncertain.* The very uncertainty, however, (which is greater at the present moment than when the Commissioners reported in June last) is an i jagihsement that cuts both ways. On the one hand, it I tells against the undertaking of ambitious schemes of ! development; but, on the other, it points to the ! desirability of 'pegging out claims” with as little | delay as possible, which, if the worst comes to the ! worst, will at least live British commerce a good start in the race with foreign, competitors.

It is necessary to consult the government of India and Sir P.

(3). Irrigation . The Commissioners reconmiend (paragraph of Report) the immediate creation of an 'Irrigation Board' to examine the whole question in detail. Partial effect has recently been given to this recommendation by the establishment (with the concurrence of the Civil Commissioner) of 'Directorate of Irrigation' under the military authorities, hothing further can be done during the or nod of military occupation.

The subject is one? oi some delicacy owing to the conflict that is apt to arise between immediate military needs and permanent irrigational interests; and Sir P, Cox mav prefer not to introduce a further disturbing element for the present, as regards the Commercial Adviser, 1 understand from Sir William Clark (with whom I have discussed the whole Deport both, before and after Sir A.

My dear Hirtzel, I enclose copy of a letter vihich I wrote to Lord Hardinge on 30th October, which may possibly be referred to the India Office.

Dear Lord Hardinge:- It will be in the recollection of the Foreign Office that I had protracted negotiations at the request of His Majesty's Government before the war, and that we had arranged with Germany and Turkey and the Foreign Office that I should, in conjunction with Messrs. Lynch, establish a line of steamers on the Tigris under the management of Mackay Lynch &amp; Go. The agreement was signed by Hakki Pasha and myself and confirmed by the Foreign Office. Then the war broke out- and the arrangement of course was held up. but what the ultimate settlement in regard to Mesopotamia will be is of.course uncertain. I can scarcely conceive that we shall ever give Baghdad and Mesopotamia back to the Turks, or permit Germany again to exercise her sinister influence there with all her ulterior motives, but I think it would be very desirable that we should, without any delay, peg out a claim to a position in Baghdad. the suggestion of His Majesty's Government, with a view to establishing British Interests in Mesopotamia, and I think the time has come when we should plant ourselves in Baghdad with a view to the future. as arranged before the war, and my ooject in writing to you is to ask if you think we might, with any likelihood of Great Britain is now in possession of baghdad, The firm of Mackay Lynch &amp; Co. was constituted at I am therefore prepared to open our firm there success,success, apply to the Foreign Office for permission to open a House in Baghdad now. he should probably work at a loss for some time to come, but that I don T t mind. The potentialities in Mesopotamia are enormous and there are great developments possible. The firm of Mackay Lynch &amp; Go* have the right to run steamers on the rivers, and as soon as they are opened to traffic we shall take up the obligations we assumed under our agreement with the Foreign Office, and it would, I think, be desirable that we should open our house in Baghdad at once. We have ample capital behind us, and I am quite prepared to launch out in Mesopotamia as soon as peace is arranged. If we establish ourselves there and develop a business, Banks and others will follow. At the same time it is very desirable that banking- development in Mesopotamia should be in good hands in the general interests of British Trade, and not left too much to small fry such as small Indian Banks, and eventually I contemplate using my influence towards the establishment of a powerful Banking Syndicate, in which possibly Indian and Australian interests as well as British might be associated. I consider this is really necessary, to counter the activity of the German Banks in Turkey* I am aware that the Military Authorities are reluctant to allow British Houses to open up in Baghdad at present. I think, hov/ever, that our House has a very special claim by reason of the concession we obtained, after costly negotiation, before the war* I merely mention this to show that our house can be dealt with exceptionally and on the merits of the case, without creating an inconvenient precedent for the military Authorities in the event of other houses claiming similar treatment. You will, more over,\nx) moreover, Itfeel sure, appreciate how vitally important it is that German commercial penetration, which politically has proved so insidious in Turkey, should, at the initiation of a nev/ era, he forestalled by timely British enterprise in Mesopotamia, where our interests centre« Yours sincerely, (Signed) Inchcape.i! ■ Any further communication should be addressed to— THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, at the address given opposite.

Psykte 1/ in discussion between Mr. Hollaed and myself of broader problem affecting deliberations dl Trade Commission the following fundamental issues confront us :— Please refer to Clause 6 of your telegram of the 7th January, 39 S. conveying instructions for Trade Commission. In pursuance of recom mendations contained in Section B 4, of the resolutions of the Paris Ponfeience which have been adopted by PIis Majesty's Government; commerce and shipping will presumably be subjected to special restrictions lor a period of time to be fixed in agreement with Allies. In case nature of restrictions to be imposed on German enterprises in the Persian Gulf may come under consideration before the Trade Commission report is received, 1 venture now to recommend, in view of previous character and aims ’of German competition, and of fact that British commerce cannot, unaided, withstand its subsidised encroachments, that if Persian Gulf cannot as suggested below be made a mai'c clausum, German shipping may at anv rate lie prohibited from entering Gull: ports for as long a time as possible, and that during same period German commerce may be confined to such business, if any, as maybe done through British or at least non-German firms. Secondly, as regards competition from Far-Eastern ports there is every reason to tear that Japan will be eager after the war to step into the position vacated by Germany. Japanese manufacturers are already establishing a hold on Gulf markets, and their recent experiment in the matter of shipping is known to Government of India. It would be wholly undesirable that a nation possessing a large and up-to-date fleet in Eastern waters should achieve by commercial penetration a basis for political footing and intrigue in Gulf It would obviously be impossible to apply to Japanese trade and shipping restrictions not shared by other powers, and I would accordingly suggest as a question for consideration of His Majesty’s Government whether,In view of great development of our interests in various parts of Gulf, which has resulted from war it would not now be possible by agreement, with Allies to supplement declaration of policy made by Ford Eansdowne in 1903 and reiterated by \ iscount Grey in 1907, by an announcement that ports in Persian Gulf, including Maskat, shall for a period of years be closed to all steamers other than British. The interests of .Japan in Gulf are slender and of recent growth and could not be put fonvard as a basis of objection to action proposed while Bussian and French concurrence might be secured by grant of special facilities for transhipment at Bombay or Karachi in \qewof extent of trade enjoyed by them respectively in Gulf before the war. If essential to placate Russi^amour propre their ships might by special exemption be admitted to Gulf ports to same number as called annually before the war. I assume abandonment by France of her special position at Maskat will be an essential feature of settlement to be made with her alter the war for iusion of mutual interests and elimination of doss ihie causes of friction.

The representatives of the Allied Governments have met at Pans under the presidency of M. Clement el, Minister of Commerce, on June 14, 15, 16 and 17, for the purpose of fulfilling the mandate given to them by the Paris Conference of March 28, 1916, of giving practical expression to their solidarity of views and interests, and of proposing to their respective Governments the appropriate measures for realising this solidarity. IT They declare that after forcing upon them the military contest in spite of all their efforts to avoid the conflict, the Empires of Central Europe are to-day preparing, yn concert with their Allies, for a contest on the economic plane, which will not only survive the re establishment of peace, but will at that moment attain its full scope and intensity. III. They cannot therefore conceal from themselves that the agreements which are being prepared for this purpose between their enemies have the obvious object of establishing the domination of the latter over the production and the markets of the whole world and oi imposing on other countries an intolerable yoke. In face of so grave a peril the Representatives of the Allied Governments consider that it has become their duty, on grounds of necessary and legitimate defence, to adopt and realise from now onward all the measures requisite on the one hand to secure or themselves and for the whole of the markets of neutral countries full economic independence and respect for sound commercial practice, and on the other hand to facilitate the organisa tion on a permanent basis of their economic alliance. j -j j + For this purpose the Representatives of the Allied Governments have decided to submit for the approval of those Governments the following resolutions : A. MEASURES FOR THE WAR PERIOD. I. The laws and regulations prohibiting trading with the enemy shall be brought into accord. For this purpose : A. —The Allies will prohibit their own subjects and citizens and all persons residing in their territories from carrying on any trade with :— 1. The inhabitants of enemy countries whatever their nationality. 2. Enemy subjects wherever resident. . 3. Persons, firms and companies whose business is controlled wholly orpartia y by enemy subjects or is subject to enemy influence and whose names are included in a special list. B. —They will prohibit the importation into their territories of all goods originating in or coming from enemy countries. C. —They will devise means of establishing a system enabling contracts entered into with enemy subjects and injurious to national interests to be cance e unconditionally. II. Business undertakings owned or operated by enemy subjects in the territories of the Allies will all be sequestrated or placed under control; measures will be taken for purpose of winding up some of these undertakings and of realising their assets, the procee of such realisation remaining sequestrated or under control.In addition to the export prohibitions which are necessitated by the internal situation of each of the Allied countries, the Allies will complete the measures already taken for the restriction of enemy supplies, both in the mother countries and in the Dominions, polonies and Protectorates :— 1. By unifying the lists of contraband and of export prohibition, and particularly by prohibiting the export of all commodities declared absolute or conditional contraband ; 2. By making the grant of licences for export to neutral countries from which export to enemy territories might take place conditional upon the existence in such countries of control organisations approved by the Allies ; or, in the absence of such organisations, upon special guarantees such as the limitation of the quantities exported, supervision by Allied consular officers, etc. B. TRANSITORY MEASURES FOR THE PERIOD OF COMMERCIAL INDUSTRIAL countr L ieI RAL ANJ) maeitime ^construction of toe alwed I. The Allies declare their common determination to ensure the re-establishment of the^ countries sufiermg^ from acts of destruction, spoliation and unjust requisition and decide to ]om in devising means to secure the restoration to those countries, as a’prior claim, of their raw materials, industrial and agricultural plant, stock and mercantile neet, or to assist them to re-equip themselves in these respects. II. Whereas the war lias put an end to all the treaties of commerce between the Allies and the Enemy Powers, and whereas it is of essential importance that, during the period of economic reconstruction which will follow the cessation of hostilities, the liberty of none of the Allies should be hampered by any claim put forward by the Enemy Powers to most-favoured-nation treatment, the Allies agree that the benefit of this treatment shall not be granted to those Powers during a number of years to be fixed by mutual agreement among themselves. J During this number of years the Allies undertake to assure to each other so far as possible compensatory outlets for trade in case consequences detrimental to their commerce result from the application of the undertaking referred to in the preceding paragraph. • r 6 III. The Allies declare themselves agreed to conserve for the Allied countries, before all others, their natural resources during the whole period of commercial, industrial, agricultural and maritime reconstruction, and for this purpose they undertake to establish special arrangements to facilitate the interchange of these resources. IV. In order to defend their commerce, their industry, their agriculture and their navigation against economic aggression resulting from dumping or any other mode of unfair com petition the Allies decide to fix by agreement a period of time during which the commerce of the enemy powers shall be submitted to special treatment and the goods originating in their countries shall be subjected either to prohibitions or to a special regime of an effective character. The Allies will determine by agreement through diplomatic channels the special conditions to be imposed during the above-mentioned period on the ships of the enemy powers. J V. The Allies will devise the measures to be taken jointly or severally for preventing enemy subjects from exercising, in their territories, certain industries or professions which concern national defence or economic independence.8 c. PERMANENT MEASURES OF MUTUAL ASSISTANCE AND COLLABORATION AMONG THE ALLIES. I. The Allies decide to take the necessary steps without delay to render themselves independent of the enemy countries in so far as regards the raw materials and manufactured articles essential to the normal development of their economic activities These steps should he directed to assuring the independence of the Allies not only so far as concerns their sources of supply, but also as regards their financial, commercial and maritime organisation. The Allies will adopt the methods which seem to them most suitable tor the carrying out of this resolution, according to the nature of the commodities and having regard to the principles which govern their economic policy. . ^ , They may, for example, have recourse either to enterprises subsidised, directed or controlled by the Governments themselves, or to the grant of financial assistance for the encouragement of scientific and technical research and the development of national industries and resources * to customs duties or prohibitions of a temporary or permanent character ; or to a combination of these different methods. ^ . Whatever may be the methods adopted, the object aimed at by the Allies is to increase production within their territories as a whole to a sufficient extent to enable them to maintain and develop their economic position and independence in relation to enemy countries. It In order to permit the interchange of their products, the Allies undertake to adopt measures for facilitating their mutual trade relations both by the establishment of direct and rapid land and sea transport services at low rates, and by the extension and improve ment of postal, telegraphic and other communications. III. The Allies undertake to convene a meeting of technical delegates to draw up measures for the assimilation, so far as may be possible, of their laws governing patents, indications of origin and trade marks. In regard to patents, trade marks and literary and artistic copyright which have come into existence during the war in enemy countries, the Allies will adopt, so far as possible,- an identical procedure, to be applied as soon as hostilities cease. This procedure will be elaborated by the technical delegates .of the Allies. D. Whereas for the purposes of their common defence against the enemy the Allied Powers have agreed to adopt a common economic policy, on the lines laid down in the Resolutions which have been passed, and whereas it is recognised that the effectiveness of this policy depends absolutely upon these Resolutions being put into operation forthwith, the Representatives of the Allied Governments undertake to recommend their respective Governments to take without delay all the measures, whether temporary or permanent, requisite for giving full and complete effect to this policy forthwith, ana to communicate to each other the decisions arrived at to attain that object.Draft Paper.

I am to to explain that the Mission is to be a joint one, undertaken by had Mr. John Wilson of Messrs. Grey, Mackenzie &amp; Co., who has/considerable experience of trade in Mesopotamia, and by Mr. R. E. Holland who is Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. It will be observed from the enclosed letter from the India Office that it has been agreed that that Department and the Board of Trade should pay the fares, subsistence allowance and remuneration of their respective Commissioners and that expenses incurred in Mesopotamia should be equally divided, on the understanding that the question will be reconsidered if the work of the Commission is The Secretary, Treasury. prolongedprolonged beyond the cold weather. As Mr. Wilson requires no remuneration for his services the Board are disposed to think that he should receive a subsistence allowance of £2 a day or £60 a month. Mr. Wilson is further anxious that he might be allowed a cabin on board ship to himself and he suggests that the extra expense should be borne by His Majesty’s Government. The Board are of opinion that this request is not unreasonable. Certain further expenses may be incurred as regards accommoda tion in Mesopotamia, clerical assistance, hire of mules and so fortl but it is in the Board’s view improbable that the expenses of the Commissioners will together exceed from £500 to £600. Mr. Wilson it is understood, wishes to return before the commencement of the hot weather. As Mr. Wilson proposes to sail for Mesopotamia on January ll the matter is one of some urgency and the Board would be grateful ii Their Lordships could see their way to sanction such part of the above expenditure as may be incurred by their Commissioner as early as possible. r\ HH I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient Servant, !Sgd.)

It should enquire into trade methods of the past with, a&gt; special reference to G-eiman competition. It should similarly consider trade methods for the future and especially whether British films can improve their i methods. The Mission should examine the possibilities of commercial expansion, (a) in exports, especially in connection with grain and x cotton, (b) in imports. In this connection the Mission should report on any openings for trade and especially should einquire into the classes of goods in which G-eiman competition has been particularly successful, and should collect samples. The Mission should report on proposals for the improvement of internal communications by rail, river and road. Enquiry should be made into the shipping question, including the question of regular transhipment service, special rates for certain classes of cargo, port and light* aues, thethe handling of cargoes, through rates, possible competition from continental or far eastern ports. Enquiry should be made into banking facilities and currency. The Mission should consider whether in order to maintain and develop British trade in Mesopotamia, private enterprise need be supplemented by measures on the part of Government, and if so in what direction.Any further communication should be addressed to — THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY, at the address given opposite.

I am directed by the Board of Trade to state, for Mr.Secretary Chamberlain’s information, that they have ascertained informally that the Treasury will be prepared to agree to the appointment of Mr. John Wilson as Board of Trade Commissioner, and to the payment by the Board of Trade of his fares to and from the Persian Gulf, subsistance allowance, and half of any joint expenses (e.g. for clerical assistance and travelling in Mesopotamia) which may be necessarily incurred by the Mission. The Treasury are, however, understood to be of opinion that the fares, subsistance allowance and any special renumeration of Mr. Holland, and half the share of the expenses incurred in Mesopotamia, should be borne by the Government of India. The Under Secretary of State, India Office.The Board accordingly propose, subject to Mr Chamberlain’s concurrence to write officially to the r Treasury asking for formal sanction of the arrangements outlined above; and to authorise Mr, Wilson to take his passage to Basra by boat leaving England on the 13th January.

Dear Holderness, i In reply to your letter of the 9th December about the sending of a Commercial Mission to MESOPOTAMIA, I think the essence of the proposal previously made was that Mr. Wilson snould be accopiipanied by an official who would be able to look after the administrative side of the work, and the other aspects which Mr. Wilson, a non-official, would not be so well fitted to deal with. Mr. Lloyd, even if he were willing to go, vrould not comply with the foregoing desiderata, and in any case it seems very doubtful whether his association with the Mission would be of advantage, considering that he has already delivered himself in a Report, as you note in your letter. In all the circumstances we should be glad if a further effort could be made to find a suitable official to accompany Mr. Wilson, but if this effort is unsuccessful it seems best to let Mr. Wilson go alone.alone. w As you say f the matter is now a very urgent one, and. we would propose that Mr. Wilson should start as soon as his arrangements can be made, on the under standing that the Indian Government find an official to accompany him, the two will meet at some suitable point en route.

The Board understand that Mr. Wilson was stationed at Basra and Bushire from 1888 to 1898 and was then employed by Messrs.

It is under stood that Mr. Wilson, of whose abilities the Board hold a high opinion, would be prepared to start at the beginning of December end would wish to leave Mesopotamia*by the end of March when the hot weather begins.

SECRET. P. 3501/16. The Economic Situation in the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamian Markets. From the Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Z. Cox, K.C.S.L, K.C.I.E., Chief Political Officer, Indian Expeditionary Force “ D,” Basra, to the Honourable Mr. A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. No. 0510. Chief Political Office, Basra, Sir, ^ 18th-^4th July 1916. In my recent reports to General Headquarters, Indian Expeditionary Force “D,” regarding the working of the Judicial. Revenue, and Mis cellaneous Departments of the Civil Administration of the Occupied Territories, of which copies have reached Foreign Department, it may have been observed that no mention was made of any Commercial Department; and in fact I have at present on my staff at Basra no officer whose experience qualifies him to study and advise upon the important commercial questions which will arise in the very near future. It was primarily with the object of making preliminary enquiries in this direction that I asked for and obtained the temporary loan of the services of Captain G. Lloyd, M.P., 1st AAarwick- shire Yeomanry, from Egypt, where he had been doing duty under the Director of Military Intelligence ; and I attach an interesting and timely note from him bearing upon the subject of trade conditions here. Captain Lloyd, it will be remembered, was the author of a valuable report on British trade in Mesopotamia in 1908. 2. Whilst our whole energies should be and are for the present devoted to the prosecution of the war, it nevertheless seems to me to be of great importance that we should set to work whilst we may to collect material, before the conclusion of the war on which deliberate judgments can be formed in regard to various questions affecting these territories. This is all the more the case, inasmuch as certain political or diplomatic questions, which are likely to arise for discussion at the close of the present hostilities, depend for their satisfactory solution upon an accurate and up-to-date appreciation of economic needs in Iraq, Central Persia, and the Persian Gulf. Conditions have greatly changed since the commercial (including the agricultural and productive) potentialities of this country were last deliberately considered ; and we now have-to look at the question from a point of view which differs widely from that which we adopted before the war. 3. The aim of such enquiry would be :— (a) To pmt His Majesty’s Government within the next few months in possession of a report which would have some claim to be authoritative, so far as our existing knowledge makes this possible, upon certain economical aspects of these territories. (h) To prepare data for the elaboration of a definite commercial policy, to be brought into force, by administrative and legislative means, on the declaration of peace—mo action being taken until then which will in any way prejudice our ultimate policy. (c) To examine the information already collected as to the best avenues for railway penetration in the areas in question, and the present possibility of converting this general information into exact knowledge by the undertaking of engineering surveys. S 327 40—10/16 A4. Amongst the many problems that await consideration and investiga tion I will mention three or four only : (i) Currency. —The best method of establishing rupee currency through Southern Persia in order to strengthen Britsh and British-Indian trade which is greatly hampered at present by the • chaotic currency conditions prevailing in South West Persia. The best method of establishing currency on a sound basis in Iraq; and banking facilities at Basra and other ports. (ii) (a) Exports. —The potentialities of Iraq as a grain producing country and the possibility of making it an important contributor to Imperial udieat supplies, in view of our present undue dependence upon extra-imperial sources. (b) The potentialities of the country, at least in its southern naturally irrigated areas, in regard to the growth of cotton for the supply of Bombay and Manchester. (iii) Imports. —The best means of inducing British merchants to cater adequately for this market, so as to maintain its predominantly British character ; elaboration of legislative and administrative measures with this object; revision of present 10 per cent. ad valorem tariff. (iv) Shipping. —Question of regular transhipment service ; special rules for certain class of cargoes ; port and light dues ; handling of cargoes; through rates ; relations with Continental ports; possible competition from Far Eastern ports. 5. If these questions are to receive adequate and continuous attention, two appointments are, I think, necessary ad hoc: — (1) Temporary, for from three to six months during the cold weather, of an acknowledged expert in commercial matters with mature practical experience, whose considered views would carry weight both with Government and with the commercial community. He might be designated Director of Trade Development. His function would be to start enquiries on the right lines and to give the necessary inspiration to this new development which, particularly as regards the commercial community, must depend in no small degree for its success on the spirit in which it is initiated. (2) Permanent. A junior officer (of the type of Mr. H. G. Chick, C.I.E.) qualified to act as Commercial Adviser in these territories, to be appointed simultaneously with the Director of Trade Development, so as to act as his Assistant and to carry on after his departure. His function then would be to keep in close touch with the commercial community here, in England (through the Board of Trade) and in India (through the Department of Commerce and Industry); to furnish information and statistics; to report the trend of foreign trade ; and to propose measures in advance to promote British trade interests. 6. I am somewhat diffident in suggesting to Government the name of any particular individual for the post of Director of Trade Development, but my conception of the requirements of the post leads me to suggest that the Honourable Mr. M. deP. Webb, C.I.E., of Karachi be invited to undertake the duty. I feel sure that the enthusiasm and expert knowledge that he would bring to bear on the problems at issue, and his reputation as an expert upon commercial and currency questions, would prove invaluable, end that all parties would be greatly the gainers by his deputation. In any case it would appear to be indispensable that the appointment should only be given to one fully conversant with the complex systems of continental trade shipping and tariff questions, and in consequence a Consular official of the ordinary stamp would be of no use for the work in view. 7. For the post of Commercial Adviser I should have been glad to have been able to utilise the services of Mr. H. G. Chick, C.I.E., now employed at Bushire as His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and Commercial Adviser to thePolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf. His tastes and bent, however, do not lie in this direction, but rather towards Southern Persia, and for the moment it would be inconvenient to spare him from his duties there. I am inclined to think that the latter post could be filled by the appoint ment of a-suitable junior officer to be nominated by the Board of Trade, who would be well remunerated, say TOOL a year with free house and adequate clerical assistance. 8. I am convinced that the expenditure entailed by the above appoint ments is not merely justified but demanded on Imperial grounds. Our position here has suffered most seriously in the past from failure to take timely and specific steps to meet the politico-commercial activities of our commercial rivals, from the adoption of a laissez-faire policy, and from a multiplicity of advisers ; and unless these questions can be considered here and now by an expert whose considered views will cany full weight in the counsels of Government, I greatly fear that peace negotiations or the conclusion of the War will find us as little prepared to face the problems of peace as we were in 1914 to face those of war. In order to facilitate discussion of this question by telegraph I have ventured to send a copy of this despatch with enclosures to the Secretary of State for India. I have not had an opportunity of obtaining Army Commander’s con currence to the terms of this communication, as he is absent up-river, but a copy has been sent him and I have little doubt that he will be in agreement with the suggestions which I have put forward. I have, &amp;c., P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief Political Officer, l.E.F. “I),” Basra. The Honourable A. H. Grant, C.S.I., C.I.E.Notes on Economic Situation in Gulf and Mesopotamian Markets, by Captain George Lloyd, M.P. 1 TIig strategical and naval necessity of maintaining a piedonnnant position in the Persian Gulf as well as in Central Persia is founded on such decisive declarations on the part of Idis i\Iaiest\ s Government at various times that it may be taken as axiomatic. It has also been an accepted doctrine that this position must depend mainly upon the retention^ of a preponderance of British trade in these areas, and that in proportion as Russian or German influence extends into Persia and the Gulf, so will their pretensions to a greater share of territorial and political influence become more firmly established. 2. But this doctrine in recent years has not been supported by a policy active enough to maintain it. It has, it is true, suffered politically as far as Persia is concerned by its inevitable subordination to moro urgent diplomatic needs such as the Anglo-Russian agreement of 1907, but it has also suffered commercially throughout the area by an indecision which neither the unsettled state of Southern Persia nor 'the struggles with Germany over the Baghdad railway more than partially explain. 3. The temporary elision of Germany from the Gulf, and the certainty that before long new spheres of influence as between Russia and ourselves in Persia must be negotiated, makes the moment one in which, however great our other preoccupations, the economic position of Great Britain in the Gulf and Persia must be resummarised, and such practical and prompt attention paid to it that we shall be ready at the moment of negotiation to pursue a policy in conformity vdth both our political and economic needs. 4. It is dangerous and may be fatal to continue in partial recognition of the dangers, and in total indecision as to the remedies. 5. Look where you will into the position of British trade in the Persian Gulf and in Central Persia, the evidence points unmistakably to the decay, and the rapid decay, of our trade, and to the serious inroads which have been made in an incredibly short space of time into both our export and import trade, inroads so continuous and severe that nothing but a studied and energetic policy, backed up to the full by the powder of the Government, will suffice to check. 6. Especially disquieting is it to observe that these inroads have been made and the attacks concentrated latterly, not merely upon the subsidiary trades in wdiich British energies were occupied, but upon those staple industries, shipping, Manchester goods, iron and steel, &amp;c., wdiich were regarded as the impregnable fortresses of our trade position. So long as nine years ago when German competition was but in its infancy in these areas the writer warned the Government, in an official report! on trade conditions in the Gulf, that the easy confidence of the British merchant as to the inviolability of these trades w r as unjustified and pointed out that the subsidiary trades, wdiich the Germans w r ere then engaged in capturing and which wmre considered as of no importance in view of the strong staple trade position still held by Great Britain, were merely the necessary wedge by virtue of which they would before long split apart the solidarity and monopoly of British trade in its more valuable forms. 7. It must not be thought that it is suggested here that the Home Government have ignored the position or have had no moments of uneasiness in regard thereto; still less that those in charge of British interests in the Gulf have failed to put the position very clearly before them; for locally, at 1 1 Cf. “ Report upon the Conditions and Prospects of British Trade in Mesopotamia.”— Board of Trade, 1908.5 all events, everything possible has been done to record and acquaint the Government of India and the Foreign Office with what was going on. Plain evidences of the Government’s uneasiness may be seen, for instance, in the negotiations between the Foreign Office and the Persian Government m regard to the southern trade routes, culminating at one period in a threat to take British measures to safeguard the trade routes themselves; but the fear of committing themselves to new responsibilities in Southern Persia, fears which Russia in the north showed no signs of being incommoded by, seem to have obscured the vision of the Home Government to the greater danger that confronted them in the loss of their economic position in the Gulf. COMMUNICATIONS. 8. Inasmuch as the primary essential for our trade, vis a vis Russia in Persia, or Germany in the Gulf, is the provision of good land and pea com munications, it is pertinent to examine the position m which British trade finds itself to-day in regard to shipping, railways and roads. 9. Up till 1906 British shipping had a practical monopoly of all trade entering and leaving Gulf ports. 1 10. In 1906, however, the Hamburg-America line started a service of steamers to the Gulf, and in spite of initial losses maintained their services, so that in four years they had increased their import trade by 100 per cent. From that time onwards, working in close co-operation with the German firm of Wonckhaus, established at various points in the Gulf, their success has been phenomenal. 11. British shipping lines, who commenced by being scornful, became alarmed when they realised that the German company had come to the Gulf to stay ; and British merchants, who at first had seen in the competition of the Hamburg-America a silver lining to the cloud of previous high freights, soon began to realise that the Hamburg-America line had not come there in order to serve the interests of old-established British houses, but rather to carry German goods with which to out-trade the British merchants in all the Gulf markets. 12. In the short space of ten years they have succeeded in wresting practically the whole of the sugar traffic, formerly exclusively in British hands, from the British lines, and in making very serious inroads into much of the general traffic formerly emanating from Great Britain and now coming from Antwerp or Hamburg. 13. Perhaps the shortest and most convincing evidence as to the hold which the Hamburg-America line had acquired in the first ten years of its comnetition will be shown in the nature of agreement come to between the conference of British lines (which m itself was formed to oppose the German line) and the Board of the Hamburg-America, recently before^ the com mencement of the war. The agreement provided two main things (a) an agreement of freight rates from Europe to the Gulf, and (b) an agreement that the British lines should not load at Hamburg or Antwerp, on condition that the German line should not load at English ports. These terms were fatal terms for the British lines to accept, and information goes to show, that the terms were practically dictated to them as to a beaten enem}. The significance of this fact will only be fully recognised when it is seen that the German line found themselves in. a position to dictate terms to a conference of British lines composed of no less important lines than the British India line, holding the largest mercantile tonnage in the world, and of lines under the control of men like Sir John Ellerman and others. 1 * * * S 1 There was, it is true, a Russian line which had a nominal monthly service to the Gulf, hut it was in no sense competitive as regards British trade, and was moreover not very successful in its own trade. In the date season a few non-British ships under special American oc other charter called at Basra ; but apart from this it may be said that all British goods entering or leaving Gulf Ports were carried in British bottoms. S 327 B6 V 14. It is important also to recognise the nature of the terms imposed, for at first sight the terms agreed to scarcely seem to warrant their being described as fatal. In any case Lord Inchcape did not fail to grasp the nature of the agreement he was entering into or its serious nature, for in a letter he wrote to the India Office on 29th December 1913, he stated that— “ It has been an impossibility for British shipowners to compete success fully with the Hamburg-America line, subsidised as that Company is, either directly or indirectly, by the German Government, and the British shipowners have been obliged to come to terms with the Hamburg-America line, and to agree rates of freight, and also to give up directly loading from Hamburg and Antwerp. ... If the British lines had not come-to terms with the Hamburg-America line it would have been impossible for them to maintain a position in the trade. . . . Prior to 1907 the shipping trade in the Persian Gulf was practically exclusively in British hands. Sugar export trade to the Gulf was then almost entirely for Marseilles and was served by British lines. The advent of the Hamburg-America brought the German sugar manufacturers into competition with the French refineries, and the former are gradually monopolising the trade. “ I am a little nervous about what may happen when the Baghdad railway is completed. We may find an attempt on the part of the Germans to oust British vessels from the trade from Basra to India, but we have had this well in view, and have been preparing for it by laying out a very large amount of capital in improvement and up-to-date vessels, which, I hope, will be able to hold their own against any legitimate German competition ; but, of course, if the German Govern ment are determined to force their wag into the trade ivitli India by means of subsidies, it may go hard with the British linesB 15. As it may quite confidently be assumed that the Germans both did and do intend to continue their operations against us by means of “ subsidies,” it is clear that Lord Inchcape’s anxieties are not confined only to the European-Gulf trade, but that he also fears that they may in the future take a highly dangerous interest in the Indo-Guif trade. 1G. It is remarkable also that Lord Inchcape’s pessimism in regard to the success German methods have had in the Gulf is fully shared by local merchants and traders in Iraq. The traders who nine years ago were'full of an unjustified but an easy confidence as to the impregnability of their position in Persian, Turkish, and Gulf markets, are now the first to admit that at the outbreak of war they were something like a beaten body, and in a very short time would have to take second place to the Germans. They still, however, refuse to look the facts squarely in the face, and say that they cannot be expected to fight successfully against German “ subsidies.” Without attempting to define what they mean by “subsidies,” they merely look upon them as an unfair weapon of economic warfare, something like gas in trench warfare as a hit below the belt with which no fighter, however skilled, can be ^ expected to deal. It is, therefore, important to make them realise that it is nothing of the kind, and the mere fact that the Germans have in some areas used their organised system to shroud dishonest methods is no ground for not accepting “ subsidies ” as a perfectly fair and recognised system of modern commercial warfare. 17. It may well be asked what were the powerful methods by which a single line like the Hamburg-America line were able, after a bare 10 years in the Gulf, to make Lord Inchcape write in this strain. The usual reply of German subsidies is no sufficient answer, for the French Government have for many years heavily subsidised the Messageries Maritimes line to Australia, and yet British lines have made perfectly successful headway against them, the German line, too, was peculiarly handicapped in the Gulf trade. It was fortified by no large Manchester freight contracts. The British lines had this adantage. It had no share in the large Marseillessugar carrying trade. The British lines had it all. It had no carrying trade between India and the Gulf. The British lines had it all. Its passenger traffic was insignificant. The British passenger traffic was considerable, and included a highly profitable pilgrim traffic. Its mail contract, if it existed at all, was small. That of the British India was substantial. The political and commercial atmosphere of the Gulf was hostile to it, but was entirely favourable to British lines. It had no inland communications to assist its trade penetration, whilst in British hands lay the foreign monopoly not only of the I ignis and Karim river traffic, but the organisation and virtual control of all trade roads from the Gulf inland. IS. The pressure that a line so adversely situated must have been able to exert to counterbalance all these handicaps, and to dictate any terms at all to so powerful a British group, must have been very considerable, and it was so. 19. That the pressure was exerted by means of “subsidies” is in a sense true, but the term is far too loose to indicate the methods employed. The power was derived from State organisation of production and transit working in harmpny, and in this particular connection was derived from the employ of what is known as the “through rate system.” The importance of understanding the system which Las been used to forge a way for German products and German shipping all over the world is so great as to warrant its re-statement in brief in this paper. 20. During the early years of the invasion of any area a direct subsidy is given by the German Government to the German line sufficient to enable the line to cut rates and underquote its competitors throughout the area. The low rate is designed chiefly to attract traffic away from the competing lines, but also to make possible the rapid and systematic flooding of the invaded markets with cheap German goods. The line works in partnership with a trading house established in the invaded area, who arranges for the distribution and sale of its cargoes, which come out unconsigned, and collects exports under cover of the low rate for return freight. 21. But these early preliminaries are really directed to one object and one object alone, which is to persuade the competing lines to enter into a rate agreement with them. The German system is so framed that, once this is effected, there is every prospect of the Germans becoming masters of the trade position within a short time. 22. As soon, then, as the competing lines have agreed not to carry goods to the area under a fixed figure, the German direct subsidy is replaced by an indirect subsidy system which is of general application to all German export trade, and which (contrary to the academic views held by some in regard to State subsidies) may, but also ma} r not, involve even any initial loss to the State. This system, known as the “through rate system,” is designed to enable shipping companies already in rate agreement with their competitors ostensibly to observe their engagements towards the foreigner, but, in practice, to underquote them whenever it may suit them to do so. In the task of capturing a new market, when the formation of a clientele and volume of trade done has temporarily more importance than the earning of large profits, the freedom to underquote and take a smaller profit than their rivals, in order to supplant their trade, is all important. As will be seen subsequently, the higher the rate agreed to as the minimum the more smoothly does the system operate for the Germans, and the more rapidly is their rival ousted. 23. The system works as follows, and is the outcome of scientific organization of land and sea transit. For the sake of example let us suppose the case of the carriage of goods from an inland town in Germany on the one hand, and from an inland town in England on the other to a common inland port in Turkey.A German line liar ao-reed with its British rivals not to quote less than 40 S . ph‘tonfrom any port in Germany, and the British line has entered intn a similar agreement in regard to British polls to Basia. Let ns suppose that a Birmingham manufacturer wishes to send a on Let US supi rmoted, say, 10s. a ton from Birmingham to Ma^t or ffpool he mn^y’ the ’agreed rate of 40, for sea freight from Manchester or Liverpool to Basra, and he is quoted 10, tor the irom ;' a “ cll ® s . fl . 0I1 * the p 0rt of Basra to Baghdad, giving him a through rate of 60, pll port and landing charges. The British exporter cannot however, get a through rate quoted him as from Birmingham o Baghdad, and is dependent upon the fluctuations of the land late eith The n German manufacturer at Essen, however, who wishes equally to send a ton of goods to Baghdad will, by applying to the rail authorities at Essen be quoted an inclusive rate from Essen to Baghdad. The rate quoted him will be sufficiently below the lowest rate available to the British exporter to enable him to undersell his rival in the market of destination, which we will suppose to be 55s. as against the British b(Js. Ihe os. loss, if there he a loss by the interworking of the state railways and the shipping company is apportioned to that part of the transit which can carry it without loss or; in the rare case where both the railway and the shipping company are working at too fine a margin to allow of the os. to be earned withou loss the loss is divided between the two. In the latter case the shipping company will in effect be carrying the goods for 3is. bcl, and under quoting their agreement to that extent. But this fact will never become apparent, for the published rate from Hamburg to 'Basrah is gnen as 40s., or if suspected, can never he brought home, as it is always open to the company to say that the railway company lowered their rate Irom Essen to Hamburg by 5s.; and unless the apportionment m every case of the share of the through rate as between the line, the railway and the transport company between Basrah and Bagdad can be proved wine it cannot he, the British line lays itself open to be underquoted m its agreement without hope of remedy. The main advantages to Germany of which are that— (a) She is enabled at will to underquote her rivals, and therefore capture the trade -without fear of reprisals. (b) Whereas a rate agreement is usually operative for four or five \eais, and is made irrespective of questions vital to the exporter, viz., fluctuating cost of materials and demand for goods, it is entirely to the advantage of the German exporter (and thus the shipping line also) that his rate should he flexible, while that of his competitor is fixed. and when the German line can conclude a similar arrangement with the land transport company at the port of discharge, and get them to tie the hands of the competing land transport company by a rate agreement, the loss, if any, over the whole transport can he still further spread. It must he repeated here, however, that, inasmuch as a_ rate agreement is made with the object of eliminating outside competition, it follows that the parties have a monopoly of traffic within the scope of the agreement. Ihere- fore there is every probability that the agreed rate allows for a handsome margin of profit. This enables the Germans, when they underquote in the manner indicated above, not only to do so without any loss at all but at a profit, but also to take the traffic away from those with whom they have agreed rates. 24. The above system explains why the agreement come to between the British lines and the German in the Gulf was described as a “ fatal one. 25. Not less innocent at first sight would appear to be the agreement come to not to load at Hamburg and Antwerp, in return for a similar agreement on the part of the Germans not to load at British ports. But here again the special circumstances of the case must he taken into con sideration. The German line made no sacrifice in this part of the agreement (c) If9 commensurate with the sacrifice made by the British lines. For the British lines had got contracts of considerable duration for the carriage of the vast majority of the shipments of Manchester goods to the Gulf, contracts which the Hamburg-America could not disturb, and for whose ultimate expiry they probably could not afford to wait. But, on the other hand, the port of Antwerp had provided for a long time a rich source of freights for the British lines, with which the Germans had only recently begun to compete. And the loss of this held w r as an immense sacrifice for the British lines to make. 26. But here again to a small degree the German “ through rate system ” is called into play to circumvent the agreement come to between it and its victim. Where an agreement is_ come to not to load from a British port on the part of the Ham burg-Am erica, British cargo is obtained from British ports in the following manner. The London merchant is offered through terms^ from London to Basra by the agent of a line allied to the Hamburg- America, and ships of that line collect cargo in the port of London, transport it to Hamburg or Antwerp for shipment in the Hamburg-America line steamers to Basra. All that happens is that the line carrying the goods between the port of London and Hamburg or Antwerp takes the place in the system of the German State railway. The London merchant will benefit, it is^ true, by getting the lower rate of freight, but he is really assisting at his own funeral in supporting the system contrived for the replacement of his commodities by those of German origin. 27. It will thus be seen that the “through rate system,” worked in conjunction with rate agreements, is the chief weapon of the German competitive policy, and it follows that in consequence every effort ought to be concentrated in refusing to make rate agreements with German hires, and in this way to prevent to a certain degree full operation of the “ through rate system against us. But there is some evidence that the Government do not seem to realise the nature of the German system, its danger, or even its existence, for in a Foreign Office memorandum dated oth July 1913 the whole “through rate ” principle is at once conceded to Germany as if it were a concession of small, if of any, importance. The memorandum runs as follows : — “Herr von Kiihlmann called on the 3rd July, to say that be had had a letter from Herr Ballin of the Hamburg-America line to the effect that, though he did not like the idea of a monopoly on the Tigris, he personally would not oppose it in Germany if one of the following alternatives were conceded:— “ (a) No through rates to be quoted by the British India Company or any other company from Europe to Baghdad by water. “ (b) If such rates are quoted Hamburg-America line must have the right to quote on terms as favourable as any other company, British or foreign.” It will here be observed that the Germans attach the very greatest importance to the power of through rate quotation, and were prepared to make considerable concessions to prevent our imitating their example. In spite of this obvious feature, the memorandum goes on to say :— “I said that if importance were attached to this, it might be well for the German Government to say so in their reply to us and then they would get a written answer. Herr von Kuhlmann said that he was going to meet Herr Ballin in a day or two on the Emperor’s yacht, and as Herr Ballin would be able to say a good deal to influence the Emperor, it was very desirable that Herr von Kuhlmann should be in a position now to state definitely what was proposed. I said the declaration to be made by Turkey did not contain any express stipu lation on this point, but under our draft agreement with Germany, article 7, unfair discrimination on the river was ruled out and I felt sure he might rest easy and that the wishes of Herr Ballin would be metd’ S 327 c10 28. It will thus be seen that the all-important through rate question is here easily conceded to the Germans in one short interview. It is of course possible that all-compelling circumstances, of which there is no indication in the correspondence, made this concession inevitable ; but the circumstances described in the Memorandum quoted above establish the fact that the Germans attribute the greatest possible importance to the question of through rates. 29. The German line set to work immediately to seize the sugar carrying- trade from the British lines, in whose hands, previous to its intrusion into the Gulf, it had exclusively been, and who were the holders of all the Marseilles sugar freight contracts. 30. The diagrams that follow refer to the Persian ports alone and do not refer to the Basra and Bagdad trade. If figures had been available for the Port of Basra, the most important port in the Gulf, the comparative position of Great Britain and Germany would have been shown far more clearly and unfavourably to British trade as against German. lu, 6 fe 1 S &lt;i G $ C&gt; ft 6 A ij ft G Hogg t ft o too -T H O e o ft 6 C« , ft CS ft A ft ft i ft ft 1 a ft c q i i ft o o i \ ft o ft 1 ft ft O t o ft ft ft q b ft ft It will be observed that the process of seizure worked rapidly, and that whilst in 1908 the^ British carrying trade (represented by the imports of India, the United Kingdom, and hranee) totalled some 2,925 tons, as against the German (represented by the imports of Germany and Austria) 1,950 tons, five years later in 1913 the British tonnage had only increased by some 650 tons, w hilst the German had increased by 4,550 tons. Already in five years the Germans were carrying more of this class of sugar to the Gulf than v T ere the British lines, although five years previously the British lines were carrying 1,000 tons more than the Germans. If figures for the previous years were available the results would be shown in an even more indicative manner. ol.

Here the carrying trade of British lines as against the German line is represented as follows : —British by France, the United Kingdom, and India ; German by Belgium, Austria, and Germany. N.B. Belgium is included as German tonnage, firstly, because it is all shipped from Antwerp, a port denied to British ships under the rate agreement previously referred to, and secondly, because evidence goes to show that the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise, whence the sugar originates, is in working agreement with, if not actually owned by, German capital. oo. The diagram shows that, whereas in 1908 British ships carried 6,050 tons of sugar, as against 3,150 carried by the Germans, in 1913-14 they carried only 8,650 tons, as against 13,600 carried by the German line. In other words the tonnage carried by British lines increased by 2,000 tons, while the German in the same time increased by 10,450 tons.34 Two tilings must be remembered, firstly, the rapidity with which the Germans captured the trade-in a space of five years only—and secondly, that the slight recovery of the United Kingdom tonnage during the last two years was solely due to the repeated appeals of His Majesty’s Resident in the Gulf, through whose instance pressure was brought to bear upon Messrs. Tate to re-enter this field. Whether the firm in question can be persuaded to persevere in its attempts in face of the situation remains to be seen. 35. As to the serious effects which the loss of the sugar trade must have upon British lines, Mr. Chick (Commercial Adviser in Gulf) has pointed out that, out of a total 75,512 packages carried to Bushire by British lines in 1911, no less than 40,900 were of Marseilles sugar. 30. The sugar trade has been selected as an example of the inroads made upon British sea-borne traffic to the Gulf ports themselves. When, however, the enquirer wishes to examine the conditions of foreign trade in Iraq and Turkish Arabia, and its important Persian transit trade, he is handicapped by the absolute lack of any official information on the subject. Turkish customs statistics are too inaccurate to be of any value, and British Consular reports in Basra are so scanty in their information, and so ill drawn up, that they have no practical value of any kind. Comparative statistics as between Britain and her competitors, which from a State point of view are the most important form of information, are not given at all, and German competition, which has been the one subject of interest and discussion among the local trading community for the last 10 years, has not a dozen lines devoted it throughout the period. We can therefore only fall back upon a general description embodying the unanimous view of all the traders concerned. 37. Such opinio]i would confirm the existence of an active and successful competition on the part of Germany in Iraq. The Germans became masters of general trade, except Manchester traffic and special Indian imports. In all the various articles of import such as glass, stationery, drugs, hosiery, hardware, &amp;c., German imports rapidly ousted British trade, in addition to the important sugar trade. Whilst the latter only represents an import value of some 450,000b, as against a Manchester cotton trade of some 1,200,000b, it is probable that the sugar trade added to the general trade would show a total import trade not greatly inferior to the total British import trade, exclusive of India. This is remarkable enough in view of the short time in which German traders have been in this field. 38. But the rapidity with which they have attacked the export trade is far more remarkable. It is a matter of regret that the British Consul here should have neglected to obtain information to demonstrate statistically the well-known occurrences of the last ten years in this matter, for the informa tion Avas easily to be obtained from year to year. 39. Only in the last report available of 1912 does he show the amounts of grain shipped to London and Hamburg respectively, and their figures show that 80,000 tons of grain w r ere shipped by the Germans to Hamburg and Antwerp, against 90,000 tons to England. This was in 1911, only five years after the beginning of German operations, and British merchants complain bitterly of the loss of this trade to the Germans. They state that the Germans did the trade at a loss, and give the usual reply about “ subsidies ” ; but there is more evidence to show (and the Commercial A dviser in the Gulf agrees with me on the point) that this was not generally the case, and that the Germans were able to take the trade away from British firms and still make a profit. British firms w r ork on a double margin of profit, leaving a London margin and a local margin, thereby handicapping themselves in quotation to a great degree. 40. In import and export trade then, in Mesopotamia as in the Gulf, the Germans had seized a large share of trade hitherto exclusively British. This was not, however, the limit of their activities, for quite apart from the13 commencement of the Baghdad Railway they were attempting and were succeeding in capturing the river-carrying trade that had been a British monopoly up the Karim River, and which was the link between sea and land on the important caravan road known as the Lynch road into Persia. Briefly, the activities of the Germans in the past few years have had the result of ruining and jeopardising our position not only in the Persian Gulf, but in Mesopotamia and the river waterways that are the centres for British Central Persian trade. 41. We may now turn and examine what was happening to British trade during the same period in Persia itself. Economic Position in Persia. 42. bo mr the general aspects of British and German competition in the Persian Gulf only have been reviewed, we may now turn to a similar review of the position in southern and central Persia. 4o. Just as British trade in Iraq and in Gulf Ports depends upon the maintenance of British sea and river communications, so in southern and central Persia the permanence of our trade depends upon our abilitv to tianspoit goods from the Gulf ports to the central Persian markets as rapidly and as cheaply as possible. In these markets British merchandise has to meet energetic Russian competition, and British trade has suffered in the last few yeai&amp; se\eie checks at their hands. Ilns lias been due to a series of causes, but notably to the disturbed state of the country, which has reacted with some force in the north, but with far greater severitv in the south. 44. But the archives of the India Office and the Foreign Office afford ample testimony of the fact that the need for providing better land com munications loi om trade has been a matter of common agreement, and was undei ie \ iew long before the chaos in Persia became acute, and the comparative advantages of one railway over another discussed for the last ten years if not longer. Meanwhile, ‘in the north of Persia, Russia has slowly but steadily progressed in railways and roads, while in the south British merchandise still climbs the rugged passes of the kotals on mule or donkey back over roads “ protected ” only by the local tribesmen. 45. The long-continued official discussions and prospects for railway construction have so far resulted in no action (nor indeed has a single engineering survey been made except a section from Mohammerah toDizful), by virtue of which a decision even as to which of the alternative routes would gi’v e the most penetration power to British trade vis-u-vis our main competitor could be come to. . 4G. British trade recently so active, competing, in spite of geographical difficulties, so successfully with Russia as far north as Kermanshah and Ispahan, has of late years been faced with intolerable handicaps, and received no material assistance from the Government even in an area where, more than in any other, it was to the complete advantage of the Government to afford that assistance. 47. On the Bushire-Ispahan road the trade is believed to be past recovery—transport animals are only available in ever diminishing quantities, and consequently transport rates show a constant and fatal increase. The number of pack animals available, according to official returns in 1912, had diminished by_ 100 per cent., and in a despatch dated October 1913 forwarded by Sir Percy Cox, the position is summarised in these words :— “ If, compared with seven years ago, imports to the Ispahan Province via the Gulf are being severely restricted, and if under otherwise favourable conditions British trade is unable to check the extension of Russian trade southwards, it is due solely to the dearth of pack animals between Bushire and Ispahan and Ahwaz and Ispahan.” S 327 DThe despatch dealt with one particular year in which this was no^ doubt true, but other years would have shown handicaps occasioned by raids, by illegal levies on caravans, and such causes—all going to show that the obsolete methods of transport which are now the only vehicle for British p trade into Persia are rapidly hilling British commerce. This accomplished, the trade will pass into eager Russian hands ; and the railways, which, if built in time, could have kept alive and doubled our trade, will then have lost their opportunity and their raison d'etre. 48. It is not the purpose of this paper to criticise, but merely to state once again the facts, and to urge that, unless very early steps are taken to arrest the present palpable decline of our trade, it will fall into other hands from whom it will be difficult to recover it. 49. Even were surveys put in hand at once, it is highly improbable that the railway resulting could be completed before the lapse pf at least another five or seven years, during which time the decline in British trade, which is already so evident, is likely to have increased ; and should the provision of essential communications be much further delayed the trade may have disappeared altogether. 50. Nor is it the purpose here to discuss anew the rival merits of roads versus railways; material for deciding points of this nature is already at the disposal of the Government; but rather to urge that a decision be come to speedily and action taken. 51. The following tables will be convincing enough as to the adverse trade tendency referred to, and are made up from Persian (Belgian) Customs Statistics. Manchester goods (piece goods and yarns), tea, and metallic goods are the staple imports of Great Britain and India into Persia, and in order to show the share which Russia and Great Britain are comparatively taking of these imports the following diagrams have been drawn up. 52. It would have been very desirable, and the lessons obtainable would have been more pointful, had it been possible to give a comparative review over a 20 year period ; but the fact that up till the establishment of Belgian control of Persian Customs the inaccuracy of the statistics renders them useless, has made this impossible, and figures have only been given for the period since which accurate statistics are available. 53. No one conversant, however, with Russo-British trade of the past in Persia will deny that it is safe to assume that the farther you go back the greater would the preponderance of British trade over Russian, up to and including Ispahan and Kermanshah, be established ; or in other vmrds that the comparative decline vis-d-vis Russia of British trade is not a phenomenon of merely six years, but has been going on for a longer period, is therefore more determined, and more indicative of the deep-rooted nature of the disease. 54. The first two diagrams show the position as regards Manchester goods. / ^ vyd/Q fi tH&amp;A/tX M o-ws i \qoq.io i&lt;yo-n tqn-i3L 3 - 1 W-It will be seen— (1) That the imports from United Kingdom have steadily declined to a negligible quantity ; while (2) Russian imports starting from nil have steadily increased. (3) That Manchester yarns have been replaced by Indian yarns. Thus while English imports on the one hand have declined from 800 tons to 150 tons in six years, Russian imports have increased by 550 tons in the same period ; and further, in spite of the steady increase of Indian imports, the total imports of United Kingdom and India together have only increased by 300 tons as against the 550 tons increase of Russia. 55. If we turn to the diagram on imports of piece goods the same tendency is to be observed in an even more marked degree. t Q; og- ^ cd UjLcjl ^crooba wJU f’o-S.Pfji , \qiq-u tqn-ta iqaub Tj 0 9 o I 9 Q CO^cfAA. The figures show— (1) That United Kingdom and Indian imports are steady and each show a small increase. (2) But that Russian imports show a continuous and large expansion. Thus while Manchester imports have increased barely 1,500 tons and Indian by 1,250, Russian imports have increased by 6,000 tons and have actually surpassed the Manchester imports, and are only 1,000 tons iess than Indian and. Manchester imports combined. 56. If this has happened in one premier industry, in a field not long ago monopolized by British products, and has, moreover, occurred in the short space of six years, then it is clear that something immediate needs to be done, if the process of decay is to be arrested and our position restored. 57. Be it observed moreover that no random selection of trades has been made, nor a studied selection designed to support a pre-conceived theory, but those trades in which we were strongest have been chosen. If such be the condition of these trades, what is likely to be the condition of those supple mentary trades for which we are not perhaps so well adapted ? 58. We may take as an example of one of the latter trades that large Eastern trade in enamelware, a product which there is no reason why we should not be able to produce as cheaply as our foreign rivals, but which has fallen everywhere largely into other hands.10 0 0 Imjaort of 'bnamelooare ^ . -r ar) s \qos-ocj iqo^-io , '^io-h ' lc l 12 '' 3 ^ Russia has been 440 tons. 59. According to the Persian (Belgian) Customs House statistics the imports of British (Indian) teas into Persia have actually declined while those of Russia largely increased. Thus, while Russian exports have expanded from 900 to 2,300 tons, British imports have declined from 2,300 tons to 2,000 tons, that is to say, that Russia has increased her imports by 1,400 tons while Britain has decreased hers by 300 tons. 60. The Indian tea trade, however, has not only been handicapped as against Russian by the worse land transport facilities referred to previously, but by other causes as well. While an adverse tariff checked the trade considerably, yet the smuggling genius of the native traders in Persia did something to counteract this handicap ; but it suffered its worst blow at the hands of the British India line who by its exorbitant freights between Calcutta and the Gulf strangled to a large degree its efforts as may be seen by the diagram below. -C Q-Wa iqoq-IQ rqn-«l- _L3, i Q O 0 1 SGO 1 6 Oti 1 U O 0 12 0 0 1 o o o l * 0 0 1 € 0 0 1^00 t 1 a o •fiAWv^ t 0 0 0 RiAiivsAt tSpy'-OOi to 0^.10 iqtO-M Tqn-tl17 61. The whole question has been fully dealt with in Captain Birdwood’s Despatch, No. 468, of 14th February 1914, to the Government of India, in which he lays stress on the excessive freight rates alluded to. The despatch points out that, according to Calcutta merchants, excessive British Indian freights have much to do with the diversion of trade to Russia, and also that in consequence Indian tea now goes into Persia via Russia and is described as Russian tea. 62. Attention is here drawn to this example of the importance of providing better communications for our trade with southern Persia, and to the fact that, partly owing to our misuse of existing sea transit, but still more to the benefits gained by Russia by her development of railways and roads in northern Persia. In support of this I quote from the same despatch, page 2, as follows :— “ The diversion of India, Batavian and China teas from the Persian Gulf to the Black and Caspian Seas has undoubtedly been fostered by the opening of the Batoum-Baku, Batoum-Tabriz and Batoum-Meshed routes,” after which the converse effect upon Gulf trade is described in the bad land communications from the Gulf. 63. The following table given by the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence in India of rates charged by various companies on the alter native routes substantiates the statements made above :— Calcutta to Batoum - - - Austrian Lloyd, Rs. 30s. per ton (50 cubic feet). To the first two quotations must be added the land charges. Rates from Batoum to Baku by rail, to Enzeli by sea, and Enzeli to Tehran are not known, but said to be much lower than above rates. 64. “ But the reason for the rapid encroachment of the import via Russia . . . till lately supplied almost entirely urn the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding the far greater distance to be travelled, is probably to be found in— “ (a) high shipping freights from India to the Gulf as compared with freights from India-Batoum ; “ (6) high rates of transport from Gulf and Kermanshah to Ispahan.” Nowq the producer of Indian teas may take the view that it is immaterial to him which way his tea enters Persia, provided it reaches the market and demand remains. But from the point of view of British trade in general and British influence in Persia, it matters a great deal. Not only does the import via Russia of an increased tonnage assist in lowering the import cost of all goods coming from Russia, but there is also lost to British traders (a) the profits on sea carriage, (6) the merchants’ profits en route ; and, finally, it has the disadvantage of throwing Persian buyers still further into the hands of the Russian merchant for this and for other purchases as well. 65. No clearer proof could be given of the inadequacy of our trade communications from the Gulf that the fact that tea can reach Ispahan from Calcutta more cheaply, in spite of Canal dues and immensely increased mileage, via Suez, Constantinople and Batoum than direct to Ispahan. In the latter journey bulk is broken only twice, or at the most three times. Whereas via Caspian it must be landed at Batoum, at Baku, at Enzeli, at Resht, and again at Tehran. S 327 E Rates for Tea.

The comparative proximity of Russian iron and steel works in South Russia partly explains these figures, as against which British products have the benefit of sea carriage to Persian ports as against the more costly land transport and bulk breakage of the Russian route. » 6 S 6 0 S O W 0 to 1 to G O &amp; £ 0 to C| 1 Q to S S &amp; o E h 0 o ? to &amp; to 'I C, 0 Q -r £ 0 to £ g to to €. a 0 k c o 0 S C. to o S 1 0 0 fo S' to a k to 0 k to to O ^ C, b to 5 £ to to 2 8 to 6 2 ^ b o 2 0 6 0 1 C ts 0 ? 5 0 o imports in 1909-10 is due probably to the importation for erection of Abadan oil refineries and pipe line. The normal course of imports may more properly be arrived at by a curve from 1908-09 to 1913-14, and the steady decline of British imports, as shown in the diagram, is to that extent artificial or at any rate non-indicative. British imports seem to have risen slightly, but to have been completely overtaken by Russian. 67. The export trade shows almost in exactly the same way the tendencies exhibited by the import trade, and it will suffice if the diagrams are appended without comment. Attention is, however, drawn to the fact that of the main raw materials emanating from Persia, viz., wool, gum, hides, rice and cotton, there is scarcely an exception from the adverse tendency displayed in the general trade, and British are importing comparatively less and less year by year, while Russia imports more and more of Persian products.

Ley, E« 5 quire, I.C.S., Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, The Secretary, Revenue and Statistics Department, India Office. I am directed to forward, for the information of His Majesty 1 s Secretary of State for India, a copy of a 'Mote on the Economic Situation in the Gulf and Mesopotamian Markets by Captain George Lloyd, M.P., together with an additional copy for the use of the Board of Trade. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant,NOTES ON ECONOMIC SITUATION in GULF AND MESOPOTAMIAN MARKETS. By Captain George L&amp;oyti, K*P. The strategical and Neval necessity of maintaining a predominant -or position in the Persian Gulf ns well as in Central Persia is founded on such decisive declarations on the pert of His Majesty’s Government at various times that it may be‘taken ss axiomatic. It has also been an accepted doctrine that this position must depend mainly upon the retention of a preponderance of British trade in these areas, and that in proportion as Russian or German influence extends into Persia end the Gulf, so will their pretentions to a greater share of territorial and political influence become more firmly established® But this doctrine in recent years has not been supported by a policy acta&gt; ive enough to maintain it. It, he.s, it is true, suffered politie?*lly as far as Persia is concerned by its inevitable subordination to more urgent diplomatic needs such as the Anglo-Rueeian Agreement of 190?, but it has also suffered c commercially throughout the area by an indecision which neither the unsettled state of Southern Persia nor the struggles with Germany over the Baghdad Railway more than partially explain. The temporally elision of Germany from the Gulf and the cer »ir y that before long new spheres of influence as between Russia and ourselves in Persi* must be negotiated makes the moment one in which, however great our other pre*'occupations, the economic position of Great Britain in the Gulf and Persia musT. be resummarised and have attention paid to it so tnat in realising clearly the necessities of the situation, we shall be ready at the moment of negotiations to pursue a policy which will satisfy those necessities* It is dangerous and may be fate! to continue in partial recognition of the dangers, and in total indecision as to the remedies.

Without attempting to define whet they mean by eubeidie. theythey merely look upon them as an unfair weapon or economic warfare, something like gae in trench war-rare ee a hit below the belt with which no fighter however skilled can be expected to deal* It is therefore, important to make them realise that it is nothing of the kind and the mere fact that the Germane have in some areas used their organised fstem to shroud dishonest methods is no ground for not accepting ''subsidies*' as a perfectly fair and recognised system or modern commercial war-iare. It may well be asked what were the powenul methods by which a single line Mis like the Hamburg America line were able after a bare ten years in the ^ulf to make Lord In chape write in this strain. The usual reply of 'German subeidief! w is no suffi cient anewer, for the French Government have for many years heavily »ubsldi$S}&lt;^h6 Leeeageriee ^aritimes line to Australia and yet British lines nave made perfectly successful headway against *hem. I'he £ennan line, too, was peculiarly handicapped in the U ulf trade. It was fortified by no large Manchester freignt contracts. The British lines had this advantage. It had no share in the large Marseilles sugar carrying trade. *he British line had it all. Its passenger traffic wae insignificant. The British passenger traffic wae considerable and included a highly profitable pilgrim traffic. Its mail contract if it existed at all was small, that of the British India was substan tial. The political and commercial atmosphere of the Gull was hostile to it out was entirely favourable to British lines* It had no inland communications to assist its trade penetration whilst in British hands lay the foreign monopoly not only of the Tigris and Karun River traffic but the organisation and virtual control of all trade roads from the Gulf inland* The pressure that a line eo adversely situated must have been able to exert to counterbalance ell these handicaps and to dictate any terms at all to so powerful a British group must have been very considerable indeed, and it wae so. That the pressure wae exerted by means of 'subsidies' is in a sense true, but the term is far too loose to indicate the methods employed. The power wae derived from state organisation of production and transit working in harmony, and in this particular connection wae derived from the employ of what is known ae the 'Through rate system'. Ihe importance of .understanding the system which has been used to forge a way for German produces and German shipping all over the world is so great as to warrant ite re-statement in brief in this paper. During the early years of the invasion of any area a direct subsidy is given by the German Government to the German line sunicient to enable the line to cut rates and underquote ite competitors throughout the area. The low rate ie designed chieflychisfly to attract traflic away from tha compating Xinaa but alao to maka poaaibla tha rapid and aystematic flooding of tha invadad xnarkata with chaap Carman gooda* Tha lina worka in partmarehip with a trading house eataoliehed in tha invadad area who ^irranges for the distribution and sale ofl its cargoes which come out unconaignad and collects exports under cover of the low rate for return ireignt. hut these early preliminaries are really directed to one oeject and one object alone; which ie to persuade tha competing lines to enter into a rate agreement with them* i ha German eyetem is so framed that once this ia affected there ie every prospect of their becoming masters of the trade position within a very short time. -HCe/w As soon tiny as the competing lines have agreed not to carry goods to the area under a fixed figure, the German direct subsidy is replaced by an indirect subsidy system which ie of general application to all German export trade, and which contrary to the academic views hold by some in regard to state subsidies may, but also may not, 21 Involve even any initial loss to the state* This eyetem known as the 'Through rate eystem' is designed to enable shipping companies already in rate agreement with thnir competitor* ostensibly to observe their engagement* towards the foreigner, tut in practise to underquote them whenever it may suit them to do so* In the task of captur ing a new market, when the formation of a clientele and the volume of trade done have feara temporarily more importance than the earning of large profits, the freedom to underquote end take a smaller profit than their rivals in order to supplant their trade it all important. As will be seen subsequently, the higher the rate agreed to as the minimum, the more smoothly does the system operate for the German* and the more rapidly is their rival ousted* The system works as follows and is ths outcome of scientific organisation of land and sea transit* for the sake of example let us suppose the case of the carriage of goods from an inland town in Germany on the one hand and from an inland town in England on the other to a common inland port in Turkey* A German line has agreed with it* British rivals not to quote less than 40/« per ton from any port in Germany, and the ^ritish line has entered into a similar agreement in regard to British ports, to Basrah* Let us suppose that a Birmingham manufacturer wishes to send a ton of goods to Baghdad* H * is quoted say 10/- a ton from Birmingham to Manchester or Liverpool, he must pay the agreed rate of 40/** lor sea freight from Manchester or Liverpool vO basrah, and he is quoted 10/- for the carriage of the goods from the Port of ^asrnhBwrah to “aghdad giving him a through ret* of to/- pX u . port end landing charge. „ a. 'ritieh exporter cannot however get e through rat. quoted him as from Birmingham to Baghdad and ie dependent upon the fluctuation, of the land rate at either end. ihe German manufacturer at Ee.en, however, who wienee equally to .end a ton oj of good, to Baghdad will, by applying to the rail authorities at K.aen be quoted an inclutive rate from Eesen to Baghdad» Tho rate quoted him will be sufficiently below the lowest rate available to the British exporter to enable him to undersell his rival in the martet of de.tinati.n which 1* will .» PP oee to ba 55/* «&gt;. 5/- io.e, if there be a loss by tho interworking of the state railways and the shipping company, is apportioned to that part of the transit which can carry it without loss: or in the rare caee where both the railway and the shipping company are working at too fine a margin to allow of the 5/** to be carried without loss, the loss is divided between tne 1 two * In the latter case the ehipping company will in effect oe carrying the goods for 3?A and underquoting their agreement to that extent, out this fact will never become apparent for the published rate from Hamburg to oasrah is given as 40/- or if euspectec can neverjbe brought home, as it is always open to the company to sey that the railway company lowered their ixad* rate from Essen to Hamourg by five shillings, and unless the apportionment in every cese of the share of the through rate as between the line, the railway and the transport company between Basrah and gaghdad can be proved, which it cannot be, the British line lays it^self open to be underquoted in its agreement without hope of remidy. The main advantages to Germany of which are that:- (a) She is enabled at will to underquote her rivals, and therefore capture the trade without fear of reprisals* ^b) That wherees a rate agreement is usually operative for four or rive years and is made irrespective of questions vital to the exporter, vis, fluctuating cost of materials and demand for goods, it it entirely to the advantage of the German » exporter (and thus the ehipping line also) that hie rate should be flexible while that of his competitor is fixed. (c) That.if end when the German line can conclude a similar arrangement with the land transport Company at the port of discharge and get them to tie the hands of the competing land transport Company by a rate agreement the lose, if any, over the whole transport can be still further spread. It must be repeated nere, however, that in as much as a rats^agreement is »«d&lt; made with the object of oliminating outside competition, it follows that the partiespartie* have a monopoly of traffic within the scope of the agreement. Therefore there is every prohahility that the agreed rate allows for a handsome margin of profit. This enables the Germans w*aa they underquote in the manner indicated above not only to do so without any lose at all but at s profit, but also to take the traffic away from those with whom© they have agreed rates. The above system explains why the Agreement come to betw;een the British lines and the German in the ^ulf was deecriced as a 'fatal” one, not less innocent at firat signt would appear to be the agreement come to not to load at Hamburg and Antwerp in return for a similar agreement on tne part of the Germans not to load at oritieh Ports, hut here again the special circumstances of the case must be taicen into consideration. The German line made no sacrifice in this part of the agreement commensurate with the sacrifice made by the nritieh lines* For the British lines had got contracts ox considerable duration xor the carriage of the vest majority of the shipments of Manchester goods to the Gulf, contracts which the Hamburg America could not disturb, and for whose ultimate expiry they probably could not afford to wait. But, on the other hand, the port of tkm Antwerp had provided for a long time past a rich source of freights for the British lines with which the Garmane had only recently begun to compete* And the loss of this field was an immense sacrifice for the British lines to make, gut here again to a smaller degree, the German through rates system is called into play to circumvent the agreement come to between it and ^wee victim, ^here an agreement is come to not to load from a nritish Port on the part of the Hamburg America, British cargo is obtained from British ports in the following manner. The London merchant is offered through tenne from London to Basrah by the agent of a line allied to the Hamburg American and ships of that line collect cargo in the port of London, transport it to Hamburg or Antwerp fpr shipment in theitfamburg American j.ine steamers to Basrah, All that happens ie that the line carrying the good* between the port oil London and Hamburg or Antwerp takes the place in the system of the German state railway, A he London merchant will be befit it is true by getting the IdOrer rate of freight, but he is really assieting Jo hie own funeral in assieting the system contrived for the replacement of hie comoditiee by those of German origin* ±t will thus be seen that the 'Through rate system' worked in conjunction with rate agreements is the chief weapon of the German competitive policy, and it f oil owe that in consequence, every snort ought to be concentrated in refusing to make rate agreements with German lines and in this way to prevent to * certain degrdegree full operation of tha 'Through rate system' agairst us* ”»• Gennan line eet to work imnoaiately to sell* the ouger carrying trade m trom the nntiah linee in whose hands prsvious to its intrusion into the Gulf, it had exclusively been and who were the holders of all the Mareeilles sugar freight contracts* Aha process of seizure worked rapidly and whilst in 190« the British carrying trade (represented hy the imports of India, u« K« end France) totalled some 2925 tons as against ths German (represented by the imports of Germany and Aastrfca) 1950 tone, five years later in 1913, the British tonnage had only increased by some 450 tons whilst the Germans had increased by 45i&gt;0 tone, Already in five a years ths Remans were carrying more of this class of sugar to the Gulf than were the British linee although five years previously, the britieh lines were carrying 1,000 tone more than the Germans* Jn the import of Loaf sugar, previously also a monopoly of ths British linsi ths same story is told, and told even more convincingly« whereas in 190t5 British ships carried 4450 tons of sugar as against 3150 carried by the Germane; in 1913-14 they carried only £450 tone as against 13,400 carried by the German line* In other words tne tonnage carried by British lines inefeased by 2,000 tons, while ths German in the same time increased by 10,450 tone* Two things must be remembered, firstly the rapidity with which the Germans captured the trade-&lt;»ir a space of five pears — and secondly that the slight recovery of the tonnage during the last two years was solely due to the repeated appeals of H»M # Resident in the Qulf through whose instance pressure was Drought to bear upon Messrs Tate, te reenter this field* whether the firm in question can be persuaded to pmeemme* in its attempts in face of the situation rsmains to bs seen, as to the serious sffsets which the lees of the sugar trads must have upon British liaes Mr* Chick (Commercial Adviser in Gulf) has pointed out that of a total 75512 packages carried to Bushir* by British Xinss in 1911, no less than 44900 ware sf Marseilles sugar* ^he sugar trads has been selected as an example of the inroads made upon British sea-berne traffic te the u ulf Perte themselves, when, however, the enquirer vs wishes ts examine the conditions of f oreign trads in Iraq and British Arabia, and its important rersian transit trade, he is handicapped by the absolute lacx of anyany official information on the axfc# eubject, Turkieh cuatoma atatiatica are too inaccutate to be of any value and British Consular reports in Basrah are so scanty in their inf ormation and so ill drawn up that they have no practical value of any kind Comparative statistics as between Britain and her competitors, which from a state point of view are the most important form of information, are not given at all and German competition wrhifih has been the one sudj ect of interest and discussion among the local trading community the last ten years has not a dozen lines devoted au to it throughjt the period. We can, therefore, only fall back upon a general description embodying the unanimous view of all the trader* concerned. Such opinion would confirm the existence of an active and euccessful competition on the pnrt of Germany in Iraq. The Germans necame masters of general trade except Manchester traffic and special Indian imports. In all the various arti** cles of import each as glass, stationery, drugs, hosiery, hardware &amp;c. German imperte rapidly axxxxx ousted British trade, in addition to the important sugar trade, Whilst the latter only represents an import value of gome £450,000 as against a Manchester cotton trade of tome £1,200,000, it is prooaole that the sugar trade added te the General trade would show a total import trade not greatly inferior to the total aritieh imoort tr^de exclusive of India. Thi.e is remarkaule enough in view of the short time in which German traders have oeen in this field. But the rapidity with which they have attacked the export trade is far more remarkaole. In the &amp;afct Consular renort available of 19x2, he shows the amounts of grain shipped to London andCHamburg respectively and their figures show that 80.000 tons of grain were shipped oy the Germans to Hamburg and Antwerp against a 90.000 tons to England, This was in 191i, only 5 y«ars after the oeginning of German operations and British merchants complain oitterly of the loss of this trade to the Germane, They atat-e that the Germans did the trade at a loss and give the u usual reply about 'subsidies'; but there is more evidence to show (and the Ctmmercial adviser in the Gulf agrees with me on the point) that tfcis wae not generally the case and that Hie Germans ware able to take the trade away from British xil firms and still make a profit. British firm* work on a double margin of prefit, leaving a London margin and Local margin thereby handicapoing themselves in quotation to a great degree. In import and export traae, then, i« Mesopotamia as in the Gulf, thethe Germans had seited a large share of trade hitherto exclusively Britisho Ihis was not, however, the limit of their activities, for quite apart from the commencement of the Baghdad Railway they were attempting and were succeeding in capturing the river carrying trade that had be^n a British monopoly up the Karun River and which was the iink between sea and land on the important caravan road known as the Lynch Road in to Persia* Briefly,, the activities of the Germans in the past few years have had the result of ruining and jeopardising our position not only in the Persian Gulf, out in Mesopotamia and the river waterways that Are the centres f or British Central Parti Persian trade. £ pnrtrmnt of Commerce &lt;£ IndustryNOTES ON KCUi OUC SIT 1 ATI ON in CULT AND HKSOPOTAklAN MARKER’S. hy Captain Oeorge Lioya, ,0.

Plain evidences of the Government' e uneasiness may be seen for inst-nce m the negotiations between the Foreign Office and the Persian Government in regard to the southern trn e routes, culnin- atirg at O' e period in a threat to take British measures to safeguard the tra e routes themselves; but the tear of committing themselves to new responsibilities in Southern Persia, fears which Hus sia in the North showed no signs of being incommoded f&gt;y, seem to have obscured the vision of it-eing ii'ew.weda^ by, esaw to hawe obscured the viaior of the Home Government to th fj greater danger th»t confronted theni in the loss of its economic position in the Cubf• uQ^MUFICAUONS * Inasmuch as the pr^jnary essential for out tr de, vis a vis ussia in Persia, or Germany in the Gulf, is the -revision of good lend end s^a communication, it is pertinent to examine the position in which britisi &amp; finds itself to-d»*y in regard to shipping, railways and roads. f p till 1906 . British shinning had a nracticel monopoly of all tr-detrad© entering and leaving Gulf Porta, in 19C6, however, the Hamburg*American line started a service of steamers to the ^ulf and in spite of initial losses maintained their services so that in four years they had increased their import trade by 100^, From that time onwards working in close co-operation with the German firmof 'onckhaus established at various points in the Gulf* their success has been phenommal, British shipping lines who commenced by being scornful became alarmed they realised that the German Company had come to the Gulf to stay, and British merchants who at first had seen in the competition of the Hamburg-America^ a silver lining to the cloud of previous high freights soon began to realise that the Hamburg*American line had not come there in order to serve the interests of old established British houses but rather to carry German goods with which to out*trade the British Merchants in all the G u lf Markets* In the short space of ten years, they have succeeded in wresting practi cally the whole of the sugar traffic, formerly exclusively in British hands from the British lines, and in making very serious inroads into much of the general traffic formerly emanating from Great Britain and now coming from Antwerp or Hamburg. Perhaps the shortest and most convincing evidence as to the hold which the Hamburg America line had acquired in the first ten years of its competition will be shown in the nature of agreement come to between the conference of British lines (which in itself was formed to oppose the German line} and the Board of the Hamburg America recently before thenar. The agreement provided two mam things (a) an agreement of freight rates from Lurope to the Gulf and (b) an agreement that the British line© should not load at Hamburg or Antwerp on condition that the German Vv, line should not load at Hrawiah Ports. These term© were fatal terms for the British lines to accept and information goes to show that the terms were practically dictated to them as to a beaten enemy, the significatasa of this fact will only be fully recognised when it is seen that the German line found themselves in a position to dictate terms to a conference of British lines composed of no less important lines There was it is true a Russian Line which had a nominal monthly service to the Gulf, but it was in no sense competitive as regards British trade and was, moreover, not very successful in its own trade. In the date season a few non-»ritish ships under special American or other charter called at Basrah out apart from this it may be sail that all British goods entering or leaving Gulf Ports were carried in British bottoms.lin©» than the britiah India line, holding the largest raerchantile tonnage in the world and of lines under the control of men like Sir Jorm merman and others. ^t it important alto to reeognite the nature of the terma impoaed, for at first sight the terms agreed to scarcely seem to warrant their being described as fatal, in any case Lord Inchape did not fail to grasp the nature of the agreement he was entering into or its serious nature, for in Lecember, 1?13» he stated that:- 'it has been an impossibility for British shipowners to compete success- 'fully with the Hamburg America line, subsidised at that Company it, either direct- 'lyo or indirectly by the u erman Covernment, and the British shipowners have ba^n 'obliged to come to terms with the Hamburg America line, and to agree to rates of 'freight and also to give up directly loading from ’amburg and Antwerp.... w lf tht british lines had not co; e to teres with the iiambuAmericAXiJLe 'hevfc been impossible for them to maintain a position in the trade . . . .

As it may quite confidently be assumed that the Germans both did and do intend to continue their operations against us by means of 'subsidies’ , it is clear that Lord Inchape’s anxieties are not confined only to ths European Gulf trade, but that he also fears that they may in the future take a highly dangerous interest in the indo-Gulfttrade it is remarkable aloo that Lord Inchape*s pessimism in regard to the success German methods have had in the Gulf is fully shared t?y local merchants and traders in Iraq, ihe traders whom nine years ago were full of an unjustified tut an easy confidence as to the impregnanility of their position in Persian, Turkish and Gulf ark*t 8 are now the first to admit that at the outbreak of ar they were something like a beaten body and in a very short time would h-ve to take second place to tre Germans, ihey still, however, refuse to 1 ok the tacts souarely in the face and say that theynean not be accepted to light auccesafully against German 'subsidies'. Without attempting to define what they mean by ’subsidies' theythey merely look upon then Rg a n unfair weapon of economic warfare, something like g a8 in trench war-iare at e hit below the belt with which no fighter however skilled can be expected to deal. It is therefore, important to make them realise that it is nothing of the kind and the mere fact that the Hermans have in some areas used their organised 'stem to shroud dishonest methods ie no ground for not accepting 'subsidies” as a perfectly fair and recognised system of modern commercial war^fare. It may well be asked what were the powerful methods by which a single line lik like the Hamburg America line were able after a bare ten years in the ^ulf to make ^ord u.nchape write in this strain, ihe usual reply of 'German subsidies' is no suffi cient answer, for the French Government have for many years heavily subsiid5(ar* the iessageriea laritimes line to Australia and yet British lines have made perf#ctly successful headway against $hem. a he Ceman line, too, was peculiarly handicapped in the U ulf trad*. It was fortified by no large kanchester freignt contracts. The British lines had this advantage. It had no share in the large Marseilles sugar carrying trade. *he British line had it all. Its passenger traffic was insignifleant. The British passenger traffic was considerable and included a highiy profitable pilgrim traffic. Its mail contract if it existed at all was small, that of the British India was substan* tial. Ihe political and commercial atmosphere of the Gulf was hostile to it but was | entirely favourable to British lines, it had no inland communications to assist it® trade penetration whilst in British hands lay the foreign monopoly not only of the ;ignis and Karun ftiver traffic but the organisation and virtual control of all trade roads from the u ulf inland. The pressure that a lin* so adversely situated must have been able to exert to counterbalance all these handicaps and to dictate any terms at all to so powerful a British group must have been very considerable indeed, end it was so. * That the pressure was exerted by means of 'subsidies' is in a sense true, but the term is far too loose to indicate the method*? employed. The power was derived from state organisation of production and transit working in hannonji end in this particular connection was derived from the employ of what ia known as the 'Through rate system'. The importance of understanding the system which has be*n used to forge a way for German produces end German shipping all over the world is so great as to warrant its re-statement in brief in this paper. during the early years of the invasion of any area a direct subsidy is given by the German Government to the Ger an line sufficient to enable the line tc cut rates and underquote its competitors throughout the area. The low rate is designed chieflychiefly to attract trafiic asay from the competing lines but also to melee possible the rapid and systematic flooding of the inaadad markets with cheap German goods. Vhe line works in partnership with a trading house estatlishad in the invaded area who arranges for the distribution and sale o£ its cargoes which come out unconsigned and &gt;Xl6Cws exports under cover ot the low rets for return freight* isut these early preliminaries are really directed to one object and one object alone; which i© to persuade the competing lines to enter into a rnte agreement with them. *he German system is so framed that one© this is effected tViere is every prospect ol their becoming masters of the trade position within a very short time# ^s soon thwy as the competing lines have agreed not to carry goods to the area under s fixed figure, the German direct subsidy is replaced by an indirect subsidy system which is of general application to all German export trade, *nd which eontr-ry to the academic views hold fcy some in regard to state subsidies may, but also may not, it involve . . . , , i even any initial loss to the state. This system inown as the 'Through rate system' is designed to enable shipping companies already in rate agreement with th&lt;ir competitors ostensibly to observe t'neir engagements towards the foreigner, but in practise to underquote them wherever it may suit them to do so. In the teak of cantur- mg a new market, when the formation of a clientele and the volume of trede done have k»xx temporarily more importance than the earning of large profits, the freedom to underquote end take a smaller profit than their rivals in order to supplant their trede is all important. As will be sewn subsequently, the higher the rate agreed to es the minimum, the more smoothly does the system operate for the Germans and the r; ore rapidly is their riv*l ousted. ihe system works as follows and is the outcome of scientific organisation of land ard sea transit. ror the sake of example let us suppose the* c^«e of the carriage of goods from an inland town in Germany on the on© hand and from nr inland town in England on the other to a conurion inland port in Turkey. A German line has agreed with its British rivals not to quote less than 40/«* per ton from any port in Germany, and the ^ritish line has entered into a similar agreement in regard to British porta, to Basrah. Let us suppose that a Birmingham manufacturer wishes to send a ton of goods to Baghdad. * l e is ouoted say 10/- e ton from Birmingham to Manchester or Liverpool, he must pay the agreed rate of 40/- for sea freight from Manchester or Liverpool to A; asrah, and he is quoted 10/- for the carriage of the goods from the Port of B M rnh IBasrah to Baghdad giving him a through rata of b0/~ plus port and landing charges. Ihe “ntioh exporter cannot however get a through rate quoted him ae from Birmingham to Baghdad and is dependent upon the fiuctuations of the land rate at either end. _ * he G * ra * n manufacturer at ssen, however, who wishes equally to send a ton ol ' 41 Boods to (Jaghdad will, by applying to the rail authoritiee at ! seen be Quoted an inclusive rate from .aaen to Baghdad. The rate quoted him wiii be sufficiently below the lowest rat* evailatie to the British exporter to enable him to undersell his rival VO-» YfV- ilyU. 60 /— in the market of destination which \m will suppose to be 5 $/4, *he 5/* loss, if there be a loss by the interworking of the state railways and the shinping company* is apportioned 10 that part of the transit which can carry it without loss: or in the rare case where both the railway and the shipping company are working at too fine a margin to allow of the 5/® to be carried without loss, the loss is divided (etween tne 1 two. In the latter case the shioping company will in efiect be carrying the goods for 37A and underquoting their agreement to that extent, nut this fact will never become apparent for the published rate from Hamburg to naarah is given as 40/- or if euspectec can nevebbe brought home* as it ie always open to the company to esy that the railway company lowered their ixad* rate from ssen to Hamourg by five shillings, and unless the apportionment in every case of the share of the through rate as between the line, the railway and the transport company between Basrah and 'aghdad can be proved* which it cannot be, the British line lays it self open to be underquoted in its agreement without hope of remidy. -he main advantages to Germany of which are that:- la) She is enabled at will to underquote her rivals, and therefore capture the #ri trade without fear of reprisals. lb) That whereas a rate agreement is usually operative for four or five years and it made irrespective of questions vital to the exporter, vix, fluctuating cost of materials and demand for goods, it is entirely to the advantage of tha German » exporter land thus the shipping line also) that his rate should be flexible while that of his competitor is fixed. (c) That if and when the German line can conclude a similar arrangement with the land transport Company at the port of discharge and get than to tie the hands of the competing lend transport Company by a rate agreement the loss, if eny, over the whole transport can be still further spread. it must be repeated nere, however, that in ae much as a rate agreement is ^sse --• v 'I I made with the object of eliminating outside competition, it follows that the partiespartie* have a monopoly of traffic within the ocope of the agreement. Therefore there i* ev * r y prolactlity that ihe agreed rate allows for e handsome margin of profit. v^V'\ 6 / v&gt; ' This enables the Gormans wim they underquote in the manner indicated above not only . rorn those with whoiae they have agreed rates. The above system explains why the Agreement come to between the British lines and the German in the G u lf was deacrioad ae e M fatal M one. ot less innocent at first sight would appear to be the agreement come to not to ioed at Hamburg and Antwerp in return for « similar agrer*ert on the part of tne Germans not to load at British ; orte. But hare again the special circumstances of the case must be taken into consideration. The German line made no sacrifice in this part of the agreement commensurate with the sacrifice madp by the British lines, for the British lines had got contracts of considerable duration for the carriage of the vast majority of the shioraents of jCjanchester goods to the Gulf, contracts which the Hamburg America could not disturbi and for whose ultimate expiry they probably could not afford to wait. But, on the other hand, the port of Jtka Antwerp had provided for a long time past a rich source of freights for the British lines with which the G*ratans had only rece tly begun to compete. And the loss of this field was an immense sacrifice for the British lines to make. into play to circumvent the agreement come to betwe -n it «nd tin# victim. Where an agreement is come to not to load from a British Fort on the part of the Hamburg America, British cargo is obtained from British ports in the following manner. Ihe London merchant is oftered through terms from London to Basrah by the agent of a line allied to the Hamburg American and ships of that line collect cargo in the port of London, transport it to Hamburg or Antwerp fer shipment in therHamburg American line steamers to Basrah. All that hapnens is that the line carrying the goods betwe n the port ot London and Hamburg or Antwerp takes the place in the system of the German state railway. *he London merchant will ba befit it is true by getting the lower rate of freight, but he is really assisting ae his own funeral in assisting the system contrived for the replace, ent of hie comodities by those of Carman origin. without any lose at all but at a profit, but also to take the traffic away $ut here again to a saiallar degree, the German through rates system is calied i t will thus be seen that the **ihrough rata system*’ worked in conjunction with rate agre ments ie the chief weapon of the German competitive policy, and it follows that in consequence, every effort ought to be concentrated in refusing to make rate agreements with German lines and in this way to prevent to a certain degreedegree full operation of thm '’Hirough rate syntw'' against ue. ihe German line set to work immediately to seize the sugar carrying trade i-r froii. the nntiah lines in whose hands previous to its intrusion into the Gulf, it had exclusively been and who were the holders of all the harseilies sugar freight contracts* Aha process of seizure worked rapidly and whilst in 190B the British carrying trade (represented by the imports of India, u. K. and rrance) totalled some 2925 tone as against the German (represented by the imports of Germany and ^letria) 195G tons, five years later in 1913, the British tonnage had only increased by some &amp;50 tons whilst the C -mans nad increased by A^O tons, A lready in five Co years the germane were carrying more of this class of sugar to the Gulf than were the British lines although five years previously, the British lines were carrying 1,000 tons more than the Garmanso Ajn the import of Loaf sugar, previously also a monopoly of the nritish lint the same story is told, and told even more convincingly. whereas in 190C British ships carried bb50 tons of sugar*as against 3150 carried by the Germans; in 1913**1&lt; they carried only Bfe50 tons as against 13,b00 carried by the German line. In other words the tonnage carried by British lines incfeesed by 2,000 tons, while the uerman in the same time increased by 10,450 tons* Two things must be remembered, firstly the rapidity with which the Germans captured the trade-^in a apace of five years — and secondly that tha slight recovery of the U .K, tonnage during the last two years was solely due to the repeated appeals of Resident in the Gulf th ough whose instance pressure was Drought to bear upon Masers Tata, to reenter this field, whether the firm in ouestio \p*SV~5 CW«^vCL- can be persuaded to pweerve in its at tempts in face of tha situation remains to bs seen* as to the serious offsets which the lose of the sugar trade must have upor British lines Mr. Chick (Commercial Adviser in Gulf) has pointed out that of a tot# 75512 packages carried to bushire by British lines in 191T# no lass than 4b900 were of Marseilles sugar* fBe sugar trade has benn selected as an example of the inroads made upon British sea-borne traffic to tha u ulf Porta themselves* ^hen, however, the enquirer wishes to examine tha conditions of foreign trade in Iraq and British Arabia, and its important Persian transit trade, ha ie handicapped by tha absolute lac* of anyany official information on tha uk# aubjoet. Turkic cuatom, atatiatica are too inaccutate to ba of any value and Britiah Conaular raporta in Ba.rah are ao acasty in thair information and ao ill drawn up that they have no practical value of any kind “omparatiwa atatietico aa between Britain and her competitors, which from a atate ■Pint of view are the most important form of information, are not given at all and Carman competition vhith has b-'en the one suoj act of interest and discuaeion among the local trading community gffjr the laat ten years has not a dosen lines devoted 0 K- to it throught the period. • can, therefore, only fall back upon a general description embodying the unanimous view of all the traders concerned. Such opinion would confirm the existence of an active and successful competition on the pnrt of Germany in Iraq. The Germans Became masters of general trade except lanchester traffic and special Indian imports. In all the various arti cles of import such ns glass, stationery, drugs, hosiery, hardware Ac. German imports rapidly *a*axx ousted British trade, in addition to the important sugar trade Whilst the latter only re resents an import value of some £450,000 as against a kmnehoster cotton trad# of some £1,200,000, it is pronacle that the sugar trade added to the General trade would show a total import trade not greatly inferior to the total British import tr-de exclusive of India. This is remark^ul* enough in view of the short time in which German traders have oeen in this field, but the rapidity with which they have attacked the exoort trade is far more remarkaols. in ths last Consular report available of I9i2| he shows the amounts of grain shipped to London andCHa»Purg respectively and their figures show that 80.000 tons of grain wars shipped oy the Germans to Hamburg and Antwerp against a 90.000 tons to England. This was in 1911, only 5 y««rs after the beginning of German operations and British merchants complain nitterly of the loss of this trede to ths Germans. They state that the Germans did the trade at a less and give the u usual reply about 'subsidies*; but there is more evidence to show (and the Commercial adviser in the Gulf agrees with ms on the point) that t^is was not generally the case and that the Germans were able to take th*' trade away fro i Eritigt ail firms and still make a profit. British firms work on a douole margin of profit, leaving a London margin and Local margin thereby handicapping themselves in quotation to a great degree. In import and export trade, then, in Mesopotamia as in the Gull, the4 v the Germans had seized a l^rge ahara of tr&lt;de hitherto exclusively British* This was not, however, the iii it of their activities, for quit® apart from the co maneament of the Baghdad Hailway they were attempting and were succeeding in capturing the river carrying trade that had be n a British monopoly up the Karun River and which wae the ^ between sea and land on the irn ortant caravan road knewn as th^ Lynch Read in to Persia* Briefly, the activities of the Germans in the past few years have had the result of ruining and jeopardising our position not only in the Persian Gulf, but in &lt;iesopot'uai« and the river waterways that Are the centres for British Central Perai Persian trade.. 6570 HI 1 j A4 ' jO 1 j Offic 6 f Basrah, 18th July 10 *t.

I am somewhat diffident in suggesting to Government the name of any particular individual for the post of Director of Trade Development, hut my conception of the requirements of the post leads me to suggest that the Ilon’ble Hr.H.de P.

I feel sure that the enthusiasm and expert knowledge that he would bring to Dear on the problems at issue, and his reputation as an 1 expert upon commercial and currency questions^would prove invaluable^and that all parties would be greatly the gainers by nis reputation. In any case it would appear to be indis- pencable that the appointment should only bo given to one | fullj, conversant with the complex systems of continental trade shipping and tariff questions, and in consequence a Consular official of the ordinary stamp would be of no use ior the work in view. ?.

Of particular concern for British officials is ensuring that British firms are placed in the best possible position to counter expected competition from Germany and Japan following the cessation of hostilities. Much of the file is taken up with proposals for a Mesopotamian Trade Commission, prompted by a report produced by Captain George Lloyd on the economic situation in the Gulf and Mesopotamian markets in 1916; multiple copies of Lloyd's report can be found between folios 216-285. This includes details behind the selection of the Commissioners (Robert Erskine Holland and John Wilson), the division of expenditure between the British and Indian Governments, and the remuneration for the Commissioners. It also outlines some of the process behind the British Government's decision not to publish the report immediately following its submission in 1917, and subsequent reviews of this decision.The volume does not contain a copy of the report produced by the Holland-Wilson Commission. However, a summary of its recommendations can be found on folios 104-06, and a note on the report prepared by the India Office (dated 6 February 1918) can be found on folios 100-03. Copies of the Commission’s original instructions may be found on folios 180 and 182. Proposals from Sir Percy Cox dated 1 March 1917 on measures to turn the Persian Gulf into a British ‘mare clausum’ [closed sea] can be found on folio 154, along with English and French copies of the ‘Recommendations of the Economic Conference of the Allies’ held at Paris 14-17 June 1916 on folios 155-58.Another matter discussed within is an application from Messrs Lynch and Lord Inchcape [James Lyle Mackay] to establish an office for their joint firm — Mackay, Lynch and Company — at Baghdad, and for permission to implement a pre-war concession from the Ottoman Government to run steamers on the Tigris and Euphrates. This includes the minutes of a meeting of the Middle East Committee of the War Cabinet (see folios 84-5) held on the 18 February 1918 on the undesirability of granting a monopoly on these rivers.Other matters covered by the file include proposals — dated 28 February 1918 — from the Bahrain Political Agent (see folios 53-4) towards the establishment of a strong commercial position for British trade at Bahrain, an agent deputed by Messrs Herbert Whitworth Limited to establish branches at Basra and Baghdad, and the construction of a through railway between Basra and Baghdad.The main correspondents are officials of the Board of Trade (Henry Fountain), the India Office (Arthur Hirtzel and John Evelyn Shuckburgh), the Foreign Office, and the Government of India; with significant input from Sir Percy Cox (serving as Chief Political Officer of the Indian Expeditionary Force), and the Under Secretary of State for India (John Dickson-Poynder).Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force, Chief Political Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Mesopotamia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Tigris River</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Euphrates River</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Development policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Economic competition</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000106#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
