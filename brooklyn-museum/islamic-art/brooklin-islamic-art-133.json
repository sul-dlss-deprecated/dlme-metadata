In this photograph, the first portrait in a series entitled <i>The Loss of Our Identity</i>, the artist presents the viewer with a portrait of an Iranian youth in a white T-shirt with headphones, both attributes of western culture. His eyes, however, are hidden beneath a superimposed &ldquo;curtain&rdquo; created from a reproduction of a battle scene illustrated in a Qajar period Persian lithographed book. The image seems to question the deterioration of traditional Iranian culture in the face of an increasingly superficial world driven by new media. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nTirafkan belongs to a group of contemporary Muslim artists whose work is increasingly sought by collectors and museums in the Middle East, Europe, and North America. The Brooklyn Museum is proud to present this work as the first contemporary addition to its Arts of the Islamic World collection.<br />", "summary": "", "rank": 0, "label_date": "2009-08-03", "date_added": "2009-08-03 15:05:04", "approved_for_web": 1}], "artists": [{"id": 16189, "prefix": "", "name": "Sadegh Tirafkan", "suffix": "", "nationality": "Iranian", "role": "Artist", "dates": "Iranian, 1965-2013", "start_year": 1965, "end_year": 2013, "date_added": "2017-08-04", "rank": 1}], "collections": [{"id": 20, "name": "Arts of the Islamic World", "folder": "arts_of_the_islamic_world", "rank": 0}], "exhibitions": [], "related_items": [], "geographical_locations": [], "videos": [], "images": [{"filename": "2008.51_PS6.jpg", "id": 109475, "standard_size_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size2/2008.51_PS6.jpg", "thumbnail_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size0_sq/2008.51_PS6.jpg", "derivatives": [{"size": "0", "width": 78, "height": 96}, {"size": "1", "width": 156, "height": 192}, {"size": "2", "width": 313, "height": 384}, {"size": "3", "width": 626, "height": 768}, {"size": "4", "width": 1252, "height": 1536}], "largest_derivative_url": "d1lfxha3ugu3d4.cloudfront.net/images/opencollection/objects/size4/2008.51_PS6.jpg", "largest_derivative": "4", "description": null, "caption": "Sadegh Tirafkan (Iranian, 1965-2013). <em>The Loss of Our Identity #1 (Boy)</em>, 2007.
