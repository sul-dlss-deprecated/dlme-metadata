Also included are the negotiations with the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the eventual resolution of the situation in 1942.Also mentioned in the file is the temporary problem in April and May 1941 of the newly established Iraqi Censorship Office in Basra opening all mail being sent through there and the need to ensure confidential mail was not opened by them.A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 194-204. These file notes relate only to the correspondence from folio 62 onwards, the correspondence on folios 2-16, and possibly also folios 17-61 appear to have been placed in the file at a later date after the file notes were compiled.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, Secretary to the External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sub-Postmaster, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003a1#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003a1#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0003a1#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
