H.M.Government have sent in reply to Your Majesty’s letter dated 17th November through the British Agent, Jeddah but have directed me to send Your Majesty a copy as it may reach Your Majesty quicker by this route. Reply. H.M.Government isas follows. H.M. Govt, have learnt of contents of YoM’s letter dated 17th November to British Agent at Jeddah with regret. They have^failed in undertaking which they have C all means in their repeatedly given to Your Majesty l£~ power prevent improper use of Kuwait Iraq territories by Y.M»s rebellious subjects. Efforts which latter have made to take refuge in Kuwait territory have indeed already been frustrated mo more than once and on 3rd September Y.MIs Govt, recognised since rity and efficiency with which British authorities in Kuwait have carried out their undertakings by formally thanking them for their efforts. As Y.M. is aware H.M's Govt, were approached as recently as 1st November by Shaikh FAISL ed DAWISH with request * for guarantee for his women and children. They are credibly informed overtures for peace which Faisal DAV/ISH is reported recently to have addressed to Y.M. were principally due to un- -compremising attitude which H.MIs Govt, have taken up in reply to these requests. H.M’s Govt, have moreover given material proof of vainest desire to co —oueratf* wi+Vivn •derate wila r.M. m suppression of : revbellion0 rebellion in n«rth east of NEJD by assisting Y.M. to •btain fr#n India arms wliich you urgently required and by arranging supply in near future tn s^ciaJjJfaveurable terms 4 aeroplanes of latest type witu the necessary British perseiincjl. Further supplies for use with these aeroplanes are already on the way out to Persian Gulf and should reach DaRIN early in December. H.M.Govt. feel certain these explanations will dispel misunderstandings of their ' attitude. Careful enquiries have convinced H.M.Govt. that Y.M. katx must have been misinfomed as to assistance which rebels have obtained from Kuwait Iraq. K.M.Govt. desire in this connection to place Y.M. on your guard against reports from untrusted and unreliable sources. Turning now to specific request contained in Y.M*s communication II.MoGovt.^ in audition to strict instructions already given to tiicir authottios in Kuwait Iraq of nature which Y.M. have taken following action. In their desire to meet Y.M’s wishes as far as possible and to show their roaainess 'to co-operate whole heartedly with Y.M. in re-establishing peace and order in your dominions $ 1 ) The have now issued renewed instruc- -tions which should ensure pledges given to Y.M. shall be fully implemented; ( ii ) Instructions have been given to secure removal of all Kuwait tribes and of refugees^ AWAZIM from vicinities of frontiers or from any scene of possible conflict. ( iii ) Instructions have been given concerning necessary military measures for ejection of any of contending forces Ttsul enter Kuwait or Iraq territories and to intercept possible isolated groups of rebels entering ouch territories for h the purpose of merging v/ith local tribes in manner in which Y.M. suggest. With regard to communication addressed by Y.M’s Actg. Minister for Por.

Apart from risk of which Y„ji. has already been informed by Br. Agent Jeddah that such night « O'- 4 ? forces conflicts with those of H.B.M a contingency which H.M(s Govt, and Y.M. would equally deplore «, In conclusion H.ll’s Govt. would again rebels. Ends.

After Compliments, We received Your Excellency T s letter dated Era Hajab 1348- 5th December 1929 No.1604 sent by you on behalf of the Ho’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. .Seeing that it was to the Hon f ble the Political ResiuenT necessary to expedite repl/ we despatched five cars to Kuwait on the 16th Rajab- 17th December to take the reply. We were then at -i Lisafah. The cars remained two days at Kuwait and then returned without reply from any British authority about the Military station? or any information as to the measures taken to eject tne enemies from the Kuwait and T Ira; frontiers. On the evening of the 2ord Rajab 1348 ( 24th December ) a detachment of our armoured cars attacked the enemy at the out - skirts of Ria f i and inflicted loss on him, and ascertained that the I enemy was still within Kuwait and ? Iraq territory at the junction oi Al- f Aujah at the Batin, and some of them (enemies) are at Mahzul. fie have just started to Hafr al-Batin but have so far received no reply from the British Government about the situation. We have therefore informed Your Excellency in order to communicate the same to His Excellency the High Commissioner for ’Iraq and the Hon f ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf about the present situation. There is only a distance of one and a half days journey between us and the enemy, but the enemy is still within ’Iraq and Kuwait territories. The British forces should either eject the enemy from the frontier or permit us to attack him. We will try our best to send this information to the neared'Military station* at the frontier. We intended to send this information to Kuwait but as the enemy is between us and Kuwait,it was not possible to send the information through this route, fie expect the reply of the British Government as earlj as possible in carrying out their pledges. It is very difficuilt to keep our forces confronting theenemy without taking measures against them owing to their taking shelter within f Ira and Kuwait territories. We are waiting for a reply to this as early as possible by any route the British authorites are able to communicate to us. Usual Endings. A.R.Teltgraiu.

I wish to point out, however, that the letter fro^ King Bin Saud was received by me from the Qus&amp;ibis in an open cover, and so had presumably become public propert 3 r already. It is well-known that all Foreign Governments are assumed to be able to road the Government Telegraph Code, and so oven had the message been coded, little protection to its contents would have been given.

I venture to draw your attention to Colonel Trevor v s lotter He. 465 S d~ted the bPnci June 19h2, in which he urged the then High Commissioner not to use this Agency as a post office for letters to the Ruler of Hejd, on account of the burden placed upon it thereby.
