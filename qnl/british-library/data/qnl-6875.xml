Fortnightly Report by Civil Commissioner, No. 17 (Ist-lSth July). [A brief note on administrative development is submitted this fortnight instead of the usual detailed report.] I.—A DM INI SIR ATI VE. 1. District Organisation. —The organisation of the Baghdad Vilayet has during the last six months made marked progress. The province now falls into 10 divisions, 1 Tr . 7 , . each under a political officer; the divisions are ppeiu ix att&lt;u km . composed of a varying number of districts under Assistant Political Officers. ' Two important modifications have been made in the administrative organisation. Under the Turks the revenue administration was completely independent of the executive authorities ; there was a separate revenue hierarchy extending from the mamur of the shu'ba (sub-division) through the mudir mal of the qadha, the muhasibaji of the sanjaq and the daftardar of the Vilayet to the Ministry of Finance at Constantinople. Again, though the 'Young Turks ' took over all the Crown Lands from Abdul Ilamid, they maintained a separate organisation to administer them. Political officers do not correspond exactly to the mutassarifs, qaimmaqams or mudirs whom they have succeeded ; they control the revenue work also through a mudir mal at the headquarters of division or a mamur at the headquarters of sub-division (shubas). The smallest unit is a sub-division, two or more of which—each in the charge of a mamur—constitute a district. The mamur of a sub-division deals not only wirli revenue work proper but also with the development of agriculture, and that on private as well as public land. The sub-division has been found to be a convenient administrative area, and the functions of the mamurs are gradually being extended to cover other than revenue and agricultural development work.' There is as yet inevitable difficulty in finding a sufficient number of competent natives to fill these posts. 2. Revenue Board—Customs, Excise, Waqf, Education, Agriculture exclusive of Grass and Dairy Farms, Agricultural Development Scheme and such preparations for a Land Records Department as it was possible to make, were all at first centred in the Revenue Board, and administered by the First Revenue Officer and iiis assistants, working as a single office. Some such concentration was necessary in the protoplasmic stage, as qualified Arab assistants were few, and each of these departments was largely dependent on the other. The secondary schools were used to turn out revenue surveyors as well as teachers, the revenue inspectors did double duty as assistants to agricultural oiUcors, land records officials have acted as temporary inanvurs, while a iurther saving of staff was effected by administering the Public Debt and Waqf through the Kevenue Agency. But this concentration was not intended to be other than a temporary expedient; and as staff has increased and development broadened, each department has tended to crystallize into a separate entity. Education now has two whole tune officers, and the separation of the office into a directorate will be practicable very soon. Land Records and Waqf are being similarly organised. Miscellaneous Revenues and Excise are still worked directly by the Board, but an expeuenced Excise Inspector has been added to the strength, and it will be possible to employ him in a capacity akin to that of a Deputy Collector. 3. The Arab population is playing a large part in this organisation. The Depart ments of Revenue Board will have each its British Director geneiallv a^^i^tec &gt;&gt; an Arab Personal Assistant, and a Committee. In cases where a formal Committee does 10 S 2 40 10,18not exist it is the practice to summon all the leaders of opinion and consult them. Thus the Officer Commanding, Education, is assisted by a mudir, and has also an influential c( mmittee which, after Ramadhan, will resume weekly sittings. It is proposed to organise Waqf similarly. The Director of Auqaf will, it is proposed, have a personal assistant, selected from the leading men of affairs, to assist him on executive work, while the Mudir Auqaf and Committee will continue to act us disbursing- agents of Auqaf funds, and advisers on Shara' law and local custom. The Director of Land Records will require similar assistance as soon as the registration of agricultural lands begins. On occasion when any large problem, such a« the fixing of prices, is under consideration, and it is possible to take the public into confidence, merchants and leading men are invited to meet the First Revenue Officer, popular opinion is voiced and the Government position explained. We are still handicapped by shortage of office staff, but a commercial class has been formed, shorthand, type writing, and filing being part of the curriculum. The Jewish community with their capacity for detail should furnish excellent accountants; and it is hoped by the end of the year to see each department firmly established under :'n Arab advised British officer and a trained office staff. 4. Irngatwn and Agricultural Dcparhncuts. —Closely parallel to this development within the Board has been the organisation of military departments. The Irrigation Department came into being early in the year. A Director of Agriculture arrived in the last fortnight of June. The Board of Agriculture has come into being whereby Heads of Departments also will be kept in immediate touch with the progress and plans of other Departments. • 5. Bloclcade and Customs. — The Civil Administration has taken over the blockade from the Director of Local Resources amalgamated with Customs, which were formerly run by the Revenue Board. It now forms a department under a Director with a single staff, which is better able to grapple with the conflicting interests of blockade and customs. The Director of Blockade is ex-officio Collector of Customs, Baghdad Vilayet, and as such works under the general supervision of the Chief Collector of Customs, Mesopotamia!! Expeditionary Force, at Basrah. The Custom Houses at Baghdad, Mandali, and Khaniqin have been reorganised, and receipts are increasing with a surprising rapidity, consequently chiefly on the opening to traffic of the Persian roads since 1st June. An export duty of 1 per cent, into Persia has recently been instituted. H.— J UDICIAL D KIMUT.MENT. G. W ith regard to the advance made in the administration of Justice, the Senior Judicial Officer gives the following particulars : — A (ourt of 1'irst Instance was opened in .Baghdad in January P.)18 under the presidency of Mr. 11. F. Forbes, l.C.S., with two native members, Daud Effendi Sam rah, who had formerly been a member of the Turkish Court of Appeal but who had i c^igncd that position and of recent years had had a leading practice as an advocate, and Abdul Jabbui LfFondi, who had been a member of the Court of Appeal at the time of the fall^ of Baghdad. Some 000 cases were instituted before the Court between !ts opening m January and the 30th June 1918, and over Rs. 85,000 were collected m fees. 1 he proceedings of the Court are wholly condacted in Arabic, am I oman n.\\ is app led. Advocates practising before the Court are required to o c a icense rom t le Senior Judicial Officer, and regulations have been issued ^meimn it exucibc o t le profession of advocate.- The number of the licensed advocates is l^b. has boen cl s ^ con .^ ^ ^mte 0 f t] ie Baghdad ' ivil Court of First Instance ^lSiZ ^^, a r l T- 11 t ^'pused of Mr. B.

Between 1st January and the 30th June 1918 Rs. 10,518 was taken in fees. I he Baghdad \ ilayet Peace Court Rules, which were issued on the 23rd March provide that the procedure of the Court and of other Peace Courts should be that piovided by the I urkish Peace Judges Law, subject to a few amendments. A Court of First Instance was opened at lla'qubah in May with Mr. E. B. Norton, I.C.S., as President and Saiyid Salih Effendi, late an assistant member of the Turkish Court of Appeal, and Mulla Husain Effendi, the present Qadhi of the Ba'qubah Mohammedan Law Court, as members. Mr. E. B. Norton and Saiyid Salih Effendi also hold appointments as Peace Judges for the District. The opening of a Court of First Instance has been approved for Hillah and will take place on the arrival of the British lawyer who has been selected as President of that Court. 8. In districts where no Court of First Instance has yet been established, Political Officers exercise limited powers for the hearing of civil suits. Their procedure has been now regulated by the Baghdad Vilayet Peace Court Pules, and, subject to the consent oi the Senior Judicial Ollicer, their decisions may be referred to the Court of Appeal for revision. It is hoped that wherever the work is sufficient to employ the time of a whole time judge, a native Judge of the Peace will be appointed, thus relieving Political Officers of a class of work, which is necessarily laborious and for which few of them have had previous training. A beginning has been made at Khaniqin, when laiq Eftendi Alusi, a graduate of the Baghdad Law School who had been wofkiug for several months in the Baghdad Court of First Instance, has been appointed Judge of the Peace. • 6 9. Pursuant to the policy that cases regarding Shi'ah Mohammedans and relating to questions of family law should he decided in accordance with Shiah Law, this class of cases has been withdrawn from the Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts, and are now instituted before the Civil Courts, who refer them or any points of Shi'ah Law arising out of them to a Shi'ah Jurist, selected by the parties ; or if the parties do not agree, to one nominated by the Courts. From the point of view of efficiency it is desirable where the amount of work justifies it, that a special jurist should be selected for this work, and should receive a regular salary, and in fact be a Government servant. After consultation with the principal Shi'ah residents, this plan has been adopted at Baghdad, and Shaikh Shukrallah, the Director of the Ja'fariyah School, has accepted the appointment. The appointment has been received with satisfaction by the Shi'ahs of Baghdad. If is a proof of the confidence with which Shaikh Shukrallah is regarded by his co-religionists that no petitions of any sort have been received against his decisions. A similar appointment has recently been made for Ba'qubah. 10. Under Turkish rule a Sunni Mohammedan Law Court was established in each Qadha. The Qadhis were, so far as their judgments were concerned, independent of local control, but their judgments were liable to revision by the Ulama in Constantinople. Since the occupation of this Vilayet, appeal to Constantinople has, of course, been impossible. It is obviously essential to provide a means for the correction of erroneous judgments delivered by Qadhis. After consultation with the principal Sunni authorities, it has been decided to form a Board of Uevision at Baghdad, consisting of three or more Ulama. This has now been approved, and the Board will commence sitting at an early date after Ramadhan. 11. To sum up, therefore, the results of the last six months' work has been : — (1) To re-establish an organisation for the administration of Civil Justice for the Baghdad Vilayet, based on the existing law of the land and permitting the fullest use being made of native personnel. s 2 A 2(2) To make provision for the hearing of cases relating to the family law of Shi'ahs in accordance with Shi'ah law, and to associate Shi'ahs with the Government by the starting of a Shiah branch of the Judicial Department. (3) To establish a local Court of Revision for the Sunni Mohammedan Law Courts of the Baghdad Vilayet. The progress would have been more rapid but for the difficulty of finding natives suitable for judicial appointment. The number who are both competent in knowledge and character is not large, and of these the majority are either interned or are unwilling to accept service at the present time. The limited number of suitable candidates available for judicial appointments will be a serious difficulty in the way of the extension of the judicial system during the war. III.—C ivil Police. 12. The police have been reorganised with effect from 1st April, the cadres in Basrah and Baghdad being separated. In Baghdad, Kadhimain, Muazzam and Karada, previously under the direct orders of the Commissioner of Police and independent of Baghdad, have been brought within the Baghdad Police area under the Deputy Commissioner of Police, and a reduction of two officers effected thereby. The size of the force has been substantially reduced, and the pay increased. The number of British ranks employed with the Police has been increased with excellent results, those selected having proved keen and capable. The force is now nearly up to strength fit was seldom above half its strength previous to these changes). A police training school has been started where the men are instructed in drill, gymnastics, &amp;c., their powers and duties as police officers, reading and writing in Arabic. A class for elementary first aid has been started. A class Lor Inspectors and Head Constables in police duties is being held ; examinations take place periodically. Law will be taught as soon as the code is introduced. A Local Criminal Intelligence Bureau has been formed, and, although yet in its infancy, has justified its existence. A Finger-print Bureau has also been formed— in course of time should prove useful. A system of registration and surveillance of habitual criminals has also been introduced. The 42 Egyptians working in the Police were found unsatisfactory, and have been returned to their units. Indians have been eliminated as much as possible from the 1'olice Force. Onty two now remain, one being a Parsee Inspector who is acting as Assistant Instructor in the Training School, the other being a finger-print expert. There arc, however, two Indian clerks in the office of the Commissioner of Police. It may now be said the whole Force consists of natives of the country controlled by British officers. IV.—Finance Branch. 13. The main functions of the Finance Branch are :— (а) Preparation of accounts showing the revenue and expenditure of the Civil • Administration from month to month. (б) 1 he preliminary scrutiny (audit) of all accounts before submission to the Controller of War Accounts for final audit. (c) Control of expenditure. I t. All officers in charge of civil funds are required to forward simple cash accounts e\ery month recording chronologically their receipts and expenditure. In laige stations, where there are several officers receiving and disbursing lovernment funds, all the accounts are kept by a Treasurv Officer who receives all Grovernment dues and makes all payments on behalf of the officers concerned. This relieves the officers concerned of the technical supervision of accounts, and also Co icentiates all available Government balances in convenient centres.Every item of revenue and expenditure in the cash account of the Assistant Political Olhcer or the Treasury account, is classified to a definite minor head under one of the following Major Heads of Account : — Receipts. Charges. • I. Revenue : I. Revenue. Land Revenue. If. Customs and Blockade. Koda. III. Judicial. Ottoman Debt Revenues. IV. Jails. Miscellaneous. V 7 . Postal. II. Customs and Blockade. VF. Political and General Adminis- III. Judicial. tration. IV. Jails. VII. Police and Shabana. V. Postal. VIII. Education. VI. Miscellaneous. IX. Pensions and subsistence allowances. X. Miscellaneous. These classified accounts are then combined into a consolidated account, showing by districts, &amp;c,, the monthly and progressive totals under the major heads of revenue and expenditure, and also the monthly and progressive totals of revenue and expenditure for the Vilayet. 15. The preliminary scrutiny (audit) of all cash accounts is carried out by the Deputy Financial Assistant under the general control oC the Financial Assistant. The final audit is performed by the Controller of War Accounts, Simla, who also compiles the final consolidated accounts for submission to His Majesty's Government in London. IG. Control of Expenditure. —Administrative control of the Civil Administration was delegated by His Majesty's Government to the Government of India in December 1914. For convenience, very large financial powers were delegated by the Government of India to the Civil Commissioner, and the occasions in which it is necessary to refer to the Government of India are now very few. Specific proposals for expenditure from Political Olficersand Heads ol Departments are examined by the Revenue and Financial Secretary, or by the Financial Assistant under the general supervision of the Revenue and Financial Secretary, and alter sanction by the ( ivil Commissioner are printed and published fortnightly in ^ ivil Depaitmental Ordeis, which constitute the authority of the Controller of War Accounts for passing the charges. 17. The following developments during the last six months are noteworthy ; (i) Separation of Sanctioning and Audit Functions of Finance Branch—J]p to December 1917 both the audit o! accounts and the examination of proposals for sanction were carried out by Financial Assistant. In the early stages of development of the administration ol the \ ilcwet this was'very convenient and worked well, although it was recognised that the combination of duties was unsatisfactory from the audit point of view and would soon become impracticable in view ol the incieasing volume of work. The services of an officer with accounts experience were obtained in Januarv 1918, and he was put in charge of the detailed examination of accounts under the general supervision only of the Financial Assistant. During the last six months the policy ot separating completely the audit and sanctioning functions ot the Finance Branch has been adhered to and developed. , (ii) Organisation of a Cadre o/Accownian^.-A 11 accountants in the Baghdad Vilavet have been placed on a separate cadre, distinct hom that of o-eneral clerks, for promotion, transfers, and leave. _ lo bioadui the experience of accountants, the policy of interchanging those of out- stations with those who have been in the audit section at headquarteis for some time has been adopted with good results. r ^ • • *\ p n /-• OiJiccr* —In view of the periodical variations in the rate of exchange ( ) the Fimmce I'.rauch and distributed to the olhcers concerned.G (iv) Revenue Accounts.—A large proportion of revenue is collected in kind, and then transferred to the Directorate of Local Uesources for the nse of the Arniv. Returns of such collections were submitted until recently to the Kevenue Board. The consolidation of revenue statistics and the preparation of claims against the Director of Local Resources have now been transferred to the Finance Branch, so that the financial position of the Vilayet will be known completely from month to month without delay. (v) Pensions Office —In view of the increasing number of former Turkish pensioners and dependants of prisoners of war, a special pensions oflicer was appointed in January to assess all claims and pay all allowances in Baghdad, and to co-ordinate and record systematically all allowances sanctioned at out-stations. The Pensions Oflicer also disburses the numerous remittances of prisoners of war to their relations in Baghdad, remittances of officers of the Turkish Army to their families, and the family allotments of Hejaz Volunteers. (vi) Local inspection of Accounts—One officer is now on special duty for touring out-stations, to overhaul locally the accounts of Political Officers helping them with any difficulties experienced, suggesting improve ments of procedure and training the accountant. Although still in the initial stage the experiment has been very successful, and by improving the quality of accounts submitted promises to reduce work considerably. A PPEXDIX.
