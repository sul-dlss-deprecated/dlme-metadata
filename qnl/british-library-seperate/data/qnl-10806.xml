Related matters of discussion include the following: the occupation by the Jawasim of villages in the Wadi Madha, which is defended by the Regent of Kalba as an act of protection rather than one of aggression; a reported settlement in late 1941 between the Regent of Kalba and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; the demolition of the tower at Diba, and the Regent of Kalba's claim for compensation; reports that, contrary to his agreement with the Sultan, the Regent of Kalba has rebuilt the tower.The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and representatives of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Minister for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Regent of Kalba</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Qawāsim (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Shiḥūḥ (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Diba</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e3#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e3#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e3#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
