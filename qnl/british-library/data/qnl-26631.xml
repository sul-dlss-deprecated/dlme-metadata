My dear Lloyd, I have now been able to consider more carefully the very interesting meoioranduni about oil which you sent me on the 13th December. There is no need for me to comment on it in detail, but it emphasises of course the strategic importance to the Empire of the Middle East and of ensuring that the activities of the oil companies accord with the policy of His Majesty’s Government. The memorandum only deals with mineral oil and does not cover the possibility of the manufacture of fuel oil and motor spirit from coal and vegetable products. The technique of getting oil from coal is now well established and I imagine that supplies from this source might be a considerable supplement to the world’s resources of mineral oil. As regards oil from vegetable products, I am told by Dr.Aeizmann that there have been very interesting developments recently. We should perhaps be wise not to leave these factors out of account in prognostications about the more distant future. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) LLOYD. Geoffrey W. Lloyd, Esq., M.P.FOREIGN OFFICE, S.tf.l. 2nd January, 1941. (E 3093/2107/65K SECRET CONFIDENTIAL ^ My dear Geoffrey, I have read with great interest the letter which you sent to Halifax on the 11th December regarding oil in the Middle East. In particular, we have considered whether there is anything more ohat we can do to combat the subversive activities of enemy agents in Iran and elsewhere. On this point, we have decided to send a telegram, of which I enclose a copy herein, to our Minister at Tehran, authorising him to take up with t^e Iranian authorities the desirability of their taking immediate action to force the eight recently arrived German officers (in civilian disguise) to leave the country. The Iranians probably did not like letting these people in, and it is of course doubtful whether they will pluck up courage to turn them out. The memorandum on 'The Future of Oil in its 'relation to the Middle East' certainly deserves serious consideration by all'of us who are concerned with the formation of our future policy in that part of the world. I note that it would be rash to rely on the continuity of large American oil supplies to Europe and elsewhere for any considerable number of years to come, and that this renders Middle Eastern oil even more important to us than it would otherwise be. I am sending copies of this letter to Amery and Lloyd. Tours ever, (Sd.) ANTHONY EDEN. Geoffrey Lloyd,Esq.,M.P., Petroleum Department.P. Z. 146/41 QUTVrARD TKLiiXjRt^i . E 3093/2107/65.

I am not clear what action has been taken as regards arrival in Iran of these eight German officers, but, if you have not already done so, it might be well to approach the Iranian Government on the subject. Iranian Government can be asked whether they are aware of the real reasons why these German officers have recently established themselves in Iran. It could be suggested to Iranian Government that it is not to be supposed, at this stage of the war, that these German officers are occupying themselves entirely with civil work. It is reasonably certain that the object of their visit to Iran is to advance the German Government's political or military aims. Their activities are presumably directed against British interests in the Middle East, and Iranian Government must talcs into account the probability that any action against British interests might also be action against Iranian interests. Iranian Government could be informed of report which nas reached us (see Moscow telegram No.963(of November 4)) that there are certain 'German officers dressed as civilians' who have been given the task of conducting in Iran all kinds of subversive activities, particularly against the oilfields. The Iranian Government will probably share the view that these German activities may well be directed against the Anglo-Iranian oilfields. In any case, they will doubtless consider it advisable, in order to prevent Iranian territory from being used for unneutral activities of any kind, to take immediate action to force these German agents to leave the country. 2. Any such communication should probably be verbal, at any rate until we can obtain more definite evidence, but it might be well to add a specific request that, as the safety of the oilfields may be affected, which are of such vital importance/iff 1 ■mi —— ™ importance to Iran’s prosperity, the matter na y brought to the notice of the Shah.

As regards the guarantee I have I trust and believe succeeded in convincing Ibn Saud that though we cannot commit anything to paper in more explicit terms than those used in Prime Minister's and Sir R. Bullard's letters (your telegram No. 69, 1939) he can have full confidence in us. I made use of the most helpful material contained in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Your Lordship's telegram No. 11.

My immediately preceding telegram. At first interview King showed bitter disappointment at offer of £100,000 credit for foodstuffs. He must, he said, reject it. His people and his enemies alike would say that this represented in His Majesty's Governments eyes his value as a friend. His Majesty's Government did not understand. They wanted him to be strong in his own country. For this he must either distribute money and food generously or undertake punitive expeditions. He needed for the duration of the war, when his better revenue would be further reduced by falling off in the pilgrimage, credit for at least £800,000. He did not want to use it now but he needed it to allay the fears of his people for the future. He ended his forcible though entirely good-natured harangue by smiling, saying that ^even if I do not get a penny I am still youx iriend • 2. I could only say I would report to His Majesty's Government /Government what he had said, and it was aecided to leave the question for further discussion on the next day. I asked Hafiz Wahba to come and see me before my next interview and learnt that the King was worried on two counts. One, the meagreness of his reward as an old friend and compared with uhat of our nqw friend Turkey, two, publicity. Everyone would know that His Majesty s Government was paying his bills in India and would know the low limit. If he had hesitated to use the arms credit it was because the [grp. undec.] of the loan to Turkey had been published and odious comparisons would have been drawn. 5. I told Hafiz Wahba that I saw little hope of His Majesty's Government beingalot j provide a credit of £800,000. £100,000 could be regarded as a loan between friends, but higher figure meant a full-dress commercial transaction with awkward questions of security etc., In one respect, however, I thought we could meet the King. His Majesty’s Government might perhaps agree (please see paragraph 4 of your telegram Nj&gt; 10) not to tie Ibn »^aud down as to the manner in which he used the money and thus avoid publicity consequent on Indian purchase arrangement. Hafiz Wahba agreed that this would help, especially if £85,000 could similarly be freed and the total figure raised by £15,000 to £200 5 000. 4.

Perhaps v/e could agree on a proposal more in keeping witii that of His Majesty's Government. I then suggested as a purely personal idea that I should ask you to open s. free credit for him for £200,000 this year and consider sympathetically his needs if any next year. 2. He launched forth into a lengthy talk about his long friendship and Turkey's new friendship - the old friendship was fobbed off with a pittance and the old enemy received £60,000,000o I said he must not draw this comparison,. What His Majesty’s Government ?[was] specially offering him was a loan to a friend in temporary difficulties, the loan to Turkey was a commercial transaction.

Ibn Saud has refused to accept Grobba or any other German. He has agreed to trust us and not to press for a written guarantee« n satisfactory solution to these two problems was regarded as being of highest hnportance and I am confident that you will agree that the granting of a loan of £200,000 entailing as it does a mere addition of £15,000 to the existing sums earmarked as credits, is a minimum return for these signal marks of Ibn Saud’s loyalty and confidence.

Meanwhile I shall be glad if you will, if you see no objection reply in following terms: 10. His Majesty’s Government have learnt with interest of Ibn Said’s attitude to Dr. Grobba’s visit, and applaud the resolution with which he has acted. Having taken his stand they think it necessary for his own dignity and from every point of view that he should stick to it. They are convinced that he need have no apprehensions about the consequences. It is almost unthinkable that Italy would break Middle Eastern Agreement and risk war with Great Britain for the sake of German representation in Saudi Arabia. His Majesty’s Government have always tried to advise Ibn 3aud in his own best interests. In this case advice was based on sincere belief that misunderstandings to which reception of a diplomatist of Dr. Grobba’s reputation would give rise, and intrigue which he might attempt, would be as embarrassing and dangerous for Ibn Saud as for His Majesty’s Government. If they had had slightest ground to suppose that refusal might have serious consequences they would certainly have warned him. If Ibn Saud feels that Italian retaliation is nevertheless possible they invite him to read again the assurances contained in messages referred to at beginning of paragraph 4 above. They think these two messages will show Ibn Saud that they regard his interests as their own.H F.Z.643/40 EXTRACT (E.385/252/25) GEITERAL DISTRIBUTION TO: SAUDI ARiiBIA Cypher telegram to Kr.

I am not sure how far this telegram supersedes your telegrams Nos. 15 and 16 (of the 18th January), but I propose to reply on assumption. (a) that if the Italo-German reaction to Ibn Saud’s refusal to receive a German representative is very strong, he may renew his request for a guarantee and (b) that in any event he needs and expects material assistance. It is on this basis that the following observations are made. 2. In refusing to receive not only Dr. Grobba but any German representative Ibn Saud has taken a very strong step and now that he has taken it on his own responsibility His Majesty^ Government think he should be encouraged to persist in it. They are satisfied that if he does so he will have nothing to fear. 3. As regards a guarantee, His Majesty's Government clearly cannot let Ibn Saud think they would fail to protect him from the consequences of a decision which he doubtless regards as in accordance with their wishes. At the same time they have no wish to tie their hands as to precise manner in which they would uphold Saudi interests in circumstances which cannot now be foreseen or, for the reasons indicated below, to give more precise assurances than are necessary.A tNbLOSURE iN FOWEION OFFICE This Document is the Propert^)OVfeRtfrtQiicE&amp;jFsI&gt;^fib( to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.; /: Decy^her.

He feels it would be best for him not to remain here and so give the inroressioh that he [grp.omitted] and was waiting to return to Riyadh, but to go elsewhere and await an indication that the King would like him back.

He told vae that he had had a long talk with Ibn Saud in Mecca and that he had been instructed to acknowledge receipt of my note and to put the King’s views and v/ishes before me. 2o The Italian Minister, the King had told him, had been almost threatening in his talk with • the* : Amir Feisal. Mussolini had given his word to Hitler that he would use his best endeavours to ensure the return of Grobba. If Ibn Saud refused he was making an enemy not only of Hitler, but of Mussolini. Ibn Saud said that he could only risk incurring the hostility of Italy when convinced that His Majesty’s Government would come to his aid if he were in danger, e.g, if the Italians tried to annex Asir. 3. He had had long talks with -Sir R.- : Bullard and ••Mr.-' de Gaury and had protested his friendship and his loyalty to the British cause but he was in some doubt as to whether His Majesty's Government has full confidence in him. He felt some tangible mark of their confidence could have/%have been given him. I replied that I had the privilege before leaving London of being received by Your Lordship, By Sir John Shuckburgh and by Mr. Butler and that I could assure him that, one and all, they expressed •-•admiration'- and gratitude for the attitude His Majesty had adopted in most difficult circumstances. If His Majesty wanted tangible proofs of His Majesty’s Government’s confidence, I would submit for their sympathetic consideration any suggestions he could make. 4. Hafiz -Wahba* stated that what the King regarded as vital was a guarantee of assistance in the case of aggression against his territory by another Power. This -he-** thought could conveniently take the shape merely of a note [?preliminary to arranging for the] formal instrument to be published abroad. Hafiz - : Wahba* was convinced that if the King could obtain such a promise of assistance he would refuse admittance to Grobba and risk Italian displeasure. 5. As regards immediate assistance Hafiz -Wahba- said that the King wanted arms and ammunition. I said that I had understood he had decided to wait till the end of the war. The King had, Hafiz ^Wahba* said, merely said so because he had gained the impression that that was what His Majesty’s Government would wish him to say, but he did want what he had asked for in Mr. Trott's telegram No. 104 of August 2nd 1939 and he '-hoped- they would be supplied, as on the occasion of Mr. Rendel’s visit, at a nominal price. 6. He also wanted a credit of £250,000 gold for the purchase of foodstuffs in -India-. The pilgrimage had fallen/3. fallen far below expectations and the country’s finances were very bad way. I said I would put this proposal forward but that I should like to be ghle to give some indication of how the loan was to be guaranteed or repaid. Hafiz .T/abba- replied that the important thing was for us to be authorised to state that the question was having Your Lordship's sympathetic consideration - that details could be discussed later. He added very earnestly 'this is a very difficult moment for Saudi Arabia and a most favourable moment for His Majesty's Government to show their generosity- 1 '. _ 7 * As regards the feasibility of giving guarantee against aggression, to the vital importance of which Hafiz *Wahba* constantly reverted, I can of course offer no opinion but I was entirely convinoed that the advantage of gaining Ibn Saud's wholehearted support far outweighed the possible loss of a proportion, or even the whole of the sum he asks and the inconvenience entailed in providing him with a comparatively insignificant quantity of arms and ammunition at a nominal price. 8. Hafiz ’,',ahba v said that the matter was very urgent as the Italians would return to the charge as soon as the pilgrimage was over on Monday. I promised to request a very urgent reply.

At is desiraole to distinguish loetv/een tuo quite uiiferent possibilities,—i^e^-a refusal 'by Ton Saud to receive: (a) Lr 0 C-rohha (h) Any Germe.n representative at all. 2. I was at lirst incj.ined to view that as Dr. Grobha is already unfavourably known to Ion Saud it would be better, on assumption that some German representative will have to be received sooner or later, for this representative to be Dr. Grobba rather than some other German who might be equally able and more dangerous because less suspect,. 3. I am however impressed b* r Sir B. Newton's observations (although it is possibly premature to attach much importance to Shekib Arslan's activities),. It is not so much a question of harm Dr* Grobba could really do c This might be very small. But the % reception of a diplomat with his record would give rise to much misunderstandingo It therefore seems desirable to take advantage ol fact that Ibn Saud has, as Sir 3. Newton says, virtually asked His Majesty's Government to make up his mind in order to adviseadvise him not to receive Dr. GroDba. 4. You should therefore thank Ibn Saud for his friendly action in consulting his majesty's Government. They uould naturally much prefer, so far as their o\ r m interests are concerned, that Dr. Grobba should not be admitted to Saudi •.rabia. Since Ibn Saud has asked for a frank expression of their views they have no hesitation in saying so. Furthermore, Dr. Grobba proved a most successful intriguer and propagandist while German minister in Bagdad and did not hesitate to work, not merely against British interests in that country, but also against the Iraqi Government in power. (This part of your message could be amplified on the basis of Sir B. Dewton s telegram, omitting however, the passage about Shekib Asian's activities). It is admittedly a much more serious diplomatic step to declare an already accredited hinister persona non grata in the absence of definite proof of misbehaviour (which may not in the circumstances be available) than to do so in respect of a new minister whose agreme nt is being sought. But notwithstanding this consideration and without prejudice to your judicious preliminary remarks to the Amir Feisal, His majesty's Government would advise Ibn Saud in all the circumstances, and in his own interests as much as their own, to reply that he has been unfavourably impressed by the stories reaching him of Dr. Grobba's activities in Bagdad and would prefer not to receive him. At the same time His Uajesty’s Government appreciate the difficulty of Ibn Saud's situation and would certainly not hold it against him if he found himself compelled to receive Dr. Grobba after all. 5. 'The question of receiving German representatives generally is rather difficult. It is convenient for His Ilajesty's Government that Ibn Saud should remain neutral in the present war. In fact any suggestion to the contrary is bound to be embarrassing for various reasons, including Italian suspicions and the difficulty5. difficulty unich always confronts His i.'ajesty's Govemnent in providing any tangible reward for Ibn Sard's loyalty. Apart therefore, from a general need to avoid asking Ibn Sard for favours, His majesty s Gcvemerit must endeavour to avoid ask ing him to act in any manner inconsistent with neutrality or with normal diplomatic relations between two States at peace with one another. A refusal on the part of Ibn Saud to receive any German representative would certainly be inconsistent with such re1ations„ 6. iioreover, His Majesty's Government are likely in such matters to conserve their influence and so gain most in the long run by trusting Ibn Saud, especially when he has given so clear an indication of toe line which he really wishes to follow, and by refraining from advising him in what might seen their own more immediate interests, if these interests are not entirely consistent with his. 7. I therefore consider (although reluctantly) that if this point arises (which it nay not necessarily do at once) you should say that His Majesty's Government recognise that a refusal by Ibn Saud to receive any German representative at all would be inconsistent with normal diplomatic relations; and that this being so they do not wish, in Ibn Baud's own interests, to ask him to take this action. You could add however that it is to be hoped that if any German representative is admitted to Saudi Arabian territory he will be most carefully watched, and in par- staff.^ 06 closel ' restricted in regard to the numbers of his[Thfs Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use..

As a journey by ordinary air route through Egypt and Sudan would require visa facilities which would presumably be unavoidably refused, possibility suggests itself that Dr. Grobba may be flown secretly across Sudan direct from Libya. I submit that the best thing from the point of view of checking enemy activities in the Middle East would be for Ibn Saud to refuse to receive [grp.omitted. ?Grobba] and I trust that His Majesty’s Government may find it possible to advise him unequivocably in'that sense. His arrival during pilgrimage season seems particularly inopportune in view of indications that Hejaz during pilgrimage will be used as centre for diffusion of anti-British propaganda throughout Moslem world. Time arrival seems in fact to be carefully calculated. Hafez l/vahHfz* on his way through here seemed to think that Ibn Saud could find ways to keep Grobba out.

The purpose of Dr. Grobh’s visit is certainly to make trouble for us throughout the Arab world and probably also to create difficulties between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. For such a mission he is of course exceptionally well-qualified. Information available to you concerning activities of Shakib Arslan suggests also that Germany may be maturing plans for extensive nationalist risings in Palestine and Syria coupled with tribal insurrection of the lower Euphrates In Iraq and that ambitions of Ibn Saud or his family are to be exploited if possible in order to add to our embarrassment. In any case the mere fact cf Doctor Grobb's arrival in Saudi Arabia would give rise to a host of disturbing rumours which would be used by German propaganda. I w6uld urge therefore that everything possible should be done to persuade Ibn Saud to find means of preventing a visit which would probably lead to Doctor Grobb’s permanent establishment in Saudi Arabia. Ibn Saud evidently expects His Majesty’s Government to make up his mind for him and I trust that there need be no hesitation in advising him that a visit from Dr, Grobb would always involve him in grave difficulties.

Amir Faisel asked me to call this morning and on Ibn Saud's instructions gave me the following Information. 2. The Italian Minister had informed His Highness that Signor Mussolini had been approached by Herr Hitler with request that Italian Government should ask Ibn Saud to allow Dr. Grobba to visit Jedda. 5. The Italian Minister had also on instructions raised the question of diplomatic representation. Ibn Saud was represented in London and [?now] in Paris, and Italy felt neglected. * 4. As regards Dr. Grobba, Viceroy had, he told me, replied that this was a matter which Ibn Saud must himself decide, and that he would consult him on his arrival in Mecca in about four days time. He had given this reply in order to gain time as King did not wish to take action before consulting His Majesty’s Government. King's view was that he did not want Dr. Grobba here: he feared that if he permitted him to come, the idea might gain currency that he was modifying his attitude which whilst one of neutrality was known to be benevolent to Allies. On the other hand, I would readily recognise that it would be invidious for Ibn Saud to refuse to allow visit of a duly/duly accredited representative of a Power with whom: he was at least theoretically on friendly relations. Ibn Saud suspected that as Dr. Grobba could have no conceivable matter to discuss, the request was a put up job on the part of Italy and Germany to embarrass him and place him in the eyes of the world in a false position. 5. As regards appointment of a Saudi-Arabian Minister to Italy Viceroy had replied to my colleague that this request of his government would receive due consideration. Viceroy stated for my information that King's view was that so long as His Majesty's Government saw no objection and while Italy was not involved in the war he saw no harm in appointment. If Italy joined Germany means could be found to remove representative. 6. I replied as regards Dr. Grobba that whilst he would appreciate that I could not give a final opinion without reference, I felt convinced that His Majesty's Government would wish not to embarrass His Majesty. They would, I felt sure, fully appreciate the delicate situation in which Signor Mussolini’s demarche had placed Ibn Saud. I could assure [grp. omit.] I trust, that the King's attitude since the war had been most fully appreciated and I did not think it possible that His Majesty's Government could interpret his permission to Dr. Grobba to visit Hejaz, if he felt obliged to give it, as a change of attitude towards us. Principal reason why His Majesty's Government might prefer not to see Dr. Grobba here would, I thought, be .that he was a born intriguer and might try to stir up trouble, but strong line which Ibn Saud had always adopted in matter of propaganda was well known and we could safely leave this aspect in Ibn Saud's care. 7. Viceroy begged for a very urgent indication of your views/views both as regards Dr. G-robba* s visit and ^s/udi Arabian representation-in Rome. I promised to telegraph urgently and request urgent reply. 8. If I may venture an opinion, after so short an experience here, it is that I be authorised to inform Ibn Baud that His Majesty’s Government fully appreciates this further proof of his desire for closest co-operation but do not feel justified, in his interests, in urging him to refuse request for Dr. Grobba's visit, nor do they see any objection in exist ing circumstances to appointment of representative at Rome. 9. Ibn Baud particularly asked that a definite expression of opinion be given and that he should not be told that His i • Majesty’s Government leaves the matter to his own good sense.

I have the honour to submit a brief report on the commercial side of the activities of the new German Minister to Saudi Arabia on whose stay in Jedda I reported in my for the German exporter, since its exports are insignificant and it has free currency obtained from the pilgrimage and from royalties on oil* The revenue ffom oil is at present small, jj but within a short time it may be coming in at the rate of nearly a million sterling a year* i5. Saudi Arabia also suits Germany as a market in that the King is very anxious to establish a standing army, and that Germany is able to supply arms and ammunition. Wa know from confidential sources that the Gorman Minister promised to do his best to ensure the sale of arms to Saudi Arabia at low prices and on easy terms of payment, and it may be assumed that his task will be facilitated by political considerations. So far, it seems, only Mauser rifles and ammunition have been in question, but as the oil revenues increase, orders for other munitions such as guns and armoured cars might well be placed in Germany. despatch No.29 (371/327/6) dated February 18th. 2.

In my despatch No. 206 E (2546/308/8) dated October 30th, 1938, I reported on a transaction by which Saudi lamb /skins The Right Honouraule the Viscount Halifax, K.G.,skins had bstm sold in Germany at a good pri se or* condition { w 1 20C that the sellers bought German goods to twice the amount which the skins realised* Aluhammad Ali Riza, who effected tiiis transaction, stated at the time that this arrangement suited Saudi Arabia at the moment but might not always be convenient* 5* In his iinal visit to me ^ust before his departure Dr. Grobba talked a good deal about trade prospects* He admitted that the creation of a regular army would give Germany an opportunity to tender for the supply of arras. He saw only restricted opportunities for the use of the barter system with Saudi Arabia, but hoped that Germany might take a larger share of Saudi exports of skins. He said that the ;audi authorities had also suggested as suitable articles for barter, millet from Jizan and dates from Hasa; but as Germany only wants millet for fodcier and dates for the extraction of spirit the prices she ip likely to be able to offer cannot be tempting unless politics i6 to take precedence of economics. I have no special knowledge of the Hasa date trade, but I believe that the Haea dates, which ripen earlier than the dates in Basra, command a fair price as food in India and Persian Gulf ports. But I am inclined to believe that the Saudi suggestions about millet and dates were not very serious, and that such German goods as are sold here will usually be sold for c,.sh.

Macdonald asked the Prime Minister whether his attention has been called to the fact that a German ambassador has been appointed to Saudi Arabia; and whether any consideration has been given to the desirability of rais ing the British diplomatic representa tive in that territory to a similar rank? Mr. Butler: No, Sir. I understand that the German Minister in Bagdad has also been accredited as German Minister to Saudi Arabia. The second part of the question does not, therefore, arise.

Sheikh Fuad replied that he had no authority to do so. During the course of conversation I gathered, however, that the chief clauses covered the establishment of formal relations, the reciprocal appointment in due course of diplomatic and consular representatives, the protection of nationals in accordance with the principles of international law and commerce on the basis of the treatment of the most favoured nation. 3.

You added that the German Government would be glad to receive, in connexion with this demarche by the Government of the Yemen, information as to the relations now existing between that Government and His Majesty’s Government. 2. In reply, I have the honour to inform you that for some years past, the Imam o* the Yemen has been in occupation of certain areas of the Aden Protectorate. E rly in the present year he was responsible for further acts of aggression in Protectorate territory, and His Majesty’s Government consequently took forcible action to expel the Imam’s troops from these areas. In September Irst, the Imam indicated his willingness to re-open negotiations with His Majesty’s Government, and His Majesty’s Government, for their part, are prepared to conclude a treaty with him, recognising the independence of the Yemen and defining the boundary between the Imam’s territories and the Aden Protectorate.

(E 5622/5622/91) 30th Novemher, 1928 Sir, The German Ambassador called at the Foreign Office on November 23rd and informed Sir R. Lindsay that his Government had recently received a communication from the Foreign Secretary of the Government of the Hejaz, a communication which had also been addressed to the German Minister in Cairo, expressing the desire that the German Government would formally recognise the Hejaz Government and would open negotiations with a view to improving commercial relations. The German Government had replied accepting these overtures and wished His Majesty's Government to be informed immediately of their action. 2. The German Government had since then received a communication from a certain Raghit* an official of the Government of the Imam of the Yemen, also asking for recognition and formal relations. To this the German Government had hitherto sent no answer; they understood that relations existed between the Yemen and Italy, and that they were likely to be contracted in the near future with Turkey, but they were not quite certain what the position of affairs was between the Yemen and His Majesty’s Government, and, while anxious not unduly to delay any answer, thought it would be desirable to have some information on this point before doing so. 3.

Lindsay, relative to the Hejaz and the Yemen. 2. In reply to Monsieur Sthamer’s enquiry regarding the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Imam, Sir Austen Chamberlain proposes to reply that the Imam has for some years past been in occupation of certain areas of the Aden Protectorate; that early in 1928 he was responsible for further acts of aggression in Protectorate territory, and that His Majesty’s Government consequently took forcible action to expel the Imam's troops from these areas. The Ambassador might also be informed that the Imam indicated in September last his willingness to re-open negotiations, and that His Majesty’s Government for their part are prepared to conclude a treaty with him, recognising the independence of the Yeman and defining the boundary between the Imam’s territories and the Aden Protectorate. It is, however, not yet possible to form any definite opinion as to whether these negotiations will result in a satisfactory settlement. 3. It aopears to Sir Austen Chamberlain to be undesirable to express any opinion on the proposed establishment of relations between Germany and the Yemen, and I am to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Amery concurs in the proposal to address a note to the German Ambassador on the above lines. 4.
