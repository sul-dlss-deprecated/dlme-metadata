So. 102(4/10/37}. Brit left Legation, TBHKAiT. 17tn SoTember, 1937. Bir # fith reference to my deepatcn No.2Q of tne 5th April, I transmit to you herewith a copy of a despatch from the foreign Office regarding the attitude to be adopted by Hie Majesty’s Government in the event of the arrest of a British subject at the outer anchorage at Buehire. 2. Subject to any observations which you may wish to offer, particularly with regard to the proposed definition of the outer anchorage, 1 would propose to reply that 1 agree that the beat course, in the particular circumstances existing at Sushire, is that suggested in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office despatch, and that I also agree that no communication need be made to the Iranian Government until a concrete case arises. It is undesirable to enter upon a barren controversy with the Iranian Government over this question, and I consider that this will be best achieved by adopting the course proposed in paragraphs 3 to 5 of the Foreign Office despatch. I would suggest that it should be understood that if &amp; case arises involving Iranian juris diction over a British subject on a snip at the outer anchorage. His Majesty's Legation ehould at once be informed by telegraph, so that the necessary communication can be made to the Iranian Government without delay. It does not seem necessary that a similar communication should be made simultaneously to the Governor of Bushire. 3. Before replying to the Foreign Office on these lines, I should be glad to learn whether you wish to offer any further observations in the light of the despatch of which a copy is enclosed. / 0.Jf.Caro© Ssquire, C.I.3., The Acting Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affaire No.429 and to the Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department No.212. 1 am, Sir* four obedient servant. ad. rt.J.Seymour.Fn Copy. . F0HSI03? OF?IC12,3. , ?.l. ao.389 (is 5852/5653/34), 18th October, 1937. Sir, I have had under consideration your despatch ho.l28 (4/5/37) of the 5th April regarding tne arrest by the Persian authorities of a member of the ore* of tne Oertaan 3.3*Ueierfels after being involved in an affray with Persian coolies on board tiiat vessel while it was lying at tne outer ancnor&amp;ge at 3uahire, and in which you requested instructions regarding the attitude which His Majesty's Government proposed to adopt in the event of a 3ritish subject being arrested by the Persian authorities in corresponding circumstances. 2. After carefully weighing the various considerations put forward in your despatch under reference, I am of the opinion that for practical reasons it is desirable tn&amp;t Persian juris diction should be recognised over the outer anchorage of the -eraiari port jf uahire# Owing to the shallowness oi the harbour, this is a place where sea-going vessels perform the operations which they would normally perform inside a port, and in so far as foreign vessels g 0 there for the purpose of establishing contact with the shore, and to that end admit Persian offioiala on board, taey muet be assumed to accent some measure of i-ereian Jurisdiction. At tae same time, it seems dee i iv. ale to find a way of meeting tne practical needs of tills situation wnicn does not prejudice tne position wnicn nie Bfcjeety's lovernment nave taXen up wltn regard to tne limits of ter itorial waters and, in particular, does not imply any recognition by His Majesty's OoTernment of tne Persian claim to a s ix-raile limit (or in exceptional circumstances twelve miles) or a contiguous aone. 3./3. In circ JTOBtancea, I oonaidar tnat tn# difficulty could beat bo mot, if TUo 'Majesty’s OOTsmiaont woro to take the lino tnfrt, in via* of tne esocial ciroumatancoo obtaining at Buanire, tney Intend, ao far oe tney are concerned, to regard tne outer anchorage aa being under ^ereiac juried lot ion in tne same manner as if tno anchorage were part of tne Persian port of Buanire, and tnat snipe going there will accordingly be deemed to be in t he same position ae If they were in Persian national waters. This metnod appears prefer* able to one involving any attempt to negotiate a special agreement with tne Persian Government in regard to tne outer anchoifrage at Busnire, more especially as tnat Government clearly could not be expected to accept a proposal for aucn an agreeraent, tne conclusion of wnicn would be completely inconsistent witn tne attitude wnloft tney nave always main tained regarding tne limits of Persian territorial waters. 4. If this policy is to serve its purpose, it ougnt to be con&amp;nunicated officially to tne Persian Government. Tne coafcaunlotttion would be a statement of tne view wnicn Mis lajeety'a Government nad decided unilaterally to adopt witn regard to this matter, and would contain a definition of waat they conceived to be tne geographical limite of tne anchorage. I am advised tnat a simple definition wnicn would be adequate for this purpose would be ’an area within one mile of tne chartered position of tne Outer Ancnorafje light buoy'*, i anali ae giftd if you will consider tnle suggestion, if necessary in consultation witn tne acting Political Meaident in tne Persian Gulf, and furnisn me witn your opinion on it in due course. A furtner point requiring consideration is tnat of tne t ime /- 3 - time at wnicn the proposed communication wnlch is to be addressed to tne Persian uovernmsnt cnouid be niade in order best to serve the purpose in view. In general, 1 consider tnat little would be gained by raaking tnio communication before tne particular oircumetfinces wnion would render it necessary nave arisen, and it aignt be beat to wait until a concrete case of tne kind contemplated In tne last sentence of paragraph 2 of your despatca under reference nas occurred, ^evertfteleas, I am prepared to leave it entirely to your discretion to decide on the time and manner of making such a communication, and you are authorised to take such action at any time when, la the light of local conaiderations, it may appear desirable. 1 am, with great truth and regard, Sir, Your obedient servant, (for the secretary of Jit ate) ed.
