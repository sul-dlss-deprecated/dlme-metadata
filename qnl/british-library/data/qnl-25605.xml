In the particular case in point, I understand the Finance Committee’s £?:ound for altering the Political Department’s draft to have been this: there is not any current account between India and Egypt through which payments to, and recoveries from, Egypt are adjusted at a certain ratio of Indian to Egyptian currency: transactions between the two countries are ordinarily settled between this Office and the Nation Bank of Egypt, but in this case payment to the Foreign Office is proposed by the latter and will meet the case.

To The Dight Honourable AUSTEN CHAMBERLAIN, Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 2nd June 1916. Sir, We have the honour to refer to your Political Despatch No. 10, dated the 3rd March 1916, relative to the claim preferred by Assistant Surgeon Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahman, lately Acting Consul at Jeddah, m connection ■with his travelling expenses from Jeddah to Delhi on the termination of his appointment owing to the war with Turkey. ^ 2. The position as regards the Assistant Surgeon is as follows. Doctor Abdur Rahman has already received from the Foreign Office the full amount of his original claim, viz., £257*3-10. In the statement forwarded with pur Eoreign Secretary’s letter dated 24th December 1915, the amount admissible to Doctor Abdur Rahman under the Consular Reguiations was shown as £217-12-1 leaving a balance to be recovered from him of £39-11-9, less the cost of transporting the Consular Archives from Jeddah to Bombay. The above calculation, however, requires amendment m the following particulars . (al The statement referred to includes £34-10-5 on account of luggage ^ allowance from Jeddah to Delhi. Doctor Abdur Rahman has only claimed £2y-o-o * Vide enclosure. -under this head. On recon sideration we have decided to restrict him to the amount actually claimed, which reduces the sum admissible to him by £5-b-Il. (b) As pointed out by the Accountant-General, India Office, m his note ^ appended to your Despatch under reply, there is an error of 10s. in the fourth item of the same statement. The ^ount admis sible to Doctor Abdur Rahman must consequently be further reduced by this sum. The second error of 2s. Qd. indicated by the Accountant-General requires no adjustment, as it is covered by the reduction of £5-6-11 under luggage charges. 3 Asa result of the above adjustments, the travelling expenses admis sible to Doctor Abdur Rahman under the Consular Regulations are reduced from £217-12-1 to £211-15-2. Nothing is due to him on account of the transpof the Consular Archives from Jeddah to Bombay, since the expenditure incurred is included in the luggage charges which he has claimed and which he will now be allowed. Doctor Abdur • £257-3-10 less £211-15-2. Rahman has thus to refund £ 45 - 8 - 8 * on account of his travelling expenses, which sum, when set off against the amount (£150-10-3) due to him from the Foreign Office in connection with the accounts of the Jeddah Consulate for the quarter ending 31st December 1914, leaves a balance in his favour of £105-1-7.
