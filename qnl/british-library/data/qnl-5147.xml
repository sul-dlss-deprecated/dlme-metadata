We should be very grateful if you would ask the Government of India to confirm that there is no truth in this report. I should mention that a similar report appeared in the Moscow press last June (see Moscow telegram ** -No*2107 of the 16th June of which a copy was sent to Cleary). On that occasion it transpired that there was some faint substance in the story, as an R.A.P. officer had made an unauthorised flight into Persia to pick up a Persian friend, whom he flew back to Persian territory a few days latdr. The whole story is contained in the enclosure to Tehran despatch No.206 of the 21st June, of which a copy was also sent to Cleary on the 10th July.1071 ]. cD En Clair CABINET DISTRIBUTION FROM MOSCOV TO FOREIGN OFFICE Mr. Roberts D*. 4,37 p # m # 20th September, 1946, No, 5106 20th September, 1946# R. 7.18 p,m. 20th September, 1946.

His Majesty's Embassy present their compliments to the Imperial Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have the honour- to invite a reference to the first paragraph of the Ministry's letter Ho.739 dated 9/2/25 (29th April 1946) on the subject of the unauthorised landing of a British aircraft from Jiwani on Iranian territory at Dalakan. As stated in paragraph 3 of this Embassy's letter No.279 of 11th May 1946, the matter has.been the subject of correspondence with the Government of India, who now state that, to their regret, there is some substance in the report received by the Imperial Iranian Government of the above incident. A Royal ^ir Force officer from Jiwani is believed to have flown to Dahtiari and returned with Persian friend Mir Yusuf Ahan Saddozai whom he flew back to Persian territory a few days later. Flight and visit were entirely unauthorised and appear to have been the outcome of personal friendship between R.A.F. officers at Jiwani and Mir Abdi Khan Saddozai and his relations. No Political Officer or other civil official was involved. The Government of. India in*v§ information regarding the alleged gift of arms, ammunition and cash to Yusuf Saddozai.

Baluchistan reports that early in March R.A.F. officer from Jiwani is believed to have flown to Dashtiari and returned with Persian friend Mir Yusuf Khan Saddazai whom he flew back to Persian territory few days later. Flight and visit were of course entirely unauthorised and appear to have been outcome of purely personal friendship between R.A.F* officers at Jiwani and Mir Abdi Khan Saddazai and his relations. No (repeat no) Political officer or other Civil official was involved. 3, There is no information about arms, annunition and cash etc alleged to have been given to Yusuf but on this and other points Government of India are making further enquiries and result will bo communicated. 4, Meanwhile Government of India would be grateful if you would convey suitable expression of regret to Persian Government with assurance that appropriate action will be taken against offenders and to prevent similar incidents in future, (5, No reply should be returned to the Persian Consul at For ( Baluchistan(Quetta, only.
