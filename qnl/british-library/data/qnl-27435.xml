For simplicity in filing at thifc end and possibly yours they will be divided up into two separate letters. 2. I eventually left far Bahrain in the «S8ang«, a steamer vhich was crowded out as all Gulf steamers are L v r at the P r «8ent day, and 1 viewed the disposal of our forty confidential boxes with alarm. Shortly after reaching Bahrain 1 found that the up transport vhich the Senior Naval Officer had kindly diverted for me and which was ex pected on the 13th was coming in instead on the 10th thereby leaving me with only two whole days. I held the steamer for a day, but even s o my plans were completely ^ upset and 1 had to crowd everything into 3 days, refusing to see any of the merchants, and the Political iigent was obliged to cancel an *At Home* vhich he was giving so that 1 might meet some of the people there. 3. I naturally concentrated su&lt;h little time as I had . AJ'v on t* 16 Shaikhs. I found them in good health and (iulte If k. (■'' fiVl e A 'pf 11 *1 « Vlllf.

His meanness has caused a good deal of unfavour- j able comment, but it is such a welcome change from his predecessor’s spendthrift habits that I have not yet brought myself to do anything fcbout it. I saw little of the other members of the Ruling Family and had to avoid the shaikh’s invitation to dinner, as there was no time to fit it in. 4. I had intended to mention a rather interesting incident vhich occurred on the last day of my )ecember visit to Bahrain. ihe office was packed as the steamer was due, but it was delayed by a storm and so I had the I decided to spend it by going and seeing father-in-law the red-bearded Shaikh Rashid, who 1 had heard was failing and no longer up to his duties as Senior Judge of the Bahrain Gourt, blindness and absent- mindedness being among his handicaps. (He has since been given *leave*). ,;hen 1 went round to his house the old man, vho was sitting in the reed hut outside, came up to me and spoke for some time under the impression that I was v 'i, . Hickinbothaffl J tdxen he discovered who I was, he said that he thought my voice had altered and took me upstairs into his private apartments. presently I was surprised to hear his daughter announced and in came the Lady &lt;Ayesha, Shaikh Hamad’s principal wife. ihls enterprising lady made an attempt / Sir Olaf Oaroe, KCIE., CSI., I .C.S., Secretary to the Government of India in the External .iffairs Department, New Delhi.2. attempt to meet me many years ago when I was Political Agent, but I had avoided it as, apart from the fact that X wae a bachelor and that it would have given rise to comment, 1 felt sure ehe would take advantage of it to pueh her family’s interests. Che hae recently been on bad terms with Salman vtoo had granted her unduly meagre allowances, and thou^ri I had been urged to interfere X had refused to do so* beyond mentioning to the Shaikh on my earlier visit that I ho^ed all bis father’s family had been carefully provided for, vhich he assured me had been done. This visit to Shaikh Hash id was intended to reach • hie ears. 5. presently shaikh Rashid’s conversation on past Political agents and Residents began to fail, and his daughter took up the ball. ahe is a good looking and intelligent woman, somewhat Turkish in appearance and surprisingly weH-informed. Che said that she was sorry we had not met before though she had often seen me (I did not meution that one of the little hiscoes had given me a snap of her which I still have) and said that she had listened over her wireless to my speech at the Shaikh’s investiture and said that she had been much gratified by the remarks X had made about her late husband. ^he told me that when bhaikh Salman succeeded, she had been very worried about her interests and asked him to make suitable provision for her, but that matters '•had not been very a happy*, though now things were better and she did not wish to say more. Che then began to talk about her visit to England, and clearly showed that it was all still very vivid in her mind. She was rather {musing about Daly and mentioned how much the Ctate ov«ed to him. ~&gt;he sail veiy acutely that Daly was like an unpleasant medicine, one did not like taking it, but it did one good afterwards. Altogether 1 was about two hours in the house, and unfor tunately I seldom get time for such contacts now. 6. The Shaikh’s call with his uncles &lt;*ily produced the usual platitudes so I arranged to go out and see him at Rafaa by myself. as is usually the case he was ^uite different alone, and put off the regal touch, not that he affects it very much, and spoke very simply and sincerely. He said that he greatly appreciated my support and the things X had said about him in the speech at his Investiture and that it was very helpful to him because it showed that he and 1 were like one bone and that no one could separate us. He told me that \nhat he liked about me was my affection for hie father and said that he liked any tiling associated with him. He mentioned that recently they had oome to him and suggested that he should put some old horses in the races that were being organized, but he had replied *Bo, they belonged to my father*. V.hile I felt that the analogy was perhaps not very happy the sentiments seemed clear! The Shaikh is clearly alarmed at the .American penetration and said that he did not want to have anybody except the British /- (D 3. i-U' ; v 4 Britieh ocjraing into hie State* I had obeerved in my epeech we had been friends for over 130 years and he alluded to this and said that friends of such long standing were quite different to anybody else* I took advantage of the Shaikh's affability to settle an important matter which I will disclose separately* He was quite plainly delighted to have Hickinbotham back again, and said so on more than one occasion* /&gt;yefiha, for reasons unknown, calls him Major «Tombottom*. 7* I think the Shaikh has been very pained by the behaviour of the jnerican construction gang, who are not of a very happy type* X imagine the uomp^ny must be having great difficulty in getting anybody at all now. 1 saw Lloyd Hamilton the Director of Bahrain petroleum Company, but did not get cmything out of him that he did not wish to tell me* He mentioned that they were most anxious to see that the new Personnel did not cause any trouble. I understand he has now extended his stay indefintely, possibly in connection with the pipe line project or perhaps owing to the minor pipe line connection with Dhahran. I also went out and dined one night with /&amp;rd nderson, the Manager of the Refinery. He is a very pleasant and four-square sort of person with tfiom we have always been on the best of terms. I am not entirely satisfied regarding conditions of Bahrain labour yet, and the Political iigent considers that the men should be given a further concession about transport out to their work every day. At the present moment they have to pay 6 annas a day vihich is exorbitant for men on daily wages, but nothing can be done till the Company ggi *ome vehicles from Paiforce and the Bahrain Government get their lorries from India. 8. Hiokinbotham has struck a number of snags in his proposals to link up ^tar and Bahrain again, but he is pursuing the matter actively and is still hopeful of arriving at an agreed conclusion. It will be a great thing if this can be done as the supply of v atar from Dubai is giving rise to all kinds of abuses. I have not been able to see the bhaikh of ^atar since Alban's day, but am content to leave him to Hickinbotham for the present. 9. Two distinguished Indian frinoes flew through at about this time. Hadow went to meet Kashmir, who winced visibly on learning that he belonged to the Indian political Service, and Hickinbotham saw Bhopal, v^io appeared to have an equally low opinion of themi L must say I have always found the Gulf Rulers and their genuine Iriendship (and often surprising gratitude) a pleasant change f.rom what they term the «Maharajat*.

(g) Sir, 1 have the honour to forward herewith a copy of a note on a tour i have recently completed on the Trucial Coast. 2. The Trucial Coast has not as yet felt the pinch of the war. The Shaikhs, thanks to Petroleum Concessions Limited, the British Overseas Airways Corporation, etc. are drawing what are for them fat incomes, business is flourishing and the people are making an easy living out of their legitimate pursuits combined with a certain amount of smuggling into Persia. They have now however heard that supplies from India are to be curtaiL. ed and this combined with Royal &amp;ir Force activities is caus ing them much anxiety, 'fthen will there be peace ? , ‘ asked the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah and this indicates the attitude of the public at large. Onthe whole tuey are very friendly to us and would like us to win, but whatever hapxens they want the war to end before it engulfs them. So far as local politics are concerned the atmosphere is extraorainarily peaceful. There are a few intriguers about but generally speaking the Shaikhs are all firmly established and exercise undisputed authority. Their anxieties are of an economic nature and nearly every one of them had two requests to make, viz. (a) tn&amp;t an adequate food supply should be ensured for his Shaihhcom and (b) that he should be provided with spare parts etc. ior his car. 3. A large scale immigration is at present in progress from Persia to the Trucial Coast, and i am told that some times more / thanthan a thousand immigrants arrive at Dubai in a day* hey come i partly because of the vastly superior living conditions on the Trucial Coast vhere most of the necessities of lii e are still readily available and partly to meet the deiiiand for labour on the aerodromes and buildings at Dubai and Sharjah* * 4* 1 am sending a copy of this letter ano its enclosure to the Secretary of State for India and. vyolonei trior.

The u.ost uitice which the Posts and Telegraphs lepartment of the Government of India thought would nut pay was only opened on April 1st arid by the Ibth had already more than covered the whole of its eyperses ior the month. Dubai’s prosperity is cue partly to the silting up of tne bharjah creek anc partly to the exactions of the Persian Custoa.s authori ties at Lingch, Bandar Abbas and other places.

This reception had been arranged before receipt of your telegram No.68 Circular dated 18th December 1941 and was of an informal nature. Every Persian eho was in vited attended, including 14 officials and 7 local mer chants. Host of them brought their wives and grown up sons and daughters, and two or three brought smaller children. The local European community and two American * ■ officers who happened to be passing through Bushire were also present. 2 . The time fixed for the reception was from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. but many stayed till 8.30 p.m. Some of the iV. guests plsyed billiards or cards and the backgammon board was very popular. A substantial buffet was provided in a separate room, and when the doors were thrown open the table was immediately besieged by the Persian ladies who ate as if they had not had a square meal for weeks. The men finished up practically everything they left. 3 # The party was a bit •sticky 1 to begin with but brightened up as soon as the food appeared, after which everybody was most cheerful.

( 74/6/40 ), BRITISH L TEHRAN. 22nd February, 1940* Secret, My dear Baggallay I enclose a copy of a demi-official letter which the political Resident in the Persian Gulf has sent to the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, on the subject of his recent visit to Bushire. The more friendly atmosphere of which Prior was conscious covers more or less the whole of Persia at the present moment, and is quite noticeable in Tehran. But I think it would be dangerous to accept as correct the deduction in the eighth paragraph of Prior 1 s letter. This paragraph reads: It is interesting to look back over the years and see how little they have affected our position. The Residency still unquestionably has very great influence, and we have less to complain of at present than our colleagues elsewhere in Persia. The Shah is being more amiable at present, and causing his officials to be more amiable, because the opposition between Germany and Russia which gave him a feeling of security has gone and he hopes that in the last resort Great Britain and France will help him. Also he is looking to Great Britain and to India to take the place of Germany in his economic system. And, finally, His Majesty's Government have granted him a credit of five millions. But it would, I think, be rash to suppose that this good humour will necessarily outlast/ H.L. BAGGALLAY, ESQ,outlast the present war, though how things will turn out then depends naturally on the result of the struggle. In view of the long line of disputes and incidents which have marked Anglo-Iranian relations at Bushire and elsewhere during the last ten years or more we should be ill-advised to believe that the years have affected our position very little. We cannot, any more than any other foreign power with interests in Iran, escape the effect of the rising tide of nationalism, and if the tide is rising more slowly for the moment, that is because of the temporary effect of the war. It is possible that if the war should result in the permanent weakening of Russia and the defeat of Germany our situation here would be permanently improved, but even that is not certain, and in any case it is not, I imagine, what Prior had in mind when he wrote his letter, I am sending copies of this letter to Prior and Caroe, Yours ever, (Signed) R,W. BullardOffice Secret• of the political Resident Camp, Kuwait. Dated the 1st February, 1940. I was glad to get back to Headquarters after my recent tour and my impressions of Bushire may be of interest to you. 2. There is little doubt that the Persians are out to please. They are, of course, not allowed to show any interest in foreigners, and one must judge the position more by one*s immunity from the usual pinpricks than by any signs of active benevolence. Our passage through the Customs, for example, which offers scope for tiresomeness was the smoothest and swiftest on record, and the Director of Customs whom his colleagues find ’’very strict” has given the minimum amount of trouble. The Governor, an agreeable man who has served in a similar capacity at Khorramshahr and at Abadan, was on leave when I took over and so was due for a formal call. He was very cordial, and showed great ingenuity in wishing us a happy ending to the war without committing himself to any un-neutral statements. His reception of me was all that could be desired and on my departure he came to the top of the stairs instead of merely seeing me to the door of his reception room, as is the usual practice: a trifle but one not without significance. 3. There were an unusually large number of ships in the harbour during the month, and the customs yard was choked with/ Caroe, Esquire, C.I.E., I.C.S., Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department New Delhi.with Chevrolet lorry chassis. It is a mystery how any one can do business in Persia with its host of monopolies, restrictions and currency difficulties, but despite the extraordinary negligence of and lack of interest in every southern port save Bandar Shahpur, Bushire appears to be looking up. 4. The Ittimadieh Spinning and Weaving Mills are a new feature employing four British technical experts from Lancashire and one German. Hassin Agar, the Manager and &gt; part-owner is a Persian who has spent most of his life in Manchester and who has one son whom I have known for a long time in the Anglo-Iranian Oil company, and another younger one either actually in the Royal Air Force or under training. He came to call on me at the New Year and said that he hoped that I would not mind if he did not show up very often as it would create 'a bad impression’ , • The Mills do a good deal of business, and if they were freed from their innumerable restrictions would do very well indeed. 5. Some of our old friends in the shape of Messrs. Malcolm and Goolzad made their appearance. The latter in view of his wealth has had to find large voluntary subscriptions for the Aero Club. He was, of course, formerly the British Naval contractor. Persian merchants are not encouraged to show themselves, but it is easier to keep in touch with them in Bushire than elsewhere in Iran. 6. The local inhabitants have, of course, been ordered to observe strict ’’neutrality”, and no signs of pro-German activity came to notice. They do, however, listen to foreign broadcasts, but appear to be less impressed by Berlin than the Arab Coast. The Delhi broadcasts in Persian have aroused interest/, 1940 j interest, but they are critical of the broadcas^eT J s' and old-fashioned verbiage. 7* I gave a dinner to the Governor before leaving Bushire, and told him that I was shortly going on tour again and he replied that having recently taken over he supposed I would have much travelling to do. He is on excellent terms with Stewart, who was Vice Consul at Khorramshahr when he was there, and I said that I was glad to find that they were old friends as it would ensure cordial relations in my absence. He replied in French with great emphasis ’’Rest ’’assured, Excellency, all will go well in your absence: I ’’will answer for that”. 8.

SEEN POLITICAL COMMITTEE The Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast have relaxed something of their suspicion of British penetration. Medical facilities seem to he particularly appreciated. In Bahrein and Koweit, however, the Political Resident found a less friendly atmosphere than that of ten years ago. The changes brought about on the Trucial Coast in the last tv/elve years, v/ithout our firing a shot, Lt. Col. Prior attributes to our policy of hastening slowly, and he argues against any hasty use of force in the future. For information. (11844) Wt.29201/P.295 2,000 9/39 A.&amp; E.'VV.Ltd.
