Dear Ham, Please refer to your letter enquiring a-bout the law in force in Bahrain re^rding negotiable instruments. The Negotiable Instriments Act (26 of 1881) has not been applied to Bahrain but if a case arose in the Agency L court it would be decided on the anology of the provisions of this act. \ , You enquire what the liability of the banker is GSr the endorsements on cheques paid by the bank are forgeries. Such forged endorsements may be divided into two classes: (a) . Cheques payable to order,purported to be endorsed by or on behalf of the payee - Under Section 85 of the negotiable Instruments Act,the banker is discharged Wt payment in due course and is not further liable. (b) . Forged endorsements of any person other than that of the original payee - A person claiming under such a forged endorsement is not held^and payment to such a person would not operate as a discharge against the true owner. Ihe cheque is not discharged and the banker cannot debit the drawer with the sum paid. The bank’s remedy lies in suing for the recovery of the money from the person to whom it has paid it.

Sectx-n 65 of the Indian Act is as foxlows s *Where a cheque payable to order purports to be endorsed by or on behalf of the payee, the drawee is discharged by payment in due course.• H Section 10 deals with payment in due course. It provides \- provide “Payment in due course” means payment in accordance with the apparent tenor of the instrument in good faith and without negligence to any person in possession thereof under circumstances which do not afford a rea sonable ground for believing that he is not entitled to receive payment of the amount therein mentioned.” ••Whilst under Section 16 (2) ’’The piovisiana of this Act relating to a payee shall apply with the necessary modifications to an endor see.” citJk ”It is thus clear that if the Bank makes ’Payment in due course* to a person in possession of a cheque payable to order such payment is a &amp;oud discharge to the Ban*., even if it were to turn out subsequently that one or all of the endorsements were forged.
