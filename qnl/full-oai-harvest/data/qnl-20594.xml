Anderson writes that it is up to Kemball to determine what action, if any, should be taken against Jāsim. Anderson encloses with his letter three earlier letters issued by the Government, giving guidance as to how official letters to Government should be prepared. The three enclosures are as follows:1. A copy of a Government Circular (folio 60) issued by Francis Warden, dated 30 November 1815, containing instructions on how letters to the Government should be composed, specifically in relation to not including more than one subject in each letter;2. A copy of letter no.1449 of 1820 (folio 61) from Francis Warden, Chief Secretary, to the Resident at Bushire, dated 27 November 1820, reminding the Resident of the 1815 guidance on composing letters to the Government;3. A copy of Circular no.912 of 1831 (folio 62) from Charles Norris, Chief Secretary, dated 27 June 1831, reminding of the 1815 guidance on composing letters to the Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00000c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
