Later plot was divided in two and half of the South East portion was utilized as site for a house built by Shaikh for Gray Mackenzie’s. Imperial Bank of Iran have now sent man from Tehran to acquire site for new house for manager urgently and they are negotating for North West portion reserved for Q.M.O’s house or failing that for remaining half of South East portion. 2. There is nothing on record here about Ministry of Works’ requirements of sites. 3. I think both these sites should be reserved for our buildings, the site South West of Gray Mackenzie’s for Clerks quarters or house for B4 officer in addition to North West portion for Branch A officer. 4. Not only are these some of the best sites in townG&gt; town but they are close to Agency and would permit of air- conditioning from central plant for Agency and all residential quarters. Please telegraph whether I should asK Shaikh not to alienate plot South West of Gray Mackenzie’s house. If we are not lively to require it there is good reason for Imperial Bank of Iran taking it as they propose to build a well-designed 2 storey house suitable to the neighbourhood whereas if we reserve it now and later release it Shaikh is likely to build /'“'N monstrosity similar to that erected for Gray Mackenzies. Shaikh has already reiterated the promise to retain North West piece for us, but is sceptical about H.M.G ever building any thing and would probably like to let plot South West of Gray Mackenzies go unless we can hold out hopes of reasonably early development.
