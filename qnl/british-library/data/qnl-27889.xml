Dear Mr. Howitt, Thank you very much for your letter of the 16th February, TM/H/B2. We note that the An^lo-Persian Oil Company have now received authority from the sheikh of Qatar to establish a wireless station in Qatar and that you have informed your station at Bahrein that no objection is seen to the opening of wireless communication between Qatar and your Bahrein station.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, We were advised in January 1933 by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in Abadan that they intended establishing a wireless station in the territory of Qatar to communicate with our Bahrein Station,provided they could obtain the necessary permission from the Sheik of Qatar to erect such a station; the Sheik,however,refused this request at that time. On the 12th February 1935 we were advised by our Karachi Station that the Oil Company had now received authority to establish a wireless station in Qatar and wished to open communication with our Bahrein Station forthwith. It is understood from a telephonic conversa tion with your Department that the India Office sees no objection to the opening of wireless communication between Qatar and our station at Bahrein,and we have,therefore, instructed Bahrein accordingly. Yours faithfully. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., India Office, S .W.1. ASST. TRAFFIC MANAGER.Extract from d.o. letter, No* S*32797/D*0.I., dated 5th January, 1934, from Wing Commander McClaughry, Air Ministry, to Mr. Laithwaite. With reference to your letter PZ.6215/33 of the 21st December** 1933, the Air Ministry are not at present greatly concerned regarding air facilities on the QATAR PENINSULA owing to its close proximity to BAHREIN, and the present arrangements, under which the Sheikh has been warned that he will have to account in the event of occupants of an aircraft which may have a forced landing coming to any harm, should meet our requirements for the time being. x x x 5. There is one other point which I think I should mention at this stage, in connection with wireless telegraphy* It is important that in the event of a *V/T station or stations being erected on QATAR that the wave length should be chosen to avoid interference with R*A*F. or Imperial Airways communications, and the Air Ministry should, therefore, be consulted in regard to any proposals of this description.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002c4_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/4130</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002c4</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/4130</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 35/24 'Persian Gulf: establishment of a wireless station in Qatar by Anglo Persian Oil Company'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-11-23T22:52:55</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 6; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the proposed establishment of a wireless station in Qatar by Anglo Persian Oil Company station in Abadan, to communicate with their Bahrain station, having obtained permission from the ruler of Qatar.The file contains correspondence between the India Office and Cable and Wireless Limited.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Cable and Wireless Ltd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Wireless telegraphy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0002c4#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
