Khalil*ah. bin Hamad Al Khalil'ah came to see af' me this morning and his own request and begged that 1 would intercede with Shaikh Hamad in connection with the reduction of his H pay M . I was quite firm on the subject and said that I could do nothing whatever and pointed out to him that the expenditure exceeded the revenue by a considerable sum and that the Al Khalifah got more than sixty per cent of the total. I put it to him that unless trade revived it would be much more likely that the 'pay” would have to be cut than increased and that it was the same for everybody. 2. I need not bother you with the details but he said that if he could not get an increase in his ’’pay' could he sell date gardens* I said that he could sell them to Members of the Al Khalifah. He said that none of them wished to buy and t therefore,might he sell them to outsiders. 1 said that was contrary to custom of the a! Khalifah and could not be done,but I said eventually that 1 would write and ask you whether it would be possible for the Bahrain Government to buy the date gardens., I emphasised that I could say nothing for certain but that I would let you know. You will remember that a little time ago we mentioned the possibility of the Bahrain Government buying Al Khalifah land and if the need for a sale is genuine,possibly this is the sort of case in which a sale to the Bahrain Government might be a solution of an individuals difficulties. I presume that he has difficulties but,of course,have only his statement for it. C.Balrymple Belgrave Esquire, Adviser to the Bahrain Government.No. Ihe Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to The Political Agent, Bahrain. and is directed to transmit to him a copy of the undermentioned documents^ for favour of disposal. British Residency and Consulate-General, BUS HI RE. Dated the 1933 . Reference to previous correspondence : bescription of Enclosure. CtHDbllAfter Compliments. I have the honour to lay 'before Your Honour my grievances and to explain at the same time facts for your information. 7ith regard to the pay fixed for me hy 'both (Colonel I'rideaux and Colonel Barrett) which was to.remain immune from reduction. It was however reduced afterwards hy Bs.20 and subsequently another reduction of Is.55/8/- was made in 1352. 'liile I was drawing the pay allowed (after reduction) a letter has 'been received hy me from the Court of Justice intimating a further reduction from my pay of ns. (Y). 1 considered it necessary to interview Colonel Loch, .Political Agent, Bahrain, and converse with him on the subject. This I was compelled to do on account of the hardship which I experienced. I own family and servants and though the original pay was quite insufficient yet I was economizing so as to have it distributed among them. If I was spending Ks.300 I reduced it to Hs.225 saving Ks.75. But I see it is impossible for me to save anything now because my family members have increased while my pay has been decreased. I wanted to ask for an increment but as I have already stated I wished to interview first the Political Agent and discuss the matter with him. But as he was leaving Bahrain I found that he could not receive any visit then. And as you are aware it is impossible for me to wait for his return because I am very hard up. in the circumstances X request you very kindly to consider this case favourably by honouring me with an interview to enable me to discuss the matter with you. If you will be good enough to issue telegraphic instruc tions informing me to come to Bushire I shall be highly obliged to discuss the matter and make everything clear to you.Bushire Printed letter No:1395 dated the 1st July 1933 Petition to P.R by Khalifah bin Muhammad al Khalifah against reduction of his allowance.
