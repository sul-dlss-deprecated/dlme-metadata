Translation of letter dated l^^Safar 1367/ v from His Highness Shaikh Sir Sulman bin Hamad AlKhalifah, KCIE., Bahrain to C.J. Pelly, Esquire, O.B.E., I.C.S., H.B.M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. • - | I ^ I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No.C/1226 dated 23rd December 1947, dealing with the sea which lies between Bahrain and Q,atar. 2. We wish to point out that since the time that our ancestors conquered Bahrain from their town of Zubara until the present day the seas lying between our Eastern coast and the western coast of the C^atar peninsular have been under our control and we have held domination over the islands, shoals and reefs which exist in these waters. Our people own fishing rights, which have never been disputed, in the waters inside this area. 3. During the lengthy negociations between our Government and the two oil companies, Bahrain Petroleum Company and Petroleum Concessions Limited who were competing for an oil concession in the seas belonging to Bahrain, in 1938 and 1939, many discussions took place and maps and plans were made showing the sea area which was the subject of the negociations. These negociations were carried on through H.B.M's Political Agent who was either present during the meetings or who was provided with a detailed note about all matters which were discussed. The sea area which we were then prepared to lease to the companies between the coasts of Bahrain and ^atar was from and including the island of Jinan, the most southern island of the Hawar Group, to a point approxi mately 10 miles north east of Fasht al Dibal. It was at no time suggested by H.B.M f s Political Agent that 2/— -M. ,o 7 ■» '&gt;/«&gt;■/« Confidential. BAHRAIN RECEIPT n N ,..l Dat.,.#/?/..:W ( we had no rights over any part of the sea area lying between Bahrain and this line. If our ownership of this area was in doubt why were these negociations approved by Political Agent ? 4. In para 4 of your letter you state that our sovemgn rights in Dibal and Jaradah shoals, which are above spring tide low water level, are recognised. These two shoals are in fact the terminus of one long continuous shoal which begins off Sitra Island and reaches Dibal and Jaradah. There is no deep water channel crossing this shoal and the highest points of this shoal, at Dibal and Jaradah, cannot be separated from the main shoal. We contend that all the sea lying between our coasts up to and including Dibal and Jaradah should be included in the sea over which we have sovereign rights. 5. We are unable to understand why our island of Jinan, which, owing to the rich fishing grounds around it, is an island of value, has been excluded from the Hawar group. Jinan is used as a base by our fishermen who are accustomed, with our permission, to erect huts on the island in the fishing season. Jinan has been recognised as one of the islands of the Hawar group and was speci fically referred to by us in our letter to H.B.lTs Poli tical Agent, vide letter No. C/180 of April 28, 1936 from our Adviser to H.B.M's Political Agent., It is marked I ^ b\2e- - by a beacon which werconstructed in 1358^ ! • jo ; | 6. In conclusion we consider that the delimination described in your letter should be readjusted and the dividing line should run from and including Jinan up to the north east corner of Dibal, including the whole length of the shoal which starts at Sitra and which appears above the surface at Dibal and Jaradah.C.12.46.

We are now directed by our London Principals to advise you that, if permitted, they have the following comments to make: (a) No objection is raised to the principle of the division by the median line based on the general configuration of the Coast-line of the two territories but regret is expressed at the violation of this principle in order to give Hawar Island and both the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals to Bahrain to which they do not geographically belong. (b) If it be considered too late to reconsider the allocation of Hawar Island, which forms a part of the mainland of Qatar, there would seem to be grounds for the revision of the allocation of the two shoals to Qatar, as they are geographically a continuation of the intervening shoal area. 3.

The 19th February, 1948, j » ) Dear Mr. 3ro.vn, A In our telephone conversation of the 17th of February I under3tood you to say that your letter No. FA-103, dated the Sth February, 1948, of which you senc me a copy, did not mean that your field party's drilling activity is not to be restricted to the limits laid do,vn in paragraph 2 of my letter No. c /661, dated the 9th June, 1947, and that you consider that your Company is now at liberty to operate anywhere to the west of the dividing line limiting the rights in the bed of the sea lying between Bahrain and ^atar - even at point •J*; and that your principals had asked you to get on with drilling in the areas mentioned (though not, I observe, specifically) in your letter first quoted. 2. Until your Company has officially accepted the delimitation of the rights of sovereignty of the two Rulers over the sea-bed by His Majesty's Government, I must ask you to restrict your opera tions in the TTawar area to those defined in my letter No. C/661 iated the 9th .Tune, 1947, and not to drill at point 'J*. 3. As the matter is one in which close definition is most desirable, this is a good opportunity to make a point which T have had in mind since speaking to you on the 17th. Neither the expression ^decision regarding the eastern boundary of the Shaikh's domain' 1 (used in your letter No. C/PA-315 dated the 27th December, 1947) nor the expression 'decision as to the delimitation of the boundary between Bahrain and ^atar' (used in my demi-official letter No. C/157, dated the 4th February, 1943) are accurate. 'Vhat the decision did was to delimit the rights of sovereignty of the two Rulers over the sea bed. Doubtless, you appreciated this point before, but as the matter is so important I am again mentioning it. Yours sincerely. 0^ ,1^ n Mr. Russell M* Brown, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain petroleum Co., Ltd., Bahrain. j NS.W&amp;m^. ' v ,rM i ■ ioll? .

C/1227 and C/160 dated the 23rd December, 1947 and the 4th February, 194B, respectively, regarding the delimitation of the sea—bed which Your Excellency referred to as being shown on the map forwarded with Your Excellency's letter of the 23rd December, 1947. I hsve perused the contents of the map and wish to confirm to Your Excellency that I am one of those who are keen on accepting whatever H.M's Government propose or decide as I never question the just and equitable way of her investigations, her far-sightedness in (dealing) with matters and the nobleness of her principles. However, I like to invite Y'our Excellency's attention to the correspondence exchanged some ten years ago on the subject of Huwar (Island) and the clear representation I made regarding its position in my letter submitted to His Excellency the Political Agent, Bahrain, at the time, in which I expounded ray points of view in regard to this Island which is a part of Qatar and in which I expressed my protest against the behaviours of Bahrain Government. Rut H.M's Government acted as they wished, and I had nothing but to submit, reserving in the meantime to myself my own rights. The map you were kind enough to send me shows clearly that Deebil shoal and Huwar Islands are within the territory of Qatar. Huwar is directly attached to the coast of Qatar with a piece of shallow water disconnecting^which recedes at ebb tide, thus establishing access for pedestrians. If this is its natural position and geographical aspect, how can it be separated from its motherland Qatar and made the domain of other than its ruler-^ Yet as I have mentioned to Your Excellency I cannot but exercise patience, being content with what Your Excellency said that this decision is liable to alteration at any time In case more exact geographical data are iorthcoming. This strengthens in me the hone '- 2 - that H.M's Government will reconsider the matter once again and award a more correct decision based on georraoh.lcal data etc. Usual Wndinp.110. 0/263. 13th larch, 1948. ?o .?he Chief Local Representative/ ''he Bahrain petrolaum Company, Limited, Bahrain, T)ear air in referring go my letter No.C/lS#?, dated the ^3r i oeceraber, 1947, forwar iin^ to you a copy of a letter -o T {ls Highness the .haikh of Bahrain iecision as to the boundary .mlch should limit che rights of sovereignly of the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar over the sea-bed lividing ;holr territories, T a.n tc request your Company to restrict your opera tions in -hie Ha war area to :hose defined in my letter Wo, C/661, fated the 9th of June, 1947, and not to drill at point 'J* until your Company has officially accepced this leclslon. communicating to him [is ajesty's iovernmeriC' s Yours faithfully political Agenu, Bahrain. NS.Mr. Brown, Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain petroleum Company, and Mr. Witherspoon, Vice—President, Operations, came to see me this morning. The main subject discussed was the restriction on the Company's drilling operations in the Hawar area and the related correspondence concerning the dividing line limiting the rights in the bed of the sea lying between Bahrain and Qatar. Mr. Brown gave, as he had done on another occasion before, Viis point of view on the correspondence between myself and himself on this subject. He said that neither he nor his people in London considered that their comments were called for when the decision was conveyed by me to him. I said that it did not strike us to ask for their comments, but that I naturally expected that he would let us have these in a matter so closely affecting the Company's interests if he had any to make. I said further that I had not considered that the communication of the decision on the dividing line cancelled the restriction placed by H.M.G. on the Company's drilling activity. Mr. Brown countered this by stating that we had informed him (he did not quote a specific letter and ^he point is not very important) that the restriction was only to be enforced until h.m.g. gave a decision on the dividing line, and after that decision had been reached he took it as cancelling the restriction. He professed to be puzzled as to why the letter of which I sent p .R. a draft with s.35 (Agency Express Letter No.C/215 dated 18.2.'48) and a previous demi -official letter to him in the nature of a reminder, asking him fof the Company^ comments on the delimitation decision, were demi -official; and said that his people (presumably, this time he referred to the local staff in charge of opera tions) thought he was merely acting on a demi-official arrangement between himself and myself, and that he would, /therefore....therefore, prefer to have an official letter communi cating to him the substance of paragraph 2 of the draft already referred to and seen by P.R.

For a proper appreciation of the Bahrain situation it is, of course, to be borne in miol that territorially we are dealing with an Achipelago in a Gulf within the Persian Gulf, the inhabitants of which (the Bahrainis) have carved out an existence as Islanders would do, within and withfrut the waters of both Gulfs. A careful study of this proposal, in the light of my Company's knowledge of the locality likely to be affected by it, convinces my Company that any such proposal must be one of expediency but why that should be so and why the area for long regarded by the Company and, indeed, by the Sheikh of Bahrein, as the minimum extent of the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and known to your Office as that within the 'Belgrave Line' should be so reduced, are questions to which the Company can find no answer* Also, why should some of these Islands, Islets, Shoals and Shallows which liave be?n made use of by these Islanders, the Subjects of the Sheikhs of Bahrain, and ' ifregarded as coming within t ; e 3ahrela Archipelago, be treated as enclaves or quasi -enclaves, l.e # as territories wholly or partially surrounded by foreign doalolons? This t ppears to be the CBse of the Jiatar Group of Isl ^s etc. and of Dlbal and Jaradeh to the iforth of that Group: by no systea of reasoning c i the Company rcKionclle the proposal of H. I. Government «lth the rights and Interests both of this Sheikhdom (which the ^onapatTy has so sincerely at heart and which It has lone so auch to protect and Improve) and which the Company Is so desirous of furthering, and of the Compan, Itself. In fact, the proposed boundary line would hea in t e Archipelago from the waters of the Persian Gulf to an extent contrary to established Custom and necessity, Furtheraore, by proposing tc divide the Sitr* Channel by a line running from the open sea to the Horth Sitra light is to do at least four things adversely affecting the Interests of this Company, 'iaoel/i- (1) To hand to a neighbouring Sheikh a right over and under a channel peculiar to the Bahrein Island itself and therefore to the Company and to which that Sheikh could otherwise have nc pcs«ible claim; (2) To introduce t&gt;e possibility of serious interference with the Company's exclusive rights in regard to the production, refining, etc, of petroleum and its products within the Sheikhdom of Bahrein; (3) To create a cause for provocation to the ahreln Islanders which would lead to disturbances inimical tc the Interests of the Company; and (4) To pave the way for rights in third parties granted by a Sheikh either hostile or oblivious to the Interests of t&gt;e Sheikh of Bahrein and therefore those claimed by the Company, which must hinder or prevent the Co-span^s operations and bring it into direct conflict with third parties: the Company could not possibly be asked to be put into such a position so directly at variance witr the general ter^s of the Concessions it holds from the Sheikh of Bahrein. This britlsh Compmny is desirous of reaping the reward of its pioneer effort in the Bahrain Archlpellgo, aa effort which has- 3 • not only opened up a wide horizon of tremendous Importance in and to the petroleum world (and In which this Cofapany naturally and flarly stakes its claim) but one also of the greatest Importance to the United Kingdom and the Government of Bahrein. When put to the Company, it was understood that the proposed line was of a political character only, having nothing to d# with subsoil rights etc. and accordingly the Company did not recognise that It was particularly concerned and was inclined to stand aside because of its policy of steering clear of all politics. However, as the line is now known to be territorial in character and therefore directly affecting the vital interests of the Company, it Is very much concerned and views with apprehension a sectional boundary which (apart fro^i anything else) seems to have been drawn without regard to the netroleum potentialities of the adjoining Islets, shoals f shallows and waters generally y particularly those within the w Belgrave Line', a boundary hitherto re arded as a feasil minimum line of demarcation of the extent of the ghelkhdos of Bahrein.^ In this connection my Company believes, although It has not by any means concluded its exploratory work to the eastward and Southward of Bahrein, that such a line as has been suggested by R.M.Government might well adversely affect the best Interests of the Company and of the Sheikhdom of Bahrein to a very grave extent. Here may I respectfully venture a suggestion:- Why should not H*M.Clovernment take rny Company into its confidence by seeking its views and expert advice on the petroleum resources of these * ^ surrounding waters and the best method of dealing with them? I say this for the reason that not only has this britlsh Company the best Interests of Bahrain at heart but its knowledge of the petroleum resources and possibilities of the surrounding territory isindubitably unequalled although, as yet, incomplete. Besides f raight I not pray in aid of my Company's cace, the additional supporting factsi- p&gt; T (1) The Company rescued Bahrain and its many inhabitants from poverty, by venturing in on an operation which no one of the other Companies to whom the original Concession was offered, *ould seriously consider. In his Administrative Report dated December 1937» for the years 1926-1937, Mr. C, Dalrymple Belgrave (Financial Adviser to the Bahrein Government), says, on page 47 'If oil had not been discovered in Bahrain the Country would now be on the verge of bankruptcy. n 2) The Company's productions at Bahrain have been of inestimable value to the War Effort of Great Britain and her Allies, and will t&gt;e of even greater value to Great Britain in the future. In this latter connection this ,Company is striving to enlarge the Sterling Area for the production of petroleum crude, to relieve itself of the dollar purchases of crude it is now forced to make. (3) The Company has proved to be worthy of and receive# the confidence of the Bahrein Government, the Local Auth^orities and H.M,Government• (4) The Company has discovered and serviced the deep water channel for navigation into Sitrah, which has proved to be of great service not only to the Company and through it to the She khdom of Bahrein, but to •Government. (5) Directly and Indirectly the Company's operations provide a i-reat deal of v*ork for local and brltlsh labour. (6) In many arays the Company has assisted nmterially in developing a happy, well-regulated comiunity, with Hospitals. Schools and other modern Social services. (7) The Company has produced a large revenue for the Internationa! radio station on Bahrain of Cable and Wireless Ltd. 8) The Company's financial investment in Bahrain stands at a very hdgh figure which Is to be greatly Increased in the future by (among other things) the enlargement In size and usefulness of the Refinery which is already extensively used in refining the produce of its own fields an! the fields of Saudi Arabia. (9) The Company's operations wholly within well defined petroliferous areas would obviate the many troubles which are bound to arise where two competing Oil Companies are developing the same field, a position likely to be aggravated where the base of operations might have to be the same, a base already covered by this Company's Concession. Bases other than within the Bahrain Achipft4go are unlikely to be available lor efficient and otherwise well-ordered field andadministrative oparatlons In the southern section of the Persian Gulf excepting on the Mainland of Saudi Arabia. Lastly, seeing that I have been actively engaged In and about the affairs of this Company since its inception, and particularly so with the negotiation of the transfer of the original Concession of 1925 to this Company and of the subsequent Lease of •'the Additional Area M when practically the whole of the Sheikhdom / 1 of Bahrain was entrusted to this Company, so far as petroleum is concerned, I humbly venture the opinion that the course outlined above is essentially in the best Interests of H•M• Government and of the Bahrain Government.^ $ 4 * r I an. __m '-N - No.C/326.

Dear Sir: f (v ' 12' ' \/f S I am desired 'by The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited to call your attention to an apparent disal'epancy in the geographical position of the Hawar Island group as' shown on the map which accompanied the attachment to your letter No. C/1228 dated December 23rd, 1947. The abovementioned map shows the Hawar Island group to be located approximately 4-,000 ft, further East than indicated by sur vey work carried out by the Company. This contention is based on information to the effect that in 1932 H.M.S. 'Ormonde' made a hydrographic survey to the North and North-East of Bahrein Island. At this time the geographic position of various points on Bahrein Island was established. A photostat copy of a record signed by D, H, Fryer, believed to have been a Captain of H.M.S. 'Ormonde' of these positions is attached. This record shows the geographic position of:- (a) Triangulation Station on the summit of Jebel Dukham: Latitude Longifoidfr, North 26° 02 , 15 M East 50° 32 l 30 n (b) Political Agency (Nail in roof)t Latitude Longitude North 26° UW East 50° 35*00' These geographic positions have been used to find other geographic positions on and near Bahrein Island. A triangulation system was formed covering Bahrein Island, and the co-ordinates of all the triangulation stations were found with reference to Triangulation Station No, 1 on Jebel Dukham, ' ^ T PT. No og. cPo, 7,.^...2—PA-253. July 17, 1948. In 1939 the Bahrein island triangulation network was ex tended seaward to various shoals and small sand islands for the con trol of additional geographical and geophorsical examination. One of the triangulation stations, No, 113A, was erected on the watch tower of the Police Fort on Hawar Island. The geographical position of this station was found to be:- Latitncfe longitude North 25° 43 t 13.2 tl East 50° 47 , 15.9 f1 and its co-ordinates with reference to Triangulation Station No. 1 were South ; 115,278.6^ feet. East ; 81,025.10 feet. In 1940 the Bahrein Island triangulation network was fur ther extended to Hawar Island and a fourth order survey made of Hawar Island for orientation purposes only, this is shown on the Compary's drawing No.BRA-999. In February, 194-8, angles were measured from the Police Fort on Hawar Island, sighting on three triangulation stations on Bahrein Island. By using the 'three point method 11 the geographical position and the co-ordinates of station 113A on the Police Fort were found to be as follows;- la^itudg Longitude North 25° 4.3 f 12.9' East 50° 47 f 19.2 ,, Co-ordinates with reference to Triangulation Station No. 1 South; 115,304. feet East; 81,331 feet A check was made hy triangulating from triangulation stations on Bahrein Island,direct to the Police Fort on Hawar Island. The re sults of this survey gave the geographical position of station 113A as follows;- Latitude Longitude North 25° 43 f 12.5 ff East 50° A7 f 20.1' Co-ordinates with reference to Triangulation Station No. 1.

The exact geographical position of the Hawar group of Islands, of course, depends upon the accuracy of the 'Ormonde' ob servations, but in any case the relative position of this group of Islands with respect to Bahrein is shown on the Company^ maps within the accuracy of a Fourth Order Survey. The maps or copies mentioned above can be made available should you require, and the triangulation data is open to inspection 'by an accredited Cartographer. It has been suggested this information kindly be forwarded to the Hydrographer of the Navy, Admiralty, London, S.W.I, as being useful for the correction of charts and other publications issued hy the British Admiralty.

I ar to add that in making their aeard f His Majesty 1 s/Oovernoient have felt thera- selves bound to follow strictly the principle of equity in adjudicating: the rive/ dales of the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Qatar and that it has not therefore been possible for thes to allow themselves to be Influence I either by ^eolo^ical factors or by any consideration of the services which may have been rendere'! in the past by the Bahrain Petroleum Conpany.

His Majesty's Government are fully aware of the iaportance of this channel not only to the Bahrein ^etroleuc Company but to the Bahrain islands generally, and will be at pains to tee that no action is taken as a result of the decision reached regarding the division of the sea-bed which will in any way interfere with the u^e of the channel for navigational purposes.

H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Dear Sir, We would refer to our recent conversations on the subject of the Marine Seismic Survey now being undertaken by the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited in Qatar waters. 2. On 26th April 1949 it was reported that a buoy had been laid the previous evening off the point on which our Distillation Units are erected, the distance from the shore being well under a mile. 3. On 4th May 1949 three launches were reported lying south of the Distillation Plant and at 08.30 work commenced which was identified as being of a marine seismic nature. It was feared that the explosions would damage the sea lines of the distillation plant as these occurred within approximately eight hundred yards of the shore. The undersigned flew over the area in the afternoon of 4th -ay and observed the operations and the explosions by the three launches involved. A fourth launch was anchored off shore approximately 10 kilometres south of the distillation plant and near two flagged buoys, all of which were within one mile of the shore. This seismic survey is therefore definitely operating in Qatar Territorial Waters which are part of our Qatar Concession. The seismic personnel who were visited on board by our Resident Geologist and In Charge Marine Dept., informed them that permission had been obtained from 'Capt. Pelly of the British Agency in Bahrain' for the work to be carried out in Qatar waters. 4. As previously reported to you verbally, similar work has been undertaken North of the Hawar Island group, extending to within Qatar- 2 - QSA*2/7445 (contd.) Territorial Waters, 7 /V \ A 5. Your Secret letter No. C/S-46 dated 30th April 1949 addrejssjed to H.E. The Ruler of Qatar states that the division or the sea-bed, between Bahrain and Qatar, was finally decided by His Majesty's Government and conrnrunicated to H.E. in vour letter c/1227 of the 23rd December 1947. In this letter it is stated that with the exception of the Hawar Group and the areas of the Dibal and Jaradeh shoals. His Majesty s Government will, in future, regard all the sea-bed 0f the median as be i n g the sovereignty of the Ruler of Qatar. &amp; J In these circumstances the presence of a seismic party sponsored by the Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd., and working in Qatar waters and obtaining information of the sea-bed, which is under the sovereignty of the Ruler of Qatar, would appear somewhat in- ethical especially as the sea-bed in question is claimed as part of the Concession area covered by the Qatar Oil Agreement. . .l e would therefore be grateful if you would issue instructions for this survey to cease functioning in the seas east of the median line and in Qatar Territorial Waters. c.c. qcb.l bhl/acm Yours faithfully.

This shoal is claimed by His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and is clearly included,in the islands and reefs whose status His Majesty's Government offered to discuss in 1939, which offer the Saudi Arabian Government did not reply to. His Majesty's Government have no intention whatsoever of taking any action to prejudice the status of this shoal or the division of the sea-bed. They are ready to discuss these subjects at any time. They suggest that no obstacle should be placed in the way of the Bahrain Petroleum Company's proceeding with exploratory work. His Majesty's Government assujre the Saudi Arabian Government that the continuation of these operations will not be used in any way as an argument in favour of the claim of Bahrain to the shoal in question.

Dear Sir, I am Instructed by His Excellency the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to inform you that I have addressed His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain regarding the Fasht Bu Saafah as indicated in the letter to His .c\ Highness No.C/L-406 of to-day^ date a copy of which V x N \x I enclose. v , ^, &lt;&gt; 2.

I am further to say that in the light of these com munications it is for your company to decide whether to continue for the time being with your work at Fasht Bu Saafah or not. In regard to it you will recognise that circumstances may have changed in the considerable period since His majesty's Government gave conditional approval to your operations on that shoal and it is suggested that it may not be wise for your company in its own interest to incur expenditure in a place which it may well have to sur render.
