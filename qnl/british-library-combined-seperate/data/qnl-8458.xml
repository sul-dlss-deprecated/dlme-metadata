These reports describe security, public order, economic conditions and agricultural productivity in Fars. Included in these reports is a detailed summary of events in Fars for the year 1936 (ff 352-370), and a report on the economic conditions in Fars in July 1937 (ff 334-346). These reports were written by the British Consul at Shiraz, Arnold Edwards Watkinson.The second part of the file contains papers dated from August 1941 to July 1944 (ff 5-320). These papers concern the situation in Fars in the wake of the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, and the two Allied powers’ occupation of Iran during the Second World War.
