I have been interested to note the definition in the memorandum of ”backshish” as ”a form of largesse which is neither a tip nor a bribe but a traditional recognition of unsolicited service. ” Yours ever, AA /k Miles Olauson, Esq., India Office., /) &lt;3 1st February 1940. Ty dear Gilbert, With reference to paragraph 22 of the Viceroy’s private letter dated 13th Noveniber, the Secretary of State desires rre to forward for His Excellency's Information a copy of a memorandurri on Press activitic s in Cairo, by the Embassy press section. Yours ever, (Sgd.) M. J. CLAUSONfile copy '/ V*:i - v »0 (J 159/49/16) If PORiilGH OFFICE, S.W. 1. 24th January, 1940. In your letter P.Z. 5935/39 of the 28th November you asked whether we could obtain any information from the Embassy in Cairo about the methods used to influence the Arabic press in our cause. I now enclose a copy of a memorandum prepared by Williamson Napier, of the Press Section of ~che Embassy. Napier has already sent copies to Jerusalem, Jedda, Beirut, Damascus, Aden and Bagdad, and I am sending a copy of this letter to Rushbrook- Williams of the Ministry of Information. - R.T. Peel, Esq., C.B.E. ,M.C.(J 159/49/16) M B F 0 ~R A F DU F IRE Jo AC^IVITI^&gt; IN CAIRO, on GEFERA Having been invite l to supply information on certain aspects of the Embassy’s Press activities, T would venture first to place on record a few cardinal princi les by which relations with the l ress in Egypt have been conveniently guided. (1) In a country where flattery, adulation, and lavish display form an integral part of social and commercial inter course, it is inevitable that a ’’publicity sense” is highly developed. It follows, as a natural corollary, that those who cater to this particular complex - namely journalists - enjoy a sort of fictitious prestige which is often quite inconsistent with their merits or attainments. ''hus a humble reporter is often granted access to a Cabinet Minister, and there is hardly a member of the Royal Family who is not on terms of friendly intimacy with one or other henchman in one paper or another. Even the ex-Khedive Abbas Hilmy employs a salaried and accredited publicity agent in Egypt, an individual, incidentally, of extremely dubious antecedents but valuable and influential ’’contacts”. An uncompromising attitude towards this possibly deplorable but fundamentally harmless manifestation of Oriental mentality is not likely to improve personal relat ons with the ]ress, even though the publicity it is desired to create is not personal but national. (2) Another peculiarity of the East is ’’backshish”, a form of largesse which is neither a tip nor a bribe but a traditional recognition of unsolicited service. Thus an editor, who on his own spontaneous initiative goes out of his way to present a case in a favourable light, quite legitimately expects his services /aftrvicee to bo rocogniood, If not noceuaorily In ce«h f then in kind (o.g. ho^pitolity# odvortXKing, •ufeaoriptl no). It lo troditiv'7n«l, fon instance, fo^ o Governor of a irovinoc, on th« occasion of o roy^l or ministerial visit not only to entertain the repreaentativea of the Fraaa but clao to give them a gratuity in ceah* Service* I'endcrr d by arrangement do not feature in this oatogory, but the custom in qu^ation might bo deeerib^d in th^ worde of a leading newspaper proprietor to the writer, '’ l** -v^tite m ;nn^J L&lt;^ des r?-lotions :aondRines% (a) I would suggest that an official dealing with the Press should eliminate from his vocabulary the word ‘•bribery*. It 1© no r.or** reprehensible for a newspaper proprietor to lesse his editorial columns for the presentation of a politic*! icau^ in e favourable light then to acoept ^ayrarnt for the use of his advert icing space to cry the virtues of a patent «ec!ioine. he subconscious u*?e of the word 'honorarium*' confers u,&gt;on a fi iuncial trsnsmotion s dignity which cannot fail to react favourably on th&lt;* mutusi r* lotions of the giver »nd the recipient. On the other hand, it is fre( uentiy advisable not to reveal the fact that the 'sweetener' emanfstos from Oovernment funds and it is there ore neoosfcary to devise various eyosciebts to effect payment through a third party. The bourses of revenue of the gyptian or© (a) advertisements, (b) subsidies, (o) news, and it is that; perfectly logical tha^ influence or control should br operated through se channels. There is another factor in warti^t rruaely Tenaorehip. ^dvert is© ; ne n ts • In countries un ier a totalitarian regime wh« re commercial enterpriao is » uP j cted to rif orou^ .ovem v nt control it woul : bo possible to induce oom ^ rcinl » dve t i ers(3 to ufe only as media of advertising those papers the editorial policy of uhich was politically satisfactory. Thus In Egypt t was attempted to follow the example of the Germane and Italians and to canalise all British advertising through one agency. Unfortunately, in spite of several conferences in London, lengthy correspondence, and conversations with the local British Chamber of Commerce, this proved impossible. Nevertheless, means were found to bring pressure to bear on papers who derived their advertising through an agency in London to persuade the manager of thi s agency to warn certain papers that advertisers in the United Kingdom were expressing unwillingness to continue to patronise those whose policy was anti- British. Moreover individual British advertisers in Egypt undertook to drop a similar hint to offending Journals. This had a most salutary effect. But n addition it was decided to allocate to various Journals, subject to an implicit understanding of a favourable editorial attitude, monthly appropriations varying from £E.10 to SE.80 per month under the guise of genuine advertisements on behalf of the Travel and Industrial Association of Great Britain. In addition or as an alternative to space occupied by these advertisements it was understood that there would also be editorial space available for articles reflecting favourably on the British cause. Since the war, the ”Travel Association” fapade has been dropped and the lublicity Section of the Embassy has arranged for facilities to be available under the guise of 'publicity space'. Material is either communicated direct or 'inspired'at the Publicity Sect on 1 a direction. A careful check is maintained on the reproduction of material supplied and if this should fall below a reasonable standard or the editorial policy not be satisfactory, the proprietor isis brought gently but firmly to account* The transaction, however, is in the nature of a 'gentlemen’s agreement” and every consideration is given to the technical difficulties which frequently confront the proprietor when these are justified. With tactful handling, give and take on both sides, mutual confidence and comprehension this perfectly legitimate method of control produces adequate results. But if, as might be possible in India, British advertisers could be persuaded to lend their full co-operation, the charge on public funds in this connection might be considerably reduced if not entirely eliminated. Subsidies . (a) At times of political crisis in peacetime it has been found advisable to negotiate definite agreements with proprietors of certain journals radically to modify their policy during a specified period. The proper functioning of Censorship should render this unnecessary in wartime. (b) Certain sub-editors are paid a regular retaining-fee to write articles as a dally feature subject to general instructions. (c) Others are paid a small fee to ensure adequate reproduction of our news bulletins and photographs. (d) Others are specially commissioned to provoke Interviews the texts of which are 'vetted'. In short, every paper and every journalist may present a different aspect in which the judicious distribution of 'honoraria' may produce profitable results. No proposition, however unorthodox, is lightly rejected. But a rigorous line is drawn between 'backrhish' and 'blackmail”. News. Some itsms of news represent the equivalent of a cash payment, others require a cash payment to secure reproduction. Thus a sense of news-values and the tastestastes of each paper's oublic is essential* Before the War the Embassy subsidised a news agency specialising in the Near East and supplied it with exclusive items. It was expected to make its own arrangements to secure reasonable reproduction. Now the Embassy issues its own daily bulletins and adequate reproduction is part of the publicity contract mentioned above. At present, owing to legal difficulties in publishing news taken from the air (e.g. the British Broadcasting Corporation’s Arabic Broadcast), to the inadequate presentation and distribution of British Official Wireless, and to the relative weakness of Reuter’s, the supply of authentic and favourable news to the Press - the most important factor in the influencing of public opinion - is the weakest element in our Press organisation. There are other metnods of stimulating the reproduction of favourable news which will readily occur to an official handling the Press, e.g. the payment of telegraphic expenses of a London correspondent or even the facilitating of his contacts with government departments at home. In this, as in all questions relating to news distribution, it is necessary to have an adequate comprehension of the technical principles involved and of the vast vested interests in which national and commercial incentives are frequently, but not irremedially, at conflict. QgflSORSHI? . In Jul&gt;, 1938, the writer hazarded the following observations in a memorandum on 'Propaganda in Wartime':- 'In an allied country and with the aid of severe censorship restrictions we should normally be able to discount the danger of a positively unfriendly attitude. But it must not be deduced from this that the Press would necessarily be uniformly and enthusiastically pro-British without special inducuments. There would be on the part of certain proprietors/proprietors (a) misgivings that isigypt has bean dragged into the w^r to serve British Imperial interests; (b) a lurking foar that the Allies might lose the war and that proprietors of pro-British papers would be singled out for reprisals; (c) the knowledge of the existence of an organisation spending money to propagate the British cause, which would temot them to sit on the fence and await concrete proposals. Nor must we exclude the activities of hostile agencies to oromote a ’’neutral' attitude. There is however little doubt that personal and political arrlere aensees would yield to considerations of self- interest and that in war money would talk even more effectively than in time of peace. Our task in this respect would be much easier than in peacetime as papers the editorial policies of which are fundamentally anti- British for reasons of internal politics would, one may hope, not be allowed to exist. In short, with Judicious distribution of cash there shoulu be small difficulty in converting an editorial policy ab initio non-committal to a favourable one. Editorial space in the Egyptian press can be purchased as easily as advertising space and there should consequently be little difficulty about the placing of appropriate material. The crux of the question would not be the laying and the firing of the gun, but the provision of a constant supply of first- class ammunition.' These observations have been amply confirmed by existing conditions. Whilst it cannot be claimed that Censorship has completely eliminated a latent hostility to certain aspects of our policy in Egypt, it can be affirmed with certainty that the existence of a brand new ’•Publicity Section' has raised expectations which can only partially be satisfied. In certain cases disappointed hopes have led to a form of 'passive resistance' which it would be folly to ignore and fatal to attempt to overcome by further obstacles. It mustbe clearly x-ecogniacd that Censorship can only operate in a 'negative' direction, and that to lead an 'unwilling horse to 'water' is not a practical proposition. co;;cL(}sion . In conclusion I would quote the following from my first report on methods of influencing the Egyptian Press written in April, 1936:- 'There is the type of emancipated Mohamedan journalist whose memory lingers fondly on his delightful associations with the daughter of his lanulady in Balham or his admiration for Professor Brown at Cambridge. He responds almost pathetically easily - at any rate on the surface - to the blandishments of a cup of coffee, or more probably several whiskies, ana takes an obvious delight in expounding his own views on Egypt and the English which are not necessarily those of his paper. He is easily enticed into the lounge of a local hotel while the amenities of the CJezira Snorting Club are outside the range of hia ambitions or interest. ■ro 0 Xal.u cQ:u.aJv&gt;, t..is sor-t ,coald_ ; n.laenea .-fee ,;»pllcy of a paper would be absurd . I would endorse this observation by the remark of an Egyptian journalist to the writer recently:- 'Thais can be no honey without money'. 4Ui Jami iry._ 194 '(J 4719/774/16) FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l 6th December, 1939♦ I enclose a copy a letter from Peel of the India Office expressing admiration and interest at your methods of dealing with the Arable press.

I have read with great interest the account given in _ paragraphs 36 and 33 of the annual Report on J-gypt for 1938 of the efforts of the Embassy, partly by means of exploitation of advertising, to control the editorial /policies of leading organs of the Egyptian Press. I gather also from Caroe that the tone of the 'Abram' and 'iluqattam' - which seem to be papers of very wide circulation - has recently been extremely satisfactory, and we are finuino the copies of these journals (which are now reaching us from the l.E.I.C.) most helpful as an aid to our publicity efforts. Would It, do you think, be possible to obtain from the Cairo Embassy press section some detaiieu account of their methods and the organisation adopted to secure these excellent results? It might well be of very real assistance to us here, and I would see to it that tne confidential character of any such information was strictly guarded.(3 P. Z. 5935/39. CONFIDENTIAL. EXTRACTS FROM ANNUAL REPORT ON EGYPT, 1938. 36. During the actual crisis it “became abundantly clear that the means open to the Government to restrain the press from abusing its liberty were extremely faulty and a stringent press law was mooted at the end of the year. In the circumstances it became increasingly incumbent on the press section of the embassy to supplement the Government’s deficiencies and contacts with the various organs of public opinion - newspapers, news agencies, films and broadcasting - were extended and improved; a distinct advance was made in the exploitation of advertising as a means of controlling editorial policies. Numerous photographs of weapons of war were distributed and published to illustrate the progress of British rearmament and the annual visit of the fleet to Alexandria was used to point the moral and adorn the tale. A great deal of publicity was also given to the activities of the British Council. 38. XXX XXX X X X X The embassy had long been considering the possibility of promoting the publication of a magazine which would aim at disseminating news and views reflecting generally to British credit.
