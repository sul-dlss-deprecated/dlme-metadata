INDIA OFFICE. (P. 6258/29.) Question of British Interference in the Administration of Bahrain. Despatch No. 385 S. of 1929, from the Hon. Lieut.-Col. C. C. J. Barrett, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Hritish Residency and Consulate-General, Sir, . Bushire, 28th August 1929. I have the honour to refer to your letter No. F. 164-N./29 of the 28th May 1929** asking me to examine the whole question of British interference in the Bahrain administration, with a view to deciding how far it is possible and expedient now to retrace the steps which have been taken. 2. The history of the development of our concern in the internal affairs of the islands is fully set forth in Lieut.-Col. Haworth’s Despatch to the Government of India, No. 295 S., of 1st September 1927,t so it is unnecessar}” to repeat it. I wish, however, to stress the following points:— (а) In 1869 we had installed Shaikh Isa as ruler of the islands, and it was entirely due to our support that he had been able to keep his position. (б) From 1877 to 1900 we attempted, with our advice, to improve internal conditions, but were most concerned about financial conditions and particularly the Customs administration. (c) From 1904, with the appointment of a British Political Agent to Bahrain after the visit of Lord Curzon, our interest in internal matters increased, and w r e continued to press Shaikh Isa with good advice. He, however, seemed more concerned with preserving his independence from us, than with conciliating us, by whom only his independence could be maintained. (d) In 1904, following on riots in which Persians and a German were concerned, and in which Shaikh Isa was first supine and then obstructive, the Viceroy, Lord Curzon, advocated vigorous measures against him, as he was “ only encouraged in his obstinacy by our continued forbearance.” The most important results of our intervention were the abolition of Shukra so far as foreigners were concerned, the banishment to Bombay of the leader of the anti-Persian riots (who was Shaikh Isa’s own nephew), and the assumption by the Political Agent of jurisdiction over foreigners. The Shaikh was reminded of his assurances to follow the advice of the Political Resident. In this case the impossibility of obtaining justice for Shiahs from the Sunni Qadhis was brought to notice. In connection with these events Major Cox reported :— “ I do not see how we can expect anything but periodical trouble from a continuation of our laudable endeavours to carry on the government of the islands through the rule of a chief who has shown himself to possess few, if any, of the qualifications necessary for the maintenance of order, the security of persons and of trade.” He was accordingly in favour of stronger measures, but His Majesty’s Government decided that the amelioration of the internal government should be sought by indirect and pacific means. (e) In 1919 Shaikh Abdulla’s interview with Sir Arthur Hirtzel showed how the P. 5649/20. Ruler chafed against the interference of the Political Agent in the matter of jurisdiction over foreigners and appointments to the Bench of Magistrates. Although the Political Agent possessed these powers, he was powerless to stop misrule. (/) The gross oppression from which the deposition of Shaikh Isa in 1923 rescued the people—especially the Baharanah, and the opening that this oppression gave to foreign nations—especially the Persians and the Wahabis. The oppression is set out in the extracts from Major Daly’s report forwarded to Government under ColonelTrevors letter, No. 23 S., dated 8th January p. 90022 . 1922. (g) Colonel Knox brought to the notice of Government that the whole management of affairs would more and more come into the hands of the Political Agent. * Not printed. t Reprinted as Enclosure No. 2 to Teheran Despatch to Foreign Office, No. 484 of 7th OctoVr IQ 07 [P.5668/27]. 4005 50 10.29o (h) W ith an uneducated Arab, independence means the power to do many tilings of which we do not approve. It means administering the islands for the sake of the Chief of the tribes, exploiting the people for the rulers, and treating the Shiahs as a people of an unprivileged class. (0 Government, and not the Political Agent, finally had to insist on threats instead of advice. (j) Shaikh Hamad is a pleasant man but weak, and it is idle to pretend he and his brothers would not backslide. To relax too much means to go through the same grind as we have come. 3. Throughout the history of Bahrain during the twentieth century, the fear of interference displayed by the Government of India is apparent. In 1904 thev decided “ to pursue a cautious policy.” Later, the Political Agent was to “seek the amelioration of the internal government by indirect and pacific means, and by gaining the confidence and trust of the Shaikh.” In 1922 they “did not desire to be drawn into interference between the Shaikh and his people.” “Government are not prepared to act until they are satisfied all local resources are exhausted.” Yet it was this Government, who were so obviously and sincerely anxious to avoid interference, which finally had to order the Political Pesident to take the steps which led to the deposition of the Ruler. They never, however, forgot their original policy, and within a couple of months are again warning the Political Agent to be on his guard against being tempted to interfere too much, or to become the administrative officer rather than the adviser. It is obvious that Government did their very best to avoid the action of 1923 ; but it was forced on them by the gross tyranny of the A1 Khalifa, whom Shaikh Isa made no attempt to restrain, and by the pressure of the London Foreign Office, fearful of the reaction in Persia of the oppression of a Shiah population, and because “misrule would be the only serious flaw in our case if the status of Bahrain and our position in the Islands was brought before the League of Nations.” 4. The point to remember now is that Shaikh Isa, the Ruler, was not bad matured at heart. Although obstinate in rejecting all advice from the Political Agents as derogatory to his position as an independent ruler, he was easy-going and had a strong dislike for interfering with the actions of members of his family even when these took the form of gross tyranny. The family—the A1 Khalifa—were uneducated savages with a veneer of town manners. The outlook of Shaikh Isa and his family was as is described in para. 2 (h) above. Now Shaikh Hamad is extremely amiable, with a constitutional disinclination to take strong measures on any subject. Even as a judge, his inclination is to acquit an obvious criminal and himself to pay a fine imposed. Such a man—except in the fact that he is younger and has seen changes taking place around him and that he is, in consequence, less conservative—is not to be differentiated from his father. Just as his father permitted oppression, but did not actively oppress, so would Hamad act. With the exception of Shaikh Khalid, all the old oppressors are still alive and willing to resume their former ways if not repressed. Shaikh Hamad would certainly not repress them if deprived of active British support and direction. To this day his weakness in any matter connected with the A1 Khalifa is pathetic. In ordinary matters also, in spite of the presence in Bahrain of a British adviser, he truckles to any show of force. In May of this year he reversed a decision he had made the previous day regarding the amount of advance to divers because a mob of 20) unarmed men made a clamour in his Majlis. It is certainly better that Shaikh Hamad should govern and make mistakes than that we should govern and make none, but a man of his type, who will not incur the odium of governing, must have an adviser. If the European adviser were removed, Shaikh Hamad would surely fall under the influence of some intriguing Syrian or Egyptian who would, for a consideration, play into the hands of Persia or Najd. It was the defencelessness of the Bahrain Government in the face of gano- robberies which led to the institution of the Indian armed police. These police had to be foreign as the Bahrain Arab was averse from wearing uniform, had an objection to an occupation iinconnected with boats, and disliked binding himself to fixed periods of duty. I he armed police are still necessary, but it may be possible to make them less obstrusively foreign by substituting Sudanese for Indians, directly the contract of the latter expires at the beginning of 1931. Owing to the large number ot clacks, descended from slaves domiciled in the islands, the Sudanese would melt into the landscape in a way the Indians fail to do. Mr. Belgrave, the present adviser to bnaikh Hamad, has experience of Sudanese, having served with them in Egypt during the war. I would have recommended that the present European Commandant106 of I ohce—whose four-year contract expires about tlie same time—should depart with ie Indian policemen at the end of 1930. In view, however, of the probability that mlirain may shortly have to submit to an influx of American and other foreign dnlJers and oil workers, f do not think it advisable to dispense with the services of a European Commandant of Police unless and until we are satisfied that the threatened invasion—which would certainly include a number of tough characters—will not take place On the analogy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the O-nlf Syndicate would probably start a security service of its own, and the Bahrain State wild' require 1 r^iT ^ 0 T ,8nda ', t of .■ Poliee t0 deal with il &gt; aml with the bad characters utt] acted by the chance of employment. t&lt;n 5 ' 1 or'-mV 0 lhe , ( i' st0 '' s Apartment. This was an old bone of contention between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. It was Colonel Mead who first Suggested bringing it under control, under the mistaken assumption that Shaikh Isa was really as poor as he pretended when the pretence suited him. In any case, the « i° f f h6 Ca, . st ?,'I s department came for a time to be looked upon as a trial of Strength between Shaikh Isa and the Government of India. i , , e - vst ® ,a '; as to farm out the Customs to a Hindu contractor and, as was onh to be expected, the revenue accruing to the Slate was much less than it should have been bis loss was estimated at one lakh of rupees a year, but judging from it I,mat i, ° i* 6 '' St0,1 m 11 * las * )eeu P ut l| ntler conscientious European control, it must have been considerably more. v P .,, C r&gt;a 0 n S -M 1-0 mai , n 6 c ource 1 ; e ,? nue to the State a “d brought in during the past \ear Ks. ll,24,bd9, out of a total of Ks. 12,15,694. =&gt; f ivl.i h n Direet0r , 0f .

UI { U u 1Ue&lt;I 7 e of au Englishman, an Egyptian might look more indigenous tlmn an Englishman, but to a resident of the Gulf he would still be a foreigner. le Customs is not a political department, and in Persia it can be staffed by foreigners without upsetting the political balance; but in a small nation like Bahrain the personality of the man who collects 90 per cent, of the revenues must count for someth,ug. As the case of the Adviser, why jettison a European, who can be tins ted, mordet to icplace him by some foreign Oriental about whose integrity and whose intrigues one can never be sure ? 6 j * C. Captain Prior, the present Political Agent at Bahrain, summed up the situation ver) well in one of Ins reports to me, when he stated that Mr. de Grenier collects the revenues of the State and Mr. Belgrave conserves them. If the efficient collector and conserve,-are removed, what is to happen to a State which has become accustomed to a far highei late of public expenditure than ever before in its history? Not onlv have the claims of the idle and ever increasing A1 Khalifa been generously met but for the first time Bahrain has been administered for the good of its people, and not merely for the benefit of its ruling family. With a decline in revenue, discontent is sure to return. If the European Adviser were removed, his place would be taken bv aa 4 ra .!Y r oi n Bahraul -- al ™ ORt certainly one of the A1 Khalifa. With the exception of Shaikh Abdulla there is at the moment not a single member of the A1 Khalifa fit either by character or education to fill (he post. Bahrain in the present day is not such a principality as those of the Trucnl Coast, slumbering in the conditions of the seventh centuiy Ihanks to its geographical situation as the gateway to Kajd and to the pear trade of which it is the centre, it has always been a trading centre, and Las ' d , t 'Y tse i a , '' nii f r °J foreigners, who are in contact with the outside world. anks to the interest taken by the Government of India in 1923, its adminisiration' once a by-word, is now the admiration of the Gulf. The more enlightened citizens cLv b bai ’ f0r lnstance - env y Pahram, though the ruling Shaikhs have no desire to L/V lb. /. It has repeatedly been saiii that Bahrain has been westernised too hurriedly It is necessary to examine this statement, for although there is a substratum of truth in it 1 think it conveys a wrong impression that all native institutions have been ruthlessly swept away. I lie reforms instituted iu or shortly before 1923 related to— (a) Municipalities. (b) Reorganisation of the Customs Department. (c) Institution of a proper police force.4 KX)/22. (d) Appointment of an Adviser to the Shaikh. (e) Reformed Courts. (f) Reforms in connection with the pearl fishery. '(g) Survey. (h) Public Works. (l) Education. (j) Reform of the Waqfs. I will take the above seriatim. (a) Before and during the war Bahrain w^as notorious for its unhealthy climate; the stench was indescribable and plague visited it every alternate year. In the course of years the people of Manama, the chief trading town, had been becoming more and more enlightened by contact with the outside world. A demand for greater cleanliness arose, and in spite of the opposition of Shaikh Isa, the demand, backed by Major Dickson (the Political Agent), prevailed and a municipality was established in 1920. This municipality still exists and in 1927 was followed l&gt;y the establishment of another in Muharraq. The two Municipal Councils—the members of which are partly nominated by the Rider and partly elected—are presided over by Shaikh Hamad’s brother. The Political Agent and the Adviser attend the meetings, but take little part in the proceedings unless asked for guidance. In 1920 a considerable part of the population looked upon the Manama municipality as an objectionable foreign innovation, but it is now recognised as a valuable portion of the administration. The Muharraq municipality was established in 1927 in consequence of popular demand, without consulting the Political Agent. People recognise that if the municipalities were abolished filth and plague would return. The benefit derived from the presence at municipal meetings of the Political Agent and the Adviser, who have no vote, is to lend a certain decorum to the proceedings, which otherwise have a tendency to become pandemonium. They do not interfere unduly, and their complete withdrawal from interest in municipal affairs would be unpopular. (b) , (c) and (d) have already been treated in paras. 1 and 5 above. (e) Major Daly’s report on the state of affairs in 1921 shows the conditions from which Bahrain was rescued. These conditions were largely due to the lack of any Court of Law which could deal efficiently with offenders. The minor members of the Khalifa family terrorised the people just as they wished. The Qadhis were corrupt or impotent. A good Court of Law was a crying need, but the difficulty was to find a suitable magistrate. At first the Political Agent (Major Daly) sat as adviser to the local magistrate, but with the arrival of Mr. Belgrave he resigned his position to the latter. At present there are the following Courts functioning in Bahrain :— 0) The Joint Court, on w r hich the Ruler and the Political Agent sit to hear cases, civil and criminal, involving foreign and Bahrain subjects in which the latter are defendants. There is also a small Joint Court presided over by the Indian Assistant and a minor A1 Khalifa. (2) The Political Agent’s Court, for the trial of all cases in which foreigners are concerned. (3) The Court of Shaikh Sulaiman, eldest son of Shaikh Hamad, assisted and advised by Mr. Belgrave, for the trial of Bahrain subjects. (4) The Small Cause Court, conducted by a minor member of the A1 Khalifa. In the first case all disputes are referred to one or other of these Courts. They usually deal themselves with criminal cases, though a considerable number are referred to the Qadhis for settlement by the taking of oath. Civil cases, almost without exception, are referred to the Qadhis, the Majlis al Urfi or the Salifah Court for opinion. Judgment usually follows the opinion. The indigenous Courts are :— (a) The Court of the Qadhis—Sunni or Shiah as the case may be. (b) The Majlis al Urfi. (c) The Salifah or Diving Court. The Qadhis are the usual Islamic Courts having jurisdiction in all personal matters, divorces, inheritances, &amp;c. They often advise in criminal matters, but their peculiar laws of evidence and the sharp differences between Shiah and Sunni make it impossible to hand criminal justice completely over to them. The Majlis al Urfi is the Court dealing with the customary law of trade. It is the commercial Court and all disputed commercial cases are referred to it. There are20 members. Its meetings are weekly—10 members sitting on alternate Thursdays* under an Al Khalifa president. It deals with trade disputes, on the whole expeditiously and well. Its members ate all appointed by Shaikh Hamad subject, in the case of foreign members, to the Political Agent’s veto. The Salifah consists of three Arab experts versed in the customary law relating to diving. Before 1923 this Court consisted of one venal old man, whose decisions were a disgrace to the State. Now, except for a bias against foreigners, it functions satisfactorily. From this description it will be seen that except in the Court of the Political Agent— established under the Order in Council—a member of the Al Khalifa is associated with all the proceedings of justice. Fven the Political Agent’s Court refers many matters for native opinion and advice. As already stated, the Al Khalifa are uneducated and ignorant, and it would be impossible for them to manage affairs without the support given them by the Political Agent or the Adviser. Both Shaikh Hamad—when he can be aroused to interest him- self-—and his son, Sulaiman, on all occasions, are excellent in dealing with cases demanding local knowledge; but as they themselves confess, they would not pass sentences of death or take action against prominent men without the support of their advisers. In the course of time Shaikh Sulaiman may get sufficient courage to stand on his own feet. A successor will be trained to take his place when he succeeds his father in the rulership or gets tired of his magisterial work. (f) Before 1923 the divers were wholly in the hands of their nakhudas and the merchants, who worked through the single venal member of the Salifah. Now a proper system of accounts has been established and, thanks to the supervision of the Courts over the Salifah, the divers have very little cause for complaint. Their lot, from being the worst, has become the best in the Gulf. (g) Bahrain, in addition to town sites, has an extensive area under gardens. It was found that Shaikh Isa, as Lord of the Soil, in his happy-go-lucky way, had frequently sold or gifted the same area to two or even three different persons. The result was innumerable disputes, which could only be terminated by careful enquiry followed by an accurate survey. A survey of all towns and of certain village areas followed. At first the survey of villages was resented, as people could not understand the reason for it, but now they have come to realise its benefits. Those villages which have not hitherto been surveyed, owing to paucity of staff, have begun to demand that a survey should be carried out immediately. (h) Public works have not been numerous, and there is no regular Public Works Department; but public utility works, such as the sea wall and the road alongside it, are much appreciated. One of the results of these works is that the inhabitants of Kuwait and other ports are apt to point to the deficiencies of their home towns and get into trouble with their Shaikhs, but the leaven works. If Bahrain continues on his own initiative to supply public gardens and walks, start electric schemes and carry out works for the public benefit, such as the proposed causeway from Manama to Muharraq, it is sure, by its example, to ameliorate the conditions' in its lesser advanced sisters on the Arab coast, and wean ihem from that surly isolation in which most of them live. 1 mention “on its own initiative ” because all public utility schemes—except the Manama sea wall and road, which are the work of Major Daly—were conceived by Bahrain subjects themselves, though they have looked to their European advisers for guidance. The British name is benefited by this progress. (i) Education is still backward, but thanks to the push of Shaikh Abdulla, the Ruler’s brother, it has made immense strides during the past two years. The drive in this case has come wholly from Bahrain subjects themselves Except in the matter of making hitherto fruitless efforts to persuade Shaikh Hamad to educate his own sons, neither the Political Agent nor the Adviser has taken any steps unduly to push education, although their services in obtaining masters from Iraq have been put at the service of the State when asked. Syrian and Iraqi masters have been imported in most cases without the intervention of the Political Agent or Adviser, at good salaries, and there are now five indigenous Arabic boys’ schools and one girls’ school on the island, in addition to two Persian nationalist schools. In addition, eight Bahrain boys, including three close relations of the Ruling Chief, have been sent to the American University at Beirut for education. I trust that these three boys will turn out well, and with Shaikh Mubarak—the most promising of the sons of Shaikh Hamad—will provide material for the higher0 appointments in the State, and ultimately will prove competent to take over the position now held by the Kuropean Adviser and Customs Director. (j) Waqfs are eminently a religious matter in which it behoves foreigners, especially non-Muslims, to walk very warily. Just before his departure, Major Daly, moved by certain bad scandals, attempted to take action to reform the Waqfs, but his successor decided it would be best not to interfere and to trust to the public opinion that was being stirred by the liberal policy of the State. The policy of non-interference appears to be justifying itself. Recently the Shiahs themselves appointed a committee which took over their Waqfs from the Qadhi. If the Sunnis follow' suit, large sums now pocketed by the Qadhis may become available for primary education. S. I have examined the present conduct of affairs in Bahrain and 1 see nothing that can be profitably altered at the present moment. Innovations which met with opposition in l ( J2.&gt; are now accepted as the ordinary scheme of things; and the Bahrain merchants look forward to the development of air communication under British auspices. The unpopularity of the British Government, which was worked up in the Arabic and other Rress, has now disappeared and their good works are appreciated. In time the good works and the tyranny from which the British rescued Bahrain, and especially the Shiah Baharanah, will be forgotten, and only the privileged position of the British occupying the chief posts will be noticed. To avoid the odium which would fall on Britain, in course of time, from this cause, it is necessary to educate natives of Bahrain to take the place of the British ollicials. 9. Captain Prior, Political Agent at Bahrain, thinks that a useful understudy for Mr. de Grenier offers in Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim al Khalifa—at present a third- year student at the American University in Beirut. He has industiy, but unfortunately no great aptitude for arithmetic. Captain Prior thinks, however, that when he has completed his course at Beirut he might be sent to India for training in the Customs Department at Bombay or Karachi, before being appointed to the Bahrain Customs with a view eventually to taking over charge. I consider Captain Prior’s proposal very sound and recommend it for adoption. If Abdulla bin Shaikh Ibrahim’s indifferent arithmetic is a bar to the efficient performance of his duties, one of his younger cousins—Shaikh Khalifa bin Shaikh Mahomed or Shaikh Hamad bin Shaikh Abdulla, nephews of the present Deputy Ruler —who are first-year students, might later be selected for training. 10. There remains the question of a successor to the Adviser. Although Government do not appear to desire the immediate removal of Mr. Belgrave, this question must be considered. Shaikh Hamad, the Deputy Ruler, is an amiable nonentity. Captain Prior, in alluding to his weakness and the impossibility of allowing him to stand on his own feet, has stated truly: “ So long as he can enjoy the pleasures of the harem, get shooting and hawking, and enough money to support him with a little pomp and pride of h iace, he does not mind what happens to Bahrain.” Such a man must have an adviser on whom he can lean. His natural adviser is his eldest son, Sulaiman, age about 35, who will probably succeed him. Sulaiman is not without promise; he is intelligent and is gaining valuable experience on the magisterial bench, but he is uneducated and in some ways little removed from a Bedu. The only really capable member of the Al Khalifa family is Shaikh Hamad’s brother, Abdulla, who is self-educated, but is unfortunately distrusted by the people owing to his previous evil record. Of Shaikh Hamad’s sons the one who shows most promise is Shaikh Mubarak, the fourth son. In my letter Xo. 36(5 S. of 21st August 1929 I have already recommended that a good tutor should be obtained for him. It is hoped that in due course he may be given a chance to acquire administrative experience so as to be a help first to his father and then to his brother, Sulaiman, who has no son to follow after him, and that he may in due course be able to perform the functions now falling to the Kuropean Adviser. 11. With the spread of education it should be possible to conduct the adminis tration of Bahrain without any British interference in interna) affairs in a manner which will not shame us. At present, owing to the weakness of the Deputy Ruler and the lack of men of suitable character, this is impossible.of the European Commandant of Police be dispensed with at the termination of his- present contract, but that the services of the Adviser and the Director of Customs be retained until suitable Arab substitutes have been trained to take their place. 16. Shaikh Hamad has already extended the term of the Advisor’s contract till March 1934. It will probably be necessary to grant him at least two further quaternary extensions. i ^ • It is difficult to say when a substitute will be ready to replace Mr. de Grenier ; but the period required for training cannot be less than seven years from now. 17. As the coming of an oil company is still problematical, 1 have not discussed this matter at length. If the company should materialise it will of itsell westernise the islands in possibly an unfortunate way, and I presume there would have to be a British element in the administration to counteract its effects. 18&lt;It appears from para. 2 of your letter under reply that Government is purturbed at the danger that, with the example of Bahrain before their eyes, the minds of the smaller Arab rulers may be turned increasingly in the direction of Bin Saud. It is true that the Shaikhs of the Trucial Coast are extremely jealous of any British encroachment on their independence, just as Shaikh Isa was beiore his Jorced relinquishment of [power. They oppose any concession to the European. 1 do not, however, ascribe this attitude wholly to the events in Bahrain. It is due far more to the natural exclusiveness of the Arab. A certain section of Arab thought would exclude the foot of the infidel throughout the holy land of Arabia, from Aden as well as from Mecca. No attempt had been made to westernise Bahrain when the Hyacinth episode of 1911 occurred. It is from this incident and the comparative immunity from evil consequences enjoyed by the people of Dubai that I date the increasingly independent attitude of the Trucial Shaikhs. Sir Percy Cox stated at the time that the incident furnished a convenient peg on which the Shaikh of Dubai could hang his objections to the admission of Europeans to the coast, flis statement was true in 1911 and is true to this day ; but the British policy in Bahrain obviously cannot be blamed for this. If we interfere in Bahrain to put down misrule, depose its Shaikh, introduce reforms and then permit the country to sink back into the slough from which we have rescued it, then indeed will we have forfeited Arab respect and cleared the way for Bin Saud. In 1920, Major Dickson reported : “ Our position in the island is founded on fear and not respect.” Now it is founded on respect. The Trucial Chiefs now see that our intervention has benefited Bahrain and even its Chiefs. We cannot expect them immediately to call in British advisers on their own account, but in time- their aversion from contact with the European may be overcome through the influence of a civilised Bahrain. It will not be overcome through a reversion of Bahrain to the conditions of 1920. If it suits Bin Sand, he will intrigue in Oman as his lathers did before him. The attitude of the Shaikhs of the coast will be guided by self-interest as it ha* ever been. If we have consistently and with success espoused their cause against Persia and Najd they will look to us for support. If we have shown no great energy in supporting their case against third parties, they will be discouraged and more easily succumb to Najd intrigue. If Bin Saud emerges victorious from his present troubles, it is possible that he will seek to extend his influence on the coast and cause us trouble as Heza Shah has in Persia ; but 1 do not see how the situation in Bahrain will affect the issue. All Arabs criticised our action in Bahrain when the supporters of the old regime were crying out under chastisement, bhe chastisement was salutary and Shaikh Isa s supporters have accepted the present regime, which is not unduly westernised. I have shown some ways in which the outward form may be modified while retaining the spirit, but I do not advise the jettisoning of useful European officials nor the taking of any steps other than those I have indicated. 19. 1 am much indebted to Captain Prior, now Political Agent at Bahrain, for a long report, on which, and my own experience of the islands during periods extending over two and a half years, I have based these observations.
