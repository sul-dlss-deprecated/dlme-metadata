A NOTE ON COMMUNICATIONS AND IRRIGATION IN THE PERSIAN PROVINCE OF ARABSSTAN. 1. On the assumption that Mesopotamia remains under British control and that the Port of Basra becomes a British Possession, a new aspect is given to the various schemes for developing, in British interests, the province of Arabistan. The Mesopotamia Trade Commission have dealt fully with the subject of British trade in Persia in their report, and in this note it is proposed to discuss in greater detail the questions of communications and cultivation. I cannot claim to any originality, except in respect to the proposals to make Basra the principal port of Arabistan, and, indeed, of Persia, and to abandon the Karun river for navigation purposes. I have travelled through the country and inspected the Karun river between Mohammerah and Shushter, but for the details of the country and river and the proposals for irrigation I am indebted to the valuable report drawn up by Major Morton, B.E., in 1907, and to other literature on the subject. 2. The note is accompanied by the following plans and photos (i) Survey map of Arabistan, shewing the course of the Karun river, and the Shatt-el-Arab as far as Basra. (ii) Reproduction to a reduced scale of Major Morton’s survey and sections of the Ahwaz rapids. (Hi) Photographs taken by myself of the Ahwaz rapids and of the remains of the old Sassanian weir. (iv) Reproduction to a reduced scale of Major Morton’s general scheme for irrigating the left bank of the Karun. (v) Photographs taken by myself of the old dam and bridge of Shushter. GENERAL DESCRIPTION. 3. Arabistan is potentially one of the richest provinces of Persia, and consists of alluvial plains through which run the Karun river and its affluents. The chief products of the country are dates, wheat, barley, rice, and a certain amount of cotton. The country was at one time irrigated throughout its length and breadth, and must have vied in prosperity with Mesopotamia. The principal towns are Mohammerah, the seaport, with 12,000 inhabitants ; Ahwaz, 4,000 inhabitants ; Shushtar, 10,000 ; and Bizful 15 000. COMMUNICATIONS. 4. The communications throughout the country are bad. There are no good roads, and navigation vid the Karun river is broken by the rapids a^ Ahwaz and Cl05(w)AD2 liable to interruption in the low-water season owing to the shallowness of the river. There are caravan routes to Shushter and Dizful; and by the Bakhtiari or Lynch’s road, opened in 1901 (which is but little better than the ordinary caravan route) from Ahwaz to Isfahan—a distance of 257 miles, with cost of transport at present rates between £90 and £110 per ton. A railway has been projected and partially surveyed between Mohammerah and Khorammabad via Ahwaz, Shushter and Dizful; and there have recently been prepared, the plans and estimates for a road between Ahwaz and Isfahan as an alternative route to the Bakhtiari road, and the new road would, in the first place, be made available for motor transport and ultimately be converted into a railway. 5. Sea communication with the province is via the Shatt-el-Arab river and the port of Mohammerah, but there is no port accommodation and vessels lie in the Shatt-el-Arab river and discharge or take in goods by means of lighters plying to and from the shore. ° ° The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has given a considerable impetus to trade, as all the plant and machinery for the oilfields has been landed at Mohammerah and carried up country by river and road. THE KARUN RIVER. f , Aon f Tl 7 SeS , in A 6 m0untains of the Bakhtiari country at a height 0 abo'.e sea level, and about 100 miles due west of Isfahan and enters the plains of Arabistan some 20 miles north of Shushter which a An b about 30 miles in a direct line nearly due north of Ahwaz. About a quartei of a rmle above Shushter the Karun divides into two streams, the Ab-i-Gargar o the east, and the Ab-i-Shatait to the west. Thirty miles south of Shushter the two branches re-umte at the village of Band-i-Qir, and here the Karun riw resumes its course under its own name and is joined on its right bank by its main affluen the Ab-HDiz. From Band-i-Qir the river runs in * straight channel to tne village of Wais, a distance of 11 miles; and thence, with many bends to Ahwaz—31 miles distapt by river, and 16 miles by road. At Ahwaz are the rapids formed by two main lines of tertiary sandstone rock a contmuation at a lower level of a range of sandstone hills the higher n art J wkch end a short distance from the eastern bank of the river nearly opposite Ahwaz. The rapids terminate at the lower end of a small island called Ihe Umm U ’ ^ ] bei0,y them &gt; 011 the ieft bank, is situated the village of Nasiri. series ° 0f b - ds - d 15 miles by road, it resumes a more ordinary course. 7 “ and Tnere nas been considerable controversv es to tie , ■ ■ . .

The river begins to rise about the middle of November, and to fall from the middle or end of April. The maximum flood discharge at Ahrvaz is 212,000 cusecs, and the minimum discharge 4,600 cusecs ; whilst the difference between maximum flood level and minimum low-water is 26 feet below the Ahwaz rapids, and 20'4 feet above the rapids. IRRIGATION. 9. The remains of ancient irrigation works are to be found in many parts of the province, and schemes have been discussed for the restoration of the headworks at Shushter and Ahwaz. These projects I will briefly describe. Shisshtef. As stated in the description of the Karun river, there is a bifurcation above Shushter where the river divides into two streams, the Ab-i-Gargar and the Ab-i- Shatait. The Ab-i-Gargar is, in part, an artificial channel cut through sandstone cliffs a hundred feet high, and where it takes off from the Karun a weir with crest about low-water level was constructed, in the reign of Shapur, having 6 sluices for the passage of water. Half a mile below this weir is a massive dam called the Pul-i- Bulaiti extending up to above high-water level and surmounted by a good roadway, which carries the road from Shuster to all places east of it. At each side of the dam are bye-passes through which water is conveyed to drive water-wheels for flour mills below the dam. Of these, there were, on the occasion of my visit, 30 in working order, and although the wheels themselves are extraordinarily primitive they seemed to answer their purpose. It is said that if modern turbines were installed, there would be sufficient water-power to work all the machinery at the oil-fields, and to light by electricity the town of Shushter in addition to grinding its corn. The Ab-i-Shatait was the old Karun before the Ab-i-Gargar was cut, and immediately below the castle the Minau canal takes off and in olden times irrigated a great part of the island between the Ab-i-Gargar and the Ab-i-Shatait. A little distance below this canal are the remains of a combined bridge and weir called the Bund-i-Mizan in respect to the weir, and the Pul-i-Dizful in respect to the bridge, but commonly known as Valerian’s bridge owing to a legend that it was built by the Emperor Valerian when a prisoner in the hands of the Persians. The dam was originally 9 feet above low-water and the bridge was 570 yards long with 41 arches, the whole forming a magnificent engineering work ; the dam seems to have given constant trouble, as the records shew that it was repaired in 1310 and 1840 : the last attempt, in 1889, was unsuccessful, and now there is a gap about 200 feet in breadth, whilst very deep holes have been scoured in the river bed in the vicinity. Since the breach, the Minau canal has naturally fallen into disuse, as the raison d'etre of the dam was undoubtedly to force water down the canal, and the cultiva tion of the rich lands between the Ab-i-Gargar and the Shatait has practically ceased. For further details of these most interesting works, I invite a refer ence to Lord Curzon’s t£ Persia,” wherein they are most graphically described and the question is argued as to the order in which the various works were con structed.4 From the ulitarian point of view there is no doubt that the prosperity ot the province would be much enhanced by the irrigation and cultivation of the 270 square miles contained within the Myanab island, and whether this could best be achieved by repairing the broken bund or building a new one in another position can only be ascertained when the proposals have been examined in detail by a competent engineer. Ahwaz. 10. At Ahwaz, on the line of one of the shelves of rock which form the rapids, can be seen the remains of the massive weir built in the time of the Sassanians and, above the weir, the old canals are easily traceable. Major Morton’s scheme, which has been examined and reported on favourably by Sir John Benton, late Inspector General of Irrigation, comprises the irrigation of some 300,000 acres on the left bank of the Karun below Ahwaz, as shewn on plan reproduced herewith, and he proposes to build a masonry dam more or less on the site of the old Sassanian dam ; whilst in order to maintain navigation in the low- water season, he proposes to close the canal from about the 7th of October to the middle of January if necessary, or, alternatively, to abandon river transport and build a railway from Mohammerah to Ahwaz. In this connexion he remarks, that if navigation on the lower Karun were abandoned those who owned steamers would find compensation for their loss in other ways, and that a canal on the line of railway would open up the country to an extent which would never be possible with the present state of affairs. In my tour of the country I was much impressed by its possibilities, once the irrigation systems were restored ; and in the matter of navigation, it is an axiom that if water is wanted for irrigation, navigation must give way, and in the new circumstances which have arisen, I should have no hesitation in taking up, if necessary, the whole of the low-water supply of the Karun at Ahwaz. NAVIGATION. 11. The Karun is described m ah the textbooks as the only navigable river m Persia, and one conjures up visions of a deep, broad river up which steamers of considerable size and draught can navigate with speed and safety. The reality is unfortunately, the very reverse of the vision: the river is only navigable from Mohammerah as far as Bandar Nasiri where the rapids begin, and in the flood season the current is so swift as to make upward progress very slow whilst in the low-water season, which is also the busy season, the numerous sandbanks and shallows have rendered navigation to Ahwaz most difficult, and at tim.es impossible for vessels of over 3 feet draught. From Ahwaz to above the rapids it is possible to navigate a very shallow draught \ essel as far as Dhelalieh, 6 miles below Shushter ; and it is said that the Shatait is also navigable for some distance from Band-i-Qir. There was great competition among the European nations 75 years ago for the privilege of navigating This avenue of expeditious approach to the great cities and^centres of corn cultivation in the west of Persia,” to quote Lord Curzon’s Persia , and when in 18S9 the lower Karun was thrown open to navigation? tie Persian Go\ernment, to the mercantile marine of all countries, it was5 considered a triumph for British diplomacy and hopes were entertained of a large increase of British trade with Persia, as a British company (the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company) promptly started a service of river steamers on the lower Karun and maintained a steamer, on behalf of the Persian Govern ment, from Ahwaz to Shelalieh. The steamer service cannot be said to have been a success, either as a commercial undertaking or in assisting the development of the country, because in addition to the difficulties of navigation and competition withmahelas or country boats, the Persian Government’s restrictions on trade and their river regulations, imposed a serious burden on the company. The breaking of bulk at Nasiri, below the rapids, also militated against efficiency ; and the cost of conveying goods from Nasiri to Ahwaz, including handling charges, has been about 9 krans a ton. Suggestions have been made at various times for improving the river by making a lock channel throuh the rapids, but the scheme was rejected by Major Morton, and, I think, rightly so, as from my personal inspection of the river I am satisfied that, except at enormous cost, it would be impracticable to effect material im provements. PROPOSALS FOR IMPROVED COMMUNICATIONS. 12. If Basra is developed in accordance with the views expressed by me in a separate report, and the bar at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab dredged to permit of the passage of deep-draught steamers, I am strongly of the opinion that the development of Arabjstan could be hastened by making Basra the principal port and abandoning Mohammerah. The advantages are obvious :— ^ (i) When large deep-draught ships can come up the Shatt-el-Arab, they will not wish to use Mohammerah, as shipowners object to the loss of time caused by stoppage at small subsidiary ports. (n) The conservancy of the Shatt-eL-Arab and the administration of the Port of Basra will, presumably, be under one authority, and the maintenance of a subsidiary independent port will lead to compli cated questions in respect to port and river conservancy dues, etc., etc. These are, of course, capable of adjustment, but it is generally found more satisfactory to concentrate trade in one port, especially when the two are so close together as Basra and Mohammerah. (Hi) At Basra a depot for Persia can be established on the left bank of the river and goods discharged from or received into sea-going steamers, either alongside a wharf or in the stream as may be most convenient. 13. The question that next arises is the disposal of the goods for Persia after they have been landed at Basra, and, under the existing circumstances, they would be transhipped into river steamers whose headquarters would be at Basra, and taken down the ShatGel-Arab and thence up the Karun river to Ahwaz. I am of opinion that a preferable and cheaper means of transport would be by means of a railway from Basra to Ahwaz, a distance of 80* miles, across a flat plain, as indicated on the plan accompanying this report, with branch lines through irrigated tracts as may be found necessary. From Ahwaz the goods would be transhipped, either by river or rail, to the interior of Arabistan and beyond.6 At present the procedure for the despatch of goods from Mohammerah to, say, the oilfields, is as follows :— (a) Overside from the steamer lying in the stream to a barge, and thence to Mohammerah. (b) From Mohammerah to Nasiri (below Ahwaz) by country boat or river steamer. (c) From Nasiri to Ahwaz by tramway or by mules. (d) Ahwaz to Dharra Khazina by steamer or country boat. (e) Dharra Khazina to the oilfields by pack animal transport. 14. By rail, goods could be placed from the steamer's hatch on to a railway wagon at Basra, conveyed to Ahwaz and thence taken all the way to the fields by road, or by river and road, as might be found most convenient. It may here be noted that the dam across the river at Ahwaz proposed by Major Morton would greatly improve navigation as far as Shushter. As the country developed, there would be a great export trade in grain, cotton,, sugar, etc., and the left bank of the river at Basra would, in time, develop as Karachi has developed, with wharves and cranes, or grain elevators. Further, with the building of the proposed new motor road to Isfahan and its ultimate conversion into a railroad, and the building of a railway from Ahwaz to Dizful, Basra would become the chief port and great distributing centre for the whole of South Western Persia, and a large goods trade and an equally large passenger trade would be assured. NECESSITY FOR SURVEYS. 15. It must be understood that the foregoing remarks are made subject to their confirmation or otherwise when detailed surveys have been executed. As in Mesopotamia, so in Arabistan, the first requirements are engineering surveys of the country and its examination by a committee of experts. DRAWBACK TO THE SCHEMES. 16. The drawback to these schemes is that they affect an independent sovereign state, which may object to the development of the country and the institution of a foreign town such as Basra for its principal port ; and discussion on this phase I must leave to the Political department. I am satisfied as to the: economic advantages of the proposals and their effect on British trade. Simla ; The 10th September 1917- GEORGE C. BUCHANAN, G. M.
