Line to use the aerodromes at Koweit ana Yas Island. As to Yes Island, the Air Council vwula point out that its use by Dutch civil aircraft would be contrary to the policy advocated in Memorandum 15, numely, Uiat facilities on the Trucial Coast should not be open to foreign air lines and that the alternative route via Bahrein ana Gwadar should be followed. It will be within the recollection of the Foreign Office that this ms the view both of the India Office and the admiralty, am the Council trust that the answer to the Dutch Governaant will make it clear that no facilities at Yus Island can be afforded. As regards Kowelt, the Air Council desire to observe that the fulfilment of the Treaty obligations of H.M. Government to afford protection to the itoeikh of Koweit has in recent years involved Air Force intervention for tiie purpose of repelling incursions from the Seudlm kingdom, which had reached as far as the walls of Koweit town itself. The Air Council accordingly consider that it would be essential that any consent for the use of the aerodrome/ The Unaer secretary of state.

Ilxe Air Council would further prefer that the question of even a limited use of Kowelt aerodrome by Dutch civil aircraft should be deferred until the connection which has been very lately established there by Imperial Airways naa been further consolidated, would It not, that is to say, be possible to send a reply to the Dutch Minister to the effect that as his Government, since the date of the request contained in his letter of deptember 24th, has received permission to continue to use the Persian Coast, H.M.

In reply to Foreign Office letter of 28th September, No»E.4950/98/91, on the subject of the grant of facilities to the Netherlands civil aircraft on the Arab air route, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to say that he agrees with the Air Council (Air ministry letter No.S.31454/S.6 of the 7th November to the Foreign Office) -as to the objection to the grant of any facilities to Dutch civil aircraft at Yas Island. Yas is on trie strategical air route well south of the specified line along which Dutch aircraft will be required to fly and the grant of facilities there to the Dutch Government would be inconsistent with the view underlying the note to the hatch Legation of 31st August last, viz. that it is undesirable to admit foreigners to the trucial area so long as this can be avoided. 2, The position as regards Koweit is slightly complicated by the fact that at the request of the Sheikh and to meet his convenience Imperial Airways have agreed to pay occasional calls. In principle, however, the oeci elar}' of State, while he recognises that the maintenance of our traditional policy of exclusion may become more difficult The Under Secretary of State, FOREIGN OFFICE* inin these areas as time goes on, is averse from granting facilities at Koweit, at any rate in present conditions, to Dutch or other foreign aircraft. As the Air Council point out in the Air Ministry letter of 7th November, it may he difficult to guarantee the use in all circumstances of the existing air facilities. Koweit is not at present a regular stopping point on the British civil air route, and the Secretary of State would suggest that the reply to the Dutch Government might be that his Majesty’s Government regretted that facilities could not at this stage be granted at Koweit and that, as they were possibly not aware, it was not a regular stopping point on the Imperial Airways service. 3 , On a further point raised in the penultimate paragraph of the Air Ministry letter of 7th November, Sir Samuel Hoare fears that the Dutch may be anxious no exploit the Arabian route so far as possible and that, even trough they may have received permission from the Persian Government for the use for a further period of the South Persian route, they may nevertheless wish to make use ot the alternative air route along the Arabian Coast of the Gulf, at any rate to some extent. But he is disposed to agree with the nir Council that, if Sir J.Simon sees no objection, it might_ be desirable in replying to the Dutch to enquire whether, since it is now understood that they have received an extension from the Persian Government, they desire us to proceed further with the question of facilities generally (and not merely at Koweit) on the Arab siae of the irulf. 4 .

Sir, '/ith reference to Foreign Office letter No. 13 6451/98/91 of the 29th December, 1932, regarding the question of the possible grant of facilities for Netherlands aircraft along the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you, to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare, the accompanying copy of a further note from the Netherlands Minister, from which it will be seen that the Royal Dutch Air Transport Company still desire to obtain the facilities in question. 2. In view of the repetition of this request, Sir John Simon considers that, subject to the concurrence of Sir Samuel Hoare, an application on behalf of the Netherlands Government should now be made to the Shaikh of Bahrain in accordance with the offer made in paragraph 8 of the note df the 31st August to the Netherlands Minister, a copy of which was sent to the India Office under cover of Foreign Office letter No. E 4359/ 3307/65 of the 2nd September. 3.

I have the honour in accordance with instructions received to inform you that nothwithstanding that there is every appearance that the Persian Government will grant the permission to fly along the Persian coast of the Persian Gulf to each peroplane separately, the Dutch Air Transport Company would greatly appreciate if they coult obtain the facilities along the Arab coast and to use the same aerodromes as Imperial Airways as requested in my note of 24th September last No,1359. The measure taken a few weeks ago by the Persian Government regarding customs examination causes so much hindrance to the regular air service between Amsterdam and Batavia that the desirability and even the necessity could present themselves to transfer the service to the Arab Coast.

(Copy sent to India) FOREIGN OFFICE,S.W.l. ( E 506/11/91) 11th March, 1933. IMPORTANT . My dear Gilbert, With reference to your official letter P.Z.231/33 of the 25th January, enclosing a copy of the draft agreement between Imperial Airways and the Shaikh of Bahrain, I sendyou, as arrange* i by telephone, a written statement of our views, in order that, as you hove suggested, the matter may be discussed at an inter departmental meeting. We agree with you that it will be necessary as a first step to have such a meeting without a representative of Imperial Airways. 2. In the first place, there is one general point which interests us, namely that the agreement should be in line with the International Air Navigation Convention of 1919 and should allow no undue discrimination against foreign aircraft. This raises the general question of the position of Bahrain in respect of international conventions. At the moment we are sitting on the fence: on the one hand, Bahrain is not a British protected State, in the sense that the Malay States, for instance are; so the Air Convention cannot be said to apply already to Bahrain under Article 40. On the other hand, it seems doubtful whether we should be prepared to regard Bahrain as sufficiently independent to accede to the Convention as a separate State under Article 41. (For convenience of reference, I attach copies of this and other texts referred to in this letter). I understand that the India Office consider that the present rather vague position of the Persian Gulf Shaikhdoms in respect of inter- nat iona 1 / J. G. Laithwaite, Esq4./ - 2 - internationr;! conventions should be maintained, if possible, and though I am personally very doubtful as to how long it will be possible to go on without defining the situation more clearly, we do not want - at any rate for the moment - to dissent from this view. But obviously it will only increase the risk of the Butch or others raising the question of Bahrain’s being or becoming a party to the Air Convention if Bahrain makes an agreement with Imperial Airways which is not in harmony with its provisions. 3. On the same general ground we feel strongly that it would be unwise to allow Bahrain to make any agreement with Imperial Airways which involved undue discrimination against foreign aircraft. In addition, we know that the Butch contemplate using Bahrain for their air services, and we have already told the Hetheelands Minister (in paragraph 8 of our note of the 31st August,1932s copies to India Office and Air Ministry in Foreign Office letter E 4359/3307/65 of the 2nd September) that we anticipate that Bahrain will have no objec tion to Netherlands aircraft enjoying there facilities similar to those granted to Imperial Airways. vie think therefore that it is necessary to consider whether the draft agreement with Imperial Airways - more particularly Article 15 and your suggestions regarding Article 16 - squares with the relevant provisions - e.g*, Article 24 - of the International Air Convention, and, if not, what changes are necessary. Ufe also think that, both on general grounds and in view of what we have said to the Butch, it would be a mistake to allow the Bahrain Government to give Imperial Airways a specially privileged position, about which the Butch or other foreign companies could subsequently aomplain with some show of justification, ever if it were possible for the Bahrain Government to do so without running directly counter to the Air Convention.-3- 4. There are also one or two points which we should like to raise on the draft itself. They are as follows: Preamble : We think that it would be unnecessary and unwise to insert, as you suggest, the words 'with the approval of His Majesty’s Government”. To do so might lay us open to the accusation of interference with the independence of Bahrain to an extent not warranted by the treaty position; and the addition of these words does not in itself confer 0 n us any power of control, which none the less can in practice be satisfactorily exercised through the Political Resident. Article 3 : It is not clear whether the choice of aerodromes is to be left to the Company throughout the duration of the agreement or whether at some moment they are to take a definite decision between the two. The wording of Article 3 seems to support the first theory, the opening words of Article 15 rather support the second. Article 4 and others : 'Aircraft”: It is not clear throughout whether reference is being made to aircraft of the Company or ( in view of the Company being managers of the aerodrome) to all aircraft. Article 6 : tie concur in the amendment proposed in your covering letter. Articles 8 and 9 : Certain provisions with regard to the exemption of aircraft in transit,etc.,from customs duties have been inserted in the bilateral air navigation conventions which we have concluded with other countries. At the same time, it is worth noting that the Government of the Sudan, in allowing Italian air transport companies to use their territories for air services at the recommendation of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom under the provisions of the Anglo-Italian Conven tion of May 16, 1931, respecting Air Transport Services, only did so/-4- so with the reservation that Italian companies would not be entitled in the Sudan to customs exemption for spare parts, fuel and oil carried and used on their aircraft, even though this reservation was qualified by a statement that Italian companies would not receive loss favourable treatment as to customs duties than British or Egyptian companies. The Sudan Government objected, I believe, to customs exemptions on much the same ground as that now advanced by Bahrain, and we agree with the India Office that it would be reasonable that the customs concession should be limited to the petrol and oil imported for refuelling. Articles 12 and 13 ; We concur in the India Office views. Article 15 i (a) line 2 ; 'the aerodromes that may be used by civil aircraft' 1 . The general position with regard to aerodromes is not clear (see my remarks under Article 3 above) and, as the agreement is to last for eleven years, this phrase might with advantage be made more precise. At present it might apparently include the Royal Air Force aerodrome. The remainder of the /-rticle and the various proposals regarding Article 16 require examination in the light of the views exx^ressed in paragraphs 2 and 3 above. 5. I am sending a copy of this letter to Shelmerdine in the letter of ’which I enclose a copy. Yours ever, (Sgd.) G.W.Rendel. • • • • •• • • * Copy.

It appears to the Council, however, that as Monsieur de Marees van 3winderen has now applied for facilities along the Arab Coast and for the use of the same aerodromes as Imperial Airways, it is probable that the application relates not only to Bahrain and Gwadur but also to Kuwait and possibly to Yas Island and Shargah. Having regard to the fact that Imperial Airways have now been operating over this route for some months, it may be difficult to maintain the attitude taken in paragraph 9 of the reply sent to the Netherlands Minister on the 31st August last. The Council would accordingly be glad to learn whether Sir John Simon is content for the present to avoid mentioning Kuwait and the intermediate stage between Bahrain and Gwadur. Another point to which the Council desire to refer is the need/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, Downing street, s.w.l.- 2 - need for the Royal Butch Air Transport Company to consult Imperial Airways as to the conditions under which they would make use of the facilities which have been provided for the latter Company, Imperial Airways have in the past suffered from the Dutcl Air Line being willing to take full advantage of the facilities provided on/the Persian Coast route by the British Government and Imperial Airways themselves but shewing no disposition to make adequate payment for their use. For example, the Council understand that the practice of the Dutch Company is to appoint a native local agent of no standing in order to evade payment to Imperial Airways of agency fees. In order to safeguard the interests of Imperial Airways, the Council consider that permission to use the facilities provided on the Arab Coast route should be subject to satis factory arrangements being made between the two Companies, Copies of this letter have been sent to the India Office, Colonial Office, Admiralty and Treasury.

Proposed extension of the Italian air service between Home and Basra to Bangkok. ir, j I am directed by the Secretary of State to enclose copy / of a letter from the Foreign Office covering copy of a note / received from the Italian Ambassador dated 10th January, 1940, stating that the Italian Ala Littoria Company is considering the extension of the present Rome-Basra air service to Bangkok, across Iran and India, and enquiring whether His Majesty^ Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India have any objection to Italian aircraft operating this service flying over and landing on the routes indicated in the Note, A copy of an interim reply which has been sent to the Foreign Office stating that the Government of India is being / consulted in the matter, and recommending that permission should not be given for an Italian air service to operate along the / Arab Coast route, is also enclosed. I am to request that Lord Zetland may be informed as soon as possible whether the Government of India are willing to accord facilities for the operation of the proposed service across India and, if so, whether they agree that the permit to be given on their behalf to the Italian Government might take the form of the attached draft which, save for Clause 2 - the inclusion of which is explained in the following paragraph - follows the permit communicated to the German Government in April last in respect of the operation of a German air service across India, suitably modified in view of the fact that Italy is a party to the International Convention for Air Navigation, 3.919. As regards Clause 2 of the proposed permit, I am to invite reference to the Anglo-Italian Convention of December 7th, 1924, relating to the Establishment of Air Transport Lines, to which * India was a party in view of the inclusion of Aden among the places mentioned in Article 4, which, it was agreed, might be used by the Italians either as terminal points or as places of transit on more extended air routes. Having regard to the fact that the Government of India is no longer responsible for the administration of Aden, and also to the possibility that it might be held by the Italian Government that the reciprocal rights conferred on British air services by Article 2 of the Convention do not now, if it was originally intended that they should, a ply to the aircraft of an Indian company, I am to suggest that it would be desirable to make specific provision in any permit to be given to the Italian Government for the grant of reciprocal facilities to the aircraft of a company nominated by the Government of India. The Burma Office is understood to be taking steps to consult the Government of Burma with regard to the Italian Government’s enquiry. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, Sgd/- W. D. CROFT. The Secretary to the Government of India, Communications Department.INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.■, 1 # K. &amp; 0 f 50E/40 13th February, 1940. Sir, \ With reference to your letter of &amp;3rd January, 1940, No.^.833/833/27, relative to the proposal of the Italian Ala Littoria Company to extend the presen'. Rome-Basra air service to Bangkok, I am directed hy the Secretary of State for India to enclose copy of a letter which has been sent to the Government of India on the subject. 2. With regard to the suggestion that the Italian Company should make use of the route followed by Imperial Airways along the Arab Coast of the Persian Gulf, I am to sey that Lord Zetland fully shares the objections to such a proposal which have been expressed only recently by the Political Resident and by the Government of Indie, the former in his express letter of the 27th September, Po.C/49£ (enclosure in India Office letter No.P.2*6257/39, dated 13th October) regarding the visit of ignor Venturini to Behrein, and the latter in paragraph 3 of their telegram of the 9th December, No.2286 (enclosure in India Office letter No.P.Z.7732/39, dated 11th December) regarding the request of A.Roosenburg for visa facilities in connection with the establishment of a K.L.iP. service through Bahrein, 3. Inasmuch as the Itaiian Company, according to the Government of India, are reported in the press to have already obtained permission for the use of the Persian route, the position in this as in other respects is much the same as when in 1936 Royal Dutch Mr Lines (A.L.M.) sought permission to use the Arab Coast route, and the difficulties pointed out by the Foreign Office when refusing permission in their letter to the Dutch Minister of the 25th September, 1936 (No. .5895/377/91, retain their force, so far as Lord Zetland is aware. It is not improbable that the Air Ministry wi 11 feel that the strate gical objections to admitting a foreign company to the use of the Arab route (which of course were not conveyed to M.van Swinderen in 1936} are if anything increased at the present time, and that any attempts by Italian (and Dutch) Companies to take advan tage rf the war-time difficulties of Imperial Airways should not be encouraged. Lord Zetland hopes therefore that when the time comes to reply to the Italian Ambassador after receipt of the views of the Governments of India and Burma Lord Halifax will be able to communicate to the Italian Ambassador a polite but firm refusal of the facilities desired on the Arab Coast; aid while the reply might, if thought desirable, be substantially on the lines of that made to the Dutch Minister in September, 1936, His Lordship would strongly deprecate any hint that the position might be r econsidered if the Company failed to obtain facilities through Persia. 4.

My Lord, With reference tc this Embassy’s note 1 o. 4419 of 3£th August, 1938, I have tie honour to inform Your Excellency that the Italian company Ala Littoria, which is at present running the Bome-Basra air line, is considering a plan to prolcng this line as far as Bangkok, across Iran and British India. The above-mentioned company has under consideration two different routes;- 1. Air France route (Forth Persian Gulf); Eushire, Jask (Iran), Karachi, Jodpur, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Kangoon (India), Bangkok (Thailand). 2. Imperial Airways route (South Persian Gulf); Bahrein (Emirate); Shardjak, Jivani, Gwadar, Karachi, Jodpur, Allahabad, Calcutta, Akyab, Rangoon (India), Bangkok (Thailand). In regard to the foregoing and in fulfilment of instructions from my Government, I have the honour to request Your Excellency to be so good as to let me know whether there is any objection, so far as the British Government and the Government of India have jurisdiction, to Italian aircraft flying over and landing on the routes indicated. Finally I have the honour to inform you that the Ala Littoria Company are ready to send a representative to London if the British authorities would like to take the opportunity to obtain information and complete techincal particulars about the proposed air line.

From To L,t% t ) Persian Gulf Residency, ^ Bushire. 5th April 1^46. The Hon*ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf. The Secretary to the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, New Delhi . 1 , ^ 1 h a Ve the honour to refer to the minutes ? eat ^ g the External Affairs Deoartment on Tuesday the nth December 1945, to consider' the question of civil aviation between India and Persian and to say that I discussed the question of these proposed air routes at a meeting with Sir Gurunath flewoor and Sir Frederick Tymms during my recent visit to Delhi. 2 * 1 pointed out that the proposed route (l) was a roundabout method of reaching Tehran and added that so far as (2) was concerned little payload could i e »5? ec ? ;e&lt;i a -*- on £ k* 1 ® South Persian coast and that the tra ;£ ic - I bet I /een Bushi re, Shiraz, Isfahan and Tehran would almost certainly be closed to an Indian line as a J 1;Ln9 is already operating on this section. I adcied with regard to the Air Attache’s objections regard- ^? g . t r?, mo !i nta ?- nous cou n tr y between Shiraz and Isfahan, that this Persian air line was already covering it with out difficulty, and that 15 years ago Junkers had apparently experienced no difficulty with the primitive aeroplanes then available. As regards (3) and (4), I felt that I could offer no useful suggestions. then drew attention to an excellent open ing which existed for an Indian air line along the Arab shores of the Persian Gulf. The requisites of a profitable air line are that the distances/should not be and traffic should readily be available at all the stages. I suggest, therefore, that the Government of India should encourage an air line to fly to Basra stopping at Jiwani, Sharjah, Bahrain, Kuwait and finally Basra. The present steamer service to Gwadur is very poor and there is little doubt that an air line would attract a considerable amount of air mail, in addition to such passengers as could not wait for a ship. It is true that the distance from Gwadur to Jiwani is consid erable, and at present owing to the indifferent nature of the road takes some 6 hours, but this would not affect air mail and passengers would be prepared to face this. The aerodrome at Jiwani is presumably the property of the Government of India and they could make their own terms /for an/ for an air line* Should it be possible to utilise the aerodroae at Gwadur, still more traffic would be avail able* but in any case this distance provides a useful refuelling stop for the more economical types of aircraft* b* At Sharjah* this air line could land simply by payinglanding fees to His Majesty’s Government who already maintain and administer the aerodrome and have an agreement with the Shaikh of that place. There is a large Indian coimuunity both here and in Dubai who already appreciate air facilities, and in addition the Indian Post Office at Sharjah or Dubai would naturally sent their postal packets, which can be quite considerable, by an Indian air line, which would be fully justified since Indian internal air postage rates are now charged. 6* At Bahrain* the air line could land on similar terms and little expenditure would be required* Here again there is a very large Indian comrrunity, a close c onnection with Karachi and Bombay* an Indian Post Office which would make available large quantities of postal air mail packets to and from India, and finally an Arab community fully alive to the advantages of air travel and the disadvantages which they now experience in endeavouring to secure passages on long distance aeroplanes. 7* At Kuwait the aerodrome Is not at present maintained, but it is an all-weather aerodrome (regularly used by Kuwait Oil Company planes up to Lockheeds)'which has very seldom gone out of order, and meteorological reports of Basra would with very occasional exceptions suffice for Kuwait. Here a good deal of traffic could be expected since not merely is there an Indian Post Office which would provide a quantity of air mail, but there is a growing Indian community based upon the Kuwait Oil Company. An air line landing here would be most popular with the Arabs in that they would not be obliged, as they are at present, to wait a month for a visa to Iraq In order to fly from Basra* The distance from Kuwait to Basra is a very short one but the traffic that Kuwait would provide w ould fully justify a halt here. S* Basra is the logical terminus of this line and medium-sized aircraft could continue to land in the Basra air port Margil. There can be no doabt that with the close and rapidly increasing trade links that Iraq is forging with India, Basra would provide a considerable number of passengers, and in addition at certain times there would be a very large pilgrim traffic which might call for extra planes. 9* To sum up, this air line would only be required to fly short distances, through areas with large Indian interests and Indian Post Offices, and with a population well accustomed to air travel*• Potential passengers are at present badly served owing to the fact that the existing air lines cater to long distance travellers and give them preference over local traffic. / If the^ 3 • x ^ la oontjmplatliig my air Unas wf V ^ eir I r«el that this is the one 5*?5 best adapted to their purpose and which will yield the best revenue with tlie least outlay of capital. / I have the honour to foe Sir, Tour moat obedient servant GEO, * kic.1 PRIOR // // ■ / j i Political Resident, ersian Julf.

(c) All aircraft operated by the airline or airlines designated by one contracting party on the routes covered by the present Agreement and supplies of fuel, lubricating oils, spare parts, normal equipment and aircraft stores retained on board aircraft of the designated airline or airlines of one contracting party shall be exempt, on entry into or departure from the territory of the other contracting party, from customs duties, inspection fees or similar duties or charges, even though such supplies be used by such aircraft on flights in that territory. Article IV. Certificates of airworthiness, certificates of competency and licences issued or rendered valid by one contracting party shall be recognised as valid by the other contracting party for the purpose of operating the services specified in the Annex. Each contracting party reserves the right, however. ** o refuse to recognise, for the purpose of flight above its own territory, ^certificates of competency and licences granted to its own nationals by another State. Article V.

Article VII. The two contracting parties agree to appoint a Standing Joint Com mittee to co-ordinate their respective air services and, where necessary, to submit for the approval of the competent aeronautical authorities of the two countries proposals for the modification of the Annex of this Agreement. This Committee shall be composed of two representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of each of the contracting parties and. of two representatives of the airlines of each of the two countries. The Committee shall meet alternately in London and Paris under the chair manship of one of the representatives of the competent aeronautical authorities of the contracting party in whose territory the meeting is held.4 Article YIII. (a) The contracting parties agree to submit to arbitration any dispute relating to the interpretation or application of this Agreement or of the Annex thereto which cannot be settled by direct negotiation. (b) Any such dispute shall be referred to the Council of the Inter national Civil Aviation Organisation set up by the Convention on Inter national Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the 7th December, 1944, or, pending the entry into force of the said Convention as between the two contracting parties, to the Interim Council set up by the Interim Agree ment on International Civil Aviation signed at Chicago on the same date.( 2 ) (c) Nevertheless, the contracting parties may, by mutual agreement, settle the dispute by referring it either to an Arbitral Tribunal or to any person or body that they may designate.

(3) It has been agreed that paragraph 5 (d) (2) of the Annex authorised the airlines of each of the two countries to operate their trunk routes basis of a minimum frequency to be determined by the Standing b Committee set up by Article VII of the Agreement, and that, in particular, on the French trunk route to Indo-China, this frequency shall be six services a week.

We are now exploring the possibility of establishing a regular service on this route and should be most grateful if^you could advise us whether you would consider granting us a mail contract for the carriage of air mail between -vuwait and points in Iraq. There is a further point about which we should appreciate your advice.

The question of whether it is possible to permit your company to establish a regular air service between Basra and Kuwait has been referred to higher authority. 3 # It is not within my compentence to grant you an air-mail contract, but if you will inform me of the rates and frequencies at which you would be prepared to carry air mail the matter will be considered. For your information the average weekly number of air-mail bags being transported between Kuwait and Basra is sixteen of an average approximate weight of 40 Lbs each. 4.

Sir, I have the honour to enclose a cony of letter No.IA/205/i:L93 dated the 10th March, 1°47 received from Iraqi Airways and of my reply. 2, It appears that Iraqi Airways contemplate apolylnp for permission to establish a regular service to Kuwait. This would undoubtedly be very welcome to Kuwaitis particularly if it could be arranged for Iraqi Airways to carry air-mail between Kuwait and Basra. 3 # jt appears, however, that they are not entitled to do this under the ^International Air Services Transit Agreement”, which only accords them the right to stop for non-traffic purposes, and I am net clear as to what steps would have to be taken to enable them to operate a service to Kuwait and to land for traffic purposes. Their flights hitherto have been under charter to the Kuwait Oil Company and are presumably covered by article b ol the Kuwait Oil Company concession.

In reply to your letter No. 5/1-42/10 of 14th April, we are most grateful to you for the information you have given. We have made application through the appropriate Ministry of the Iraq^Government for permission to operate this service, and, provided the formalities are completed, it is hoped to commence a regular operations with effect from 15th May,1947. The proposed frequency of the service will be three times weekly, arriving at Kuwait at 1110 LST and leaving at 1200 LST on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays. The rates for carriage of Air Mail will be 84 Gold f Centimes per kilo from Kuwait to Basrah and 3 Gold Francs 52 Gold Centimes per kilo from Kuwait to Baghdad. At the present rate of exchange, this will be equivalent to 68 Fils per kilo from Kuwait to Basrah and 286 Fils per kilo from Kuwait to Baghdad. ^It will therefore be appreciated if the question of an Air Mail contract on th&lt;is« basis might be discussed with the appropriate authorities. Yours faithfully, X i ijj~ ^ f General Manager, Iraqi Airways.n EXPRESS LETTER To From Political, Kuwait Repgu, Bahrain* No.C/335. Dated the S9th April, 1947 ) CONFIDENTIAL. S Reference correspondence ending with my telegram No.332 dated the 2Sth April, 1947. Iraqi Airways. Z. I have received a further communication from Iraqi Airways in which they have offered to convey mails between Kuwait and Basra @ 34 Gold Centimes (or 68 fils at the present rate of exchange) per Kilo. The average monthly weight of mail carried in both directions at present averages 1230 kilos. Iraqi Airways propose to operate this service on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays arriving at Kuwait 1110 Local Standard Time and leaving at noon. At present the Mail—Contract between Kuwait and Basra is held by the Kuwait'-Zubair Transport Company (on the terms set forth in the enclosure to my printed letter No.C/246 dated the 27th March, 194?) but it is terminable at four calendar months notice. 4 # . There is a persistent and in my opinion justifi able demand by the Kuwait Oil Company and the merchant community for quicker and more frequent mails between Kuwait and Basra and it is suggested that the question of giving the Meil Contract to Iraqi Airways may be considered.

My dear Colonel, ^ 3-^ There is an aspect of the present proposal of Iraqi Airways to initiate a serrice to Kuwait (the correspondence rests with my telegram No*345 dated the 3rd May, 1947) which I think I should bring to your notice. 2. Iraqi Airways have made no secret of their intention to open the service.*'Iraq tour' have appointed an agent (a Kuwaiti) who has hung out a sign in the bazar; and he is shortly going to pitch tents near the airfield to accommodate passengers. The Kuwaities generally welcome the prospect of improved communication with Basra, and I fear there would be an unfavourable reaction should permission to open the service be refused by His Majesty f s Government. 3. The Shaikh, I know, is anxious that a proper aerodrome should be established here, and pressux^e might be brought upon him not to renew the Air Agreement with us (which is due for renewal next year) should we refuse to allow foreign airlines to run to Kuwait on the grounds of lack of facilities, while at the same time refusing to install the facilities. 4. The aerodrome is satisfactory for the purposes of the Kuwait Oil Company as it is; and they do not wish to assume the burden of providing further facilities and personnel for management of an international airfield. I am unable to suggest the means whereby His Majesty's Government should establish, maintain, and manage the airfield, but unless they take early steps to do so it may be very difficult if not impossible to persuade the Shaikh to renew the Civil Air Agreement next year.

Sir ■ ffc'i I have the honour to refer to your telegram No.635 dated the 28th May, 1947 paragraph 3. 3, It seems certain that aircraft of many national ities will wish to land in Kuwait in the future : the Iraqi Airways service appears to be enjoying considerable success; and an Indian service is contemplated. There seems a possibility that Kuwait might become the starting point for pilgrimages by air to Mecca. Sooner or later the countries concerned may designate Kuwait as an airfield required for international traffic* Should they do so the obligation to bring the airfield up to International standards would appear to rest upon Great Britain by virtue of her signature of the Chicago Convention on behalf of territories under protection. It does not seem that this obligation could be evaded by allowing our Air Agreement with the Shaikh to lapse. 3. Should we not renew the Air Agreement and should we manage to divest ourselves of all obligations under International Air Conventions regarding Kuwait, dangerous vacuum might be left* The Shaikh desires that an airfield should be established, and might well receive favourably a proposal from a foreign state or air-line desiring an airfield under their own control. There is presumably no necessity to dilate dn the dangers Inherent in such a possibility - the fact that His Majesty’s Government have concluded in the past exclusive air Agreements with the Shaikh indicates that they are aware of them. 4. The problem of bringing the airfield up to the standard required should not be Insuperable if the co operation of the Kuv^ait Oil Company is enlisted; and, after maintaining for many years an exclusive right to establish an airfield when no one else wished to do so, it would seem inadvisable to abandon this right at the present time.

I understand that ^rantours” originally contact ed a Kuwaiti merchant of Persian origin, one Xusuf Behbehani, on a recent visit to Teheran. After his return to Kuwait he received a letter from them asking whether in his opinion there was sufficient demand for air transport between Kuwait and Iran, and whether the Shaikh would have any objection to the institution of a service. Behbehani thereupon wrote to the Shaikh who replied to the effect that he should be approached officially. , 3. I doubt if there would be sufficient traffic between Kuwait and Iran to justify an air service, particularly as I believe Iranian Airways use Dakota aircraft. That is, however, primarily a matter for them to consider. The Kuwaiti merchant community would * naturally welcome the improvement in communications. 4. There are likely to be political complications arising out of Iranis claim to Kuwait, and I consider Irantours should not be allowed to institute and operate the proposed service as if it was an Iranian internal air-line a They should be made to obtain permission for the service through His Majesty^ Government and not direct from the Shaikh, and Persians travelling to Kuwait should obtain Kuwait visas beforeXiand.

You will recall that a few months ago these charges which were substantially increased since the war were severely criticised in the House of Commons. It was then pointed out by the Secretary of State for 4ir that the interested parties must appreciate that landing fees do not only cover a landing and a take-off but that there are numerous other expensive services and aids rendered to aircraft in flight and whilst on ground such as free meteorological facilities, Air/Ground W/T communications, • point-to-point W/T, navigational aids, Radio Telephony airport Control, fire fighting services, medical aids, passenger and freight handling facilities. I am sure you will agree that none of these services and aids are available at the Kuwait landing ground, and although I am very reluctant in asking you to give this matter of landing charges your further consideration, I do feel that some adjustment is justified in view of the lack of facilities at Kuwait. We extended our service from Basrah to Kuwait in order to assist the public in travelling quickly between these two centres. The distance is very short as a sector of an air route,and the fare must for this reason remain fairly low. It therefore follows that expenses must be kept at the lowest possible level or the operation of the route becomes most (Uneconomical. Our air services are‘already linking Kuwait to many other parts of the world and we aim at providing you with faster and more frequent services to destinations such as Karachi, Tehran, Baghdad, Cairo, London, Damascus, Beirut, Ankara, Istanbul etc. It is already possible for a passenger to leave Kuwait by our service on, say, Monday afternoon and to arrive in London midday Wednesday. It is generally accepted that air services are becoming more and more important in the development of a country and in providing essential systems for quick communications between countries. Normally countries subsidise,or contribute towards subsidies, paid to airline Companies. Kuwait is singularily fortunate in this respect as it does not give financial aid to Iraqi Airways.m) /c)*U smimmAh, No,C/36. ^he Political Agency, fW} Dated the 10th January, 1948. / To.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to the correspondence resting with your endorsement No.l205-S dated the 21st June, . , ^*57/ 1947 and to enclose a copy of a letter received from Iraqi Airways, 2. Although it is true that His Majesty’s Government are involved in an expenditure of £500/- per annum in connect’ ion with the aerodrome, this sum is paid partly for considera tions other than rent (e.g. the exclusive nature of the Air * Agreement), and I doubt if we could justify the levying of landing fess solely on th*; ground of this payment to His Highness. It is a fact that tlpe air service is a great boon t to the public and much appreciated. . • „ 3. For the above reason I feel that the arguments of Iraqi Airways have much force, and I should deprecate any attempt on our part to have the service suspended until they agree to pay landing fees. Any such action would arouse much resentment locally and v/ould only be temporary in its effect as the service would presumably be resumed after the current Air Agreement lapses in May. 4.

As instructed, I am now writing to you officially on this matter and deel that I can do no better than enclose a copy of the relative letter from the Manager of our Southern Asia Area. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd/~ Cr.F.ft. Parker 'kS 1 Station Superintendent.BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION MEMORANDUM (i^o) tbi. From: Manager Southern Asia Area, Tos Station Superintendent. Ik O T Y-i 1 &gt; ^ From a copy of the letter the Divisional Manager has written following his talk with you, I understand that you will shortly be contacting Sir Rupert Hay in order to obtain his views on the subject of Gulf Services. The Divisional Manager in his memorandum makes the following comment “The only way in which we could really secure a share of local traffic would be to establish a local Company in Bahrain to run essentially ,f Dhow Traffic” Services. 1 believe that this has been suggested before and it might well be worth while considering in more detail. It would have to be a special type of ”third class” operation and would obviously have to keep its fares at the lowest possible level. When I hear from the Station Superintendent, Bahrain, I think it would be worth while having a discussion in order to examine these possibilities of such an organisation.” 2. As you are aware, now that steamer traffic has commenced the public have shewn a disinclination to trave3. by air at the present rates, and when you write to the Divisional Manager you should certainly go into this aspect of the matter and indicate if lower fares are likely to re-influence this traffic on to the air route. If you are of the opinion that this might be so, then you should also indicate what you think the fares would have to be and give your reasons. 3. When considering the foregoing you should take into account that Iraqi Airways, and possibly Orient Airways, will be operating up the Gulf. If aircraft were based on Bahrain then it would appear that the main revenue might arise from the carriage of passengers to such places as Kuwait, Abadan, etc. and you should therefore review carefully the present traffic trend over these sectors and comment on the likely future growth in importance of these places and the resulting effect on the traffic potential.

Iraqi Airways maintain a daily service between Basrah and Kuwait largely for the convenience of the Kuwait Oil Company c.f. Baghdad telegram No.413 dated 6 th May, 1947 to Foreign Office. 4. ^ My view is that as His Majesty's Government provide no facilities whatever at the Kuwait landing ground the recovery of landing fees is inequitable. The annual payment of £.600 made to the Shaikh c.f. the last sentence of India Office telegram No.6708 dated the 23rd May, 1947, is really of a political nature and made in return for the exclusive rights granted under the agreement, rather than as rent for the landing-ground though both reasons are assigned for it in Article 16 of the Heads of Agreement between His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom and His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait. It will be noted that although in that Article reference is made to M the aerodrome' no aerodrome is anywhere mentioned by name in the Agreement and the payment cannot therefore be regarded as rental for any specified piece of land.

Iraq Tours have In fact done nothing as far as their Agency is concerned beyond setting up a few tents, appointing a Kuwaiti to meet the planes, and collect the profits. ;3« I consider the time is ripe to review the tenture of air this Agency now that other/pompanies, following E.O.A.C’s example, are beginning to become interested in Kuwait: K.L.M., T.,y.A. and P.A.A. have all had their representatives here recently, and I understand that they had all been approached by Iraq Tours in Basra first, asking for their Kuwait Agency. Once down here, however, they realised that Iraq Tours had no proper organisation, and it seems likely that their agencies, like that of B,0.A.C., will go to A1 Ghanim, who l_ are the only2. are tilie only members of I *A.f.A. in xluvvnit• 4. It would therefore* I consider, be preferable in every way If the Iraqi ^ii-ways Agency was handed over to a firm like £(£0^k\ Ghanin, who are at the sarae tirae the A. 1.0.0. refueling agents, rather than allow it to remain a sinecure for Iraq Tours: I would therefore ash you* if you agree, to raise the matter with His Majesty's Embassy in Baghdad. I have the honour to be, Sir, Y&amp;ur most obedient servant, Political Agsnt, Kuwait.

The Pblitical Agency, No .M/28 Kuwait Dated the 19th September, 1948 My dear George Please refer to your letter dated the 2nd 3e pt emb er, 1948. I have made further enquiries about K.L.M., here, and I find that the plane they used was a SKymaster. No official agent seems to have been appointed as yet, but there is little doubt that it will be Yusuf al Ghanim, as only member of I.A.T.A. here and also sole refuelling agent and Anglo-Iranian Oil Company concessionaire. I might add that there is a rumour here that K.L.M. do not intend to start operating until the new airfield is built. Yours sincerely G.C. Litiler, Esquire, Consul-General, Basra .GONfflDENTIAL. No.R/84(6/2)• The Political Agency, Kuwait. My dear Colonel, During my recent visit to Basra I had the onportunity to discuss with Mr. Fogarty of B.O.A.C. certain aspects of aviation questions in Kuwait, and in particular penetration of this territory by foreign air lines. 2. Mr. Jogarty was worried by the activity being shown in Kuwait by the agents of K.L.M., P.A.A. and T.W.A., and asked whether the facilities granted to these agents, and for instance, the recent trial flight by K.L.M., meant that His Majesty’s Government intend to maintain an ’open-dowa’ policy here, as opposed to the B.O.A.C’s monopoly in force in Bahrain. I informed him that although no doubt future policy was being considered in the present discussions being held in London over the renewal of the Civil Air Agreement, I could tell him nothing beyond what I had heard incidentally from Mr. Chisolm, Personnel Manager, Kuwait Oil Company, during his visit here, to the effect that the Kuwait Oil Company was in favour of foreign lines operating in Kuwait, particularly American, and the Ministry of Civil Aviation had been persuaded to share their view. 3. I understand that B.O.A.C. is going through a difficult period &lt;at the moment owing to shortage of modem aircraft, and theix has been a good deal of dissatisfaction with their service here owing to its irregularity. I doubt therefore if for the next ■cwo years at least they would hold their own under free competition, though they have done all they can to consolidate their position here: in the past few | days for instance they have secured A1 Ghanim, the only I member of I.A.T.A. present here, as ^heir sole agent. Hov/ever, K.L.M. have recently visited Asfour, and are now interviewing Abdulla Mulla, who will probably secure their agency: and P.A.A are reported to be considering Izzat Jaffar. Once these last two agencies are concluded, it will be possible for them to bring considerable pressure to bear on the .Shaikh in favour of foreign air-lines, and it will be proportionately more dif ficult for us to insist on a monopoly. 4. I therefore feel it would be helpful if the main lines of our future air policy here would be made known even before a decision is reached over the new airport and the new Civil Air Agreement is ready for negotiation^. Yours sincerely, His Excellency Lt-Colonel A.C. Galloway, C.I.E., O.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain .PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY.

As I see it paragraph 5 of Part II of the Kuwait Civil Air Agreement does not cover such matters as the appointment of Agents, but covers only questions arising out of the Civil Air Agreement. 3.

Political Agent Kuwait.■ — ■Hi Telegram T R T Trom Political, Kuwait. i- 1 o Britain, Basra. No. 402. Dated the 17th November, 1948. I discussed the proposition of appointing the 3.O.A.C. Kuwait agents as agents for Iraqi airlines.in Kuwait with Bernard who gave it as his opinion that there was no objection provided that B.O.A.G. waived the clause that their agents would not handle more than one agency. 8. Kuwait wish to appoint the same agent and since 3.C.A.C. are Iraqi Airways agents I should be grateful if you would telegraph 3.0.A.C r s no objection. -Galloway-mm (33/6/1 ) 3®« British Gonsuiate-(leneral, Basra. 20th November, 1948. CONFWKN 7 J - \ iV© Kuwait keccuf $ f&gt;7// sn f\ve With reference to your telegram No. 402 of the 1?th November, on the subject of agents for Iraqi airways in Kuwait. I have discussed this with Fogarty, B.G.^.G. Station Superintendent here, and quite frankly 3.C.A.C. would like to prevent their Kuwait agents becoming agents for another airline, but at the same time, seeing that 3.C.A.C. handle Iraqi Airways in Bahrain, Cairo, London and elsewhere, it is obviously a delicate matter, which will have to be dealt with in a rather indirect way. Iraqi Airways have known for some time that 3.G.A.C. were appointing their present agents as sole agents, and it is apparently only when they see that B.O.A.G. are assisting their agents to build up a decent organisation - for example, by importing ex-3.C.A.C. clerks from Palestine, etc. , - coupled with the fact that Iraq Tours seem to be not very securely established, that Iraqi Airways, Bagdad, wish to take advantage of the situation. B. O.A.C. fear that if they waive their rights in the case of Iraqi Air/ays other airlines, such as T. d. &lt;«•* j K. L. ivi. , etc. , migh t well use this as an argument for getting this agent to represent them. particular The position then is that 3.O.A.C. consider it detrimental to their long term interests to have their agents handling any other airline traffic. At the same time they do not wish, for obvious reasons, to appear as if they are being awkward with Iraqi Airways. If you could suggest to the Kuwaiti authorities that in the interests of all round trade it would be better to spread these agencies (I understand that Abdullah hullah has been angling for the Iraqi Airways agency) and that it is undesirable to create a monopoly firm such as might well happen, then I think the best interests of B.O.A.C.’s future traffic will be ensured. I am sending this letter by hand of Mr. he gen ass of B. C.A.C., whom I think you know, and he will no doubt fill in any gaps I have left in the above. 4 Lt.Col. A.C.
