Grey in his telegram to His Majesty’s Minister fin or about the 12 th March 1914 to a record beingkept of the numbers of transport animals carrying imports from Persian Gulf ports to various centres in South ^n and Central Persia, I now have the honour to report that by an extension of this system of recording the numbers of animals it has been found possible to obtain more exact and detailed information as to the volume of trade passing into the interior by the several trade routes. His Majesty’s Consular officers at Bandar Abbas and Bushire have, during the last year, induced the Municipalities at Bandar Abbas and Bushire to keep a record of the numbers and contents of packages leaving for the interior by establishing controls at the town gates, and obliging merchants to declare the contents of each consignment. At Ahwaz, Shushtar and Dizful a somewhat similar control has been evolved in the absence of a Municipality. In the previous years there has been an almost complete absence of statistics and data, on which estimates of the trade of the various inland centres of Persia could reliably be formed : the Customs figures of the weight of goods reaching the Persian Gulf ports were reliable (the values far less so) : but once landed, the desti nation and area of consumption were entirely lost to view. Consular officers, in the interior of Persia particularly, were either unable to produce trade statistics, or had to rely on vague estimates given by merchants. It was apprehended before the outbreak of war that British imports were being pushed out of Central Persia bv Russian goods : but one could not tell to what extent. Above all, there were no figures for a proper comparison of the value of the various trade routes from the ^ Ulf The provision of statistical data as regards trade in Central Persia will un- rlrvnBfpdlv be one of the first and chief requirements of any organization of Commer- ^ 1 Tntpilivence and for the more active promotion of British trade m Persia, esDecWly if it is desired to know how trade from the Gulf stands vis a ms imports •I Russia • and with that object in view, it is thought that if the record now kept ^ Maintained and improved in future years, His Majesty’s Government and representatives in Persia will have more leliable information as to the trade of the interior of Persia than hitherto.

I have the honour to address you on the subject of the construction of a motor road between Bushire and Shiraz the need for which has a^ain been put forward by Brigadier-General Sir i . Sykes, K.C.I.E., C.M.G., Inspector- General of the South Persia Bides. I beg to submit, for the information of the Government of India, a copy of the marginally cited telegraphic correspondence which has passed between General Sykes, Sir P. Cox, and myself on the subject. There has been considerable correspond ence on the subject of ( 1 ) a motor road from Bushire to Shiraz, ( 2 ) a railway from Bushire to Shiraz and ( 3 ) a motor road from Bushire to Daliki. In connec tion with these projects, I beg to invite a reference to the undermentioned documents. In respect of ( 1 ) Mr. Chick’s memorandum forwarded with Sir P. Cox’s letter No. 544, dated 6 th March 1911. ( 2 ) Sir P. Cox’s letter, No. 1840, dated 18th August 1912, to the Govern ment of India in the Foreign Department forwarding {a) a report by Lieutenant Whson, C.M.G., on the possibility of connecting Bushire by railway with Shiraz via Aliabad or some other point on the Bandar Abbas-Shiraz alio-n- ment. ° (5) A report by Mr. H. G. Chick on the commercial possibilities of the above and other railway projects in South-West Persia. Both the above reports were forwarded to the Government of India with Sir P. Cox’s letter above mentioned. (3) Mr. Chick’s memorandum forwarded with Major Knox’s letter to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, No. 1297, dated 3 rd May 1914. J I At the end of 1911 it was intended to depute Major (then Captain) L. E. Hopkins, B.E., to survey the Bushire-Shiraz routes with a view to deciding on the possibility of a motor road or railway, but unfortunately the proposal fell through. Major Hopkins, however, on general grounds expressed his opinion that a railway would be best, and pronounced in favour of the Kazerun route, vide his memorandum, dated 7 th February 1912, received at Bushire with Foreign Department endorsement, No. 823-E. A. of 19th April 1912. It will be seen from enclosure ( 2 ) that when General Sykes raised this question again I recommended to Sir P. Cox that the question could not be decided without expert advice, and suggested that perhaps Major Bich, now surveying on the Bandar Abbas-Kerman route, might, if local conditions between Bushire and Shiraz became sufficiently favourable by the time he has completed his present work, survey and report on the Bushire-Shiraz route also. Sir P. Cox has now telegraphed from General Headquarters instructing me to forward the telegraphic correspondence herewith enclosed for the consideration of the Government of India, and to add that he supports my suggestion regarding Major Bieh and hopes that the Government of India will be pleased to authorize the deputation of that officer to survey the Bushire-Shiraz routes on completion of his present work if the proposal com mends itself to them.

Restoration of order is affected by good communications as to guard aV ro^d compared with a track requires less men owing to support of motor cars and bicycles and for other reasons. Tactical advantages are also great. Cost of permanent import supplies equipment and munitions of war for South Persia Rifles on mules will be crushing. Money would be presumably advanced by Government of India.

Bushire “ Forwarding Arrangement. u In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram, No. 146, dated 23rd August, to the address of Your Excellency, on the subject of the Bushire “ Porwarding Arrangement ”, and in special refer ®f ce _^ ^ our gram to the Resident at Bushire, No. 163 (repeated to me, No. 119), and the Resident’s telegram to you, No. 214-958, I have the honour to address to you the following further remarks on the subject. In the first place I should like Your Excellency to be acquainted with the alternative proposals made to me by the Resident, to which he refers m his despatch to Your Excellency, No. 45—1686, dated 31st May, and again in his telegram No. 214—958, dated 17th August. 1 hese proposals were contained in a demi-official letter to me, dated 14th April last, enclosing a Memorandum by Mr. Chick, and are as follows “ We are, I think, going to try an arrangement, rather mistrustfully, with Zieglers by which they will be allowed, if they can, to bring in fresh traosport animals, not usually employed on the route, to supplement our transport, and Zieglers will he allowed to keep them in consideration of haying provided them. I don’t suppose that there is any idea of confining the arrangement to Zieglers and, provided any one merchant or body of merchants can ma contvwte, outside our supply of mules, which are wellknown, to bring a reasonably large supply, say, .batches of 200 or 300 mules, we will welco thern^nd^see that they are alibwed to keep them. But we must keep some control, the merchants shoukfcnot be allowed to use them to wreck our agree- ment by promising an exorMmt rate of hire that will make our muleteers discontented and'they must take up Bushire goods (-ogg ing agam O; If run in good faith and in an honest attempt to supply our tiauspoit deb ciencies and not steal our transport, they should show us the weak s P ots m °“ r scheme and we will amend it. Can Shiraz make such a contract, say wuh Tsnahan mules ? If they will, and they are not our mules, wire it dow u t and we wTlfsee that it is respected ; and they can renew it again, when mules return to them and we will respect it again. ***** “ Make vour contracts at reasonable rates and bring outside mules, camels' or donkeys, and we will help them through here, but let us know be o e- cameis, or Bushire that y 0 u will have a heavy 30 b of it, we (Ion t believe the mule transport is there, but we will be the first to congratulate you on a successful issue.” This proposal was presumably put forward by the Resident in good faith as a means P of meeting thl objeetionVraised by Messrs. an^Com^ny, and others, against the V^Tmpcssihle t 0 P regard it as a obvious difficulties and disadvantages 1 f must I think, be apparent serious attempt at a solution ot the question ^ “^Vouid n ot possibly that such an arrangemfint as is proposed by the Resident could P f AH . u 1 , dated 1 9! ^64 9 work satisfactorily in actual practice. It would mean, in tlie first instance, that each separate merchant, or group of merchants, would have to procure mules from outside sources (Ispahan or elsewhere), and to hire them at contract rates to work solely for the hirers in question between Shiraz and Bushire. Apart from the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of procuring mules (except at purely fancy rates) in such a manner, a few moments reflection must show that any such arrangement is quite impracticable There would be one or more sets of mules, working on the Bushire-Shiraz road, at di tie rent rates, and under totally different conditions, side by side with the body of mules which ordinarily frequent the road. Rivalries and jealousies would inevitably ensue. The ordinary muleteers, bound down by arbitrary regu lations which they resent and detest, would still further resent the introduction of strangers, not bound by these regulations, and working for a particular firm at special rates and under special conditions. These circumstances would necessarily give rise to all kinds of disputes. The strange muleteers would, of course, be free to compete with the ordinary muleteers for the down traffic from Shiraz to Bushire (which is hampered by no restrictive arrange ment) ; whilst they would have special privileges and immunities as regards the up traffic. Then it must be clear, also, that no firm could possibly undertake such an arrangement on its own account. No merchant can be certain of importing into Tersia a specified quantity of merchandise which will exactly suffice to afford work for a stiven number of mules, working regularly up and down the road all through the year. The quantity of the imports of every firm must (and does) obviously vary with the fluctuating conditions of trade, of the money market, of the resources of the firm itself, &amp;e. There is probably no firm 'in Persia* which could afford to maintain a body of mules working 'for itself alone on a given road. Messrs. Ziegler and Company might possibly attempt it. But even in their case the obvious risks and disadvantages are too great to make the proposal worth serious consideration. It is only necessary to consider the conditions prevailing in Persia to be convinced that such a system could not possibly be attempted with any prospect of success; and if Your Excellency s udy the Ive^idcnt s ov\ n remarks on the subject, you will, I think, agree itb me that his proposed solution of the difficulty is quite impracticable. I would invite your attention, in passing, to the Resident’s use of the expression of •‘our mules”, meaning the regular supply of mules which fiequent the Shiraz-Bushire road. The use of this expression, in itself displays how much misapprehension exists in the Resident’s office with regard to the whole transport question. The great hulk of the mules which ply on the road come from the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and as I have already shown are occupied chiefly in carrying merchandise for Shiraz merchants. If the Resident wishes to imply by the term “our mules ” that these mules are in any special way connected with, or under the influence of, Bushire, he is labouring under a misapprehension; and it is indeed this false impression which seeml to be at the bottom of this unfortunate business. But looking at this proposal ot the Resident’s as a whole, it will, I think he clear to Your Excellency, and to any other impartial observer that it is ouing to the existence of an unpopular, and indeed an indefensible arrangement under h.s auspices, that the Resident is now obliged to come for ward with some plan for obymtmg the more serious grievances occasioned by this arrangement. Having, in fact, deranged the long-standine system of transportation on the Bushire-Shiraz road in the face of the almost 0 unanimous protests of all the persons most closely concerned, it is now proposed to intro! duce further derangements and complications, in order to bolster un an erroneous and unsuitable system of working. 61 aU , YT • &lt; !! enC n wil1, 1 t '; ink ’ a S reB with me that for these reasons (and for others winch will no doubt occur to you), instead of endeavouring to support the forwarding Arrangement by the introduction of further com. o P ld syHem 1 ‘ 0 tei ' mmate U once £or “ 11 , ^ to revert to the65 Excellency romewhaif fully,^^the ^ ^ against me that I had not, given his proposed solution fuller consideration 'or attempted to arrive at, some compromise in the matter. Your Excellencv vi,II now I hope, understand why I regarded it as a waste of time to discuss any further a proposal which seemed to me unworthy of serious attention and the adoption of winch would merely have aggravated the exkHnt u’ produced by the Forwarding Arrangement. ll 8 eyils I have already, in my Despatch, No. 17, dated 3rd June last, submitted to Your Excellency the case against the Forwarding Arrangement so ful v tW 1 scarcely think that any further arguments arc necessar^Tn order to LaWe you to form a definite opinion on the matter. I have shown that not only are all the merchants of Shiraz, the past and present Bank Managers, the Governot-tieneid 1 and the muleteers unanimously opposed to it, but that the gieat bulk of the mercantile community at Bushire has also at one time or another protested against it in no uncertain manner, The Resident has not as far as I know, made any attempt to meet my arguments, or to show that he documents which I have submitted to Your Excellency are otherwise than genuine. In his telegram under reference. No. 214-958, dated 16th August, he speaks ot one malcontent ” (i.g., Messrs. Ziegler and Company ) xlus expression is, on the face of it, erroneous and misleading. I have sub mitted to Your Excellency copies of documents showing that the bulk of the mercantile community at Bushire have already protested in stiw terms against the arrangement. Since writing my Despatch No. 17 . I have received from a merchant here another copy of this protest of the Bushire merchants addressed to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, dated 24th February last, with a list of the signatories, which was not available before. I attach a' copy of this list, and Your Excellency will find that it includes all the most important merchants and forwarding agents at Bushire. I am not in a position to say w hether these persons have sinoe modified, their views or not. I can only present to yon such evidence as comes into my hands. J I would invite Your Excellency’s attention also to the letter of Messrs Ziegler’s agent at Ispahan, dated 6 th June last, addressed to the Consul-General* at that place, of which copies were forwarded to Your Excellencv, the Resident and myself. This letter encloses a copy of a letter, No. 0 —112 dated 4th March 1914, addressed to Messrs. Ziegler and Company, Bushire, from Mr Chick, which constitutes an excellent illustration of the Attitude adopted* by the Residency towards any person who differs from their views on this ques tion. In his letter Mr. Chick takes Messrs. Ziegler’s agent severely to task for desiring to raise the question as to whether the Bushire merchants as a w hole favour the continuance of the Forwarding Arrangement or not. I would also venture to invite your special attention to the observations contained in Mr. Wurth’s letter under reference, which appear to me to be well-founded and to express very clearly and justly the arguments against the Forwarding Arrangement from the merchants’ point of view. &amp; Your Excellency has, in fact, before you now, as I venture to think, sufficient evidence to show that the agitation against the Forwarding Arrange ment cannot be ignored, or dismissed as merely factitious or ignorant. I have shown that there is a very great preponderance (almost a complete unanimitv) of expert opinion against it both at Bushire and Shiraz. The communications which I have had the honour to submit to you contain the detailed arguments of experts against it, the study of which will no doubt enable Your Excellency to form your opinion on the matter. And I would again point out that no reply has been made by the Resident to all these arguments; and that the sole supporters of the arrangement appear to consist of the Resident and his staff and the Governor of the Gulf Ports. The Forwarding Arrangement, in fact, stands self-condemned, and there would appear to he no valid reason why ir should not be immediately abolished. And for this the present moment is particularly opportune. Owing to the war, the imports of merchandise have fallen to a minimum. There is, consequently, practically no competition for transport at Bushire, and an automatic fall in66 rates of lure lias resulted. of 'the arbitrary could at any time afford any justi - f tual circums tances now prevailing rules at present in force , an Justification.

Townley, K.C.M.G., His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of Persia, Tehran. The arguments for and against the Bushire Forwarding Agreement have been gone over so often that there is little to be gained by repeating them.. The following points in Shiraz despatch No. 193 of 12 th September however seem to call for comment. His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz represents the scheme by which Messrs. Ziegler were to organise their own transport as a counsel of despair by which I hoped to blotter up an erroneous system,, In point of fact the proposal emanated from Messrs. &gt; Ziegler themselves, whose Bushire representative expressed confidence of his ability to work the scheme successfully. They asked the specific question, “ whether they might, consistently with the Forwarding Agreement, organise their own independent mule transport service obtaining the necessary mules from Shiraz and Isfahan, or alternatively, whether they might use camels for the purpose and make such hiring arrangements therefor as they might deem advisable ”. I replied that the suggestion was unobjectionable as regards camels, *and dso as regards mules not already working on the Bushire-Shiraz road and was )repared to give Messrs. Ziegler all possible help in a proposal calculated to ncrease the number of animals on this section. It was obviously impossible for ne to encourage the engagement of mules already working on this road, as it vould have been inconsistent with the agreement. A curiously distorted version if these facts is given by Messrs. Ziegler’s representative in his letter of 30 th |une to the Acting Consul-General, Isfahan. Nor is the scheme so unworkable as His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz would -pf&gt;m to surest. Messrs. Ziegler would not be debarred from getting their asual share olFmuies under the agreement. They would presumably arrange to have the minimum number of mules they require permanently at their d '?R“ah When in need of more mules they could obtain from the Naqheh any addition mules up to their proper share. As regards the protest of the 24 th February, most of the signatories made the verbal reservation that they had signed the document m response to sohcita- fheTe protests an^deSTeltepfl Ze takln to satisfy myself of the real ti 008 * . . t The two main arguments against the Forwarding Agreement were that ( 1 ) It tended to drive animals off the road. ( 2 ) It was unfair to forwarders of piece-goods. India, Fokeign GecretaNy2 The first of these has been proved to be fallacious by the record mumber of animals which have passed up and down the Bushire-Shiraz road during the last few months. Figures are already in possession of Your Excellency. Even before the war broke out, stocks in Bushire awaiting transport to Shiraz had been reduced to a minimum, and merchants in Shiraz were beginning to wire to their friends in Bushire to forward no more as Shiraz markets were con gested. As regards the second point, there is no doubt that the system of distribu tion as it stood originally, was unfair to merchants forwarding piece-goods exclusively. The proportion assigned to Piece-goods as against less valuable commodities, was soon increased to two to one and early in July an improved system of distribution by which forwarders of piece-goods reaped benefit from the presence of donkeys, was introduced. Thus, while in June Messrs. Ziegler, the principal forwarders of this class were allotted 128 out of 2141 mules available for transport to Shiraz, or rather under 6 per cent, in the month immediately following the introduction of the new system of distribution, viz., from July 7 th to August 7 th, Messrs. Ziegler received as their proper share 184 out of 1566 mules or 1 if per cent, exclusive of animals passed on to them by other merchants, who had received instructions not to forward. It is thus evident that the scheme which has never claimed to be perfect, can be improved by judicious means. ’ The total destruction of a scheme on account of a few easily remedied defects would be absurd. In conclusion, I would record my opinion that the statistics of the past few months have more than ever convinced me that the main objection to the Bushire Forwarding Scheme, viz., that it tended to diminish the available supply of mules, is no longer tenable. I attach little importance to the recorded opinions of Bushire or Shiraz merchants, for I am convinced that just as His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz is able to point to a practically unanimous petition by Bushire merchants, who however very shortly afterwards repudiated it, against the forwarding arrangements, I could procure from the Bushire for warding agents of Shiraz merchants as many Shiraz opinions in favour of any arrangement to reduce the extortionate rates of mule hire obtaining 2 years a^o. The forwarding arrangements at Bushire have undoubtedly reduced materially the cost of transport up-country and continue to do so, and the result must be to reduce the price at which British goods can be placed on the markets of the interior and to compete favourably with Russian goods from the North.

Sir, I have the honour to Invite s reference to Buehire Confidential Despatch No. 45/16305 dated 31st May 1914 to your address, a copy of which has been forwarded to m* by the Resident, As Your Excellency is aware I have already eddres:?ed you with a Despatch (No.17 dated 3rd June 1914) on the subject of the forwarding arrangement at Bushire, in which I have presented the whole case for the favour of your consideration. I merely address you now in order to reply to certain observations contained in the Resident's despatch under reference. With regard to the interchange of views between the Resident and myself which Your Excellency advocated, it appeared to me after the receipt of Major Knox's demi- official letter, enclosing Mr. Chick's Memorandum, that our views on the subject were so divergent that no rood purpose seemed likely to be served by a continuation of such a cox’respondence. My opinion, and that of the merchants and others at Shiraz, is that the present arrangement is injurious to British trade, and should be abolished entirely as soon as possible; and it seemed better there fore to refer the whole case to Your Excellency xx ^o? such action as you might consider necessary or desirable. With regard to the opinions of the Bushire merchants, and to the protests which they have at various times addressed to the Resident end to the Governor of Bushire, T have already submitted to Your Excellency copies o^ communications bearing on the matter with my despatch No.17. These various communications were handed to me by different persons at Shiraz, and until I received the copies T wasquite unav/are of fr.ei: existence. T.'* copier ■*' t v e letters acdresaed v t':e EueMre British Cheiaiber of Coiuuerce to Sir Percy Cox were handed to roe by the repre sentative of British firm trading in Shim: , »t fV. ^ Vt V, r&gt; o representative also at Busbire. They were given to r^e spontaneously by this gentleman, and not only wee I pre viously unacquainted with their existence, but I was a gooc’ deal surprised to find that such important communications had been addressed to the Resident, and had not (sc far rs I know) been communicated either to Your Excellency or to Similarly the copy of the letter addressed by the Persian merchants at Bushire to the governor of that place was (as stated in my despatch No*17) handed to me by the Governor General of Fars at the request of the Persian merchants at 3hir8,zj but, as stated in my despatch, I do not know who the merchants were v/ho signed this letwfi, as, with the timidly of orientals usual in such cases, merchants feared that they might get into trouble WitlW at Bushire if it were known that their action had been reported to the Governor General and to me. My information regarding i&amp;xtx the real atti tude of the Bushire merchants in this question was also confirmed by a private letter written to me by Mr. Ferguson of the Imperial Bank of Persia^after his arrival at Bushirp; : by vertel communications mode to me in the course of conversation by Persian and European merchants resident in Shiraz. Throughout the whole of this controversy there has of course been no attempt on my part to 'undermine Bushire' (as the Resident puts it), or to 'engineer' an opposition to the policy of the Residency; and I venture very respect fully to deprecate the use of such language and of ether expressions employed by the Resident in his letter und reference. My share in the matter was, from the beginning, a perfectly open and straightforward one. As long asthe merchants raised no objection to the forwarc^n^ bT arrangement, I naturally raised none* It was only v-hen I was, u;-preached by the Persian merchants in Shirrs, entirely vh t*.eir own accord, that I began .0 Interest myself actively in the matter, as described In my despatch No.17* There has never been any Question for indeed any necessity Tor) ^engineering' an opposition to the arrange ment* Ibis opposition is entirely spontaneous; and when I was approached by the merchants I made enquiries, as in duty bound, and obtained the opinions of all persons best qualified to form a Judgement; end these opinions T V ave duly submitted to Your Excellency* This is not the first occasion upon which the Resident at Bush!re has imported r personal element into discussions 'Ith the Sornul at f' Shiraz upon purely //7f official matters; and in this instance, as well as in the others, these personalities are, I venture to submit, uncalled for, and. devoid of justification.

In compliance with instructions received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the Forwarding Agree ment at Bushire I understand that you are already in possession of copies of recent correspondence between this Consulate-General and Shiraz and His Majesty’s Minister ending with Major O’Connor’s despatch No. 17, dated 3rd June, 1914, to His Excellency, and it is in regard to this despatch in particular that I am desired to submit my views. Beyond a grotesque attack on Mr. Chick by Messrs. Ziegler’s Armenian representative in Shiraz, I find little that is new in the despatch, and, therefore, confine myself to forwarding a copy of the demi-official letter which I addressed to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, giving cover to the Memorandum which is there the subject of comment. If it is possible, I would request that this demi-official letter may now be treated as official. Copies of the most recent correspondence exchanged between this office and His Majesty’s Minister and a list of enclosure are also attached. I am somewhat embarrassed, as may appear from the enclosures I submit, by the way in which this unfortunate controversy is being conducted. I receive categorical instructions from His Majesty’s Minister to “ contrive to come to some arrangement about the Naqlieh question ”, and endeavour loyally in my demi official letter now enclosed to comply with those instructions. His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, brushes all my Commercial Adviser’s arguments aside as “ quite unconvincing ”. I attach little importance to my own observations which are rather those of a newcomer and onlooker, fresh to the controversy. He vouch safes me no reply to any of the points raised by me, or to my overtures, thereby treating as brusquely, or so it appears to me, the instructions which he, as well as I, received from His Majesty’s Minister. ! await the event, confidently promis ing that His Excellency will support his owm instructions and enquire from His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, what steps he has taken to comply with them. I am not ] a little surprised to learn, rather'late in the day, that the Shiraz view has been forwarded to London, even before the Bushire view has been perused at Tehran, j and that I am expected to follow it up with a belated account of our Bushire j opinion. Messrs. Ziegler’s complaints and the letters from the Bushire Chamber of Commerce of March 1913 have f^ilv dealt with in the Memorandum attach ed to Sir P. Cox’s despatohvNt).• Tf-Cdait^ercial of 15th November, 1913, to which i venture to invit^.a reference, as afsa to despatch No. 4-Commercial of 19 AUG 1 SI 4-: ~^&lt; 5 (rviath February ion (No. 553 of 16th February to Government oflndia), where the circumstances attending the inception of the scheme are described. As regards the actual facts of the situation, there is no sign of the muleteers and donkevmen having been driven off the road during the 18 months of the scheme’s existence, and I see no reason to anticipate this eventuality in the near future. Should it occur, the forwarding ™? r . chants ’ meet f ^ 0 'f h [ 1 V»° r a t ^ specific purpose of considering transport conditions and fixing rates of hire, and who, it may be presumed, will be fully alive to the needs of the situation, can apply the normal remedy of a carefully considered rise in rates, until the supply meeis the demand. We are here inclined to attribute the occasional scarcity to the reckless commandeering of mules by the gendarmerie and the Qawam-ul- Mulk’s expedition rather 'than to the iniquities perpetrated by a bureaucratic despotism at Bushire. On the contrary, it is claimed that the numbers of animals, arriving in and leaving Bushire during the past four months, constitute a record and, during the month of June, not less than S ,738 animals left Bushire aden with ordinary merchandise for Shiraz. Merchants, at present, expect to clear off all their cinrks awaiting transport to Shiraz, within a month. I myself have recently attended one of the monthly meetings of forwarding merchants. In view of the present controversy, I w^as at some pains to induce His Excellency the Governor to put clearly before the meeting the fact that our forwarding arrangement was being sharply criticised^ at Shiraz and tnat it was represented that the merchants here were in terror of His Excellency and myself and did not dare to express a hostile opinion. His Excellency was good enough to do what 1 asked. The merchants ridiculed the notion that they were being driven in the matter and pointed out that, before the present situation arose, their partners in Shiraz were pressing them to come to some arrangement to curb the exorbitant demands of muleteers and to stop all the useless rivalry and quarrelling that forced up rates of hire. There was no question of a dumb assent; the more important members of the assembly came forward with reason ed arguments in support of their own arrangements. I think, therefore, that I am entitled to feel satisfied that the overwhelming majority of forwarding mer chants here, with the important exception of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., favour the continuance ofthe agreement. It is always open to those who feel themselves handicapped to suggest reforms in the organisation. At the last meeting of 7th July, an important modification in the method of distribution of animals was introduced in favour of forwarders of piece-goods The necessity of some sort of understanding between merchants to keep down rates of hire in these days of chronic scarcity of mules—a condition of affairs that dates back far beyond the days of the hire agreement—is shown by the recent action of merchants at Ahwaz, who have formed a combine to keep down the price of transport hire—so it was reported in a recent political diary from Ahwaz. It will be noticed from the correspondence that not a single constructive proposal has emanated from Shiraz. The arrangement has the strong support of the local authorities, and of the vast majority of the forwarding merchants at Bushire; it has received the open encouragement of my predecessors and myself, and I venture to urge that its root and branch abolition, and a return to the old conditions of chaos and mis management would be a distinctly retrograde proceeding. Lastly, should it be considered necessary, I would beg that Mr. Chick, now at home on leave, might be permitted the opportunity of a reply to. the Shiraz despatch No. 17, dated 3rd June, 1914, already noticed in my opening paragraph, before any final orders are passed on the questions at issue.

Yesterday, we had a long and interesting conversation with Fergusson, who, nth Manson, was good enough to come over to Sabzabad and spend a who e norning with us, devoted to a discussion of what I think we had better cad in uture the “forwarding agreement”, as Chick has, in a long and careful memo- andum, which I enclose, pointed out the inaccuracy of the term * Naqhen . I will try and give Fergusson’s objections^ to our “ forwarding agreement .nd 1 will begin by stating the argument on which he laid great stress and which, must say, impressed me least. It was a strong advocacy of free tra e ^or per laps 1 had better say “ leaving merchants free to do as they liked in the natter of forwarding. To this policy the first objection, a strong one, as tar as t goes, deals with smuggling. The Customs Department here consider that ■ our forwarding agreement ” tends to suppress smuggling. Mules are told off w the authorities and so there is little chance of the muleteers being able to inter into an agreement with a merchant to go off to some small coast port hey used to do, and convey up goods that have paid no duty^ The Custom , •herefore, will not consent to Shiraz or Bushire merchants for that “ at ® r ' :onsulted as to whether an arrangement, that prevents smuggling should be d.s :ontinued. , , I am told bv Fergusson that the Governor, rather inadvisably, I must admit set forward in support of the scheme, the advantage that the ^warding agree ment gave him a small tax per mule, the proceeds of which he was enabled to spent on municipal improvements.

This is why I say that Fergusson’s chief argument appealed to me least. The shoe does not pinch with you in Shiraz ; it is we here who have to settle all the quarrels and we cannot permit a return to the old chaos. I think Fergusson saw that in the end and was inclined to admit that Shiraz must find the remedy by submitting construc tive proposals. Finally, Fergusson promised to write that, after studying our statistics and especially the long list of signatures to our monthly agreements, Shiraz had no reason to complain of the Consul-General, Chick, Governor or any one else. Their main complaint must be against their own forwardjng agents who came forward monthly, like sheep, and signed a document of which they ought to know their principals in Shiraz strongly disapproved. He also suggested that I should ask you to call leaders of Shiraz Commer cial opinion severally and put our case before them. He says that they have never had it and you have it now. I hope that we shall be able, especially with Shiraz co-operation, to make a success of the thing and Shiraz that came to course will remain to pray. Make your contracts, at reasonable rates and bring in outside mules, camels or donkeys and we will help them here but let us know beforehand. We think in Bushire that you will have a heavy job of it, we don’t believe the mule transport is there, but we will be the first to congratulate you on a successful issue. (Sd.) S. G. KNOX. MEMORANDUM. Mule hire and forwarding agreement at Bushire. Sub-enclosure No. i of Enclosure No. i. i. Reasons for introduction. —T. he combination of Forwarding Merchants in Bushire with regard to transport to Kazerun, Shiraz and Maimand dates from the end of November 1912, when forwarding business was in a deplorable con dition in most of its aspects, as the result of the shortage of animals compared with stocks to be forwarded. It was only rendered possible by His^ Excellency the Governor and the Residency assisting merchants to cease their private feuds, and join for the public benefit. As a first result it has enabled the Persian and British merchants to work in a far greater harmony in all town matters than usual in Persian towns. The main evils, which it was then, and still is, in the consensus of all, neces sary to check were :— U) Exorbitant rates of hire. —During the summer of 1912 these rose to 50 Tumans (£27 per Ton) continued about 44 Tumans till the combination of merchants in December. They were forced up and maintained by muleteers and mule brokers joining hands to piay on merchants’ enmities and make the latter bid against each other. Forwarding agents in Bushire paid no heed to protests from Shiraz that these rates were ruining trade. This high hire made f ° rwar ^“ ing to Isfahan unprofitable. It was abundantly clear that the muleteers and mule brokers would have remained masters ot the situation, and that rates would not again have fallen below 30 Tumans, if this anarchy continued. The British Government a to pay about ^1,600 for 363 mules to Shiraz in 1912, all merchants on a similar scale. : (IS Affrays between employes of merchants over Owing to the dimi- W nished numbers of mules arriving in I9 i 2, merchants’ employes used CS8FD■ —~- to try and steal a march on each other by seizing the headstalls and leathers of mules, which had been already engaged by other parties ; and affrays in which both British and Persian merchants' employes were mixed up, were frequent, and much bad blood resulted, (c) Dukesh, Sekesh, etc .—There was no check on muleteers, who were in a position, and frequently used, to take goods part of the way up the road, then leave them, and return for other loads. Merchants used to complain that goods of theirs were in this way still unde livered at Shiraz after three or four months. (d) Advance Hire .—From the half hire, which used to be paid in advance in old days, muleteers had raised their demands to 80 and 90 per cent, and merchants severally were not in a position to stand out against this. (e) Forwarding via Ftrusabad, and other routes .—There was no control over the routes followed by muleteers and donkeymen, the latter of whom without exception used the various routes in the Firuz- abad direction, which are unauthorised by the Persian Government for the purpose of claims, and one and all pilfered and delayed arrival of goods to Shiraz. (/) Smuggling .—merchants were in league with special muleteers to proceed from Borazjun to Dilvvar, and then convey up-country large supplies of tea, spices, aniline dyes, arms, etc. From the date of the institution of the merchants’ agreement all these abuses have been remedied to a great extent. All British and Persian forward ing merchants have met monthly under the chairmanship of the Governor, arranged rates of hire, and discussed other matters in connection with the agree ment and distribution. Rates were fixed in December 1912. Krans 300 per 100 Bushire mans. March 1913. » 290 n 100 n (dukesh). April 1913. a 260 11 100 11 11 »i I 9 I 3 - » 280 11 100 n (yekkesh).

Dukesh has been abolished except for the grazing months, March and April Delivery at Shiraz was fixed for 14 days, in all save the grazing months. Advance hire was reduced to 75 per cent. The use of the Firuzabad route has been discouraged, and large numbers oi donkey caravans have followed the Telegraph (Imperial) route. u , f Sti ; u ^ Iiri g ha s been greatly checked, since all animals arriving at Bushin had to take loads thence for up-country. At the outset it was represented by Persian merchants that it would be impossible to get any merchants to respect a fixed rate of hire, and to prevent rates being pushed up, unless some system of distribution by an unbiassed party were introduced; otherwise the chief merchants would seize all the mules, anc the only way by which the smaller merchants would obtain any, would be by offering higher rates and so on, ai infinitum. This was recognized by af as correct in view of the small numbers of animals; and it was to meet this exigency that the Governor arranged for all animals to be proportionately distri- the Gomnmenf House 7 7 ° ne ° f ^ Governraent Departments working inThis system has been recognized by all as beneficial in other ways: it has saved merchants all the wrangling of old days over rates with muleteers : it enables the Local Government and the British authorities to obtain and book animals, when needed for Government purposes. The only difference it makes to merchants is that their forwardings do not take place at considerable intervals, and then in heavy consignments, but are spread in smaller numbers over each month. ‘ But the greatest asset gained has been the enormous saving effected by the lower rates of hire, as compared with the rates which ruled for months previous to the agreement, and which would have had to be paid, had there been no agreement. These rates were on an average 45 Tumans per too mans (736 lbs.) for piece-goods, the lowest-rated category There have been 36,809 animals, since the Agreement. Reckoning 90 mans per 2 mules— Tomans. £. the sum which would have had to be paid under non-agreement rates ... ... ... 745.335 = I 35»5 T 5 the sum paid on the minimum average of 26 Tumans, i.e., rate for piece-goods ruling under Agreement during the 16 months was :— ... ... 430,638 78,298 The Minimum saving in hire on mules above effected in 16 months, was therefore ... ... 314.697 — 57i 2 t7 There were also 32,559 donkeys for which on the minimum average under the Agreement some -£45,580 was paid. It is impossible to give an idea of what was paid on donkey hire before . agreement was instituted because no accurate statistics are available. It will be easily realised that this saving represents a great deal to merchants in Bushire, who, whether owners of goods forwarded or forwarding for firms in Europe, or for local Shiraz merchants, had to advance, under the former chaotic .system, up to 90 per cent of these rates out of their own pockets, in addition to paying Customs charges, and were often kept waiting for their money. In addition, the steady rates of hire prevailing since institution of the Agree ment have influenced rates of Shiraz-Isfahan road in the downward direction. They have kept down the rapidly increasing cost of many articles in the interior, e.g., under the rates prior to the Agreement sugar costing rather less than 4 Krans per man at Bushire, cost another 4|- Krans to foward to Shiraz: and goods forwarded for sale at Isfahan via the Shiraz road have been better able to compete in price with those coming via the Ahwaz road, and with those from Russia. 11.—Criticism of the Agreement from Shiraz. Misuse of term Naqlieh. The term “ Naqlieh ” appears to be misunderstood in Shiraz. The “ Naqlieh ” is an official department (’Adareh-i-Naqlieh) of the local Government, lodged in the Government House just as the ’Adareh-i-Baladiyyeh, ’Adareh-i-’Adliyeh, ’Adareh-i-Nazmiyeh, etc. It controls the census of transport animals arriving, and levies the conservancy dues to meet the expenses of removing litter made by animals ; these dues are paid into the Finance Department and included in the local budget. It also has other functions, and its staff is paid through the Finance Department. The appointment of transport animals is also at present entrusted to the Department ; but, were the Bushire merchants at any time to decide definitely to give up their agreement Regarding the distribution, which is apparently the objective of Shiraz criticism, this would not affect the permanency of the Naqlieh Department of the Local Government.The word “ Naqlieh ” should not therefore be used in the latter conneiction, but “ Forwarding Agreement 2. Arrangements not in hands of Committee.-~-\t has also been erroneously stated in Shiraz telegrams that rates of hire are fixed by a local Committee. They are fixed by meetings, held regularly each month, and are fully attended, at which all forwarding merchants, Persian and British, are represented. Messrs. Ziegler’s agents, though opposed to the principle, have so far attended regularly. Specimen copies of monthly rates, as signed by merchants, are attached. 3. Aims of Agreement. — The objectives with which this agreement was set up, have been fully explained in Part I of this Memorandum in Sir Percy Cox s despatch No. 30/554 (of February 16th, 1913, No. 4-Commercial to the Foreign Office) ; and in his despatch No. 96 of October 5th, 1913 (N°- i 4 “C ( / rTlrnercia ‘ to Foreign Office) all of which require to be considered in this connection. It has been clearly shown therein that rates of hire, such as those prevailing between Bushire and Shiraz for more than a year previous to the_ Agreement, made the forwarding of most goods from Bushire to Isfahan impossible from the point of view of competition with goods reaching Isfahan from Russia ; and did not even permit of the Shiraz-Isfahan route serving as an alternative feeder to the Ahwaz-lsfahan road, which is so difficult at times. Those rates of hire ranged between £ 27 and ^22 per ton from Bushire to Shiraz alone,—a preposterous figure—and rates from Shiraz to Isfahan brought the through rate up to nearly ^50, whereas the normal rate up to 4 years ago did not touch a third of that figure. To take one instance of damage done from high rates, in 1906-07 some ^98,000 of Marseilles sugar was sent up from Bushire, the greatest part for Isfahan: while by 1911-12 His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan was complain ing that the import of all sugar from the South was only 35 per cent of the total import to Isfahan as against 65 per cent from the North, exactly the reverse of the figures ot a few years ago. This loss falls on the British firms, which used to buy and export that sugar for Isfahan, whereas now it is ordered from Russia ; and secondly it has meant a loss of trade from the Persian Gulf, as against trade vid Russia to Central Persia. Moreover we now have British refined sugar coming to the Gulf, which cannot thus reach Isfahan. Piece-goods are being confronted with a similar handicap by rates ot hire, though less severe. Unwarranted exploitation of merchants by muleteers and brokers had to be stopped, if British interests in the revival of forwarding vid Shiraz to Isfahan were to be furthered : for reasons stated, merchants in Bushire could not stop it except by a general agreement binding on all. They were incapable of such combination, as so often happens in the East, unless with the strong support of the local authorities in this case, the Governor, the Residency and the Customs Department, who were all, more or less interested from different points of view, and whose consent to its abolition will have to be obtained, if abolition is really to be seriously considered. 4. Alleged damage to British interests. —The Agreement was therefore instituted in the interest of British General trade—not in Shiraz, but in Isfahan. “ Our whole objective must be to retard, as long as possible the capture of the Isfahan market by Russian trade, and for this reason the movement in Bushire to bring back prices of transport from the South to normal level is entitled to our strongest support ”. It should be remembered that individual interests of British firms do not always coincide with British interests, as a whole, more particularly with the interests of the British Government in certain specified objects. 1 1 he whole volume of trade from the Gulf to the interior of Persia and its increase is a British interest. Had there been any ^likelihood of that volume r V • \ /9 C88FD bemg diminished any way by this Agreement, the Residency at Bushire would not have put it forvyard, nor still support it. The facts and figures given below will show that the volume of trade to Shiraz has not decreased in such a wav as to point to general British interests in Southern Persia being injured. ^ The statements made in some of the telegrams from the Shiraz Consulate about “ important British interests ” are vague, and precise details and figures are requisite, before we can ready appreciate Shiraz objections. The statement that it is detrimental to “ import trade ” requires proofs • neither the .import trade returns, as given by the Bushire Customs Department* nor statistics of forwardings, support this view. ’ It has also been alleged that “ in the opinion of persons best qualified to to judge, arrangement, far from benefiting British trade, is dealing it a severe blow, and is already leading to the ordering of Russian goods from the North. Russian goods, among others kerosene and some prints, have for years reached Shiraz from Isfahan ; caravans from Shiraz proceed to Resht every year with skins, and return ; but in view of the small numbers of transport animals working on the Isfahan road, there is little fear of Russian goods being ordered in any quantity. That there is any connection between the ordering of Russian goods from Isfahan, and the Bushire Forwarding Agreement, is, to say the least, improbable. 5. Position of Shir as merchants in regard to the Agreement .—It is already shown above that the Agreement was not devised for the benefit of merchants in Shiraz, but was made primarily in general British trade interests, and secondly, in the interest of those in Bushire immediately concerned, upon whom fell all the difficulties of the old chaotic system. In telegrams from Major O'Connor the opinion is expressed that the views of the Consul at Shiraz and merchants at Shiraz must decide with regard to forwarding arrangements from Bushire, that the Shiraz merchants are principally concerned, that the majority of Bushire mer chants are merely commission agents. The view is erroneous in fact, and quite inadmissible in practice. It would presuppose that Bushire merely existed for the benefit of Shiraz trade. Firstly, as regards trade to Isfahan, merchants in Bushire state—as is borne out by the scanty forwarding from Shiraz to Isfahan of the last few years, that more than half the goods which used to be sent to Isfahan vid the Shiraz route were the property of merchants in Isfahan ; about a quarter, especially sugar, was sent up to Isfahan by Bushire merchants for sale on their own account; and only a fraction apper tained to merchants in Shiraz. Secondly, a considerable portion of goods sent to Shiraz is on account of the Persian importers in Bushire : and, so far as British goods are concerned, the seat of control is in nearly all cases in Bushire, not in Shiraz. Messrs Ziegler &amp; Co , though accepting the Agreement at first, have from the beginning from m t ves of private advantage over competitors opposed it. In 1912-13 (9 months of which were previous to the Agreement they only forwarded one-tenth of all piece-goods forwarded by British companies up thejroad. Their views, which have been before the Board of Trade in London, and reported on at great length, are those of one in a minority against all other merchants in Bushire. They have already evolved a scheme of their own to work in consistency with the Agreement, and proposed it through the Foreign Office; their proposals are welcomed from Bushire, as they will tend to bring more animals on the road. During the year 1913-14 they actually forwarded 4,780 bales of piece-goods, as compared with 2,418 only in the previous year, while their total forwardings were 2,921 loads as against 1,374 in 1912-13. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co. Ltd. rarely have goods for Shiraz; during the past year they only sent forward 207 packages of piece-goods, and about 68 tons total goods.The head offices in Southern Persia of the following British firms, whose goods go to Shiraz, are tn Bmhre, and the interests of these firms in omraz are subiect to the control of their agents in Bushire Messrs. H. C. Dixon &amp; Co. A. &amp; T. J. Malcolm. M E. D. Sassoon &amp; Co. fi David Sassoon &amp; Co., Ltd. ,, D. E. Somech 8t Co. fi A. Elias &amp; Sons. „ Isaacs Brothers. „ Haji Ali Akbar &amp; Sons, Ltd. )f Holdsworth, Bougie &amp; Co. „ Times Dharwar &amp; Co. „ M.J. Mowla. „ J. Musabhoy. L. Malcolm. The only independent agents for British firms in Shiraz, whose views are no doubt those stated in Shiraz telegram, as representing British interests in Shiraz, are those of Messrs. Zieglers’ and Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co., Ltd. In the one case it is a matter of old history, well known from previous despatches and cor respondence with London: in the other, their interest is too small to count against the interest of the accredited agents of all the other firms in Bushire. All the agents above-mentioned have been supporters of the Agreement: their signatures will be found attached to the monthly proceedings, and rates (specimen copies of which are attached). The impression gathered by Major O’Connor from Mr. Gibbs, the Bank Manager, as to merchants in Bushire being now opposed to the Agreement is incorrect. As long as the accredited agent^of the almost complete list of British firms interested in forwarding to Shiraz hold to the Agreement, and are convinced of its utility, it cannot be said that it is prejudicial to British trade. For that matter, the head offices of all the firms mentioned in London, Manchester and Bombay are personally acquainted, or in correspondence with the Commercial Adviser to the Residency at Bushire, and would certainly have written to him, did they consider that their interests were being prejudiced by the Agreement. No communication on this subject has, however, been received. In further connection Major O’Connor’s contention that his own opinion and that of merchants at Shiraz were not consulted and should prevail in such a matter, it may be pointed that when the Agreement was initiated, Major O’Connor had hardly arrived at Shiraz, that he and most Persian merchants at Shiraz have either not seen Bushire, or at least not seen it under present day conditions, and are, therefore, not in a good position to advise as to the remedy for the difficulties and abuses which confronted the forwarding business in Bushire. Merchants in Shiraz do not have to cope with these difficulties, and they cannot expect to veto carriers’ efforts to improve the conditions, under which they carry on business. The contention is much the same as if consignees in Bradford objected to regulations of the railway company forwarding goods from London, or if consig nees of goods shipped to the British company forwarding the bulk of goods on the Ahwaz road objected to that company’s system. All goods landed by British India steamers at Bushire will shortly be conveyed by Messrs. Gray, Paul &amp; Co’s, lighterage service under regulations and probably increased charges. Have merchants in Shiraz, or Bushire, any right to claim that their goods shall2nd 8 months :— — Mules.

As regards mules the decrease of ^OQ’^oo mules during the past 8 months is sufficiently explained, when the following considerations are borne in mind (a) W M (d) w The Gendarmerie have constantly had mules under hire, as many as 400 during their movements in the autumn (as mentioned in monthly telegrams). This and their treatment of muleteers, have as was anticipated in Residency telegrams when they first came on road, and has recently been complained of in Shiraz telegrams, had an unfavourable influence on mule transport. Several muleteers had become in 1913 heavily indebted for previous purchase of mules, and fodder of animals, and went bankrupt. The Quwam-ul-Mulk took some 300 mules on his Lar expedition. The tendency year by year is for the number of mules to decrease. „ r UA luuuer ana g ram m t , arsa Dashtistan and high prices during the first seven months of t 2nd period have naturally caused muleteers great difficulties ai made them prefer work on other Persian roads.

Origin and temporary nature of the protest at Shiraz.-Ownv to the small numbers of transport animals reaching Shiraz during the winter months of ,9 ‘l 3 ; 14, f lg PTm 5 of [ odder ’ and scarci ty were being felt most by muleteers and donkeymen ; while at the same time there was a large accumula tion of imports at Bushire, merchants in Shiraz appear to have blamed the For warding Agreement as the cause of the non-arrival of goods, without taking into account the real reasons. The protest to merchants in Bushire and to the Gover nor-General was recognized as the work of two or three merchants, who have their own axes to grind, and those private notives are well known in Bushire It is typical of Persian towns that when a few merchants have a grievance and draw up a protest or telegram, all the rest consider it politic to sign. Private letters from Shiraz have shown that the bulk of signatures were not really in favour of upsetting the arrangement. The institution of the Agreement was warmly welcomed in letters from most Shiraz merchants to merchants in Bushire—the former had previously to the institution been upbraiding Bushire merchants for ruining business in Shiraz by paying exorbitant rates of hire. This is recognised rather grudgingly by Shiraz merchants when, as quoted in one of Major O’Connor’s telegrams, they say that they assented to this arrangement as the “ lesser of two evils”. The greater evil is the killing rate of hire ” and both are due to insuffi cient supply of transport animals. That Shiraz merchants were perfectly content with conditions under the Agreement has been read repeatedly in letters received at Bushire during the past year. The protest at Shiraz was reported by Major O’Connor on March 6th, Shiraz letters and telegrams to Bushire merchants were dated some days earlier. But the fact remains that from beginning of March merchants in Shiraz learnt of the large stocks being moved by the great influx of transport animals to Bushire; up till now—the 10th April—merchants in Bushire have received no telegrams or letters objecting further to the forwarding or Hire Agreement. Careful enquiries have been made of all the chief Persian merchants and agents of British firms in Bushire. The following are specimen replies :— No, 1 u He had received no complaint from Shiraz regarding the forward ing arrangement in Bushire, since the time they telegraphed, neither in writing nor otherwise from any of his correspondents. The Shiraz merchants were now all quite satisfied as their goods were on the road. I heir complaint a month ago was by reason of the small number of animals. Every one recognised the benefits of the Forwarding Agreement. Stocks in Bushire had been heavy throughout the year, owing to the scarcity and small purchases in consequence, except recently when sugar had become scarce owing to small forwardings.” No. 2.—“ He had received no complaints, and nothing had been written to him on subject since the first telegram. Even then, that had been the work of two or three merchants only: the rest signed against their judgment. It had been clear to ail that the reason for short arrivals of animals in January and February had been due to scarcity of fodder on the road.’* No. 3.—” In view of plentiful forwardings in March merchants in Shiraz were no longer complaining about the arrangement at Bushire. The reason for the complaint a month or so ago was due to paucity of animals at the time.” No. 4 .—“ Had heard nothing from Shiraz for a month on the subject.” No. 5.—“ Had received no complaints from his clients in Shiraz since the original one. They then had bills to meet in goods and com plained with reason of the lack of animals. He had always written to his correspondents, and similarly to Ziegler’s Manager, that this had nothing to do with the Forwarding Agreement, which was not locking animals up in godowns. It was the natural result of scarcity. However, there were excellent reports for this year, and all were content.”14 No , Had heard nothing from his correspondents in Shiraz against the Agreement.” they n are m they ar^beUCT than'ihe'fd'lartic'^^ of affairs, and there is nothing radically wrong to justify their abolition. The coming summer and autumn » ^ lth a plentiful hardest, will show if the number of transport animals decreases or not. If the Shiraz Consulate can put forward an alternative scheme (i) for ensur ing that rates of hire to Shiraz will not exceed tne normal rates of supply and rwind of 7 years ago 15-20 Tomans, and will not run up again to overdo Tomans, and («') for increasing the supply of transport animals ™°'very is the minimum necessary—(which mules cannot supply alone) there ev y likelihood that all will welcome it in place of the present Agreement.

In continuation of Sir P. Cox’s despatch No. 14-Commercial, dated Bushire, the 20th September 1913, I have the honour to forward herewith copy of a Memorandum prepared by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Adviser to this Resi dency in which he discuss^ in greater detail the project for motor transport between Bushire and Daliki, the first portion of the caravan road to Shiraz. Though Mr. Chick is not able to give full estimates of the cost of the under taking the figures he does give of possible gross profits which I gather would amount to ^15,000 per annum as against working expenses of ^ 2,400 ^ upkeep of road and initial expenditure of 2,000construction of road-it this is^inevitable—over an easy stretch of 60 miles, would seem to show that he sucraestion has distinct commercial possibilities and is worth further detailed examination by experts. In the hope that it may be found possible to arrange for such detailed examination-and Mr. Chick’s absence on leave to England this summer would seem 'ord a favourable opportunity for further discussion at Home-I venture to submit the project for further consideration. In this connection it may be as well to invite attention to Shiraz telegram possibilities of modern transport on the Bushire-Shiraz rout . A copy of this despatch has been sent to His Majesty’s Mimster at Tehran and to the Government of India. £ ) ■ OxH Sub-enclosure 1 of Enclosure. Memorandum.

Reference was made in a previous ™ 3048^ 5 * Octo- spatch No. 14 (Commercia ), o 2 f the nee d 0 f improving means ite from Bushire. . actions made in that It would appear that in considering the ™ that noth i„g should emorandum the Government of India were P A 4 AUal9t4,v y # C31FD2 be done in the way of a motor road for the present, but considered that the con* struction of railway lines from the South Persian ports to the interior had become a real necessity. There can be no doubt that each year the need of a railway line, both in the interests of Great Britain and of British trade from the south, as also in those of the local population is being more widely realised. But even under the most favourable circumstances, such as an early solution of the difficulties in connec tion with the concession for lines from Bandar Abbas and Bushire, can we hope for the construction of these lines to be begun within five or eight years ? Mean while the existing difficulties which confront trade from the coast to the interior, e.g., to Shiraz, are more likely to increase than otherwise, and the value and bulk of the import trade to Shiraz as well as to Central Persia, will remain limited to its present proportions, or more probably will become more restricted. For the breeding of mules for transport purposes seems to have declined all over South ern Persia; as mules die they are not replaced. The same complaints of dearth of mules are to hand from the Ahwaz-Isfahan and the Kerman roads. When the memorandum mentioned above was written, the possibility of utilising motor traction of the stretch of road between Bushire and f aliki, and by this means relieving themselves and consignees up-country from the financial burden caused by thousands of loads of goods lying constantly at Bushire and failing to reach their destined markets at the proper season, had already begun to agitate traders in Bushire. Since that date the matter has frequently been mentioned to me again ; prices of the lorries necessary and capital required have been asked and, as I see it, the views of those chiefly concerned are hardening to a decision that until they obtain motor transport there will be no improvement in their trading difficulties with Shiraz. Some, who are men of some wealth, say definitely that they will subscribe largely to such a company (always with the proviso that European capital and management should be obtained as well). The Governor of the Gulf Ports voiced this view the other day in connec tion with the instructions that had been sent him by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at Sir W. Townley’s request, and in pursuance of the approval of His Majesty’s Government to suggestions made in the memorandum mentioned above for co-operation between the Persian Governors and British Consular Officers in obtaining an adequate supply of transport animals. His Excellency said he considered a motor service greatly needed ; that he had been thinking over the matter and how the necessary capital could be raised. It was evident to him that Bushire could only subscribe a small portion of the sum required : •n Shiraz the merchants were hardly any better off, and such magnates as his friend Qawam-ul-Mulk were financially embarrassed owing to heavy mortgages and depreciation of their properties. His Excellency wondered whether the ruling Khans of the districts in the neighbourhood of Bushire and Daliki, i.e. Shahbankareh, Hayat Daud, Borasjun, etc., who all had great wealth lym. 0, idle could be induced to help to finance such a scheme. This idea, having taken hold of local opinion, will probably spread until it attracts attention ousjde trading circles in Bushire and Shiraz. Such a prospect seems to offer a certain amount of danger that interests other than British might initiate a scheme for motor transport between Bushire and Daliki. For this reason the local need, and the scheme as a commercial proposition, merit careful examination by His Majesty s Government and the Government of India Recent news that motor transport is wofking between Rasht and Tehran is causing people in these regions to realise possibilities of initiative and their own wants more than ever. If there be a current of local opinion in favour of motor transport, then I submit that British interests should put themselves at the head of such a movement rather than ignore it and run the risk of others putting forward a scheme. r &amp; Besides the beneficial effect that motor transport for part of the way to Shiraz might have on the volume of trade carried up country, it would appear a distinct advantage for British interests endeavouring to obtain a concession for a railway connection between Bushire and Shiraz that British interests were already largely concerned in a motor transport service from Bushire. 711 3 Motor Transport as a Commercial Proposition.

More accurate statistics kept in the Residency of the actual weignts of goods forwarded upwards only in March 1912-13 and l 9 l 3' 1 4 g lv e the following results for the hire ruling on piece-goods, the lowest rated category. The actual hire disbursed was however undoubtedly far more as piece-goods only formed J —% of the whole:— The section of the caravan route from Bushire to Daliki—three stages or a day s journey by caravan, out of the whole ten to Shiraz—covers about 60 miles out of a total of 185, or roughly one»third of the distance to Shiraz. Approximately speaking therefore, the minimum cost of transport of merchandise up-cowitry only from Bushire to Daliki by the main route cost ^40,011 in 1912-13; and even after merchants in Bushire had combined to check the extortionate demands of muleteers and kept rates at a more moderate level in March 1913’14, the minimum cost during the last year was about ££ 33 &gt; oi 3 - In addition to this last figure, a third of the transport rates paid on some 2,000 to 2,500 tons of goods which are brought down country from Shiraz to Bushire annually, at much lower rates than up-country hire, it is true, but still productive of a very large sum. And further in 1913-14, some 2880 tons of goods were sent inland from Bushire via Shief, for transport chiefly by the Shief road to Borasjun—goods which would go by the main route to Borasjun, if a cheaper and quicker means of transport were available. Making all allowance for the very substantial reduction on the present high rates of animal hire, which may be expected from a motor service—even if the latter charged only one half present rates—a very large income would still be obtained annually. According to the prices quoted by makers in England, the cost of the ordi nary 3-ton Motor Lorry is about £joo —^800.

Even as it is, carriages are frequently driven from Bushire to Borasjun. From Borasjun to Dahki there is certainly a good deal of rises and fells in ihe ground for oneWnd of the distance, and the ground is very stony, but the foundation seems hard. Whether it would be feasible for motor lorries, heavily laden, to be run constantly over the road from Bushire to Borasjun in its present state is a matter for examination for competent engineers, Messrs. T. Cosser &amp; Co. Limited, who have the contract for the new Customs House at ^ ushir ^ entitled under their contract to bring up a motor car for their personal use du g the work : and I had hoped to arrange with the Managing Director who is a skill d engineer, that he would bring up one of his firm s cars to Bushire before I le on leave, and that an attempt could be made in company with the Officer of the Roval Engineers attached to the Residency, to make a thorough test of the road in a motor car, with the object of obtaining their expert opinion as to how tar road construction would be necessary before motor lorries could be run. That has not been possible up to time of writing ; but in view of the opening for motor enterprise that is occurring to most people at Bushire, it is very desir able that some early opportunity should be found for the Assistant Engineer attached to the Residency and others to examine and report on the road care fully. If little in the way of roadmaking is necessary for 8—-9 months of the year, then there seems no reason why a company should not be found to import motor lorries, and run them for the transport of merchandise. ^ Speaking under correc tion 1* think that no concession is needed for motor vehicles to run over the ex isting roads in Southern Persia, provided customs duty has been paid on the cars, any more than for vehicles drawn by animals. His Majesty’s Government might even, after further examination by experts, decide that there was good reason to apply for a concession for the road to be metalled, and a company given exclusive rights of transport on it. Whether the expense of metalling had to be undertaken or not, the capital outlay would seem likely to be small in comparison with the large revenue to bet 1 dalv, able to I Town?, on f that 6||00 •countrj etuniins 0 of tie tbattle a raisel acoiBi- obtained Jorasjuni he 3 -)i Ec 1! it oad fora : present 1 the best Alniadi )bjection, , is firm but not ven from 1 deal of is verf ) be ton ate is a er &amp; Co., .hire, are i ae during asliW fore I left 2 r of tie [the road hour f ar • d n t , ’ ^i a , nd - ? s stated above . the fact that the transport of goods to Daliki was the hands of a company run and partly financed by British capital would seem a considerable asset for future negotiations regarding railway concessions.

I have the honour to report that, for some months now, a controversy has been proceeding between Shiraz and Bushire on the subject of the forwarding arrangements at Bushire of goods destined for Shiraz. I have no wish to trouble you for the present with the arguments for and against these arrangements with which however, Sir, your Bushire experience must have rendered you personally far better informed than I, as a newcomer, can hope to be but, as I have found myself constrained to comment, unfavour ably but I hope without harshness, on the methods employed by His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, in conducting this controversy and, as both Major O’Connor and myself are the servants of the Government of India, I have, with some reluctance, come to the conclusion that it is my duty to place the more recent official corre spondence on the subject before you.

I have just received from Resident copy of his despatch No. i4-Commercial, dated 28th September last to address of Secretary of State with Memorandum from Mr. Chick attached. This Memorandum contains various suggestions on commercial matters which principally affect Shiraz merchants and trade and which depend for their execution on Consul, Shiraz. These suggestions have apparently been under consideration of Your Excellency and Secretary of State for some months without any reference whatever having been made to Consul, Shiraz, and instructions have now been issued by Foreign Office on matters affecting Shiraz trade regarding which I have had no opportunity of even express ing opinion. I venture most respectfully to invite Your Excellency’s consider ation to these facts. Naqlieh question already under consideration shows what damage may be done to British commercial interests by the adoption of scheme affecting particular commercial community without that community or the Consul who is in touch with them and whose duty it is to voice their interests being given opportunity of expressing them views. I shall address you again regarding certain suggestions contained in Memorandum in question, some o which appear to me to be unsuitable and ill-considered, and in meanwhile l would respectfully beg that in future before decisions are taken on matters which attect principally Shiraz mercantile community and when suggestions are put forward by Resident on such matters for consideration of Your Excellency and Secretary cu State, Consul, Shiraz, also may be given opportunity of expressing opinion.Enclosure No. 2.

Jownley, K.C.M G., His Majesty’s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, at the Court of Persia, Tehran. I have the honour to solicit a reference to Shiraz telegram No. 195, dated 25th May 1914, on the subject of the forwarding arrangements at Bushire. On receipt of Your Excellency’s telegram No. 79, dated 8th April, I ad dressed His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, informally holding out what I believed to be a helping hand and offering, not without misgiving, considerable departures from the strict principle on which the forwarding arrangements have hitherto been carried on. It is no part of my duty to comment on the method he has adopted, but I cannot refrain from expressing my regret that he should have thought fit again to trouble Your Excellency without, so far as I am aware, making the smallest attempt to arrive at some compromise with us here or ever discussing the matter. Apparently nothing short of complete surrender will satisfy him, and I believe it must be patent to Your Excellency that it is impossible for me, as a newcomer, even if I wished to do so, to upset forthwith arrangements that were organised by my predecessor, Sir Percy Cox, and his Commercial Adviser who had studied the'question closely for years ; that had received the agree ment and cordial support of His Excellency the Governor, the local Director of Customs and all the forwarding merchants of Bushire save Messrs. Ziegler ; and lastly, that have received the full approval of the Board of Trade and His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.It would seem to me that the proper course—and one which I was ready to adopt with all good*will and a sincere effort to arrive at an understanding would have been for His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, and myself to have threshed out the question together informally or officially and, should we have been so un fortunate as to fail to arrive at some understanding, to have a.sked Your Excellency to submit bur differences of opinion in the last resort to His Majesty s Foreign Office, who will, as His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, appears to hold, be the authority that must decide the matter, should we continue to disagree. Up to the present, my overtures have been acknowledged and nothing more. I am extremely anxious to avoid controversial topics in this difficult matter, but I cannot altogether pass over in silence the following passage in the telegram under reference “ I learn from Bushire also that almost entire mercantile com munity are opposed to arrangement and I have received copies of protests which have at different times been addressed to Resident and Governor His Majesty’s Consul has certainly not applied to this Residency for copies of protests nor has he sought to inform himself through the usual official channel as to the state of commercial opinion at Bushire. If he had been good enough to do so, he would probably have been in possession of more accurate information on these subjects. I venture to think that I am entitled to ask Your Excellency to invite him to explain whence and by what means he became possessed of this information, as to procure it otherwise than through the usual official channel and then to quote it in official correspondence appears to me a method savouring of lack of official courtesy. I am anxious to escape the ugly inference that His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, in his zeal for the commercial interests of Shiraz, has deliberately set himself to work to undermine at Bushire and by rather dubious methods a policy that he knows to be that of the Governor and this Residency, and to engineer an opposition against it. Opinions may perhaps vary as to whether it is part of the duties of His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, actively to seek to inform himself other than officially of the state of commercial opinion at Bushire, but I submit that there can be no doubt that it is emphatically not the way “ to contrive to come to some arrange ment ” on a difficult controversial question.

CONFIDENTIAL. BUSHIRE-SHIRAZ ROAD. Bushire forwarding Arrangement. No. 17. Dated Shiraz, the 3 rd June 1914 . Sir, In continuation of the correspondence ending with my telegram to your address, No. 195, dated 18th May 1914, on the subject of the “ Forwarding Arrangemnet ” at Bushire, I have the honour to submit herewith the following remarks accompanied by certain papers which bear upon the matter. 2. Your Excellency will observe from the first enclosure (A) that the corre spondence on the subject between Shiraz and Bushire was begun by me in my tele gram No. 40, dated 6th March 1914, after the receipt by me from the Persian mer chants at Shiraz of a strongly worded protest against the arrangement. This pro- test was signed by all the leading Persian merchants in Shiraz without exception, 1 and it lays emphasis on the fact that the arrangement is unpopular and damaging to their business, and that it is having the effect of driving mules off the road. In my telegram No. 40 I invited the attention of the Resident to these considerations, and to my observations he replied in his telegram No. 310, dated 14th March (paper B attached). This telegram, as Your Excellency will observe, is not couched in very conciliatory terms, and amongst other arguments advanced is that the agitation against the arrangement at Shiraz is factitious and ignorant .15 «„ X had carefully gone into the matter myself before the despatch of my tele- foTafaV—^ i then nroceeded to ask for written opinions on the subject from the manager N £ i * j ■ p n i, r P ers i a (Mr. Ferguson, a man of great experience in Persia, of the Imperial Bank Persni ivin g for some 7 and wkl ir; condMoj. . 1 - to. a. manager of'the firm of Messrs.

I attach copies of the letters of manager or rne m observed that the correspondence is informal and InTfficW-butTYour Excellency will make allowances for this, it will be seen that tW wntlemen hold strong views, and that the arguments they bring forward are worthf of eyeful consideration. I also discussed the matter with Mr Gibbs, who had newly arrived from being manager of the Bnshire branch of the Bank to take “ similar duties temporarily from Mr. - e i “d 1 “mmumcated his views to Your Excellency m my telegram No. 125, dated 26th IVlarcn. 4 I can perfectly well understand, however, that in spite of the strong opinions expressed regarding this arrangement by myse f, and by the two Bank managers, andTy the wlole commercial community of Shiraz, and as communicated to you in mv telegrams Nos. 107,125, and 133, Your Excellency would naturally be re uctant ^advoSte the abolition of an arrangement supported by such powerful backing as that of Sir Percy Cox and his expert advisers at Bushire, especially as YourE lency was probably unaware that a very strong feehng existed also amongst the com mercial community at Bushire against the arrangement; and on receipt of your telegram No. 79 to Bushire (repeated to me No. 67), dated 8th April, I decided to refrain'from any further steps in the matter until I had received some communi cation from Bushire explaining m more detail the views of the Resident and Mr. Chick (for as Your Excellency will have learned from the contents of my various telegrams I have never been consulted regarding this matter, and hgve not even seen copfes of the correspondence which has passed on the subject); and I have since received from Major Knox a demi-official letter, dated 18th April, forwardmg a long Memo by Mr. Chick. This Memo, is too lengthy for me to have copied in my small office, but no doubt the Resident will submit a copy to Your Excellency if so desired, and the general tenour of Mr. Chick s arguments will be gathered by a perusal of the leters of Mr. Gibbs and the manager of Messrs. Ziegler and Co. (papers M and K herewith attached). My own observations m reply to this Memo. I will submit lower down. 5 Meanwhile the local agitation against the arrangement has continued unabat ed Naturally the strength of any such agitation will wax or wane according as the transport conditions on the road temporarily deteriorate or improve ; but the tact remains that the merchants are unanimously opposed to it for reasons which 1 have already indicated to Your Excelllency, and which will be found ably presented m the attached copies of correspondence. On the 23rd May I held a meeting of all the prin cipal importers of British goods (British and Persian) at the Consulate, and put be fore them to the best of my ability the various arguments employed by Mr. Chick m favour of the arrangement. I regret to say that these arguments failed to impress or to influence the merchants in any way. The general tenour of their replies will be found voiced in the letters of Messrs. Ziegler s representative, and in the letter of the Bushire British Chamber of Commerce to Sir Percy Cox, dated 13th May 1913, of which I attach a copy (paper D). The muleteers also are agitating in the matter. I have received several deputations from the chief “ charvardars ” and they are exceedingly bitter against what they regard as the virtual confiscation of the whole of the road transportation service, and the arbitrary distribution of their mules at arbitrary rates of hire. Several of them announce their intention of leaving the road for good and all this summer; and in no case, I fear, will it be possible to tempt them to return, when once they have gone elsewhere, as long as this arrangement continues. 6. I may mention here that I have recently learned with considerable surprise that the impression conveyed by some of the communications of the Bushire Resi dency that the Bushire mercantile community generally favour this arrangement seems to be quite erroneous. I do not know whether the Resident has made Your Excellency and His Majesty’s Government acquainted with the protests of the Bushire British Chamber of Commerce against the arrangement, but I can scarcely10 suppose tKat he has failed to furnish you with copies of the correspondence which has passed between him and the Chamber on the subject. But in case copils of t4 correspondence have not been submitted to you, I enclose (papers C andD) copies offetters from the Chamber to the Resident, dated 20th MLh and 13thMay l9 3 in which the views of the Chamber are very clearly and, as I think, ably expressed’ Mr. Gibbs, who was at that time manager of the Bushire branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was present at the meeting m question and subscribed to the latter letter. I understand that the Chamber still maintains the same opinions as are expressed 111 these letters. I also enclose (paper J) a translation of a letter recently addressed by the Persian merchants at Bushire to the Governor at that place protest ing against the arrangement. The Persian copy of this letter was handed to me by the Governor-General here at the request of the merchants. I do not know precisely who the signatories were, but believe them to have included all the principal Per sian merchants in Bushire. No doubt the Resident could ascertain this and en lighten Your Excellency on this point if desired. I may add that it is not easy to discover what is the real opinion of the Persian merchants at Bushire. Like all orientals they hesitate to express any views which they believe to be op posed to those of the authorities. The British merchants, as Your Excellency will observe from the attached correspondence, have no hesitation in condemning the agreement in the strongest terms. I am given to understand that the sentiments o'f the Persian merchants are very similar, but they are not so easily ascertained. 7. I now propose to submit a few remarks of my own in reference to the argu ments put forward by the Resident and Mr. Chick in support of the arrangement. 8. In the first place I may say that as far as the registration of the mules is con cerned, and the levy of a small tax for municipal purposes, I have no objection to put forward. These arguments have been adduced by the Resident and by Mr. Chick in favour of the arrangement. It seems to me that this is only to obscure the real issue. The registration of transport animals, and the levy of municipal taxes, are recognised arrangements, now about to be introduced at Shiraz, and elsewhere, and regarding which Your Excellency has issued a special circu lar to Consular officers in Persia ; and if the system of registration is so extended and improved as to act as a check upon smuggling in the Gulf Ports, so much the i better. No reasonable person can object to such precautions. But as I have said above, to bring forward such arguments in support of the arbitrary distri bution of mules, and the arbitrary fixing of rates of hire, is to obscure the real issue with irrelevancies. ' 9. Putting aside these, and some other equally untenable arguments, the chief arguments put forward from Bushire in support of the arrangement are as follows :— (1) Prevention of free competition amongst the forwarding agencies at Bushire, which, before the introduction of the forwarding arrange ment, led to much wrangling, and to the enhancement of rates owing to the competition of one merchant against another for transport. (2) Reduction of the rate of hire to a uniform and reasonable level. 10 . As regards No. 1 it may be admitted that a fierce and unseemly wrangling amongst forwarding agencies is a disagreeable feature of the forwarding business at Bushire, which it would be desirable to abolish, or at any rate to miti gate, if possible. But every reasonable man of the world must recognise at the same time the fact (which has been very forcibly and ably emphasised in some of the attached letters), that competition is an essential feature in business. Any arbitrary interference from outside sources with such competition must necessari ly lead to all kinds of difficulties and objections. The point is so clear, so general ly accepted, and so ably argued in the attached papers, that I think I need scarcely insist upon it further myself. If a merchant in the interests of his own business is prepared to pay a higher price for transport than his rivals, he clearly has the right to do so ; and when the means of transportation are shared amongst a number of private owners, it is clear that the rules of competition must prevail in the matter, and that such competition must form an integral and mevitable part of the system, unless the Persian Government (or a private com pany or individual) is prepared to buy up all the transport animals on the road C 230 FD17 a 4 - fn mrrv eoods under certain fixed conditions.

But in any case no masses of,figures, however accurate, can a er taUacmus guia . , J T d is be i ng hampered by arbitrary and arti- ficialrestrlctions ^whic^areCondemned by almost afl the persons whose interests are principally involved, and which will beyond question have the effect of driving numbers of mules off the road if persisted in. 12 As to possible remedies for the present state of affairs, this is another matte?’altogether In their letter, dated 22nd January 1914 to the Secretary Xstate for India, the Government of India refer to the organisation of transport service on the Nushki-Sistan route 1 his is a matter with w ich I waslntimately connected for some years, as also with a similar arrangemen on the Sistan-Meshad route; but the methods adopted m those cases differed verv widely from the method now m force on the Bushire-Shiraz road. The e we^had akystem of “camel contracts”, concluded with persons who were willing to supply camels for the transport of goods at certain definite rates, an under certain definite conditions. There was no compulsion of any kind, and mer chants were free to take advantage of the contracts, or not as they liked. Another system is in vogue on the Gilgit road where (when I was there some years ago) a regular government forwarding agency conducted the transport business. And I have had experience of transport arrangements also on the Tibetan frontier, where the circumstances of the case presented special difficulties and complications. But in all these cases (as in all others of which I have ever heard) no attempt has been made to commandeer the entire free transport of a road, and to impose upon it arbitrary conditions of working m the teeth of the opposition of the persons chiefly interested. 13. The possibility of arranging some such contract on this road is perhaps wnrth considering, but my study of the question does not lead me to think that it is feasible—at any rate at present. The old-fashioned methods of working have their disadvantages, it is true: but they have continued to serve the interests ot trade very well for generations. The policy of the Consular officers at both ends of the line should be, I think, to encourage mule and donkey-owners to frequent the road, and to render the conditions on the road as popular as possible, bucli a policy will lead automatically to an increase in the numbers of transport animals Lrd so to a lowering of rates—in accordance with the ordinary principles ol supply anrl demand. But even this will not eliminate competition, and indeed there is no legitimate means of doing so except (as suggested above) for the State, or a private company or individual, to purchase, or contract with the entire transporta tion service of the road, and to hire out animals to all persons concerned at faxedIB xates. But any suet measure is, of course* quite impracticable under tbe condi tions at present prevailing in Southern Persia. 14. In my various telegrams to Your Exeellency on this question, I have expressed the opinion that before any such arrangement as the Bushire Forward ing Arrangement came into force, the Consular officer at Shiraz should have been consulted; and that the mercantile community here also had every claim to be considered and. consulted in a matter which so vitally affects their interests. In Mr. Chick’s Memo.'received from the Resident, referred to above, this point of view is warmly combated. Mr. Chick says: “ The agreement was not devised for the benefit of the merchants at Shiraz, but was made pri marily in general British trade interests ”. ... so far as British goods are concerned the seat of control is in nearly all cases in Bushire, not in Shiraz ”. . . . “The head offices in Southern Persia of the following British firms, whose goods go to Shiraz, are in Bushire, and the interests of these firms in Shiraz is subject to the control of their agents in Bushire ” (here follows a list of the firms referred to). And there are other remarks in his Memo, to the same effect. 15. These remarks are totally erroneous and misleading, and display a really extraordinary misconception of the commercial conditions prevailing in this part of Southern Persia. I will endeavour to make the matter clear to Your Excel lency. 16. British goods imported into Persia via the port of Bushire are, with the exception of course of those intended for consumption at Bushire itself, destined for three main distributing centres, Kazerun, Shiraz, and Ispahan ; and they may be classified under two main headings: first those which are consigned by English houses direct to their agents at those centres; and secondly those which are ordered from England by Persian (or British) indenting merchants residing in one of the three distributing centres. Of the first category of goods Messrs. Ziegler and Co. are the chief importers, and they have their agents at Shiraz and Ispahan. The rest of the import trade (with insignificant exceptions) is in the hands of Persian merchants, who import goods which come under the second category. These merchants indent upon British firms in England for their piece- goods, etc., and in almost all instances the ultimate consignees, who are respon sible for the sale and distribution of the goods, are resident in the three distribut- j n g centres. There are also, it is true, certain merchants resident at Bushire, who import British goods, and send them up-epuntry on commission sale ; but they are in quite a small minority compared with the merchants who reside at the main distributing centres inland. The persons, therefore, who are principally interested in the sale of the bulk of the merchandise imported from Great Britain are those (it seems scarcely necessary to have to state such a truism) who pay for the merchandise and who have to sell it; and of these persons the great majority reside, naturally, at the centres of distribution. It is totally misleading to state as does Mr. Chick, that the “ seat of control is in nearly all cases m Bushire’ not in Shiraz.” At a recent meeting of all the principal importers (both British and Persian) of British goods, held at the Consulate, I propounded this theory of Mr Chick’s. It met with universal astonishment and absolute denial. It is indeed, on the face of it, untenable. If Your Excellency desires I can send vou details of the principal merchants doing an import business here, and of the business they do ; and my facts and figures can be confirmed by the manager of the Imperial Bank. But 1 venture to dope that what I have said, combined with the remarks contained in the attached correspondence, will be sufficient to dis- pose of Mr. Chick’s arguments. 17 The point, in fact, which I wish to bring out is that any interference j with the transport arrangements at Bushire, affects primarily the merchants at Shiraz and ako to a somewhat lesser extent, those at Kazerun and Ispahan-but fl TY of the Ispahan merchants differs somewhat from that of the others, m so rfho t H they cannot get their goods sent up Shiraz, they can have re- mU w Abwaz route (please see the remarks of Messrs. Ziegler’s Agent on this sort ^ %^ W “X nt s P at Bushire are in almost all cases (there are, as already stated^ 'some ^Significant exceptions) merely forwarding agents, who simplyi 19 carry out the instructions of the indeifting merchants at the distributing centres' as regards forwarding to the best of their ability. 18. These facts are, I think, beyond contention, and it is surprising that they should ever have been called in question. And this brings me to another point ^ to which I have already referred in my telegrams to Your Excellency : namely a. the failure of the Resident at Bushire to consult the Consul at Shiraz with regard to this arrangement at any time, or even to inform him that such an airange- ment was under consideration, or had been brought into force, or to send him copies of the various despatches to your address and to that of His Majesty &amp; Government on the subject. Even if we suppose that, as asserted by Mr. Chick, the interests of the Shiraz merchants are subordinate to those of the Bushire mer chants, it must, I think, still be admitted that they have considerable interest in any arrangements which affect the forwarding of their goods—m fact it is a simple common-sense proposition that the persons at both ends of a certain line of com munications must all be interested in any arrangement affecting that line : and it is clear that mutual consultation between the two British representatives at either end of such a line must necessarily be desirable, and will tend to the smooth working of any arrangement or plan, and will obviate difficulties. Yet m the pre sent instance, as stated above, the Consul has been completely ignored by his colleague at Bushire, and no attention from the start has been paid to the interests or wishes of the commercial community at Shiraz. 19 I have left many points untouched in this despatch, and can, if desired, supply Your Excellency^ with further and more detailed facts and figures in reply to the arguments put forward from Bushire in support of what I regard as an indefensible arrangement, but I trust that the above remarks, when consider ed in conjunction with the expressions of expert opinion contained in the attach ed correspondence, will be sufficient to convince Your Excellency, and His Majesty’s Government, that the present arrangement cannot continue. It is opposed by the Governor-General of Fars y by the entire mecantile coim munity here, by the late and present Bank managers^ and by a considerable body of merchantile opinion at Bushire. It is so unpopular with the multeers that it will beyond question result in a serious diminution of the sole means of transport on this execrable road ; and as long as it remains in force it will be impossible to tempt back muleteers who have once left the road, or to induce fresh muleteers to come in. As pointed out by the representative of Messrs. Ziegler’s firm it favours continental at the expense of British goods ; and as pointed out by Mr. Ferguson it is already resulting in the ordering of goods from the North instead of from the South. I therefore advocate its immediate abolition ; and when that has been secured I will use every effort to arrange the return of the animals who have now left, or are leaving, the road, and to induce mule-owners to bring fresh animals in; and in these efforts I shall have the cordial co-operation of all persons in the province, from the Governor-General down to the smallest merchant. A copy of this despatch is being sent to the Secretary to the* Government in the Foreign Department, and to the Resident in Bushire. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, W. F. O’CONNOR, Major.

From—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The 1st Assistant Resident, Bushire. • 1 f 1 M* 3 n Ce r e A strong P rotest signed by all leading Persian merchants here agams Naghheh Arrangement now m force at Bushire. I have consulted also representatives of British firms here and they agree with Persians in matter. Bank manager also shares their views. Merchants point out that although thev assented to this arrangement in first instanqe as lesser of two evils they have since found that it has very bad effect upon traffic on road and their business here. They say that it has disorganised whole transport on road and has led to decline in number of mules. They are unanimous in attributing present scarcity of mules om road in great part to this arrangement and as you probably know muleteers universally detest it. Merchants beg immediate abolition of restriction and return to principle of free supply and demand. I suggest that you should consult prin cipal Bushire merchants also on matter, but at same time it should be remembered that majority of them are merely forwarding agencies and that it is merchants here who feel pinch and who are most competent to give opinion. Bank manager tells me that arrangement is having most damaging effect upon trade generally and as direct consequence merchants are beginning to order goods from North instead of South. Enclosure 2. B. Telegram No. 310, elated Bushire, the 14th March 1914. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. Your telegram No. 40. Aware of factitious agitation in Shiraz during past few weeks which Governor states has been got up by Behbehani firm for reasons connected with smuggling in which they engaged in past as you will know from your records and certain busy bodies. You have probably seen Governor-GeneraPs telegram to Governor here of 26th Rabi-al-awwal, No. 8338, which has been convincingly answered in Governor’s telegram of 1st March, communication of facts given in which please obtain from Governor-General; if Shiraz merchants have no copy. It gives present situation. Chick who has dealt with question of transport for some years and knows details intimately reports as follows. Statement of Shiraz merchants that present arrangement has caused scarcity of mules on road disorganized transport is in flagrant contradiction of figures. It should be remembered that every transport mule and donkey leaving town for nearly two years has been counted and figures are before us here while Shiraz merchants are talking absolutely at random as they have no statistics. As Governor stated in his telegram for three months previous to introduction hire Agreemnt in 1912 mules leaving Bushire were 1,847, 3,193, 2,486. During summer they continued average 2,200 to 2,400 and during past month Rabi-al-awwal, 906 mules instead of 855 same month 1913. Larger number now arriving, but allowance must be made for military requirements past few months which seem likely continue. Truth is there is little hope under present conditions of mules exceeding 2,600 monthly and numbers are yearly decreasing, while how there are 24,000 loads here for transport. Shiraz merchants do not grasp that however mules are hired they cannot hope get up more loads monthly than now in aggregate- while under old system there will be added disadvantage enormous rates hire. It was 50 tomans before present arrangement in 1912, when our government had pay 1,600 pounds for 363 mules and trade generally double it pays now. Naturally muleteers prefer old system. Bank manager might be told that it is not arrangement which is causing damage to trade, but increasing dearth of mules yearly w ic is i ^e y con i nue whatever happens and calls for radical attention as has been pressed by Residency on Government for some time. Merchants m Bushire are frequently meeting and met March 1st when all present Persian and Bntisn representatives C230FDI except Ziegler fixed and signed rates of hire for present month. Now that you have above^ facts before you I f-fel sure you will discourage^yeaTand what has been a great reform and maintained rates st y y y half, Enclosure 3. C. Dated Bushire, the 12 th March 1913 , From—The British Chamber of Commerce, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to convey to you the result of a meeting of this Chamber held on Wednesday evening, 19 th instant, at which the present Naghheh ar rangement for transport of goods from Bushire to Shiraz, and the efiect of such arrangements on British trade were considered. The Hire Agreement has been in force now for some three months and my Chamber has thus been able to consider the question with actual working “xperSe before it. It has desired me to convey to you the following results of its deliberations:— . . ^ , » “(11 That the Naghlieh arrangements which have necessitated the actual counting of British and other merchants’ stocks and which make it obligatory on all parties before any addition can be made to their stocks in the Naghlieh books, to produce actual customs Jawazes lor that Department’s inspection, are in our opinion arrangements which introduce a system of over-sight of traders’business which is contrary to all our ideas of transacting business with the least amount ol publicity possible and are therefore most undesirable. “ (2) That the mere fact of all mules arriving, being allotted in accordance with merchants’ stocks, immediately interferes with the hitherto recognized individual trading and competition and moreover abso lutely prevents any merchant whose stocks are low from taking advantage of any information he may be able to obtain as to the desirability of forwarding. Such a merchant will indeed find him self frequently in a position of having to wait a very considerable time to move a small lot of goods and thus be unable to reap the benefit of any favourable fluctuation, in price at the consuming centres. “ (3) That the present arrangements, having been found to bind every one, whether in agreement therewith or not, appear to us to introduce a compulsion into our trading which we are very much opposed to. A case has recently come to our knowledge whereby a British fi rII h which was formerly a party to the Agreement, subsequently notified everybody concerned of its withdrawal. w Noth withstanding this, however, the said firm was unable to procure mules and, moreover, the muleteers which had contracted with that firm, to supply a certain amount of transport were arrested and imprisoned by the local authorities. “ Our opinion is that the said firm was. quite in order in proceeding as it did, and we think the action on the part of the authorities was not only quite irregular but also placed the firm concerned in a very in vidious position. “We would therefore request you to take such steps as you may consider necessary to effect the release the muleteers in question so that the said firm may be put to no further inconvenience, and that the very undesirable predicament in which it has been placed may be removed without delay. ^ (4) That from all the information we have obtained there appears to be no doubt that if the present agreement has been of advantage to any- ! body it is to the forwarders of continental sugar, We cannot find any evidence of direct advantage to British trade and indeed we are r22 :rr:i y tUytiA|™ hestCT piece - goods trade ha - been “ (5) We would also respectfully put before you that much as we desire be? 1912 0n vet^e ^ ^ a * Which ^ St0 ° d U P toDecem - ber 1912, yet we cannot but express our views that attcmni^ the 6 fact^T 1 ^ ° ne t0 h f0rC f rat f S ° f hire d ° Wn ’ ,notwi tbstandmg the fact that the number of mules working on the Bushire-Shiraz road is woefully inadequate for the large quantity of goods offering for transport, cannot but end m failure. ” ^ unt il M I Cllamber haS re(1Uested me t0 res P ec tfully point out to you its opinion, that (1) the reduction of the exorbitant Rahdari charges on the Shiraz Road can be brought about ; (2) the general security of the road for transport can be assured, the requisite number of mules cannot be looked for. With the safety of the road and smaller exactions animals offering would not only increase in number but rates would speedily and naturally decline. In conclusion I have the honour to pass to you my Chamber’s further request that you will use your good offices to have the present Agreement cancelled at the earliest possible date, as, in the^opinion of my Chamber, the arrangement cannot be amended in such a manner as to effectively remove the above-mentioned objec tions. Enclosure 4. D. Dated Bushire, the 13th May 1913. From—The Bushire British Chamber of Commerce, To— Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, I have the honour to inform you that at a meeting of this Chamber held on the 8th instant, I had the pleasure of reading your letter No. C.-122 of the 20th March. Contrary to the' opinion you express, the letter addressed to you was the re sult of the considered opinion of the majority at a properly-called meeting of my Chamber. The suggestion made that the objections raised were formulated from the isolated point of view of one of the firms interested is not in accordance with fact. ‘ I have been desired to intimate to you the Chamber’s sense of regret that you should have thought it necessary to minimise the value of the opinion on this for warding question of the two firms who do not to any extent actually participate in transport, and I have been requested to remind you that the interest which a bank and a shipping agent have in forwarding questions is perhaps second to the interest of no one, and that any interference with the regular movement of goods would make a very marked difference to such institutions for the reason that the trade at Bushire depends to such a very large extent on the transport of merchandise. Expressing the hope that you will agree with the above-mentioned views, I now beg to refer to the various points numerically set forth in your favour under reply. 1. Oversight of traders' business .—The very fact of the “ Naghlieh Department ” insisting on counting over merchants’ stocks is totally at variance with business methods, and this department cannot be placed on the same footing as the Customs Department. I would mention that the Naghlieh books are open to inspection at any time by any one, as a check on their accuracy, and this is not the case with the Customs books.2 . Individual Trading .—This point I regret to see has not been dilated on by you. Apparently from your communication under relpy you have overlooked the fact that competiton is essential to business, and it is, in the opinion of my Chamber, impossible to expect that such competition can be removed. In my letter of 20th March I pointed out that a merchant holding small stocks and seeing an opportunity of availing himself of a favourable market up-country would at present be prevented from seizing this opportunity owing to his being unable to secure the necessary amount of transport under the Agreement. As regards the competition and rivalry, to which you refer, as having existed K nre the institution of the present arrangements, these are the recognised results to be expected in all branches of business. Whenever there is a large demand for trans port and few mules offering it stands to reason that merchants will pay the highest rate they can possibly afford in order to secure mules. If they do not, they of course lose the opportunity of forwarding. 3 . Introduction of compulsion into business .—My Chamber has already stated its views with regard to this, and still adheres thereto, and it sincerely hopes that the present state of affairs will be amended with the least possible delay. Allowing that the present method of allotting mules is indispensable to the working of the Agreement, it seems a most arbitrary proceeding to compel firms t whose business is curtailed by such a scheme to conform thereto, and I would also refer you to your remarks to the effect that when the great majority of merchants hold that the Agreement is an advantage to trade, individuals or a small minority should give way to the views of the majority, I have to inform you that my Chamber cannot accept this view, and would emphasise that it is contrary to all commercial practice, and in this connection I have been requested to express to you my Chamber’s regret that its opinion as set forth in my letter of 20th March has not met with the support it anticipated it would receive. Even if there were no objection to the Agreement under discussion, it has to be borne in mind that the introduction of compulsion into business would form a most undesirable precedent which my Chamber considers must be resisted to the utmost. 4 . Continental sugar .—I regret I cannot agree with your views regarding this. There is no getting away from the fact that 99% of the piece-goods imported into Southern Persia represent British manufactures, whereas continental sugar does not. British capital is only indirectly affected by the import of this sugar whereas the import of British piece-goods directly concerns British capital, and it is to be regretted that my Chamber’s opinion with regard to this is not in accordance with your views. You are perhaps not aware that it was the unanimous opinion at the previous meeting of this Chamber, and this view has again been confirmed, that the present Agreement has been of decided advantage to continental sugar forwarders, and a corresponding disadvantage to piece-goods senders. The significant (point ?) to which you have failed to give due weight is that not one of the members of my Chamber transports sugar up-country. As you are aware mules arriving are apportioned in accordance with stocks which individual merchants hold for transport. When I point out to you that sugar arrived last year in Bushire in the propor tion of more than three packages to one package of piece-goods, it will imme diately be apparent to you how detrimental the Agreement is to piece-goods traders generally. My statement may be confirmed by reference to the Vice-Consular Report for 1909-10. On referring to this it will be seen that though the actual number of pack ages of piece-goods imported was nearly times less than that of sugar yet the value of the former was about 2j times as great as the latter. Since the Agreement came into force the excess of arrivals of sugar as compared with packages of piece-goods has been very much more marked, and I give you24 below the approximate details of the January, February and March:— respective imports for the three months, January Sugar. Piece-goods. .. 20,682 Nil February .. .. 22,710 5,322 March . v .. 21,441 1,466 Total .. .. 64,833 6,788 packages. You will thus see that any apportionment of mules on the basis of stocks at once gives sugar forwarders an overwhelming advantage over piece-goods senders, which was not the case before the Agreement came into force. The great advantage however, does not end here, for the simple reason that sugar forwarders are able to avail themselves of donkey transport, as well as mule transport, whereas piece-goods senders are debarred from forwarding by donkeys on account of the weight of the loads. All individual efforts to arrive at a general agreement whereby piece-goods should receive satisfactory preferential treatment in being taken into stock by the Naghlieh, have resulted in failure. The majority of merchants in Bushire are sugar forwarders and naturally realising the advantages accruing to them under this Agreement, and also being aware that the scheme has your support, it is the opinion of my Chamber that they cannot be induced to recede from the very favourable position which they have been enabled to attain. Though the Chamber does not consider that it affects the main point of its argument against the Agreement, still it would like to point out that on enquiries from Ahwaz being made no confirmation can be obtained as to there being any agreement in force at that centre. Some two years ago, attempts were made to wards this end, but they ended in failure. Neither has my Chamber any information as to there being a similar agree ment on the Bandar Abbas-Karman road. The c jndition of course as regards the river channel to Baghdad cannot be classi fied under the same heading as road transport as mules, seeing that there are only two available lines of steamers by which goods can go forward to Baghdad. In conclusion I have therefore to request your favourable consideration of the further points which I have now placed before you, and to express the Chamber s hope that you will see your way to take some course of action so that matters may be pl ace(i on such a basis as would be found acceptable by all British traders.

F. Dated the 27th February 1914. From— Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co. at Shiraz, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. We have the honour to give you, as requested, our views regarding the Naghlieh. At the time the Naghlieh was formed, the prevailing rate of hire from Bushire to Shiraz was between Krs. 400 and Krs. 450 per 100 maunds, and there seemed very little prospect of a decline unless all the merchants combined and refused to forward goods except at a lower rate. The formation of the Naghlieh certainly brought about a decline in the rate Of hire, but at the same time it has never been favourably received by many of the merchants, both here and in Bushire, chiefly because, there not being enough mules for all the merchandise awaiting transport, they are distributed amongst the different merchants according to the number of loads each merchant has in stock in Bushire, thus debarring merchants from paying more than others to get their goods forwarded quickly. We agreed to the arrangement at the time, because we considered it to be the lesser of two evils, preferring a slower despatch of our goods to the exorbitant rate of hire then demanded by the muleteers under the old system. It has since been felt that the Naghlieh has tended to decrease the number of mules on the road, the muleteers preferring to ply for hire on the roads where the rate of hire is controlled simply by supply and demand. We also feel that* now that “ Rahdari ” has been stopped it is very unlikely that the rate of hire would again advance to Krs. 450, and although the abolition of Naghlieh would no doubt cause a temporary rise in the rate of hire, this would probably soon be regulated by the return of muleteers to this road. Taking every thing into consideration, we are of opinion that it would be ad visable to revert to the old system. Enclosure 7- G, Extract from a letter from the agent of Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon and Co., to Messrs. Livingtone, Zeytoon &amp; Co., Shiraz, dated Bushire, the 4ih March 1914. Mules. —Yes, these are very scarce just now. It seems they have all runaway from the route on account of the Naghlieh Agreement or Hire Agreement. We under stand the Shiraz merchants have jointly wired to the Bushire merchants to have same cancelled. The Bushire merchants have written the Governor to cancel same, but it seems that he has not agreed. Enclosure 8. H. Dated Shiraz, the 18th March 1914. From—M. Ferguson, Esq., Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, To—His^Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. I have read the Resident’s telegram regarding the Naghlieh with interest. He says there are 24,OCO loads in Bushire awaiting transport. To whom does all this merchandise belong? Bushire or Shiraz merchants? If (and I am sure it is) mostly the latter then as you say the owners of the goods are dead against the Naghlieh to a man, because they feel the injustice of interference in their own freedom. It may be argued that the removal of the Naghlieh will not help them to get their goods any quicker, but as the control does not help them either in that respect there is no reason to maintain a cause of irritation to the men to whom after all we look% to keep tip British trade in the South, The Bushi™ rmWko + , mission agents and are not particularly interested are ^ earl y a11 com*- expeditiously or not, in fact the'tC ^ greater opportunity for piling up charges 7 and in addition nf 11 fo ™ ardm f The Governor’s telegram to which the Resident refers gave the following reasons as advantageous by the Naghlieh : ^ wing (a) the prevention of smuggling, (b) the raising of funds for municipal works in Bushire, (c) the encouragement and assistance of the smaller traders. About the first I cannot speak, hut it occurs to me that charvadars who the Resident admits, prefer the free system might find it more profitable to go to small ports where smuggling is possibly carried on and get better hire. The second is a preposterous reason which in no way concerns the Shiraz importers. The Governor of Bushire draws a tax of some fixed sum per mule which it is very difficult to persuade the merchants is in reality appropriated to the object named. The third is very well in its way, but if we profess a concern for British trade we will do more by helping the large importers with whom in any case the smaller cannot hope to compete, I very much doubt if these smaller men benefit for the bigger men in any case prefer to forward for their more important clients. The figures of mules shewn cannot be put forward in support of the arrange ment because in all experiments at first nothing untoward is visible it is only time that shews results and gradually a disastrous state of affairs is being brought about. The advocates of British trade are driving men, who have never dealt with anywhere but Britain and British India, to turn their attention to th6 North and Russian goods in which if a trade is once established here it will be very difficult to oust. I hope I am not prophetic. The Resident points out that it is the dearth of mules which is the cause of damage to trade and not the Naghlieh. Can the sup porters of the arbitrary control of transport and interference in the freedom of action of merchants put forward any scheme to increase the transport ? Why do Ziegler not join in with the arrangement, they are the most important and in dependent of British importers ? The high rates of hire ruling some time back were due largely to the unsafety and terrible extortions prevailing. Now that the Gendarmerie have stopped those exactions that cause is withdrawn, on the other hand we have dearness of fodder, but this is not in human hands. With splendid crop prospects we may even hope to see that removed. There seems to me only one point in favour of control and that is that mer chants are too much inclined to outbid each other and rush upaxtes but that is surely their affair, if profits will stand it I see no cause to interfere. Judging from the com paratively few bankruptcies during those months of high rates and bad roads it would appear that merchants were well able to meet heavier charges. Personally, with freedom and improved conditions as regards “ Rahdari ” and prospects of cheap er fodder I think transport would undoubtedly be attracted once more to the Bushire road Control will only keep it away. I heard of an instance where merchants hired a large number of donkeys from Firuzabad especially to bring up sugar long delayed in Bushire, but even these on arrival in Bushire were subjected to the Nagh lieh rules and the merchants lost money over their attempt, a perfectly legitimate one to help their own forwarding. If the merchants are not allowed to deal freely with these accumulations of months then we may expect to see numbers of them m difficulties which in the end will reflect on future orders and a marked deciease m the Customs returns will be the result. The supporters of the Naghheh appear to take a very limited and narrow view of the whole question. Now I note the Resident uses the expression “ busy bodies ” and I presume ho mins Demons who are not actually merchants like myself. He makes a vast misSke however because if anyone is interested in the welfare of the merchants, 0 (S/4'4W *- 1 f' II not a “ factitious ” one, but general and sincere. _ hank Merchants cannot be expected The matter rs a very grave one etc indefin itely.

I return the telegram your kindly sent me. Enclosure 9. I. Dated the 22nd March 1914. ji' rom ]y[ R . G. George, Representative of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co. at Shiraz, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, Many thanks for your letter of yesterday in connection with the Bushire Hire Agreement and for the Naghlieh Department, and note that you have telegraphed to the Minister in Tehran regarding same owing to the unanimous opposition, offered at Shiraz against the existence of this most pernicious arrangement. I sincerely hope that effective means will soon be employed towards its immediate abolition. I am able to come forward frankly and sincerely to denounce the Bushire Hire Agreement and Naghlieh, and to say that the importers of British manu factures have suffered greatly under this Agreement, which, if allowed to con tinue, will truly and assuredly entail very serious consequences to British trade and to importers. The Persians were slow in realizing the backwardness of the scheme and this account for the Agreement turning into a compulsory act soon after its introduc tion which was offered at first by its promoters in the form of a tentative measure. When dissension begun amongst the natives in Bushire, Movagher-e-Dowleh very unfairly suppressed such movements and gave them to understand that the Agree ment was one of insistence. Ever since matters have gradually taken a serious form under the Agreement, for not only traffic is disorganised but importers can not get their goods up which means that their capital is simply locked up in Bushire. This means a heavy blow to natives who are generally weak financially and who can only work according to current market tendencies, i.e., bring up their goods at current rates of hire and sell at once at best possible in order to keep up standing and revolve Capital and Credit as promptly as ever possible. At a very late hour they have found to their disgust that under present conditions, this is not feasible and the problem which now confronts them is so serious that they are sorely despondent. r28 The Naghlieh boasts of maintaining rates at a certain Wol * under-nsB in rates. What benefit is there for merchants to see hire aT about Krs. 260 per 100 maunds when they even cannot get up their most Dressing quirements ? With a good demand or a rising market importers can well a ft end to pay higher rates of hire hereby bringing up their goods at once and profiting on their ventures whereas under the Hire Agreement importers are informed of rates at about Krs 260, but owing to the dislocation of the prolific mule transport on the Bushire-Shiraz road, cannot be moved up with the result that interest S accrued on the ventures and market loses its activity in demand by the time the goods reach Shiraz m which case the loss is most serious to importers. Kates of hire must advance and decline according to circumstances. They will advance when are above the average and automatically decline when ship ments are about the average. \\ ithout the Hire Agreement and Naghlieh mule teers would, without any hesitancy, revert to their old favourite route and rates will as explained, fluctuate for or against importers just we find in prices for all foreign productions which fluctuate according to demand. In fact when once the mule traffic attains its normal figure in the supply of animals we shall witness much lower rates than what we have seen under the Bushire Hire Agreement. Although matters may now be considered to be very serious there yet will come a day when we shall see the Bushire road practically closed and Shiraz dependent on the North. Formerly regular and important sendings were on the Bushire road and this kept up also the regular traffic on the Ispahan route, but unfortunately the Naghlieh Arrangement has altogether dislocated the whole route between Bushire and Ispahan as the following will explain. After the Kawam’s successful campaign against the late Askar Khan and others it was fully expected that the North road would re vive as before and although there has been absolute safety on that road the Bushire Hire Agremeent has discouraged the camelmen coming in from the neighbour hood of Ispahan owing to absence to sufficient and regular loads. The last few cara vans that came in from Ispahan were obliged to go down to Bushire as they could not afford to return empty to Ispahan. We have now no means of forwarding to Ispahan and as long as the Bushire Arrangement exists the muleteers and camelmen will avoid Shiraz and Bushire altogether. This will suffice to show that forwarding on the North road has been considerably less than the quantity forwarded before the Hire Agreement in spite of the insecurity which prevailed during the Arab depreda tions. The following may also interest you very much. We land our Ispahan ship ments part at Bushire and part ar Ahwaz owing to the difficulties caused by the Naghlieh. The Ahwaz work being prompt owing to there being no Naghlieh the goods are expedited and reach destination very promptly, whereas the Bushire portion remains there for months owing to absence of animals, and is again reshipped ' to Ahwaz for despatch through the Bakhtiari country. This should portray the miserable condition prevailing on the Bushire road. The decrease of mules on the Bushire road is in no way due general insecurity and high prices of fodder. Before the gendarmes took control of the road the petty Khans were exacting high Rahdaris and forcing muleteers to buy fodder from them at fancy prices and yet charvadars were able to continue working on this road. With the abolition of the Rahdari and forcible buying of fodder muleteers do not grudge present prices for the upkeep of their animals. What keeps them out of the road is the Naghlieh which is the only cause of the upheaval of the caravan traffic. In my opinion the only means for reviving the caravan traffic on the Bushire road is to abolish the Naghlieh as speedily as possible, otherwise I am sure matters will go from bad to worse and finally present a very serious and awkward position. C230FD\ 29 Enclosure 10. Translation of a letter from the Bushire merchants to th z Qmernor °t Gulf Ports, dated Bushire, the 26th March 19Id. A- C. Reference to NagHieh Department. As most of our merchandise are property of the Shiraz merchants who have repeatedly telegraphed here that Naghlieh is prohibitive to freedom of commerce and also unlawful, and have insisted upon its removal, we share their beliefs, and request you to remove this arrangement, so that the merchants and the muleteers might be free. n Enclosure 11. K. Dated Shiraz, the 18th May 1914. From—M r. C. George, Representative of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co., To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. I Lave carefully studied the report submitted to you by the Bushire \ ice-ConsuI Mr. Chick in reference to the Bushire Hire Agreement and Naghlieh and beg to offer my comments thereon as follows :— Reasons for introduction. —Tne reasons assigned for the introduction of the Agreement are altogether irrelevant inasmuch as trade competitions must have its course according to tendency of demand. To term such competition as “ private feuds ” is distinctly erroneous. When forwarding business was rendered difficult owing to shortage of animals compared with stocks to be forwarded it was solely due to the great insecurity which then prevailed on the Shiraz-Kazerun section of the road, which compelled most of the muleters to abandon the road, and if to-day a reversion should take place to the same lawlessness, the same deplorable condition in forwarding would face us again. Exorbitant rate of hires. —From Mr. Chick’s explanation I infer that all along he has not been cognizant of actual facts which led to the rise in the rates of hire. Com petition had nothing to do in the matter and if through shortage of mules hire rose to unseem figures, it was the result of political chaotic conditions which had removed all vestige of orders or control on the road. I therefore attribute reasons for such high rates of hire to a continued depredation of Boir Abmadis on the Shiraz-Kazerun section of the road and of the anarchy through acts of lawlessness committed by divers hands on the road. The attitude of Boir Ahmadis was not defiant and as no measures were taken to suppress their raids on the caravan traffic (by the authorities) they soon became elated and thus begun wholesale lifting up of caravan on a large scale. In some raids as much as 200 mules with loads were taken and gradually the position became so unwretchedly bad for muleteers that they perforce abandoned the road and with remaining mules diverted their course to other secure routes. Only few remained to face their chance, while in some instances some were practically bankrupt having lost all their mules. Hence the shortage of mules. (b) The high exaction of lawless tufangchis and the attitude of the Khans towards charvadars who were fleeced both for Rahdari and fodder supply. This influenced rates in the upward direction as such exactions had reached to a stupen dous figure. Affrays over mules. —Such instances as cited by Mr. Chick are momentary which soon disappear when conditions improve. In every branch of trade competition according to tendency of demand will strive for superiority over opponent’s doings, and if some form of law was existent to regulate mdiscreet actions of forwarders such happenings would soon cease to exist. Dokesh and Sehkesh.- -If such sendings have been checked we have now the long detention of goods at Bushire, owing to the shortage of animals compared with stocks to be forwarded. Advance hires. Mr. Chick is no doubt unaware of the actual state of things ex isting under the Hire Agreement. If before the Hire Agreement muleteers demanded80 ox 90 per cent of the hire in advance and merchants severally were not in a posi tion to stand out against this, then what is the position to-day under the Hire Agreement ? Surely the 80 or 90 per cent, demand has not improved for it still exists. Here are actual figures which I give from roadbills as settled with muleteers. 34:. Total hire. Advance hire paid in Bushire Balance paid at Shiraz £3. Total hire. Advance hire paid in Bnshire Balance hire paid in Shiraz Krs. 1,728-30 1,530-00 198-30 1,732-50 1,485-00 247-50 which put the advance hire to the following figures, viz., say 88\ and 86%. You can now see for yourself whether or not other unsupporting figures of Mr. . Chick are reliable or not. Forwarding via Firuzabad and other routes .—This route (Firuzabad) is employed by donkey men only. This and the Jereh routes were only employed by muleteers when through anarchy the Kazerun route had to be abandoned and only after obtaining Solat’s protection and guarantee. The Persian Government likewise officially recognised the route and during their use caravans were plentiful and had the effect of driving down rates from 26 tomans to 10-12 tomans, whereas goods with 14 days' roadbill came in 10 days. Here I most vehemently refute Mr. Chick’s statement that “ one and all pilfered and delayed arrival of goods to Shiraz.” Smuggling .—This is still active, but there is no doubt that this illicit trade has decreased considerably. The Hire Agreement has done nothing towards its sup pression and it is really monstrous to attempt to lend color to the agreement by fallacious ingenuity. Those special muleteers ab out whom Mr. Chick makes reference in his report are still in league with certain merchants and their work continues unabated. The only reason for the decrease of this illicit trade is the vigilance on sea by His Britannic Majesty’s Gunboat whereby the charges for smuggling have risen to uncriminating figures to owners of goods. Those who ha/e to conduct smuggling operations seeing the kind of risks they have to take and face have commenced demanding high sums which has discouraged people who deal in smuggling trade. By the Hire Agreement it is absurd that it controls the passage of mules while on the road, its control only begins when once mules enter Bushire, so that if out of, say 700 mules 50 remain at Borazjoon and rest proceed to Bushire the JVaghlieh is perfectly unable to detect such discrepancies. When I was last time on the Bushire road I met a big caravan moving to Shiraz which had never entered Bushire. The whole consignment represented smuggled tea and before I had learnt privately everything connected with the charvadar’s journey, I had already guessed the affair from certain indications quite unusual with ordinary caravans. The Naghlieh .-—Readers of Mr. Chick’s report cannot favour his eulogistic definition of this so-called official department and the work performed by its members cannot in any way satisfy trade interests and will always be subject to criticisms, Savina effected by the Hire Agreement—1 cannot understand how Mr. Chick can assert that had there been no agreement the rates which ruled previous to the agreement would still have had to be paid. In fact I hold the opposite view and de clare that without the agreement hire would have receded considerably owing to imnroved conditions of the road and stoppage of Rahdari and other exactions since the control of the road by the gendarmerie. To get supporters to this much favour ed scheme he comes forward by factitious items of gam as a result of Hire Agreement31 aiid submits figures based on the topmost rates at wbich figure only most urgent goods were forwarded. On the whole I consider his figures erroneous and misleading and so framed to suit his purpose which is in direct opposition to British interests. Ispahan-Shiraz route. —That the Hire Agreement has reduced rates on the North road is an erroneous statement and one grossly misrepresentecL The decline is due to :—• (a) The Kawam’s successful expedition against the late Askar Khan Mam- kuli and others. Soon after they had been disappeared of the North road reopened for the traffic which had been closed for a long time ow ing to Arab depredations. The great security which has since ruled throughout the Arab territory has had the effect of increasing supply of animals of influencing rates in the denounced direction. {b) Absence of regular supplies due to the Hire Agreement which C hick s im portant sendings owing to shortage of mules as a result of unwarrant able outside interference with trade. This has had the effect of turning important sendings for Ispahan and other places to the Ahwaz route. Mr. Chick’s report does not make any reference of goods that are constantly reshipped from Bushire to Ahwaz owing to transport difficulties through the Hire Agreement and of direct shipments to Ahwaz, which, if the Hire Agreement ceased to exist, would all be landed at Bushire. Custom statistics and Lynch s forward ing records at Ahwaz would throw much light on the subject. Forwarding Previous to the Hire Agreement no one in Bushire favour ed the mule brokers and if the authorities had expelled them (seeing that they are bankrupt muleteers) instead of introducing the Agreement forwarding conditions would have profited much. Although Mr. Chick speaks unfavourably of the men yet they are to-day in the service of the Naghlieh ; so that the position may be said to be the same as before. Position of Shiraz merchants in regard to the Agreement. —Mr. Chick’s opinion as expressed under this head is altogether vague and misleading. That the Shiraz merchants are principally concerned in regard to the Agreement is a fact which can not be disputed. Except sugar sendings, the greater part of which belong to Bushiris, all other importers are owned by Shirazis andwoZby Bushiris. The Shiraz merchants do an important indent business with London and Manchester houses and shipments are dealt with by their Bushire agents on arrival there. In like manner part of stocks at Bushire are owned by Ispahanis and others further north. This is the exact posh tion and it is an old saying that Bushiris are merely forwarding agents to various interests in up-country. The Bushiris can only speak of their sugar consignments to Shiraz, the bulk of which comes from Haji Saiyid Muhammad Reza Kazeruny. Other important merchants are practically dormant. Could Mr. Chick mention {lames of Bushire merchants who participate in the important volumes of piece- goods imports ? A reference to the Bank would soon make the position very clear as decuments are passing through them and only surrendered after acceptance of drafts by indenters against shipments made by their London or Manchester commission houses. Messrs. Ziegler and Company .—Mr. Chick’s statement that Messrs. Ziegler and Co. only forwarded one-tenth of all piece-goods forwarded by British Com panies in 1912-13 (nine months of which were previous to the agreement) is no doubt an attempt to mislead readers. Similar statement was made by him sometimes last year when he was told that the one-tenth sending which he referred to, represented Shiraz shipments only. That during the period in question, Messrs. Ziegler and Co. had landed gll their Ispahan shipments at Ahwaz, consequent to the complete closure of the Ispahan route through Arab terrorism which then prevailed. Notwithstanding this explanation, which roadbill will prove, Mr. Chick persistently upholds his scheme by very unfair attitude and erroneous statements and figures which are certainly misleading to the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office who have to follow his Reports for suggestions in the interest of British trade.ings which. Zeio-W r , B -“ lre ;. To effect thls ^e mentions only the send- (firm) makes bv resbiS^f td n u t ° t 1 he Ahwaz road which the Company ■-= Ust of British firms. .Mr. Chick refers to his complete list of British firms representing British interests against whom the interest of non-supporters of comet ?

Butisto Us /tw * 'n °“H 13 ^ ame ? except Nos. 1,2,5, and 13, all are London or Manchester (two are Bombay) indent houses not established in Persia on their own account, ey merely send out samples to Persia and execute orders on commission against Tmo °1 draft ?, a g amst shipments with bill of lading attached through the Impenal Bank of Persia. This naturally alters the position as thegoods arriving Bushire belong to native interests. ° Again No. 1 have small shipments at long intervals. No. 2 have nothing of !f Cept consi i nn ; ents of Rangoon candles, which the utmost can run to 200-250 loads a year, the forwarding of which is not practicable during the months of April-September on account of the heat.

The other points touched upon by Mr. Chick are usually vague and his statis tics are mere figures of support as the following will show you Mules arrive (Consular figures). 1913. 1914.

From—-M e. C. G. Zeytoon of Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon &amp; Co, To—His Britannic Majesty’s Cosnsul, Shiraz. Please excuse my note replying to your note of the 19th there and then. I shall be at the Consulate punctually at 4 p.m. to-day as desired to discuss the Naghlieh with other merchants. Without prejudice, I think the sooner this hateful administra tion is abolished the better for everybody concerned. What we all want, is more mules on the Bushire-Shiraz road. I think every facility and inducement ought to be offered to muleteers not to give preference to other routes. Most of the muleteers who ply between Bushire and Shiraz are Behbehanis, and they would transfer their service to the Ahwaz route, owing to the tyrannical dictation of terms by the Nagh lieh, the result of which has been to scare away decent muleteers, from Bushire-*i S3 . t , -1 win of; Mr. Pettigrew t6ils fne the big Bhiraz traffic.

Enclosure 13. M. Dated Shiraz, the 25th May 1914. From-MB. H. F. C. Gibbs, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persw, To-Majoe W. P. O’Connok, His Britannic Majesty’s Acting Consul, Shiraz. r h&lt;ur in crive such information as I can respecting Agreeably with your reque pVtink’s report on the “ Naghlieh Arrange- imm.djat.ly proc6cdni§» un, ji.mr nrices would not have automatically come down as has been the nn other roads I am not competent to say. Although Mr. Chick does not men- case on other roa ’ antagonistic to the present arrangement which f° n them no otooSHo mlnipukte rates by playing off one merchant kaves them no pp^ t^ y j ucrative bi r e elsewhere, they naturally will against ano , andp ly their trade elsewhere, in which case they would indirectly 6 tecom^even more Masters of the situation than Mr. Chick states they were before tbe NagbUeh Arrangement was made. The keening down of the rate of hire, whilst not essential is certainly very desirable : the lower it is, the better can goods imported from the South compete in Ispahan with the same class of goods imported from the North. fcl “ Merchants used to complain that goods of theirs.......... were still undelivered at Shiraz after three or four months . This has also been the case during the time of the Naghlieh Arrangement specially previous to the recent grazing season. (FV&amp;wttOTfefl—I thmk it is open to question as to whether the Naghlieh Arrangementfhas to a great extent remedied the smuggling of goods, especially tea via Dilwar. w | | H HI The Naphlieh system has certainly saved merchants the wranging of old days with muleteers, and a more dignified system of engaging animals has been instituted. T have no figures which would enable me to verify or otherwise the amount of £57 217 computed by Mr. Chick as a saving of merchants m 16 months at the expense of the muleteers, as a result of the Naghheh Arrangement. ii. I hardly think the term “ Naghlieh 55 is misunderstood in Shiraz. The f 161 ' chants and indeed everyone interested in commerce are well informed ol the time tions of this department. So far as our expereince goes we have little hesitation in saying that there is a much larger market in British piece-goods in Shiraz than in Bushire and practical^ all the principal Britsih exporters have agents or representatives here to con serve their important interests.It is worthy of observation that Mr. Chick in the course of his able report does Pot remark on the powerful argument brought forward by the opponents of the Naghlieh Arrangement that as about eight bales of sugar (the product of the con tinent, in which British interests, shipping, banking, agency, etc., are only indirectly concerned) arrive to one baje of piece-goods (the product of Manchester in which not only the foregoing British interests are concerned but in the prime price of which large sums in wages have been disbursed to Manchester weavers) unless the pro portion of animal allotted for transport of piece-goods is eight times more than the proportion allotted for sugar, the sugar will be in a better position for imme diate forwarding than the Manchester piece-goods. The present proportion of allotments being 3 or 4 to 1 only in favour of piece-goods, it follows that the piece-goods forwarders are dissatisfied with the arrangement, the much more so because were there free competition they would be only too willing to pay a higher rate of hire in the open market for transport in order to ensure the quick transport of their valuable bales, thus turning their money over quickly and avoiding a loss of interest amounting up on any of their bales (one bale of which, roughly speaking, is worth 12 bales of sugar) which under the present arrangement they are obliged to keep in their warehouses in Bushire until their turn under the Naghlieh system arrives. It, therefore, follows that the system of allotment tends to favour goods of continental manufacture to the detriment of goods of Manchester manufacture. In spite of varied arguments covering a large sphere of influence in Mr. Chick’s report in support of the Naghlieh Arrangement, in my humble opinion the present Naghlieh Arrangement should stand or fall according to its success mainly in giving British firms and importers of British manufactured goods a position as regards forwarding which does not compare unfavourably with the position of others; in keeping the rate of hire at a reasonable figure, and in attracting a sufficient quantity of animal transport to prevent accumulations of goods in Bushire, only in satisfying these main points would the arrangement in my opinion be worth acquiescing in involving as it does a contravention of the principles of free competition (and “ letting the best man win ”) which, despite its numerous draw backs and imitations, has been the basis on which our commercial supremacy has- been attained. Enclosure 14. N. Dated Shiraz, the 30th May 1914. From—M r. G. Geofge of Messrs. Ziegler &amp; Co.,. To—His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz’. About the proportion of British manufactures which goes to Ispahan, provided that there be no Naghlieh two-thirds of piece-goods brought into Shiraz will go North. This two-thirds will include direct shipments for Ispahan and consign ment from Shiraz natives which they eventually forward in order to rel eve heavy stocks created through heavy orders which exceed the Shiraz demand. With the Naghlieh it is exactly the reverse. Carriers having been disappointed with regular traffic on the Shiraz-Ispahan road are not coming down regularly, which has caused congestion in stocks from time to time, with the result that owners in order to realize money have become pressing seller at most ruinous prices and this has added more gloom to the bad conditions of trade now existent through out Ears.In any further communication on the subject, please quote Xo. 32929/14. iate. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London. &lt;r% q r . r\ Ui J-r/) Foreign Office July 24th, 1914.

The Board recognise that this objection my be somewhat mitigated by r. Chick’s suggestion teat before the question of making tin pro posed road is raised with the fersiarj Government, some kind of vested interest could be establisned by tie initiation at any rate of a motor service under conditions as Secretary of State, Foreign Officelot nn t!i&gt;y esist. U). The Board apprehend that lx. Chick’s ©stimte of the retreou© wiiich would possibly accrue to thg motor service is based in the min on tte aosu«rption that one ; i third of the counts now paid to imileteers for tie wl»le journey between Ire and bhiraz would fee available for the journey along the coast strip of 60 miles. It does not, however, in the Board’s opinion, follow that, if tlB starting point of the mule traffic is transferred from Busiure to D&amp;liki, the charge for carriage from the latter place to bhiraz would not be raised to an amount exceeding considerably two-thirds of the existing charge for the coraplete journey. Mr* Clack however is understood to hold timt the concentration of ti)e number of mules at present available for t'tm journey on that portion of tlje route which lies between )aliki and bhiras would involve an increase of competition which would tend to keep down rates for the Daliki-blaraz journey. (3) It is not altogether apparent to the Board whether any allowance Ire been made for tin cost of the constructicn of depots at taliki. It is evident, however, that such construction would be necessary and, moreover, that the depots when constructed would, in the existing state of Persian unrest, require effective protection against possible raids. nevertheless the Board are on the whole disposed to think the scheme deserving of sympathetic consideration bylo-z. by hie majesty's Government, and, if the facts as regards tto nature of the ground to be traversed by the saotor •* &amp; } ,onv&gt; ire ’s stated in ;;r.

In this connection, it may be as well to invite attention to Shiraz telegram No. 20, dated the 12th February, 1914, of which a copy is attached for easy reference. This telegram shows that other interests, besides our own, are considering the possibilities of modern transport on the Bushire-Shiraz route. I have, &amp;c. S. G. KNOX, Major, His Majesty’s Acting Consul-General for Ears, dec. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Memorandum. Transport: Motor Service between Bushire and Daliki. (Confidential.) REFERENCE was made in a previous memorandum, enclosed in Sir P. Cox’s despatch No. 14, Commercial, of the 28th September, 1913 (of the 5th October to the Government of India), on the subject of the need of improving means of transport between Bushire and Ispahan, to a project under discussion in Bushire for a motor transport company between Bushire and the foot of the coast range, i.e., across the coast plain, a distance of about 60 miles along the main caravan route from Bushire. It would appear that in considering the various suggestions made in that memorandum the Government of India were of the opinion that nothing should be done in the way of a motor road for the present, but considered that the construction of railway lines from the south Persian ports to the interior had become a real necessity. There can be no doubt that each year the need of a railway line, both in the interests of Great Britain and of British trade from the south, as also m those of the local population, is being more widely realised. But even under the most favourable circumstances, such as an early solution of the difficulties in connection with the concession for lines from Bunda Abbas and Bushire, can we hope for the construction of these lines to be begun within five or eight years ? Meanwhile the existing difficulties which confront trade from the coast to the interior, e.g., to Shiraz are more likely to increase than otherwise, and the value and bulk of the import trade to Shiraz ns well as to Central Persia will remain limited to its present proportions, or, more [2133 z —2]probably, will become luTefdieXTe^ot nmlea are’to hand from the Ahwa, l3Pa When th^mfmOTandummentioned above was written the possibility of utilising^ motor traction of the stretch of road between Bush,re and Dahk, and by this means relieving themselves and consignees up-country from the financial burden caused by thousands of loads of goods lying constantly at Bushire and_ failing to reach their destined markets at the proper season, had already begun to agitate traders m Bushire. Since that date the matter has frequently been mentioned to me again ; prices of the lorries necessary and capital required have been asked and, as I see it, the views of those chiefly concerned are hardening to a decision that until they obtain motor transport there will be no improvement in their trading difficulties with Shiraz, borne, who are men of some wealth, say definitely that they will subscribe largely to such a company (always with the proviso that European capital and management should be The Governor of the Gulf Ports voiced this view the other day in connection with the instructions that had been sent him by the Minister for Foreign^ Affairs at Sir W. Townley’s request, and in pursuance of the approval of His Majesty s Government to suggestions made in the memorandum mentioned above for co-operation between the Persian Governors and British consular officers in obtaining an adequate supply of transport animals. His Excellency said that he considered a motor service greatly needed * that he had been thinking over the matter and how the necessary capital could be raised. It was evident to him that Bushire could only subscribe a small portion of the sum required : in Shiraz the merchants were hardly any bettei off, and such magnates as his friend Kawam-ul-Mulk were financially embarrassed owing to heavy mortgages and depreciation of their properties. His Excellency wondered whether the ruling khans of the districts in the neighbourhood of Bushire and Daliki, i.e., Shabankareh, Hayat Baud, Burasjan, &amp;c., who all had great wealth lying idle, could be induced to help to finance such a scheme. This idea, having taken hold of local opinion, w r ill probably spread until it attracts attention outside trading circles in Bushire and Shiraz. Such a prospect seems to offer a certain amount of danger that interests other than British might initiate a scheme for motor transport between Bushire and Daliki. For this reason the local need, and the scheme as a commercial proposition, merit careful examination by His Majesty s Government and the Government of India. Recent news that motor transport is working between Rasht and Tehran is causing people in these regions to realise possibilities of initiative and their own wants more than ever. If there be a current of local opinion in favour of motor transport, then I Submit that British interests should put themselves at the head of such a movement rather than ignore it and run the risk of others putting forward a scheme. Besides the beneficial effect that motor transport for part of the way to Shiraz might have on the volume of trade carried up country, it would appear a distinct advantage for British interests endeavouring to obtain a concession for a railway connection between Bushire and Shiraz that British interests were already largely concerned in a motor transport service from Bushire. Motor Transport as a Commercial Proposition. There can be little doubt that a motor service from Bushire to Daliki would be a very profitable investment up to the time that a railway replaced it and even afterwards seeing that Burasjan, a flourishing trade centre for the coast districts, would hardly be likely to be on the direct line of railway. _ ' In the first place, the caravan road traversed between Bushire and Daliki is quite safe ; for many years caravans have not been raided, and the districts surrounding the road are kept in good order. Secondly, the rates of hire paid for some years past on the upward journey from Bushire to Shiraz for animal transport have been enormous. It is impossible to reckon very accurately the sums paid each year to muleteers and donkeymen, as different categories of goods pay different rates of hire, but taking the prices ruling on piece goods, the lowest rated category, the following was the estimate made in memorandum enclosed despatch Commercial, Tk total of ' A H up-coim and evei ofmulel cost dur In to 2,500 at mnel] Bushire would g were av Ma of anin chargee annuall Ac o-ton n paid m Providt I; any re] engine roughl niilesi ^igU that t ofreti I this;3 n connection; ■Affairs at s Govern®!:: tion betTOi; lequate sfi &gt;r service pa necessarj cap nbscribe a n ,ny better oS,a rrassed ovi' ellency rafc sbire and 1 ’ealth lying b dimtilitattr;: local w{i by His Uajs )tor transpit; igions to i- ;re be a 0 Britisl int® Qore it ail 1 .e way to ^ ppear a t A for a alreadyW diki^, even a^' D would 6tli March 1911 (on the subject of possible route for wheeled transport to Jl iruZciDciQ) \ Shiraz via Average rate of hire upwards.

More accurate statistics kept in the Residency of the actual weights of goods forwarded upwards only in March 1912-13 and 1913-14 give the following results for the hire ruling on piece goods, the lowest rated category. The actual hire disbursed was however undoubtedly far more, as piece goods onlv formed one-third or one-fourth of the whole :— — — Tons. Rate of Exchange. Amount paid.

Approximate!} 7 speaking, therefore, the minimum cost of transport of merchandise up-country, only from Bushire to Daliki by the main route, cost 40,011L in 1912-13 ; and even after merchants in Bushire had combined to check the extortionate demands of muleteers and kept rates at a more moderate level in March 1913-14, the minimum cost during the last year was about 33,013h In addition to this last figure, a third of the transport rates paid on some 2,000 to 2,500 tons of goods which are brought down-country from Shiraz to Bushire annually, at much lower rates than up-country hire, it is true, but still productive of a very large sum. And further, in 1913-14, some 2,880 tons of goods were sent inland from Bushire via Shief, for transport chiefly by the Shief road to Burasjan—goods which would go by the main route to Burasjan if a cheaper and quicker means of transport were available. Making all allowance for the very substantial reduction on the present high rates of animal hire, which may be expected from a motor service—even if the latter charged only one-half present rates—a very large income would still be obtained annually.. According to the prices quoted by makers in England, the cost of the ordinary 3-ton motor lorry is about 700-800L The cost landed at Bushire and all expenses paid might be taken at 1,000/. each, or a capital outlay of 12,000/., which should provide for the carriage of about 30 tons of goods daily, an ample quantity on the present scale. I am not sufficiently acquainted with such engineering matters to be able to form any reliable estimate of running expenses, upkeep, depreciation, &amp;c.; but the assistant engineer attached to the Residency (Lieutenant F. H. Townshend, R.E.), estimated roughly that on 7,000 tons goods for transport up-country running expenses over 60 miles might be 3,500/. annually, and that depreciation, interest, &amp;c., on the motor lorries might be put at say 2,400/. per annum. It might be reasonably assumed, he thought, that the down-country transport to Bushire (about 2,500 tons) would pay for the cost of returning vehicles over the 60 miles. When the question of motor transport from Bushire to the foot of the mountains has been previously considered, it has always been assumed that the construction of a motor road would be necessary. The construction of a raised road ovei the p am connecting Bushire with the mainland would require a considerable outlay, and has the objection that a concession will have to be obtained from the Persian Government oi this road to be made.4 But after passing many times over the road between Bushire and Lurasjan I am inclined to think that for a considerable distance except during the three to three and a-half winter months when the road is soft with ram, it would stand motor traffic as it is. The municipality would probably need to extend the metalled road for a mile or so, but thence, as far as the stream at Ahmadi, 24 miles the present caravan route ^ is as flat as a billiard table and as hard as a rock for the best part of the year. A small culvert would be needed at the ford of the Ahmadi stream, but could be made without much cost and without exciting objection. Thence again to Ivhushab, where another culvert is necessary, the road is firm and level: from Khushab to Eurasian (45 miles) a little road-makmg, but not much, might be necessary Even as it is, carriages are frequently driven from Bushire to Burasjan. From Burasjan to Daliki there is certainly a good deal of rises and falls m the ground lor one-third of the distance, and the ground is very stony, but the foundation seems hard. Whether it would be feasible for motor lorries, heavily laden, to be run constantly over the road from Bushire to Burasjan in its present state is a mattei for examination for competent engineers. Messrs. T. Cosser and Co. (Limited), who have the contract for the new customs-house at Bushire, are entitled under then contract to bung up a motor car for their personal use during the w T ork, and I had hoped to arrange with the managing director, who is a skilled engineer, that he would bung up one of his firm’s cars to Bushire before I left on leave, and that an attempt could be made in company with the officer of the Royal Engineers attached to the Residency, to make a thorough test of the road in a motor car, with the object of obtaining their expert opinion as to how far road construction would be necessary before motor lorries- could be run. _ . . That has not been possible up to time of writing ; but in view of the opening for motor enterprise that is occurring to most people at Bushire, it is very desirable that some early opportunity should be found for the assistant engineer attached to the Residency and others to examine and report on the road carefully. If little in the way of roadmaking is necessary for eight to nine months of the- year, then there seems no reason why a company should not be formed to import motor lorries and run them for the transport of merchandise. Speaking under correction^ I think that no concession is needed for motor vehicles to run over the existing roads in Southern Persia, provided customs duty has been paid on the cars, any more than for vehicles drawn by animals. His Majesty’s Government might even, after further examination by experts,, decide that there was good reason to apply for a concession for the road to be metalled,, and a company given exclusive rights of transport on it. Whether the expense of metalling had to be undertaken or not, the capital outlay would seem likely to be small in comparison with the large revenue to be derived and, as stated above, the fact that the transport of goods to Daliki was in the hands of a company run and partly financed by British capital would seem a considerable asset for future negotiations regarding railway concessions. If this project finds favour in the eyes of His Majesty’s Government, it occurs to me that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (limited), which has previously imported a road train to Ahwaz, might do so in connection with oil borings at Daliki. This company is interested in the Persian Railways Syndicate (Limited). As for Persian support, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, who is the owner of the fief at Daliki, is a man of great wealth and influence, and could probably arrange matters with the Persian Government if difficulties arose. He knows this part of Persia well, and is a willing, investor, as he has before stated. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Major O'Connor to Sir W. Townley. (No. 20.) (Telegraphic.) R. Shiraz, February 12, 1914. THERE has been some talk here lately among Persian merchants of starting company for constructing railway between Shiraz and Bushire. I have reason to think that the scheme was suggested by the German consul during his stay here last summer. Idea would be that the company should pose as Persian company, but that considerable portion of the capital should be raised in Germany. I scarcely think that the project can come to anything, but it is worth watching. o182 put H r^KM 163 9 i s No. 158, dated Bushire, the 18th (received 28th) January 1914 (UontuTeStial)) From J.

Vice-Consul adds that there is nothing in state of road to warrant exceptional measures which protract journey and increase expenses of caravans.

It would be unfortunate if, after they had been issued, I found myself obliged, in the interests of British trade, to take exception to any. It5 184 is important that the regulations should not be irksome, also that they should be applied only to parts of road where circumstances make them really necessary. Lower part of road outside hills has been safe for number of years, and you are doubtless aware that climatic conditions during greater part of year make it desirable caravans should enjoy freedom of movement there by night as well as day A'ain, according to old custom, muleteers will wish to work amma Is chiefly on lower road for some weeks in spring to benefit by good grazing, and during that period will frequently prefer to halt off road and at distance from posts. These and similar points require attention in framing general regulations if trade is not to sufier, and I should be happy to assist you in disposing of them. (Enclosure No. 6.)

The symptoms of over-regulation of traffic observed by Mr. Chick in Dashtistan were brought to the notice of Colonel Uggla, the Commandant of Gendarmerie at Shiraz, with the satis factory result that he found no restric tions on movement by the road to be necessary at present, and decided not to propose special regulations for traffic until circumstances should call for them. The objectionable regulations which Mr. Chick found in force are believed to have been since withdrawn, but a careful watch will be kept upon the matter by this Residency. Vide my letter|| No. 158, dated the 18th January 1914. Serial No. 163.187 (Enclosure.) MEMORANDUM. During my recent short journey the route followed took me across and over sections of the caravan road between Daliki and Bushire, and the follow ing observations regarding the state of the road, and of the present nolicino- arrangements may be of interest. 1 P 0 ^m o I noticed no change, except for some half dozen gendarmerie posts in front of villages along the road, in the outward appearance of the road from that seen on the many previous occasions when I had travelled over this part of the route. As has been often stated, caravans have for many years moved night and day without fear of robbery between Bushire and Daliki: and blackmail (Rahdari) was levied in unobtrusive fashion at the stage caravanserais, and at four or five villages en route. Gendarmes and the people of Dashtistan seem to be getting along together very well, and the resnons- ibilities of the former are here light. 1 The tendency now is for this part of the road to be over-regulated. On the 7th instant our destination was the village of Karawal Khaneh, near which we had two days’ work to do. We struck into the caravan road coming from Tangistan, and after nightfall left the road again to camp at the villao'e, where I was known. The subordinate officer of gendarmerie in command°of the post on the road at some distance from the village (Mirza Ali Akbar Hamadani) gave me cause for considerable annoyance, first of all by claiming that we might not halt for the night elsewhere than at his post (which was far away, for fodder, fuel and supplies), and trying to stop our mules. He said that his orders were definite, travellers and caravans could halt nowhere else but alongside his post. Even when he knew my status and I had told him that I came there with the knowledge of the Governor of Dashtistan, was travelling in the district of my official jurisdiction, not along the main route, but wherever I liked across the country-side, as I had done many times before, he continued to talk about his powers and demanded, if I stayed at the village, a letter taking all responsibility on myself, which I did not give him. As he continued to worry me after my tent w r as pitched, I had to point out to him that I understood his duty was confined to the road, whereas I was off the road, in the districts of the Local Government, where the village Kadkhuda and the Khan of Borasjun District, the responsible Persian Official, were responsible for guarding myself and caravan at night, if necessary. A second instance came to my notice on returning to Bushire. At 2 p.m., at the village of Chogadak, 16 miles from Bushire, from which it is only separated by the swamp, a caravan reaching the post at the village, as I passed was halted by gendarmes because they said it was after hours for it to proceed. Probably for this reason I found the rest of the road on to Bushire deserted. Now the road across the Bushire Mashileh is as safe as walking down Pall Mall; donkey, mule and camel caravans have necessarily to come in from all directions radiating from the caravan road, e.g., Gurk, Dilwar, Ali Changi, Abad Samal, Chahkutah, &amp;e., and owing to climate reasons for the greater part of the year, travelling between Bushire and Daliki is insufferably hot, except at night. Caravans must have absolute freedom of movement over this stretch, and even in the most troublous times in the interior of Persia they have not been accustomed to be escorted b 7 tufangchis. The two instances quoted in my personable experience serve to show that— (1) The gendarmes on the coast plain are inclined, perhaps because they come from up-country disturbed districts, to consider this stretch unsafe also— which it is not: and to place traffic on it under a kind of martial law. (2) Muleteers complain with reason that their expenses—rates of hire which merchants have to pay for forwarding—are being increased when the journey to and from Shiraz is increased by one, two, even three days. Caravansare compelled by gendarmes to halt at intermediate posts be neen the stages, e a .,at Chogadak, Jaffarjin, Pnl-Ahgineh. This is particularly hard on muleteers, when fodder rates are, as this year, at famine prices, owing to great scarcity, and these intermediate gendarmerie posts are far away irom villages where supplies can be had in quantity. It is essential at the present time, when the problem of meeting Russian commercial pressure in Ispahan and Central Persia is becoming so serious for us, and trade up from the Gulf, that, in all but tracts liable to raiding or robbery, caravans should have absolute freedom of movement 1 he gendar merie have well accomplished the suppression of &lt;£ Rahdari, and any regula tion of traffic, where necessary, will mean restriction of traffic and be likely to harass the muleteers off the road. Lately large numbers of mules have been taken off the Pushire-Shiraz road, and though it is unlikely that the arrival of the gendarmerie has anything to do with it, and we may look for the cause in the gieat scaicity of fodder, the fact remains that there has been a serious decrease of transport animals coming to and leaving Bushire for the past 2J months (i.e., since the gendarmerie took over charge) as compared with the summer months, and remarkably low figures compared with those in 1912, viz. :— 1912. 1913. Mules. Mules. November 2,486 985 December 3,924 1,538 ■J January 1,974 698 It will he seen that traffic is very far below normal, and this, coupled with telegraphic advice from Ispahan regarding the Ahwaz road (20th January IQIJ)—“ Lynchs’ agent reports traffic so far kept up though with difficulty— owing to scarcity of food and its very high prices,” makes the situation very uneasy for British and ail trade from the Gulf, as the winter should be the most active season for forwardings during the year. His Majesty’s Government have already been informed of the urgent need of getting more animal transport on the road, if Russian commercial competi tion in Persia is to be met [vide Sir P. Z. Cox’s despatch, No. 14 (Com mercial), of 28th September, and the memorandum enclosed]. This therefore is not the time, as far as British trade interests are concerned for hampering free movement of caravans. The only other point of interest noted on my passage over the road was the conduct of the Persian officers of the gendarmerie left in charge of large posts, e.g., at Borasjun and Ahmadi. I learn from the young Khan of Chakutah, who resides at Ahmadi, how much he and his family appreciated the friendly attitude of Major Uggla (who had been his guest while there), and his assurances that the gendarmerie did not wish to interfere with the district chiefs, and only demanded that the guarding of the road should he left to them. On the other hand the Persian officers are inclined to bluster and threaten the Khans and local people, without authority from the Swedish officers. Rumours of an altercation at Ahmadi had disturbed the Governor of Bushire, and it appeared on my enquiry there that a certain Abu Talib Khan had represented to the young Khan that he had placed him under an obligation by interceding on his behalf, when the Swedish officers had told him to raze the tower of his personal dwelling, and take away 300 rifles, and 3,00,000 cartridges which were reported to be concealed in the Khan’s house—un doubtedly a fabrication, and without Major Uggla’s authority. On another occasion the Khan had had to warn the same officer against the gendarmes preferring the vile abuse, which up-country Persians use, and stomach easily, against the mothers and fathers on the local people, who like all Dashtistanis wipe out such jnsult in blood.189 And as regards Ahmadi, the hospitality of the Khans to European travel lers whom they often entertain especially those connected with the Residency and their comparative enlightenment, make them the last persons with wS the gendarmerie need quarrel. r At Ahmadi the gendarmerie officer asked leave to call on me, while I was staying in the Khan’s house, but I regret to say, was too drunk t^ talk or behave m a seemly fashion It is unfortunate that drinking, which is looked upon with aversion in Dashtistan, is common among these Persian officers. Merchants and muleteers have also frequently to complain of mules carrv- mg loads and under contract to merchants being forcibly commandeered bv Persian gendarmerie officers to carry their own supplies. I heard this at Boras]un, and, on 21st January, Messrs. Dixon &amp; Co. reported that the mules bringing 40 loads ot gum for them had been taken by the gendarmerie at Doiasjun, an d the loads had to be sent in on camels. In this connection it may be stated that the number of mules required by the gendarmes in the neighbourhood of Bushire appears at present to exceed per mensem, a large proportion of the 900 and 1,500 recently available for all goods and travellers at the port.

That is to say, that caravans and travellers may pass freely at any time without restriction, gendarmes being responsible for safety of road. Should robberies occur or he apprehended, special regulations affecting special sections of road may have to be drawn up. He is, however, issuing general regula tions of disciplinary character which apply only to gendarmes defining their duties on road and enjoining upon them necessity for protection and assist ance of caravans and travellers.

Lower part(s) of road outside hills has been safe for number of years and you are doubtless aware that climatic conditions during greater part(s) of road make it desirable (that) caravans should enjoy freedom of movement there at night as well as day. again according to old custom osp muleteers will wish to work animals chiefly on lower road for some v/efeks in the spring to benefit by good grazing and during the period will frequently prefer to halt off road and at a distance from posts.

India Office to Foreign Office.—(Received March 5.) India Office^ March 4, 1914. I AM directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th November last, enclosing copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, covering a memorandum by his commercial adviser on the existing insufficiency of transport in Southern Persia and the means of improving it, and also your letters of the 22nd December, 1913, and 20th January, 1914, forwarding the comments respectively of the Board of Trade and His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran on Mr. Chick’s memorandum. In reply I am to transmit, to be laid before the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, a copy of a secret letter from the Government of India containing a statement of their views on the general position of British commerce in Southern Persia in relation to the extension southwards of Russian trade influence. The Marquess of Crewe concurs generally in the opinions held by the Government of India, and would invite special attention to the last three paragraphs of their letter. The conclusion arrived at by the Government of India is that the construction of railways inland from the coast is the only really effective means of promoting British trade in Southern and Central Persia, and that till the projects that have been put forward in this connection are in some degree realised, they cannot advocate the other proposals for stimulating British trade mentioned in paragraph 5 of their letter. His Lordship observes tbat a similar view is held by the Board of Trade, and he is unable to dispute these opinions, which he hopes may be borne in mind in the discussions with the Russian Government regarding the alignment of the southern section of the Trans-Persian Railway. As regards the suggested institution of motor traction on certain sections of the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road, the Secretary of State, while accepting the views of the Government oflndia and Board of Trade, would invite attention to the recommendation of the former in paragraph 6 of their letter, that any rival proposal may be discouraged, until at any rate it is possible to proceed actively with Mr. Chick’s suggestion. For the present, therefore, there remains only Mr. Chick’s third main proposal: to make the most of existing means of transport, and to secure the provision of a regular and increased supply of transport animals. His suggestions in this direction are set out in some detail on pp. 5 and 6 of his memorandum. They are supported by the Govern ment of India, and the Secretary of State observes that one part of them is warmly supported by Sir MI. Townley in his despatch No. 284 of the 23rd December. His Lordship concurs in these opinions, and is prepared to contribute from Indian revenues a half of the estimated cost (10(R. per annum) of extending to the places specified by Sir W. Townley and Mr. Chick the system of collecting statistics of the numbers of transport animals passing up and down the three main routes to Ispahan. He trusts that Sir E. Grey will authorise Sir W. Townley to issue instructions to the consuiai officers at these places to set the system in operation without delay. . His Lordship attaches much importance to Mr. Chick’s further suggestion (to which Sir W. Townley and the Board of Trade did not allude), and hopes that the consular officers will be instructed at the same time to^ endeavour to secure e co-operation of the local Persian authorities for the organisation of regu ar transpor services on the roa'ds in question by exerting pressure to ensuie a ettei supp y donkeys on the Bushire-Shiraz road, and, on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, of camels. lam to suggest that the Persian Minister of the Interior, if the position were explained to him by Sir W.

To The Most Hon’ble the MARQUESS of CREWE, K.G., Mis Majesty's Secretary of State for India Delhi, the 22nd January 1914. My Lord Marquess, With reference to Your Lordship’s telegram of the 17th November 1913, we have the honour to submit the following remarks in regard to the prospect of Russian trade competition in Southern Persia, as adumbrated in Mr. Chick’s Memorandum which accompanied Sir P. Cox’s despatch No. 14 (Commercial), dated 28th September 1913, addressed to the London Foreign Office. 2. We entirely agree as to the desirability of taking all reasonable steps to facilitate and encourage trade from the South on the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan line, not only in the interests of Indian commerce, but on political grounds^ as a safeguard against the extension of Russian trade, and thereby of Russian influence from the North. But we are confronted with the difficulty of devis ing practical measures, the cost of which is not prohibitive. 3. It is satisfactory to note that there has of late been a marked improve ment in the general security of the route in question. This should give a stimulus to Indian trade enterprise which is at present sadly apathetic. Another satisfactory feature is the reduction in the rates of carriage etlected bv the mule hire agreement. Against these however must be set the very serious diminution of transport animals, which cramps and cripples such enterprise as there is. To combat this Mr. Chick proposes— (1) to organise transport and systematise transport conditions, (2) to employ donkeys and camels on the Shiraz- Ispahan accessories to mules, more extensively than at present. Thfisie measures he recommends, should be effected by co-operation between His Majesty’s Consular officers at Shiraz and Bushire and the local authorities With this we are in full agreement. The organization transport service on the Nushki-Sistan trade route has been the cause of steady increase in trade: and we think that His Majesty s Consular officers at Bushire and Shiraz should be authorised at once to approach the local authorities on the lines suggested by Mr. Chick. 4 We agree also that the provision of more reliable statistics ot the 1 the southern roads is important: and with Your Lordship’s sane- u ““**- £m r ,mi ° to this end put forward in Mr. Chick s Meuioiandum. u 7 FEB1S1 r -5.

His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran recently expressed the opinion that Russia s pretensions to a larger share of the neutral zone will become the greater according as Russian influence is given time to extend southwards. The suggestion advanced in the present Memorandum is, put shortly, that the state of the caravan route between Bushire and Ispahan has been much improved, during the Summer of 1913, and rates of hire have been reduced to more reasonable figures by concerted action; the disastrous diminution of trans port animals resulting from the years of disorder is now the real factor which militates against goods from the Gulf reaching Ispahan in the quantities prevail- ing previous to 1908, and facilitates Russian commercial encroachment and development from the north. 1 Of their own accord the Persian authorities and merchants will do nothing, argely from ignorance and mutual distrust; but Mr. Chick urges that great enefit would result if His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Bushire and Shiraz C °a a US - e 'Hhuence to get merchants and the local authorities to combine and devise means for attracting a fresh and regular supply of animals. The question of the provision of more reliable statistics of the traffic over all Southern roads seems also very important for Government, and merits the small outlay suggested in Mr. Chick’s Memorandum which I trust His Majesty’s Government will see fit to sanction. Since this Memorandum was written I have learnt of the proposal of M. Molitor, the Persian Director-General of Posts, to establish a motor service between Tehran and Shiraz. This project lends point to the remarks made by Mr. Chick anent the desire of Persian circles here to obtain motor traction between here and Daliki, 3 stages distant on the Shiraz road ; for it is obvious that facilities for motor transport from Tehran to Shiraz, without corresponding improvements between Bushire and Shiraz would but accentuate the disadvant- a ges in transport matters of our trade vis d vis Russian trade from the /V2 MEMORANDUM. Enclosure No. 2. His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in a recent telegram gave prominence to the increase of Russian influence in the Isfahan province resulting from the increase of Russian trade by reason of the deplorable condition of the Southern Trade Routes, and added that in proportion as Russian influence is given time to extend southwards, so will the justifiable pretensions of Russia to a larger Starting therefore with this axiom, we are confronted with the proposition how to prevent a further increase of Russian Trade in the Isfahan province and southwards, and how to win back, if possible, what Russian Trade has recently captured in that province. For some months past conditions on the Bushire-ShirazTsfahan road have shown great improvement. The Bushire- Condition of the Southern roads. Shiraz section has been practically free from robberies since the beginning of 1913 n.nd illegal exactions from muleteers, “ Rahdari,” “ Tufangchigeri,” etc., have been confined to the Kumarij-Bushire section and to very reduced figures since March. As to the Shiraz*Isfahan section, we are informed that it has been quite safe since May Caravans have circulated continuously on the Bushire*Shiraz road and between Shiraz and Ispahan since the beginning of June 1913. On the Ahwaz-Isfahan road there have been no Kuhgilu raids during^ and since the Sardar-i-Jang has decided to continue in the Ilkhani-ship, the amount of traffic has been very fair, considering the insufficiency of transport animals. In the latter half of 1912, the exorbitant rates of transport hire were killing trade from the Gulf to Central Persia as Rates of transport hire. much as, and perhaps more than, insecurity and oppression on the road. Rates of hire then averaged about 450 Krans per 100 Bushire mans from Bushire to Shiraz, and 350 up to 450 Krans per 100 Shiraz mans from Shiraz to Isfahan. The Mule Hire Agreement, to which all merchants in Bushire were got to adhere last November, and the formation of a Forwarding Department by the local Government for distributing mules and donkeys proportionately between merchants (by which the Mule Hire Agreement could alone be maintained) put merchants in a position to get rates of mule hire reduced forthwith from 440 Krans to 300 Krans per 100 Bushire mans, and has enabled them to keep rates steady whilst lowering them slowly and perceptibly. Rates have been brought down to 250 Krans per 100 mans and are expected to reach 200 Krans in the early winter. At a recent meeting of the merchants figures were however pro duced to show that the exceedingly high price of fodder on the Shiraz-Bushire road, due to the short harvest and monopolies of sale en route, left the muleteers little margin of profit at present and made further reduction impossible as yet. On the Shiraz-Isfahan road rates of hire fell in June and July to 160-150-145 Krans per 100 Shiraz mans, consequent on the opening of the road and security offering. On the Ahwaz-Isfahan route rates of hire fell about 1J Krans (7 d.) per Shah man in sympathy with the movement at Bushire, and the decline at Shiraz, and now stand at about 6-7 Krans per Shah man of 13*09 lbs. (or 355-414 Krans per too Bushire mans). It will be seen therefore that rates of hire between Bushire and Isfahan are rather less than half what they were in the autumn of 1912, namely about 410 Krans per 100 mans, or some ^”22-10-0 per ton. Even in former years of peace and security, before 1907, rates of hire between Bushire and Isfahan were never less than 300 Krans per 100 mans or some £\6 per ton. From the point of view of the security of the roads, and the rates of hire, conditions are thus at present—though the possibility of trouble and hostilities in the autumn must not be discounted—fairly normal and distinctly favourable to the recapture of the Isfahan market for trade via the Persian Gulf, and the check of Russian trade.3 If compared with 7 years ago, imports to the Isfahan province via, the Gulf Insufficiency of transport animals. are being severely restricted ; and if under _ , . ,. , . . . otherwise favourabe conditions British Trade is unable to check the extension of Russian Trade southwards it is due solely to the dearth of pack animals between Bushire and Isfahan and Ahwaz and Isfahan. ’ As against some 5,000-6,000 mules (these are Persian estimates) said to be working on the Bushire-Isfahan road up to 1907, the numbers leaving Bushire for up-country with goods from April 1913, have been :— April ... ... ... 6,319 mules. ... 1,081 „ ... 2,031 „ ... 2,511 „ II )95° » average 2,987 mules monthly. In December 1912, January and February 1913, the average number of niules was 3,003. This represents a loss of about half the number of mules available and working on the Bushire-Shiraz road in 1906: and the present figures are evidently stationary. There seems to be no need to look further for the cause which now hampers the revival of British commercial influence, and imports from the south, in the province of Isfahan. This lack of animals is quite sufficient to explain why some ^98,000 of Marseilles sugar was sent up from Bushire to Shiraz in 1906-07 and nearly all of it on to Isfahan, while at the present time, or at any rate till recently, little or no sugar was forwarded from Shiraz to Isfahan ; and why the Isfahan Trade Report for 1911-12 states that all sugar from the south (*.£., including Ahwaz-Isfahan) was only 35 per cent of the total import to Isfahan as against 65 per cent from the north, exactly the reverse of the figures of some years ago. Since June, when the road from Shiraz to Isfahan was reopened to regular traffic, there have been to Isfahan in :— J un e ... ... ... ... ... 920 Mules July ... ... ... ... ... 2,327 D although only 2,210 animals were counted past Dehbid. Even this small monthly average is likely to fall during the autumn, when muleteers come back from the north to some extent, and gravitate toward the Bushire-Shiraz section. Of the total number of animals working on the Ahwaz-Isfahan road there is no reliable estimate; but Messrs. Lynch’s figures for the years 1910 and 1911* averaged only 3,340 mules, 2,968 donkeys, 1,547 camels for the whole year. As additional proof of the insufficiency of mule transport it may be mentioned that the number of packages at Bushire awaiting transport to Shiraz has been at the beginning of the past three months about:— 15.000 loads, 20.000 ,, 23,600 „ The reasons for the inadequate number of mules on the southern roads now as compared to the number in 1906 and 1907 are:—the heavy losses which muleteers have suffered in the bad times of the past 5 years, which have made^ a number of them bankrupt, and compelled them to sell off their mules; the ill- treatment and exorbitant exactions to which they were subjected by tribesmen and tufangchis, which have caused many muleteers to leave this part of Persia; disease on the Firuzabad and other routes has killed many animals; many hundreds of mules have been looted and carried off by nomad tribes; fodder rates have been high, etc,, etc. May June JulyEven with a return to conditions of security and of normal rates, it is not possible, 1 think, to hope for a sufficient increase in the number of mules on the southern roads. The Ahwaz-lsfahan road is not liked by muleteers, and trans port on this road is a problem in itself, which requires separate examination. And as regards the Bushire-Shiraz road, I cannot agree with certain Persian merchants who are so sanguine as to hope for an average of 4,000 animals monthly, if fodder rates fall and il rahdari' from Kumanj to Bushire is abolished. It will, I think, take years, if ever, for 6,000 mules to be got to work the road regularly again ; and nothing short of this number will suffice to push goods steadily up country. If then we are to prevent further increases of Russian trade in the Isfahan Proposal to utilise donkey transport, and organ- province, and in northern Pars and else- ise transport animals. where, by ensuring a constant and suffid. ent flow of goods from the South, we must, I think, (i) organise transport and systematise transport conditions. (ii) employ donkeys, and camels on the Shiraz-Isfahan road, as accessories to mules, much more extensively than at present. As regards (f), there is no doubt that of themselves Persian merchants and Persian officials are incompetent to take the necessary steps. Their rivalries and suspicion of one another are an effective barrier to all progress in this, direction. That it is however comparatively easy to secure their adhesion to a scheme originated by others has been shown by the success (so far) of the mule hire agreement and forwarding Department of the Local Government at Bushire. The bases of this agreement are (a) that the rates of hire to Shiraz and Kazerun for different classes of goods are fixed monthly in meetings of all the large Persian and European forwarding merchants under the Presidency of the Governor, and with the attendance of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul (by request of the Governor) ; {b) that mules and donkeys are apportioned among merchants according to the amount of their stocks and customs passes, in an office attached to the local Government; (c) the maximum number of days for transport to Shiraz is fixed and uniform, so that there can be no loitering on the road as formerly; (d) advance hire is fixed. It is now time that some adaptation of the system should be made at Shiraz for the Isfahan road. It might not be found necessary to arrange proportional distribution of mules, as at Bushire, but fixed rates of hire and other conditions of control over muleteers should be arranged. Such a movement at Shiraz would have to emanate from the Governor-General and would need to be enforced with some authority : owing to the instability of the Shiraz merchants, it would probably be easier to work with a selected number of the more important merchants, re-inforced by the British merchants trading with Isfahan, and His Majesty’s Consuh The principal object would be 10 keep certain muleteers working on the Shiraz-Isfahan road regularly as long as security offered, and one of the greatest services that could be rendered by such a body would be to get muleteers, and mules belonging to Pars and Isfahan back to the road, and so swell the number of transport animals. {11) The number of donkeys carrying merchandise from Bushire to Shiraz-, during the past three months has been .*— May U97. June ••• ••• - -ipr: — • ' 3°9- July ... 7 6 3- Yet in the months of March and April 6655 an d 35^7 loads were taken away by donkeys, probably over 3 jOoo separate donkeys being engaged.s These donkeys come from the following districts and tribes — Samal ... • •• • •• • •• • t • ... 200 Farrashband ... • • • • • • ... ... 400 Firuzabad ... ... ... ... ... 300 Maimand ... ... t • t ... 600 Karagouni ... ... ... ... ... 1500 Abulwardi ... ... ... ... ... ... 2000 Qir and Karzi ... • •• ... ...

On past occasions, when the officially recognised route has been that by Firuzabad, all these donkeymen have worked up and down the road as regularly as the muleteers. But now that the official route is that via Kazerun, and the Firuzabad route is unathorised, it is a very different matter. Merchants have no one to guarantee them this route; there is no one in authority en route t to compel the donkeymen to proceed onwards to Shiraz. Of the large quantities of loads sent forward in t March and April, many have not yet been delivered. The donkeymen have taken the loads off to their own houses, probably with designs on a certain number, and are now employed in collecting grain or trafficking in their own districts. Many of these donkeymen are flagrantly dishonest in their intentions. They come to Bushire for loads (if merchants will trust them), when it suits them twice or three times a year. As there is no method of bringing them to book once they have left Bushire, merchants at present cannot entrust goods to them freely. Yet donkey transport is the best and cheapest for sugar, metals, kerosene, candles, etc , and as more than half of the packages forwarded to Shiraz are sugar, the provision of regular donkey transport would prevent accumulation and congestion of stocks at Bushire, and replace fairly effectively the deficient supply of mules. Donkey transport is always slightly cheaper than mule transport. Such an arrangement would be welcome to forwarders of piece goods to Shiraz and Isfahan, as pro rata the number of mules for this class of goods is restricted by the much larger number of packages of sugar to be forwarded. In a recent meeting of the forwarding merchants in Bushire, it was arranged that goods for Shiraz should only be given to donkeymen on condition that they proceeded by the main telegraph route, which they have not liked doing hitherto, as it is far off from their homes, and they are not able to loiter, as they like, along it. We need a minimum of 2,000 donkeys monthly to work up and down the main caravan route between Bushire and Shiraz. To secure this it would be necessary for the Persian Government aut&lt; orities to summon the chief donkeymen and donkey owners of, say, Kawar, arras - band, etc. districts, explain that they are wanted to work regularly on t e main caravan route to Shiraz, that they will be well treated, and obtain an un er from them that they would do so. The initial action in this direction rmg e taken at Bushire by the Consulate General with the Governor an c ie^ merchants, but it would be well, and necessary in some cases, for the overnor General of Fars, the Consulate and merchants of Shiraz to put the necessary pressure on the head donkeymen concerned. There is little information here as to the possibility of incorporating donkey transport more extensively on the Shiraz-Isfahan road, but this cou cer y done in the case of camels. C80FD6 If His Maiestv’s Government agree that insufficiency of transport animals trom the south is largely to blame for the poor resistance that is being offered by rade om the south to the downward progress of Russian Trade then the course outhned above might form a basis for improving conditions; but m any case, nothing can be effected in this direction unless His Majesty s Consular Officers take up the matter with the Persian Provincial Governors and merchants, and apply all their efforts in this direction. Of all three roads, Bushire-Shiraz-lsfahan, Ahwaz-Isfahan, Bunder-Abbas- Kerman proper organization of transport services should be the first step towards a recovery M British Trade, to follow the restoration of security along the roads. . . f , cc (a} Caravan Statistics. —In connection with the question of caravan traffic, V ' too much emphasis cannot be laid upon other suggestions. importance of His Majesty’s represent tmTetuth' = statistics has been altogether neglected in the P. a f has drifted^nto unsatisfactory condition Trade reports of centres in the interior of Persia suffer from the want of reliable figures of weights and values of imports am^ exports. ^ was sanctioIie d by the Foreign Office early tMs year and mu le traffic over the Bushire-Shiraz-Isfahan road ,s now reported week y. The number of animals loaded at Bushire can be accurately known from the distribution lists of the Forwarding Department; at Borazjun the Telegraphs are able to take note of the number of animals passing, as they load and unload in front of the telegraph station. At Dashtarjin and Dihbid, northof Shiraz, similar countings are made, and should be accurate, ,f conscen- tiously undertaken by the signallers. , This system might now be much extended. Arrangements could be made at little cosfat Bunder Abbas and at Ahwaz (at the Godar bridge or else Malamir caravanserai) for an accurate counting of all animals, by employes of the Consulates. Similar counts should certainly be made at Kirman, and, i Majesty’s Consul-General thinks useful, at the gates of IsWafan or shortly befor that city ns reached. The figures of transport furnished by Messrs. Lynch Brothers represent only animals carrying their own loads—but probably as many a nima 's a Jain are engaged by Persian merchants separately and we require to know the totals, (i&gt;., these and Messrs. Lynch’s) more accurately. Caravan statistics are also needed at Bam, where they might be collected by the officer in charge of the Indo-European Telegraph Department office: they are needed on the road from Kirman to Yezd. Between Kirman and Yezd the Indo-European Telegraph Department could control the number of animals passing; but it would be in any case advisable tor the British Vice' Consul at Yezd to engage a man to report incoming caravans both from the Shiraz and Kirman roads. - Other roads, on which caravan statistics wtfuld be useful and desirable, are :— 1 f T-* V* _ X—T o ♦'VN O / i O YT I sfahan-Sultanabad. Dizful-Khurramabad (?) . . The above proposals could be carried out at a very small cost in addition to that already incurred by gratuities of three rupees monthly to telegrapn ahulams at certan stations between Bushire and Isfahan. fc&gt; l man at 1 » » i i» n i it n 1 » r 1 n &gt;&gt; 1 !&gt; M ...

The object of the returns should be to show accurately and separately the number of mules, donkeys and camels passing each week ; and once the system was properly working, we should make it our aim to obtain in addition indications of the merchandise carried. Thus .the signaller at Dehbid should report now 178 mules, 45 camels, 89 donkeys from Shiraz to Isfahan, and in time we should look to him to report 178 mules carrying 116 bales piece-goods, 82 bags loaf sugar, 56 chests tea, etc., etc. The Consular employes at the gates of the big towns should be able to obtain very accurate figures, but much can also be done at our out-telegraph stations, where the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment officers are something more than telegraph officials. Such information as to the number and nature of packages carried by each road will enable Consular Reports to be based on fairly accurate weights of various classes of merchandise imported and exported, and permit of more accurate comparison year by year than the very round figures of estimates at the present day. (£). Improvements in Transport Conditions. —When, as is hoped, the Muhammerah-Dizful-Khurramabad railway is, in 3 years time, well under con struction, it will be desirable to expedite a decision as to next line from the sea to be built. Both Captain Wilson and the writer, in their railway reports of 1912, urged, from different points of view, that it was essential that Great Britain should regard the trade of Isfahan as an objective of capital importance. Fresh statistics since those reports make it clear that the transport hire paid of late between Bushire and Shiraz is enormous and affords subtantial grounds for thinking that a railway between these two towns would pay its way before long. This attack of Russian trade on Isfahan, and pressure southwards makes it imperative that the railway from the coast to Shiraz should be taken in hand without delay. In the interval which elapses we must do our best to improve conditions of animal transport, and if the scheme for the regular provision of donkey transport is not adopted, I suggest that British exporters of cotton goods would be well advised to bale a part of their goods to suit donkey transport, i.e., to weigh not much more than 120 lbs. per bale. There has recently been some discussion among Persian merchants here for reviving the project of a motor transport company between Bushire and the foot of the kutals, and between Shiraz and Dashtarjin. This would dispense with animal transport over 3 stages of the 10 now travelled, and would materially quicken transport up-country. The suitability of the Shiraz-Isfahan road to motor transport has been shown by Dr. Pugin, a German commercial agent, covering the distance between the two places in 3 days. In this connection it will be remembered :— 1. That the German Legation in Tehran in 1906 made enquiries^ of His Majesty’s Legation as to whether there were any British concessionary rights in the road from Isfahan to Bushire, and intended to lay the matter before his Government as a possible opening for German enterprise in Persia. 2. That a concession was granted on June 22nd, 1906 for running Renard road trains over nearly all the carriageable roads of Persia to a g r ^ u P 0 ^ rS T lf- ri notables including the present Grand Vizier His Highness Ain-ud-Dowe , is Highness Firma Farma, the Sipahdar, the Muin-ut-Tujjar. The concession stipulated that the concessionaires were to work in P er si a at least ten trains within two years from June 22nd, 1906; that within a year e construction of the roads must be undertaken ; that after 7 years al sue must be made carriageable or else would be excluded^ from the terms o concession. On the Bushire road work was to begin in one year an a finished 5 years from the date of the concession.8 w \ 1 It would presumably always be open to British capital to furnish the neces sary backing, and to British subjects to co-operate in such a Persian enterprise ; just as the scheme by Isfahan Notables ^ for diverting the headwaters of the Karun may have Russian support behind it. The construction of a road for motor traffic between Bushire and Daliki would be an easy matter, but a raised and metalled road would have to be built over the great salt marsh behind Bushire—and the outlay for rolling stock, motor lorries and wagons, would be beyond the capabilities of the local Persian merchants or Tehran Notables. It is not desired to draw any “ red herrings ” across the track of the scheme for railway enterprise from Bushire to the interior. I merely state the methods for improving transport from the south to the centre of Persia, in the order of their relative importance, viz. \— (i) Railway traction between Bushire and Shiraz. Motor traction between Bushire-Daliki ; Dashtarjin-Shiraz ; Shiraz- Isfahan. Measures for providing a regular and larger supply of mules and donkeys. M Import of Tea to Persia.—Mm Cotton-goods and Sugar, the most important article of import to Persia is Tea. The quantity of Tea imported mto the north of Persia via Russia was 94 ° Tons, Tons. (2) ( 3 ) In 1911-12 the quantity imported via Russia was ... via the Gulf was ... 2,286 828 It is well known that the greater part of the Tea imported via ^ Russia, and appearing as a Russian import in the Persian Customs statistics, is now Indian (Calcutta) Tea which has come by sea via Batoum. The “ state of the southern roads ” has not been the principal reason for the great increase of import of Tea via Russia, and decline in the Persian Gulf. It would appear that, while the freight by sea from Calcutta to Bushire =35 rupees per ton of 50 cubic feet ; Calcutta to Baghdad, (i.e.), for Kirmanshah import) = 45 rupees per ton of 50 cubic feet. Calcutta to Bombay per lb. 9 pies approx. = Rs. 33 per ton of 40 cubic feet; Bombay to Bushire per chest Rs. 2 = 10^-14 per ton of 40 cubic feet; 43^-47 the freight by Austrian Lloyd steamer, transhipment at Trieste, from Calcutta to Batoum = only 31 rupees per ton ; and by French Messageries, trainshipment at Colombo and Marseilles, from Calcutta to Batoum only 28 rupees per ton. (The French line is less patronised owing to expenses of transhipment at Colombo, in the open sea). On the other hand, freight by P. and O. steamer and the City Line and Conference steamers from Calcutta to Batoum costs 40 rupees, as freight trom Port Said to Batoum by Russian steamers (British vesseis not sailing direct; i dear. The Government of India have hardly given the import of Tea to the Persian Gulf the attention that it was hoped; it is discouraging to hear 1 Foreign Department letter No. 317-E. A., of February 18, that the 'd,an Tea trade with Persia, north and south, is insignificant from the pohtica pointy J view. But if the Government of India is anxious to see checked t P oFRussian trade, and so Russian influence, to Isfahan and southwards Auction of the import duty on Tea into Persia, and above all, representations to9 the British India Steam Navigation Company and others as to the harmful effect on our political position of charging such high freights to Baghdad and Bushire m comparison with the rates from Calcutta to Batoum will be two effective pre ventive methods, so far as the Tea trade is concerned. P (d) British Commercial Position in Southern and Central Persia in Gene* rat. Perhaps more than any other remedy, an overhauling of the position of British firms in Southern and Central Persia is needed before the spread of Russian commercial influence can be really checked. It cannot be generally realised how few are the British Trading firms with European agencies in Persia^ and what empty shells they are—conservative in the extreme, restricted in their operations : and in this connection the Board of Trade are already aware of several which threaten to withdraw altogether from trade with Persia. Thus Messrs. Gray Paul and Company do no business with the interior of Persia, sometimes sell a little sugar ; do not touch exports (except grain sometimes): confine themselves entirely to shipping business. Messrs. Ziegler and Company sell Belgian Sugar at Bushire (but do not send h up-country;; sell Manchester and Dutch piece goods at Shiraz and Isfahan ; a little copper at times , candles rarely. No exports (except grain rarely). Messrs. Dixon and Company. Piece goods only. Export grain when season favourable. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon and Company Limited import piece gocds to Shiraz (small quantities) ; haberdashery little. Export Gum, Carpets, Opium. Messrs. Lynch Brothers : Muhammerah, Ahw r az. Sugar. Messrs. Stiick, Scott and Company, Muhammerah. General.imports, small. Export grain when season favourable. Messrs. D. E. Smoch and Company) Piece goods only, native agent. Holdsworth, (jougie. ) Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm. Candles. This represents the range of activities, and the number of British firms with special representatives in Southern Persia from Bunder Abbas to Ahwaz and Isfahan. As a consequence, it will be seen how much more important relatively are those Persian merchants, who either deal direct with British firms, or else are the legally appointed representatives of British firms in the United Kingdom, or India, to what an extent the whole fabric of cur trade is in Persian hands. This is not as it should be. Greater variety of enterprise is needed for the British firms wuth special representatives in Persia. At present, if Consular Offi cers desire to have any trade experiments made, or special wares pushed in Southern Persia, or new sorts of produce exported, they have to apply to Arme nian or Persian merchants. Seme of the greatest drawbacks to British firms’ offices in Persia are the way in which the firms’ representatives are firstly, not encouraged and obliged to learn the language, or mix with the people; secondly, are not allowed to leave their offices and travel in the immediate neighbourhood in order to find out for themselves new openings for business; thirdly, youth and inexperience of most agents sent from England. But the greatest needs are a decision to deal more widely and extensively than at present, and greater activity by all firms in the export trade of Persia. H. G. CHICK, Commercial Adviser.

His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran recently expressed the opinion that Russia’s pretensions to a larger share of the neutral zone will become the greater according as Russian influence is given time to extend southwards. The suggestion advanced in the present memorandum is, put shortly, that the Russian commercial encroachment and development from the north. Of their own accord the Persian authorities and merchants will do nothing, largely from ignorance and mutual distrust; but Mr. Chick urges that great benefit would result if His Majesty’s consular officers at Bushire and Shiraz could use their influence to get merchants and the local authorities to combine and devise means for attracting a fresh and regular supply of animals. The question of the provision of more reliable statistics of the traffic over all southern roads seems also very important for Government, and merits the small outlay suggested in Mr. Chick’s memorandum, which I trust His Majesty’s Government will see fit to sanction. Since this memorandum was written I have learnt of the proposal of M. Molitor, the Persian Director-General of Posts, to establish a motor service between Tehran and Shiraz. This project lends point to the remarks made by Mr. Chick anent the desire of Persian circles here to obtain motor traction between here and Daliki, three stages distant on the Shiraz road ; for it is obvious that facilities for motor transport from Tehran to Shiraz, without corresponding improvements between Bushire and Shiraz, Russian trade from the north.

PERSIA. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October ]8.) (No. 14. Commercial.) Sir, WITH reference to my despatch enabled to control and reduce to a normal level rates of transport hire on goods forwarded to Shiraz, and the formation of a forwarding department under the control of the Local Government advised by His Majesty’s vice-consul, I now have the honour to enclose a memorandum by Mr. Chick on the subject of the insufficiency of transport state of the caravan route between Bushire and Ispahan has been much improved during the summer of P.H3, and rates of hire have been reduced to more reasonable figures by concerted action. The disastrous diminution of transport animals resulting from the years of disorder is now the real factor which militates against goods from the Gulf reaching Ispahan in the quantities prevailing previous to 1908, and facilitates would but accentuate the disadvantages in transport matters of our tr the Persian Gulf, and His Majesty’s Consul- General for Ears, dec.

The Bushire-Shiraz section has been practically free from robberies since the beginning of 1913, and illegal exactions from muleteers, rahdari, ^ x “ tufangchigeri ” t &amp;c. have been confined to the Kumarg-Bushire section and to very reduced figures since March. As to the Shiraz-Ispahan section, we are informed that it has been quite safe since May 1913. , . . juj. . Caravans have circulated continuously on the Bushire-Shiraz road, and between Shiraz and Ispahan since the beginning ol June 1913. . , 1Q1Q ■, On the Ahwaz-Ispahan road there have been no Kuhgilu raids during 913 and since the Sardar-i-Jang has decided to continue m the Ilkham-ship the amount of traffic has been very fair, considering the insufficiency of transport animals. Rates of Transport Eire. In the latter half of 1912 the exorbitant rates of transport hire were killing trade from the Gulf to Central Persia as much as, and perhaps more than, insecurity and oppression on the road. Rates of hire then averaged about 450 krans per 100 Bushire m P ms from Bushire to Shiraz, and 350 up to 450 krans per 100 Shiraz mans from Shiran to Is P a h h “ Iule H . re A ent&gt; t0 which a ll merchants in Bushire were got to adhere last November, and the formation of a forwarding department by the Local Government for distributing mules and donkeys proportionately between merchants (by which the Mule Hire Agreement could alone be maintained) put merchants m a position to get rates of mule hire reduced forthwith from 440 krans to 300 krans per 100 Bushire mans, and has enabled them to keep rates steady whilst lowering them slowly and perceptibly. Rates have been brought down to 250 krans per 100 mans, and are expected to reach 200 krans in the early winter. At a recent meeting of the merchants, fi g“ re ® J® re &gt; however, produced to show that the exceedingly high price of fodder on the Shiraz- Bushire road, due to the short harvest and monopolies of sale en route, Jett t e muleteers little margin of profit at present and made farther reduction impossible aS ^On the Shiraz-Ispahan road rates of hire fell in June and July to 160-150-145 krans per 100 Shiraz mans, consequent on the opening of the road and securi y offering On the Ahwaz-Ispahan route rates of hire fell about krans (7d.) per bnan man in sympathy with the movement at Bushire and the decline at Shiraz, and now stand at about 6-7 krans per Shah man of 13’09 lbs. (or 355-414 krans per 100 Bushire i It will be seen, therefore, that rates of hire between Bushire and Ispahan are rather less than half what they were in the autumn of 1912, namely, about 410 krans per LOO mans, or some 22i. 10s. per ton. Even in former years of peace and security, ! beffire 1907, rates of hire between Bushire and Ispahan were never less than 300 krans per 100 mans, or some 16L per ton. From the point of view of the security of the roads and the rates of hire, condition are thus at present—though the possibility of trouble and hostilities m the autumn must not be discounted—fairly normal and distinctly favourable to the recapture o e Ispahan market for trade via the Persian Gulf and the check of Russian trade. Insufficiency of Transport Animals. If compared with seven years ago imports to the Ispahan province via the Gulf are being severely restricted, and if under otherwise favourable conditions British tra e is unable to check the extension of Russian trade southwards, it is due solely to the dear of pack animals between Bushire and Ispahan and Ahwaz and Ispahan. ^ As against some 5,000-6,000 mules (these are Persian estimates) said to be working on the Bushire-Ispahan road up to 1907, the numbers leaving Bushire for up-country with goods from April 1913 have been :— ^ 1 Mules. April - ' ^r 2031 July .. .. .. •• • •• •• •• A01X Total 11,950 T? /'v r\ + o v (Average 2,987 mules monthly.) 4- l In o r*ida’In December 1912, January and February 1913, the average number of mules was 3,003. This represents a loss of about half the number of mules available and working on ^ibe Bushire-Shiraz road in 1906, and the present figures are evidently stationary, ^rhere seems to be no need to look further for the cause which now hampers the revival of British commercial influence and imports from the south in the province of Ispahan. This lack of animals is quite sufficient to explain why some 98,000i. of Marseilles sugar was sent up from Bushire to Shiraz in 1906-7, and nearly all of it on to Ispahan, while at the present time, or at any rate till recently, little or no sugar was forwarded from Shiraz to Ispahan, and why the Ispahan Trade Report for 1911-12 states that all sugar from the south {i.e., including Ahwaz-Tspahan) was only 35 per cent, of the total import to Ispahan, as against 65 per cent, from the north, exactly the reverse of the figures of some years ago. Since June, when the road from Shiraz to Ispahan was reopened to regular traffic, there have been to Ispahan in— Mules. June .. .. . . .. .. .. • • 920 July .. .. .. .. .. .. • • 2,327 although only 2,210 animals were counted past Dehbid. Even this small monthly average is likely to fall during the autumn, when muleteers come back from the north to some extent, and gravitate towards the Bushire- Shiraz section. Of the total number of animals working on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road there is no reliable estimate ; but Messrs. Lynch’s figures for the years 1910 and 1911 averaged only 3,340 mules, 2,968 donkeys, 1,547 camels for the whole year. As additional proof of the insufficiency of mule transport it may be mentioned that the number of packages at Bushire awaiting transport to Shiraz has been at the beginning of the past three months about:— 15.000 loads. 20.000 ., 23,600 „ The reasons for the inadequate number of mules on the southern roads now, as compared to the number in 1906 and 1907, are the heavy losses which muleteers have suffered in the bad times of the past five years, which have made a number of them bankrupt, and compelled them to sell off their mules ; the dl-treatment and exoibitant exactions to which they were subjected by tribesmen and tufangchis, which have caused many muleteers to leave this part of Persia ; disease on the Firuzabad and other routes has killed many animals; many hundreds of mules have been looted and carried off by nomad tribes; fodder rates have been high, &amp;c. . . .. Even with a return to conditions of security and of normal rates, it is not possib e, I think, to hope for a sufficient increase in the number of mules on the southern roads, j The Ahwaz-Ispahan road is not liked by muleteers, and transport on this road is a : problem in itself, which requires separate examination. And as regards the Bus ire Shiraz road, I cannot agree with certain Persian merchants who are so sanguine as to hope for an average of 4,000 animals monthly, if fodder rates fall and ra c an iom Kumarij to Bushire is abolished. It will, I think, take years, if evei, for 6,0 0 mu es ^ to be got to work the road regularly again; and nothing short of this number wi . suffice to push goods steadily up country.

If, then, we are to prevent further increases of Russian trade in the province, and in Northern Ears and elsewhere, by ensuring a constant and sufficient flow of goods from the south, we must, I think-— 1. Organise transport and systematise transport conditions. 2. Employ donkeys and camels on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, as much more extensively than at present. accessories to mules, As regards— . re • i 1. There is no doubt that of themselves Persian merchants and f ersian o cials^are incompetent to take the necessary steps. _ Their rivalries an Jsuspicio^ com _ are an effective harrier to all progress m this direction. others has been paratively easy to secure their adhesion to a scheme ongma e yshown by the success (so far) of the Mule Hire Agreement and Forwarding Department of the Local Government at Bushire. The bases of this agreement are (a.) That the rates of hire to Shiraz and Kazerun for different classes of goods are fixed monthly in meetings of all the large Persian and European forwarding merchant^ under the presidency of the Governor, and with the attendance of His Majesty s vice- consul (by request of the Governor). (b.) That mules and donkeys are apportioned among merchants according to the amount of their stocks and customs passes, in an office attached to the Local Government. * , ™ • - r j j -n (c.) The maximum number of days for transport to Shiraz is fixed and uniform, so that there can be no loitering on the road as formerly. (d.) Advance hire is fixed. It is now time that some adaptation of the system should be made at Shiraz for the Ispahan road. It might not be found necessary to arrange proportional distribution of mules, as at Bushire, but fixed rates of hire and other conditions of control over muleteers should be arranged. Such a movement at Shiraz would have to emanate from the Governor-General, and would need to be enforced with some authority. Owing to the instability of the Shiraz merchants, it would probably be easier to work with a selected number of the more important merchants, reinforced by the British merchants trading with Ispahan, and His Majesty’s consul. The principal object would be to keep certain muleteers working on the Shiraz—Ispahan road regularly as long as securit) offered, and one of the greatest services that could be rendered by such a body would be to get muleteers and mules belonging to Pars and Ispahan back to the road, and so swell the number of transport animals. # . . 2. The number of donkeys carrying merchandise from Bushire to Shiraz during the past three months has been :— May June July 1,197 309 763 Yet in the months of March and April 6,655 and 3,587 loads were taken away by donkeys, probably over 3,000 separate donkeys being engaged. These donkeys come from the following districts and tribes:— Samal Farrashband Firuzabad Maimand Karagouni Abulwardi Qir and Karzi Kawar .. Dur-i-Shahr 200 400 300 600 1,500 2,000 2,000 350-500 It will be noticed that all these lie off the main telegraph route, and on or near the Firuzabad road to Shiraz. On past occasions, when the officially recognised route has been that by Firuzabad, all these donkevmen have worked up and down the road as regularly as the muleteers. But now that the official route is that via Kazerun, and the Firuzabad route is unauthorised, it is a very different matter. Merchants have no one to guarantee them this route; there is no one in authority en route, to compel the donkeymen to proceed onwmrds ro Shiraz. Of the large quantities of loads sent forward in March and April, many have not yet been delivered. The donkeymen have taken the loads off to their own houses, probably with designs on a certain number, and are now employed in collecting grain or trafficking in their own districts. Many of these donkeymen are flagrantly dishonest in their intentions. They come to Bushire for loads (if merchants will trust them), when it suits them, twice or three times a-year. As there is no method of bringing them to book once they have le t Bushire, merchants at present cannot entrust goods to them freely. Yet donkey transport is the best and cheapest for sugar, metals, kerosene, candles, &amp;c., and as more than half of the packages forwarded to Shiraz are sugar, the provision of regular donkey transport would prevent accumulation and congestion o stocks at Bushire, and replace fairly effectively the deficient supply of mules. Donkey transport is always slightly cheaper than mule transport. Such an arrangement wou be welcome to forwarders of piece-goods to Shiraz and Ispahan, as pro rata the num er of mules for this class of goods is restricted by the much larger number of pac age* of sugar to be forwarded.In a recent meeting ef the forwarding merchants in Bushire, it was arranged that goods for Shiraz should only be given to donkeymen on condition that they proceeded by the main telegraph route, which they have not liked doing hitherto, as '''N.it is far off from their homes, and they are not able to loiter, as they like, along it. We need a minimum of 2,000 donkeys monthly to work up and down 'the main ! caravan route between Bushire and Shiraz. To secure this it would be necessary for the Persian Government authorities to summon the chief donkeymen and donkey owners of, say, Kawar, Farrashband, &amp;c., 1 districts, explain that they are wanted to work regularly on the main caravan route to Shiraz, that they will be well treated, and obtain an undertaking from them that they f would do so. The initial action in this direction might be taken at Bu?hire by the consulate-general with the governor and chief merchants, but it would be well and I necessary in some cases for the Governor-General of Fai s, the consulate and merchants of Shiraz to put the necessary pressure on the head donkeymen concerned. There is little information here as to the possibility of incorporating donkey transport more extensively on the Shiraz-Ispahan road, but this could certainly be done in the case of camels. If His Majesty’s Government agree that insufficiency of transport animals from the south is largely to blame for the poor resistance that is being offered by trade from the south to the downward progress of Bussian trade, then the course outlined above might form a basis for improving conditions ; but, in any case, nothing can be effected in this direction unless His Majesty’s consular officers take up the matter with the Persian provincial governors and merchants, and apply all their efforts in this direction. Of all three roads, Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan, Ahwaz-Ispahan, Bunder Abbas— Kerman, proper organisation of transport services should be the first step towards a recovery of British trade, to follow the restoration of security along the roads. Other Suggestions. (a.) Caravan Statistics. In connection with the question of caravan traffic too much emphasis cannot be laid upon the importance of His Majesty’s representatives having accurate statistics of the numbers of transport animals passing up and down the trade routes from the south. This question of internal statistics has been altogether neglected in the past; and the consequence is that, without our knowing how or why, British trade in the interior of Persia has drifted into a very unsatisfactory condition. Trade reports of centres in the interior of Persia suffer from the want of reliable figures of weights and values of imports and exports. A tentative beginning to remedy this was sanctioned by the Foreign Office early this year, and mule traffic over the Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan road is now reported weekly. The number of animals loaded at Bushire can be accurately known from the distribution lists of the forwarding department; at Borazjun the telegraphs are able to take note of the number of animals passing, as they load and unload in front of the telegraph station. At Dashtarjin and Dehbid, north of Shiraz, similar countings are made, and should be accurate, if conscientiously undertaken by the signallers. This system might now be much extended. Arrangements could be made at little cost at Bunder Abbas and at Ahwaz (at the Godar bridge or else Malamir caravanserai) for an accurate counting of all animals, by employes of the consulates. Similar counts should certainly be made at Kerman, and, if his Majesty s consul- general thinks useful, at the gates of Ispahan or shortly before that city is reached. The figures of transport furnished by Messrs. Lynch Bros, represent only animals carrying their own loads—but probably as many animals again are engaged by Persian merchants separately, and we require to know the totals (i.e., these and Messrs. Lynch’s) more accurately. Caravan statistics are also needed at Bam, where they might be collected by the officer in charge of the Indo-European Telegraph Department office; they are needed on F |q o Trnm PC q ti Fo V p* , yc\ Between Kerman and Yezd the Indo-European Telegraph Department could control the number of animals passing; but it would be in any case advisable for the -British vice-consul at Yezd to engage a man to report incoming caravans both from t e naz and Kerman roads. ['1898 s —2] COther roads, on which caravan statistics would be useful and desirable, are: Kermanshah—Hamadan. Ispahan-Sultanabad. . Dizful-Khoramabad (?). The above proposals could be carried out at a very small cost in addition to that already incurred by gratuities of 3 rupees monthly to telegraph ghulams at certain stations between Bushire and Ispahan : Ahwaz ,. .. Ispahan (Ahwaz road) Ispahan (Sultanabad road) Kerman (Bunder Abbas road) Bunder Abbas (Kerman road) Hamadan (Kermanshah road) Yezd (Shiraz road) Yezd (Kerman road) 1 man. 1 ,, 1 M 1 „ 1 „ 1 V 1 „ 1 „ Bemuneration of these eight men should not cost more than 8Z. monthly ; at Bam and other places on the telegraph routes gratuities of 3 rupees monthly might be paid to returns should be t0 show accurately and separately the number of mules, donkeys, and camels passing each week ; and once the system was P™P® r 7 workino- we should make it our aim to obtain in addition indications ol the merchandise carried” Thus the signaller at Dehbid should report now 178 mules, 45 camels, 89 donkeys from Shira^to Ispahan ; and in time we should look to him to report 178 mules carrying 116 bales piece-goods, 82 bags loaf sugar, 5b chests tea, &amp;c. ihe consular employes at the gates of the big towns should be able to obtain very accurate fio-ures, but much can also be done at our out-telegraph stations where the Indo-European Telegraph Department officers are something more than telegraph officials. Such information as to the number and nature of packages carried by each road will enable consular reports to be based on fairly accurate weights of various classes o merchandise imported and exported, and permit of more accurate comparison year by year than the very round figures of estimates at the present day. (b.) Improvements in Transport Conditions. When as is hoped, the Mohammerah-Dizful-Khoramabad Bailway is, in three years time’ well under construction, it will be desirable to expedite a decision as to the next line from the sea to be built. Both Captain Wilson and the writer, m their railway reports of 1912, urged from different points of view that ff was essential that Great Britain should regard the trade of Ispahan as an objective ol capita in.portance. Fresh statistics since those reports make it clear that the transport hire paid of late between Bushire and Shiraz is enormous and affords substantial grounds tor thinking that a railway between these two towns would pay its way before long is attack of Bussian trade on Ispahan, and pressure southwards makes it imperative that the railway from the coast to Shiraz should be taken in hand without delay. . In the interval which elapses we must do oar best to improve conditions °i animal transport, and if the scheme for the regular provision of donkey transport is not adopted, I suo-gest that British exporters of cotton goods would be well advised to bale a par of their goods to suit donkey transport, i.e., to weigh not much more than 120 ids. per recently been some discussion among Persian merchants here for reviving the proiect of a motor transport company between Bushire and the foot of the kl j ta s &gt; and between Shiraz and Dashtarjin. This would dispense with animal transpor ov three stages of the ten now travelled, and would materially quicken transpoi up country. The suitability of the Shiraz-Ispahan road to motor^ transport has bee shown by Dr. Pugin, a German commercial agent, covering the distance between two places in three days. In this connection it will be remembered— 1. That the German Legation in Tehran in 1906 made enquiries of His Majesty s Legation as to whether there were any British concessionary rights m th ® roa Ispahan to Bushire, and intended to lay the matter before his GovernmeiiL as a p opening for German enterprise in Persia.7 2. That a concession was granted on the 22nd June, 1906, for running Renard roi'd trams over nearly all the carriageable roads of Persia to a group of Persian notahW including the present Grand Vizier his Highness Ain-ed-Dowlth, h^s HigrerF^n ^arma, the Sipahdar, the Mum-ut-Tujjar. # ° The concession stipulated that the concessionnaires were to work in Persia at least ten trains within two years from the 22nd June, 1906; that within a year the construction of the roads must be undertaken ; that after seven years all such roads must be made carriageable, or else would be excluded from the terms of the concession On the Bushire road work was to begin in one year, and had to be finished five years from the date of the concession. J It would presumably always be open to British capital to furnish the necessary hacking, and to British subjects to co-operate in such a Persian enterprise; just as the scheme by Ispahan notables for diverting the headwaters of the Karun may have Russian support behind it. The construction of a road for motor traffic between Bushire and Daliki would be an easy matter, but a raised and metalled road would have to be built over the great salt marsh behind Bushire, and the outlay for rolling stock, motor lorries and waggons, would be beyond the capabilities of the local Persian merchants or Tehran notables. It is not desired to draw_ any “red herrings” across the track of the scheme for railway enterprise from Bushire to the interior. I merely state the methods for improving transport from the south to the centre of Persia, in the order of their relative importance, viz. :— 1. Railway traction between Bushire and Shiraz. 2. Motor traction between Bushire-Daliki; Dashtarjin-Shiraz ; Shiraz-Ispahan. 3. Measures for providing a regular and larger supply of mules and donkeys. (c.) Import of Tea to Persia. After cotton-goods and sugar, the most important article of import to Persia is tea. The quantity of tea imported into the north of Persia via Russia was 940 tons. In 1911—12 the quantity imported was— TT . „ . Tons. Via Russia .. .. . 9 9 of? Via the Gulf * *' T ’* Vos It is well known that the greater part of the tea imported via Russia, and appearing as a Russian import in the Persian customs statistics, is now Indian (Calcutta) tea, which has come by sea via Batoum. Ihe state of the southern roads ” has not been the principal reason for the great increase of import of tea via Russia, and decline in the Persian Gulf. It would appear that, while the freight by sea from— Calcutta to Bushire = 35 rupees per ton of 50 cubic feet ; Calcutta to Bagdad (i.e., for Kermanshah import) = 45 rupees per ton of 50 cubic feet; Calcutta to Bombay (9 pies per lb. approximately) = 33 rupees per ton of 40 cubic feet; Bombay to Bushire (l|—2 rupees per chest) = 10|—14 rupees per ton of 40 cubic feet) ; 43|-47 rupees per ton of 40 cubic feet ; the freight by Austrian Lloyd steamer (transhipment at Trieste), from Calcutta to Batoum, equals only 31 rupees per ton ; and by French Messageries (transhipment at Colombo and Marseilles), from Calcutta to Batoum, only 28 rupees per ton. (The French line is less patronised owing to expenses of transhipment at Colombo, in the open sea.) On the other hand, freight by P. and O. steamer and the City Line and Conference steamers from Calcutta to Batoum costs 40 rupees, as freight from Port Said to Batoum by Russian steamers (British vessels not sailing direct) is dear. The Government of India have hardly given the import of tea to the Persian Gulf the attention that it was hoped ; it is discouraging to hear in Foreign Department letter of the 18th February that the Indian tea trade with Persia, north aiffi south, is insignificant from the political point of view. But if the Government of India is anxious to see checked the spread of Russian trade, and so Russian influence to Ispahan and southwards, the reduction of the import duty on tea into Persia, and8 above all, representations to the British India Steam Navigation Company and others as to the harmful effect on our political position of charging such high freights to Bagdad and Bushire, in comparison with the rates from Calcutta to Batoum, will be two effective preventive methods, so far as the tea trade is concerned. (d.) British Commercial Position in Southern and Central Persia in General. Perhaps more than any other remedy, an overhauling of the position of British firms in Southern and Central Persia is needed before the spread of Russian commercial influence can be really checked. It cannot be generally realised how few are the British trading firms with European agencies m Persia, and what empty shells they are —conservative in the extreme, restricted in their operations ; and in this connection the Board of Trade are already aware of several which threaten to withdraw altogether from trade with Persia, thus :— Messrs. Gray, Paul and Co. do no business with the interior of Persia, sometimes sell a little sugar ; do not touch exports (except grain sometimes ; confine themselves entirely to shipping business. Messrs. Ziegler and Co. sell Belgian sugar at Bushire (but do not send it up-country); sell Manchester and Dutch piece-goods at Shiraz and Ispahan; a little copper at times ; candles rarely. No exports (except grain rarely). Messrs. Dixon and Co : Piece-goods only. Export grain when season favourable. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon and Co. (Limited), import piece-goods to Shiraz (small quantities) ; haberdashery, little. Export gum, carpets, and opium. Messrs. Lynch Bros., Mohammerah, Ahwaz : sugar. Messrs. Strick, Scott and Co., Mohammerah : General imports, small. Export grain when season favourable. Messrs. D. E. Somech and Co., Holds worth, Hougie : piece-goods only, native agent. Messrs. A. and T. J. Malcolm: candles. Tins represents the range of activities, and the number of British firms with special representatives in Southern Persia from Bunder Abbas to Ahwaz and Ispahan. As a consequence, it will be seen how much more important relatively are those Persian merchants who either deal direct with British firms or else are the legally appointed representatives of British firms in the United Kingdom or India—to what an extent the whole fabric of our trade is in Persian hands. This is not as it should be. Greater variety of enterprise is needed for the British firms with special representatives in Persia. At present, if consular officers desire to have any trade experiments made, or special wares pushed in Southern Persia, or new sorts of produce exported, they have to apply to Armenian or Persian merchants. Some of the greatest drawbacks to British firms’ offices in Persia are the way in which the firms’ representatives are—firstly, not encouraged and obliged to learn the language or mix with the people ; secondly, are not allowed to leave their offices and travel in the immediate neighbourhood in order to find out for themselves new openings for business ; thirdly, youth and inexperience of most agents sent from England. But the greatest needs are a decision to deal more widely and extensively than at present, and greater activity by all firms in the export trade of Persia. H. G.

S?*r IF. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received March 10.) (No. 28.) Sir, Tehran, February 4, 1913. I HAVE just received a copy of Sir Percy Cox’s despatch No. 13, Commercial, of the Kith December to the Foreign Office, submitting a memorandum drawn up b}^ Mr. Chick on the present condition of the Bushire-Shiraz road. I understand from Mr. Smart, lately acting-consul at Shiraz, that the gloomy picture portrayed by the writer of the memorandum faithfully represents, in his opinion, the conditions which prevailed on the road in question from August to November last, though the figures of the “ Rahdari ” seem a little exaggerated. These figures are presumably compiled from the statements of muleteers, who would naturally exaggerate the exactions of the road-guards in order to justify their own excessive rates of hire. With regard to the abuse mentioned by Mr. Chick of a levy of 4 krans in Shiraz itself on each mule by the Kawam-ul-Mulk and his Kashkuli adherents, Mr. Smart expresses the opinion that the money levied went entirely to the Kashkuli khans, and that the Kawam got nothing. With regard to the activities displayed in various directions by Mukhber-es- Sultaneh immediately on arrival at his post, Mr. Smart thinks, and I agree with him, that his Excellency undoubtedly acted precipitately and without local knowledge. He committed several mistakes of the nature reported by Mr. Chick— i.e., the letter which he addressed to the Khan of Shabancara. These geographical blunders, manifesting miscomprehension of local factors, feuds, &amp;c., are very unfortunate, because they expose the governor-general to local ridicule. It is difficult, however, to see how a governor coming fresh from Tehran can avoid such mistakes until he has acquired a full knowledge of local affairs. While the general conditions prevailing in Ears for the last two years render it extremely possible, even probable, that his mission will end in failure, Mr. Chick’s statement, that “ it is tolerably clear ” after “ two months’ trial of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh ” that his Excellency will fail, is rather unfair. His Excellency has not tackled the crucial questions of Ears at all seriously as yet. During the winter months, from October to April a considerable measure of peace reigns in the province, and the spring- will be the period when the governor-general will be put to the test. Before passing such a sweeping judgment on the governor-general, it would be fairer to wait and see how he deals with the complicated situation which the spring and summer are likely to present. . , Mr. Smart is of opinion that Mr. Chick’s judgment about the gendarmes enlisted at Shiraz and about the difficulty of procuring lowland recruits is, unfortunately, m all probability correct.

In that memorandum was demonstrated the seriousness of the prospect involved in the continued insulation of Isfahan and the^ markets of Central Persia from trade-communication with the Persian Gulf, owing to the insecurity of the Southern routes. It was also shown, however, (though it is no doubt merely another offspring of the general chaos prevailing) that the recent inflation of the rates of mule hire was no less responsible for the above state of things than the risk of loss from actual highway robbery. . ^' r * s Py esen t memorandum_treats of the working of a local scheme, the inception of which, I may mention, is entirely due to his initiative, for check ing the rapid inflation of mule hire and gradually restoring the rates to a nor mal scale.

The statistics evolved by Mr. Chick demonstrate the substantial advantage to commerce generally, resulting from the reduction in the rates of hire, and I agree with him that the arrangement is definitely assisting merchandise to reach Isfahan and elsewhere with better chance of competing with Russian goods from j\ the north. |! 22MI rpnort the development as I think His Majesty’s Government will be grati- tied to'ee any tangibKep tending to improve the ex.stmg cond.t.ons under which trade is carried on.

MEMORANDUM. Transport from Bushire to Shiraz : Reduction of Rates of Hire. The serious position which effected British Imports into Persia via Bushire in the latter half of 1912 , through exorbitant increases m the rates of mule transport to Shiraz, and again from Shiraz to Isfahan, ms-a-vis the increased import of Russian goods from the north into the markets of Isfahan and Central Persia has been set out at length in my memorandum forwarded to the Foreign Office’under cover of Sir Percy^Cox’s despatch No. 13 -Commercial, dated 16 th December 1912 , and in the Bushire Trade Report for 191 i m i 2 . The ruinous prices of transport of goods to the interior has indeed damaged British trade from the south almost as much as insecurity on the caravan route, and in the province of Pars. Briefly, whereas up till four years ago, the cost of forwarding to Shiraz piece-goods’ (other goods are higher in proportion) was from £ 5 - 19 -° £ 8 m S’° per ton at a minimum, from August 1912 onwards it ranged from £ 27 - 5-0 to £ 21 - 15-0 per ton. Simultaneously, rates on the Shiraz-Isfahan road had mounted very con siderably, the highest rate communicated being 412 krans (£ 22 - 10 - 0 ) per ton. Such prices made the forwarding of goods from Bushire to Isfahan either impossible, or exposed them to be undersold by similar goods from Russia. As regards the Bushire-Shiraz road, the causes of the rise in rates were (a) ‘ Rahdari,’ or blackmail extorted from muleteers amounting to nearly £1 per mule for the journey, and other methods employed by the Khans of the road for extracting money, such as monopolies on sale of fodder, etc. (b) The none too plentiful supply of mules leaving Bushire, viz., 2 , 500 — 3,000 per mensem, for the transport of goods up-country. (c) Jealousy between Persian forwarding agents at Bushire as to who should do the largest forwarding business, and secure the most mules. This was encouraged by mule-brokers. In this way, instead of competing to forward at lower prices than his neigh bours, each merchant used to cap the prices which he was told they were offering. As the goods generally belong to merchants up-country, not to themselves, and the Bushire forwarding agentsunder spect, I li ruff, icreased Cental Foreign &gt; Shiraz 'erj crni' ere^ iolies oo took commission on their disbursements, many Bushire merchants had no inducement to cut rates i while the British merchants were forced to pay the same rates as Persians in order to secure mules at all. (d) Muleteers exploited the ‘ rahdari ’ and ill-treatment on the road, and their losses thereby, to keep rates constantly rising. Muleteers were deriving enormous profits from forwarding under such con ditions ; it was hopeless to expect the Persian merchants of their own accord to remedy this state of affairs, or to expect the Governor of the Gulf Ports to do so ; for besides having little interest in such economic questions, he had apparently spoken to one or two merchants on the subject, and received a rebuff. On the other hand it was commonly recognized that the rates would not be allowed to fall by the parties interested, unless a combination of merchants could be arranged. The position being so serious for British trade, I interviewed all the leading Persian and British forwarding agents, with the exception of one or two likely to be hostile, and found them individually keen to see the rates reduced, and crying out about the Joss of trade. They showed me letters from Shiraz merchants blaming Bushire forwarding agents for disregard of their interests. But such was their mutual suspicion and jealousy that they begged me to assure myself of common action by their fellow-merchants before any meeting was called. Finally all merchants agreed on (1) That a reduction from 44 to 30 tomans per 100 Bushire m£ns should at once come into force, and be the maximum rate of hire for a period of 2 months. ( 2 ) That all mule-contracts should be based on delivery at Shiraz within 16 days. ( 3 ) That the system called ‘ du-kesh 5 by which muleteers dropped their loads half-way to Shiraz, and returned to Bushire for more, thereby keeping a large amount of goods lying about the road, and delay ing their arrival, should be abolished. ( 4 ) That only three-fourths of total hire to Shiraz should be paid in advance at Bushire, instead of 95 per cent, to muleteers. ( 5 ) That the Governor should take strong measures against the mule- brokers to prevent intrigue by them. I called on the Governor of Bushire, with the sanction of Sir Percy Cox, and after explaining the position, asked him to call a meeting of all merchants inter ested in the forwarding business. In this meeting held on December 7 th, 1912 , when nearly all merchants interested in forwarding attended, it was recalled that in the last 15 months the rate of hire to Shiraz alone had risen more than 20 tomans per 7 cwts. (about ^12 per ton). Up till August 1911 the rate had hardly ever been known to reach 20 tomans ; by January 1912 it had reached to over 30 tomans; and after June 1912 it passed 40 tomans. It was agreed that there was no justifi cation for these inflated prices. There had been no large robberies of mules during those 15 months, and the number of head of transport available was materially the same as 18 months previously, when rates were below 20 tomans ; nor had trade doubled, or even increased by a half during that period. The 5 proposals mentioned above were put to the assembled merchants by the Governor, and adopted unanimously. The British merchants in my presence agreed likewise. The Governor announced his intention of telegraphing also to the Governor General of Pars regarding this agreement between merchants to reduce the rates of hire, and of asking him to take similar steps in Shiraz. The Governor in conclusion addressed merchants, in a similar sense to that which I had previously explained to him, warning them that goods were comingdown to Ispahan from the north, that if they were not careful they would lose the markets of Pars also: that they were losing ground through lack of unity, and jealousy. On the proposition of some merchants present it was decided that mule c bickerings and the re-inflation of rates, and the whole agreement from being wrecked. In order to secure a proper control over mules leaving the port, the Governor proposed to institute a Forwarding Department of the Town under his own control in the Government House. He has since employed a special clerk with proper ledgers to receive applications from merchants for mules, and to allot the daily number in propor tion. This system of division prevailed for over a month, when complaints were made by a British firm that the Persian merchants were taking unfair advantage of those who were working honestly, in that they were preventing them securing their requirements by applying for excessive numbers of mules. A second meeting of all forwarding merchants was held, attended by British merchants interested and myself, when all reiterated their approval of the decision to keep rates down, and of the utility of the “ Forwarding Department,” though one British firm still objected to their forwardings being under Persian control: but it was agreed that the division of mules would be fairer if made on a basis of the number of packages, which each merchant in Bushire had on hand. These were to be ascertained by counting, and the numbers thus arrived at added to as fresh goods arrived, by presenting the Customs Import Passes to the Forwarding Department. Action was taken accordingly and during January-February 1913 distribution of mules was made on this basis. It was further decided to leave rates as they were till the middle of February, or tifl the grazing season began in March, when it was hoped to convoke another meeting to decide on still lower rates of hire (about 20 tomans), nearer the normal conditions of former years. All merchants, including the British representatives signed the agreement. During December and January, the two months since this hire agreement has been in being, the number of mules leaving for up-country has been estimated as follows, and shows a marked increase on the previous months,—a result no doubt of the stipulation for transport to Shiraz within 16 days contained in the agreement:— The reduction of about 15 tomans per 775 lbs. in rates during these last two months has resulted in a total saving of 55,620 tomans or £ 10,100 on the rates, which had been bolstered up from August to November. This sum represents not only a saving to all Persian and British importing firms, but more important still, it means that goods forwarded under these reduced rates can be forwarded to Isfahan wdth better prospects of competing with the prices of goods imported from Russia and the north. Our whole objective must be to retard, as long as possible, the capture of the Isfahan market by Russian trade, and for this reason this movement in Bushire to bring back prices of transport from the south to normal level is entitled to our strongest support. With only one exception, British representative agents are strongly in favour of the continuance of the system of control, of rates of hire. 1 his policy is dictated also by our difficult position in Central Persia, and it certainly should not be deviated from, should any single firm, for motives of private advantage, be inclined to dissent. available for transport should be divided daily and proportionately in accordanc with merchants’ requirements, otherwise it would be impossible to prevent'-^ November 1912 December 1912 January 1913 September 1912 October 1912 August 1912 Mules. 2,770 1,847 3&gt; l 93 2,486 3.934 3.492 C 89 FD— 44 — 1 - 3 - 13 —GCBP Simla H.

In continuation of my despatch No. 6-Commercial, dated 11th August 1912, I have the honour to submit, for your information, a memorandum drawn up by Mr. H. G. Chick on the present condition of the Bushire-Shiraz Boad, especially in regard to rates of transport and transit impositions levied. It is timely at this juncture, when the road question is in evidence, as demonstrating the extreme difficulty of the conditions with which trade to and from the interior has to contend. As it reaches me just as I am leaving headquarters for some days, I venture to leave it to tell its own tale and to refrain from detailed comment. I am sending a copy to His Majesty’s Minister and to the Foreign Depart ment of the Government of India, together with a copy of this communication. Memorandum on the Bushire-Shiraz Boad from August to October 1912. # This note records conditions on the Bushire-Shiraz trade route for the period following that covered by my last memorandum up to the arrival of the new Governor-General of Fars at Shiraz, with some observations on prospects in the near future. Previous memoranda, bearing on the same subject and more particularly concerning “ Bahdari,” were forwarded under cover of the following despatches by His Majesty’s Consulate-General: — No. 2-Commercial, July 18, 1909, to the Foreign Office. No. 55-1673, June 27, 1911, to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 47-1627, July 18, 1912, to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 6-Commercial, August 11, 1912, to Foreign Office. As fully explained in the paper last mentioned, the question of cc Bahdari,” ! in its various aspects, is by far the most important feature of the disturbing situa tion created by the present anarchy, and damage to British interests; until it is completely rooted out, and the sedentary and tribal Chiefs prevented by force, or by subsidy and a show of force, from exacting it, the existing insecurity will continue. This fact is beginning to be more generally recognised in Persia, if not by the Central Government, at any rate by European interests and by the present Provincial Governors at Bushire and Shiraz. However, during the period under report, there were additional factors, increasing the anarchic conditions produced by “ Bahdari,” and augmenting the difficult position in which trade in Southern Persia is now situated. This includes hostilities between districts along the route, rates of hire, insufficiency of mules and the Etate of the Shiraz-Ispahan and Ahwaz-Ispahan roads.— Uahdari. According to the list included in the memorandum under cover of No. 6- Commercial of August 11, 1912, totals of exactions by Khans and tufangchis had risen from— to- June 1907 January 1910 February 1910 March 1910 . April 1910 September 1911 January 1912. March 1912 . May 1912 Krans 3-70 per mule. „ 11-15 „ 9-75 „ 9-35 7-10 17-95 per mule. 23-12 21-35 27-50 Personal and careful enquiries from muleteers since August have shown me that exactions have been far more severe than previous to that date. Specimen lists giving in detail the sums taken at each place during August, September, and October are appended; it will be noticed that four of them, exceed 40 krans (14 shillings per mule). The totals are August 1912 . September 1912 October 13, 1912 October 1912 October 22, 1912 Krans 31-8 shahis. „ 44-17 „ 47-6 „ 48-14 .. 40-4 The position with regard to “ Rahdari ” had therefore become more serious than ever by the time of Mukhhir-us-Sultaneh’s arrival at Shiraz, having nearly doubled since the spring of 1912. After the incursion of Soulet-ud-Dowleh’s followers on to the road about 20 miles from Shiraz, Qawam-ul-Mulk ordered that caravans should take a circuitous route from Shiraz to near Dashtarjin: but the Kashkuh Khans, wdio w r ere put in so-called charge of this short stretch, forced muleteers to pay 5 and 7 krans per mule while traversing it. A further abuse is the 3 to 4 krans taken in Shiraz itself on each mule by the Qawam and his Kashkuli adherents, and the Jths kran at present taken by the Governor of Bushire at the town-gate on the pretext that he is driven to it by the refusal of the Customs to pay his allowances. It is true that the Governor undertakes to discontinue this impost as soon as his financial difficulties with the Customs are adjusted. Meanwdiile levies of this nature at Shiraz and Bushire afford a pernicious example to the headmen on the road, and make them the less inclined to forego this lucrative source of income. Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh arrived at Shiraz in the middle of October fully acquainted with the urgent need of suppressing “ Rahdari ” as the first item m the programme for re-establishing order along the road. He at once sent two Swedish officers and Swedish gendarmes said to number 150 as far as Kazerun: they were to employ from villages along the road a further 100 tufangchis, who •were to be paid by the gendarmerie, and they were to stop all “ Rahdari ’ bet ween Shiraz and Kazerun. The Governor-General did not propose to deal actively with the road between Kazerun and Bushire, where the position of the tribal Chiefs is far more solidly established than north of Kazerun, but he sent a Mamur with orders to the Khans in question to cease their exactions. These two measures have been practically abortive. By the middle of November the Swedish gendarmerie were withdrawn ; according to the Governor- General’s own statement, they had been unable to prevent the local Chiefs from Dashtariin to Kazerun from taking “ Rahdari,” or from putting their own tufang chis along the road. From Dashtarjin in Shiraz, a distance of 40 miles on y,&gt;“BaMari” was said to have been stopped, but it is doubtful whether this continues to be the case. As for the special Mamur between Kazerun and Bushire, he was firstly a man of very mediocre standing, an ex-artillery man from Bushire, and the letters which he bore from the Governor-General showed entire ignorance on His Excellency’s part of the local situation. Thus Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh wrote to Ismail Khan of Shabancara, the borders of whose district are at least 10 to 20 miles from the caravan route, ordering him to cease from levying “ Bahdari.” In another order the same Khan was told to co-operate with the Khan of Daliki (a blood enemy, with whom Ismail Khan had been fighting only a few weeks previously) for the purpose of recovering the Persian Government cartridges looted at Konar Takhteh in August, and of punishing the robbers—the fact being that the cartridges had been appropriated by the brother of the Khan of Daliki and that the Khan of Daliki was himself indirectly in the ‘ outrage.’ The new Governor-General has therefore conveyed a general impression of weakness through his ineffective treatment of the road and “ Bahdari ” question. Hates of Mule hire to Shiraz. Muleteers under the exorbitant exactions prevailing during the recent few months have of course incurred heavy expenses, but at the same time they have exploited their losses over “ Bahdari ” and “ Alafi ” in order to get mer chants in Bushire to pay higher rates of hire. Of late these have been pre posterous. The following figures show the rise in rates: they are per 100 mans, i.e., 775 lbs., or roughly 2 mule-loads:— March 1907-08 „ 1908-09 „ 1909-10 „ 1910 January 1911 March 1911 April 1911 May-June 1911 July-August 1911 January 1912 Pebruary-May 1912 June 1912 July 1912 August-September 1912 October 1912 Krans 55=£1.

Dp till August 1911 the rate had never been known to exceed 20 tomans per 7 cwts.: up till January 1912 it had never passed 30 tomans; up till June 1912 it had never passed 40 tomans. Not only has the rate touched 50 tomans (£9) for general merchandise but in October muleteers were asking 32 tomans (about £6) for each mule of a convoy of 160 mules to take supplies to the Central India Horse m Shiraz : the total bill, had not the rate been slightly beaten down, would have come to nearly £1,000. Considering that the regiment requires constant despatch °l provisions, it will be seen how costly these rates, and the anarchy that has occasioned them, are proving for the British Government. As for the way in which His Majesty’s officers and Europeans are affected, it suffices to note that muleteers w'ould not 2 2 loads ^ ’ Smart in Shiraz under a rate which worked out at 70 tomans (£13) pci m load.With rates of hire from Bushire to Shiraz never less than 40 tomans per 7 cvts., nearly £20 per ton, during the past 6 months, and from Shiraz to Ispahan 38 tomans or more per 7 cwts., it will be realised how hopelessly impossible it has been to put goods from the South on the Ispahan market at prices that would pay. It has not even paid to transport many classes of goods as far as Shiraz : Russian oil from the North, with a land transit of over 800 miles to Shiraz, can be put on the market there cheaper than Kerosene from the Gulf, only 185 miles away. Shiraz merchants are feeling the strain very severely ; the markets are congested, they are unable to sell freely, or at good prices, and they are often hard pressed to pay transport hire. The following figures from Messrs. Lynch’s weekly reports at Ispahan show that the Ahwaz-Ispahan Road supplied Ispahan with practically no goods from the Gulf during the period under review 3rd August 1912 . • Packages 10 th August 1912- • • „ 17th August 1912 . . &gt;&gt; 24th August 1912 . . , 3 31st August 1912 . . „ 7 th September 1912 . . „ 14th September 1912 . • „ 21st September 1912 . . „ 28th September 1912 . . „ 5th October 1912 . . • „ 12th October 1912 19th October 1912 . • „ 26th October 1912 . . „ 2nd November 1912 . . „ Received Ispahan.

Not only will the damage to British influence and to British firms engaged in Persian trade be enormous, but it is peculiarly unfortu nate just as railway concessions are in course of discussion. Since July the diaries of His Majesty’s Consul-General at Ispahan point to a 'reat increase of Russian trade to Ispahan from the north. I venture to append extracts covering the period under report. 13th July 1912 .—There have been numerous arrivals from Resht and Qazvin. 20th July 1912 .—Numerous caravans continue to arrive from Resht and Qazvin. 3rd August 1912 .—On 27th July a large caravan reported to amount to (300 700 head of transport arrived from Resht with sugar, etc. 10th August 1912 .—Large caravans amounting to about 1,000 head of transport have left Ispahan for Resht during the week, chiefly laden with cotton. 17th August 1912 .—A large caravan with specie for the Russian Bank arrived on the 16th instant. 21th August 1912. —On 21st August 23 waggons escorted by Persian Cossacks arrived from Tehran.

On the same date 80 mules also laden with Russian piece-goods. 31st August 1912 .—Pive more waggons, 2 with Russian piece-goods for Persian merchants, one of groceries, arrived. There have been numerous arrivals of mule and camel caravans with sugar from the north. 6th September 1912 .—There were some further arrivals of sugar from Qazvin at the beginning of the week. 14th September 1912 .-—Very large caravans reported to consist of 2 ooo 3,000 camels and 400—800 mules and donkeys arrived from Resht, Qazvin with sugar, petroleum, and silk.5 Eeshf^^ of caravans from to arfv^SSVetf _LarSe Ca ” ^ ^ and P etroIett ® continue amvffroTnortk^ -1 ^ 86 ° f petr ° leum and su S ar C0Ilti ^e to 2nd November 1912—About 53 bales Russian piece-goods for Persian fraders.

In August, following the forward movement by Soulet-ud-Dowlpb W robberies of petty caravans near Chenar Rahdar, the 2gehlLeen KhZh Zmian and that place was thought unsafe for caravan traffic, and muleteers were obliged to make a considerable detour. At the same time fighting wasTn progress from Kazerun to the Tangi-Turkan between Ali Mohammed the .^w and Kashkuli protege who was implicated in the attack on ^e Central India Horse m December last, and on the other side the Kalantar of district n ^ ^ Shat&gt;anCara and ■ K:umar ^ tufan gcliis holding the Kumarij hos ™ ie 1 s were finished on the Kazerun side of the Tang-i-Turkan the Kumarrps and Shabancara tufangchis became involved in a prolonged conflict astmg aH September and part of October with the district of Konar Takhteh and the Khan of Daliki. The Konar Takhteh men captured Cheroom, a village belonging to Kumarij at the foot of the Kumarij Kotal. The Kumarifis fite 0C S ed +P ? f ? e P tember ’ caravans were exposed to rifle * J he h0S l ll f wa ^ h commanding the village, and more than Z^1 ee ^ WaS f^ 0r “ ed - Caravans were unable for a time to pass J 0mt - ^ ^ m September no mules arrived at Bushire. Later, in !Sfw£ na £ TaMl *? h P i a o? 5 P art 0f the KashMi dan of the Qashgais joined forces with the Kumarij and Shabancara men, while on the opposite side the Khan of Borazjun sent 100 men to aid his ally of Daliki. The villages of Jafferjin and Banaki in the Konar Takhteh plain have become particularly notorious for their ill-treatment of caravans, extortion, general tur bulence and insulting behaviour to Europeans. The Telegraph Inspector, a Germap. merchant, the Central India Horse and British officers have all made serious complaints of treatment received there in 1912, and together with the mstrict on the Kazerun plain near the scene of the attack in December last, the Jionar iakhteh plain requires early and drastic measures. 0n J he lst October a convoy of supplies for the Central India Horse were e up for several days by the Khan of Borazjun at that town, and prevented from leaving, though he knew well that they were hired hy the British ? u ferities. This Khan has since 1909 taken every opportunity of showing Hostility to British troops and interests in addition, his blood-feud with the neighbouring district of Shabancara and his boorish character make his removal very desirable for the peace of the road. Other caravans were held up at the same time, the Khan of Borazjun asserting that he was taking this action more particularly against Kazeruni muleteers, in revenge for Borazjunis having been plundered near Kazerun, and tor his Shabancara enemies being allowed to establish themselves in Kumarij, higher up the road. . Tim Kalantar of Kazerun riposted hy detaining all mules for 12 days until the Khan of Borazjun released caravans detained there on October 14th. The section of the road on the coast plain between Borazjun and Daliki was dangerous all October. Shabancara men made a raid and lifted the Daliki flocks; the Daliki Khan lost three men killed in a night fray in reply to theirs. The Kedkhuda of one of the Boraz jun villages and several men in both Sha bancara and Borazjun lost their lives in similar night attacks. 42At the end of October and early in November there were hostilities about 20 miles from Bushire, owing to a blood-feud between two villages, one in Tangistan, a little to the right of the caravan route. By November 15th it was the turn of the first stage between Busbire and Abmedi. The principal chiefs of Tangistan, who have a blood-feud with the Khan of Abmedi and were also annoyed with the Governor of Busbire, collected a force on the further side of the Mashileb near Busbire, while a number of Tangistan riflemen entrenched themselves right on the caravan route about 10 miles from Bushire with orders to allow no caravans to pass. A good deal of shooting at long range ensued between them and the partisans of Abmedi, while valuable caravans at Abmedi, and all mules in Busbire, including a mili tary convoy, were unable to move for 5 days. It bad already been sanctioned by Government that His Majesty’s troops in Busbire should escort our military convoy across the Masbileb to Abmedi, when the Tangistanis returned to Tangistan, local influences having been exerted on them to withdraw. The new Governor-General of Pars has now asked the Governor of the Gulf Ports to undertake the Government of Dashti and Dashtistan, which includes a large part of the littoral behind Busbire : as the Governor of the Gulf Ports has no forces to impose bis authority on these independent chiefs, wbo_ have paid no revenue for years, the appointment is likely to remain purely nominal. Perusal of the above account of the road during the past three months can hardly fail to convince all that the state of security along the road is worse than ever, and that British trade and the Pax Britannica have ceased to be respected. After two months’ trial of Mukhbir-us-Sultaneh it is tolerably clear that his regime, even if he be given the large financial aid which he has asked, will be a failure : his colleague at Bushire says as much. The Swedish gendarmerie scheme received its quietus in Pars in the un fortunate fight with Soulet-ud-Dowleh’s partisans sooner than might have been expected. A force of 1,500 gendarmes was to have been in command of the whole road from Bushire to Yezdikhast in 15 months from the start : 9 months have already passed and there are no better prospects even a year hence. The men whom tbe Swedish officers have engaged at Shiraz are said on all hands to be quite incompetent for the task. The Governor of Bushire has by request from Shiraz engaged 100 men in this district to serve in the gendar merie : hut he himself states that in the winter season or for any length of time these recruits will not face the cold of the road near Shiraz, nor be will ing to leave Dashtistan during the ploughing and harvest season. The district Khans will not of their accord allow their riflemen to leave their own districts and so diminish their forces. H. G.

T have the honour to submit, for your information, a memorandum drawn up by Mr. H. G. Chick, my Commercial Adviser,.on the recent history and present aspect of the all-important question of “ Rahdari ”, i.e., the forcible lew of blackmail on passing caravans by the Headmen on the Hushire-Shiraz road, in the form of transit dues and exhorbitant charges for forage, calculated to amount collectively to not less than £20,000 per annum. The question is the most crucial one that confronts us locally at the present time, for the whole Anglo-Persian problem in Southern Persia turns on the solution or the elimination of it. The amount above estimated falls on trade, in the form of enhanced transport rates. Thus, while from 1900 to 1905 the rate from Bushire to Shiraz varied from 4 to Tomans per mule, carrying a load of between 350 and 400 lbs., by January 19 l 2 it had risen to 18 Tomans ; in July last it reached 24 Tomans. At the present moment merchants are obliged to pay 25 Tomans, and the prices will probably continue to rise still further, as, even at the above rates, mules are exceedingly scarce, most of the muleteers having abandoned the Bushire road for less precarious pastures. It is phenomenal to me how the mercantile community has been able to struggle on so long without finding itself in a specific epidemic of insolvency, but signs are beginning to be apparent that the struggle cannot be maintained much longer. As regards the “ K-ahdari ” problem, I have repeatedly expressed the convictionf that no scheme for the regu- f See .'erial Nos. 18 nnd 49. i .• i? .ii u* etu* i ° lation ot the Busnire-Shiraz road can succeed or even take shape which does not contemplate the settlement or elimination thereof as a preliminary measure. The Swedish scheme has clearly left it out of serious calculation up to now; and as regards the future, one can hardly hope, in view of the severe setj back just experienced by Major Siefvert and his party, that it will be possible to take the gendarmerie into serious account for a long time to come, if indeed it lias not already received its deathblow. In the meanwhile, the long suffering community of native merchants, despairing of receiving any effective help on the Kazerun route either from ourselves or their own govern ment, have begun to turn their attention to the possibility of making arrange ments for the use of some other route to Shiraz, as they have done before ; and a few days ago, previous to the news of the recent collision between the gendarmerie and the adherents of the Sowdet-ed-Dowdeh, I was informed that they were on the point of negotiating with that Chief for the use of the Eiruzabad route. In this connection I would explain that, in the past, it has always been the policy of this Consulate-General to endeavour locally to insist, as far as possible, on adherence to the recognised highway,—that is, in this case, the Telegraph route via Kazerun, from the mere fact that it has the advantage of caravanserais and telegraph stations en route ,—and to urge His Majesty’s Minister to argue vis-d-vis the Persian Government, that the situation cannot he considered satisfactory or normal unless that route is being kept open and secure. We have, however, been driven before now, by the pressure or independent action on the part of the mercantile community, to acquiesce, in the interests of commerce, to the temporary use of alternative routes, and it seems probable that this development will ensue now. Unfortunately, the Kashgai Chief, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh, though in disgrace with the Central Government and in arms against the Shiraz authorities, is still predominant on the most likely alternative l Serial No. 39.ront^ via Firuzabari, so that, as far as onr own merchants are concerned we have at present no element on that route with whom we can dealer whose guarantees we can accept. For the time being, however, the question will no doubt be huno 1 up as the result of the recent conflict outside Shi»^z, and the Kawam’s con- * Serial No. 57 . templated* expedition against the SowJet; hut as soon as that question has ceased to fill the horizon, I teel sure there will be a move on the part of the mercantile community in the direction of the diversion of traffic to some other route, lor the present 1 do not see that we can do more than await developments. As regards the “ Rahdari ” question generally, I think Mr. Chick’s useful and illuminating report may be allowed to tell its own story. I have ventured to forward this direct in case it may have any bearing on questions now before His Majesty’s Government, but am submitting a copy at the same time to His Majesty’s Minister. Enclosure No. 2. Memorandum on the ' Rahdari ” question by Mr. H. G. Chick, Commercial Adviser to His Majesty’s Consul-General, Bushire. In a recent despatch,+ No. 9, dated 23rd May 1912, His Majesty’s Consul, t Encio. to Serial No. 46 . Shiraz, reviews the situation in Pars and the condition of affairs on the Shiraz- 13 ush ire road. On the subject of “ Rahdari ” and its fundamental importance at the present juncture, Mr. Smart’s review is notably silent, yet when the question is carefully analysed, there can be little doubt that “ liahdari ” and its pre vention must be taken in hand before the restoration of order, either by the Persian gendarmerie or by our own troops. “ Rahdari” is in fact the govern ing fach r in the existing situation along the road, and our hands are bound to be forced to action in regard to it, sooner or later. It may be convenient to record the recent history of the levy. “ Kahdari ” existed previous to 1900 in the form of small tolls of a few Shahis on caravans, levied almost entirely on the lower part of the road only, and at a few centres, such as Rorasjun, the toll was taken spasmodically, and by no means regularly, by the Jocal Khans at the stages, and payment of it entitled caravans to night watchmen, and to an escort of a few riflemen as far as the next stage. It is important to note that, up to 1900, the sedentary tribesmen along the route were scantily armed up till 1900, after which date arms from Maskat began to filter in. Alafi, i.e., another toll, originally as a grazing fee, is, I think, an older fee than “ Kahdari hut it w as formerly levied at certain seasons, and never made a permanent charge. The toll is now become another form of blackmail levied at the halting stages by the Khans from the muleteers through suppliers of fodder; it is usually recovered by the grant of a monopoly of supply to a single individual, who charges one or two krans, as it may be, over and above the price of fodder for each animal, for the benefit of the Khans. It may also take the form of the supply of short weight of fodder to each animal which is charged for at the full price of the full weight. Even in 1903, however, these exactions, “Kahdari” and “Alafi”, irregularly levied as they were, were a sufficiently heavy tax to cause their abolishment to be made on the part of the Persian Government as one of the chief quid pro quos for the imposition of a higher Customs Tariff, and from the point of view of British interests this was the most valuable stipulation of any attached to the Convention. In point of fact, however, the Persian Government were powerless to make good their engagements. The only authorities capable of stopping the exactions were the chiefs of the districts through which the route passed, 7 or 8 in number, and, as they were in no way benefitted by the New ianff,they were in no way inclined to give up what constituted a valuable mo tion to their revenue. The Persian Government, when pressed to have the routes properly guarded, made the additional blunder ot call.ng on toeir chiefs to provide riflemen, and omitting to arrange tor their payment. This omission provided the Khans wilh a convenient excuse tor recovering the pay of their men, and making a large income for themselves, from inordinate blackmail. Many protests have been made to the Persian Provincial and Central Governments by the Residency here and by His Majesty s Legation m Tehran since i.906 The Central Government, however, always replies that orders have been sent; but if sent, such orders are always disregarded: and even the Provincial Governments, both at Bushire and Shiraz, continue to lew “Rahdari” in one form or another on all mules arriving at Bushire and Shiraz, and to all protests at Bushire the reply is that they have no option as the Ministry of Finance continue to include such charges m the schedu e of revenue of the town, and require the payment of it from local Governors (a flagrant breach of the Central Government of its own undertaking of 190d). Since the end of 1906, the gradual and serious development of the system has continually exercised me, and I have collected all available information and statistics regarding it. The growth of oppression was gradual up to 1907 and rapid from the end of 1910. The following instances show the rise up to the nresent, recorded in our monthly bulletins obtained from local merchants. Krans. Cents. June 1907 • • • 3 70 per mule. June 1909 15 00 Approximately.

These sums represent only “ Padhari ” and “ tufangebigiri ” as it is^called, and do not include ‘ £ Alafi they represent the enormous sum of 10 shillings for every 300 lbs. approximately, in addition to a rate of hire which had risen by June 1912 to 34 Tomans (over £ 6) per 770 lbs. for a distance of some lo miles, and this takes no account of loss by pilferage. About the summer of 1909, the manner in which these exactions were levied changed considerably for the worse, and can best be accounted lor by saying that, for a period of 19 months, from March 1909 to December 19 * the caravan route was diverted by Sowlet-ed-Dowleh to the Firuzaba an Jirreh routes (where caravans were treated more kindly), at the end ot w ic time Khans and tufangchis on the Kazerun road were missing their regu ar incomes and spoiling to get at caravans. By this time tufangchis from villages on the Kazerun route, nomina y under the control of their Khans, were primarily out to plunder a livingthemselves; tlie Kh-ms relying on their men finding their own pay, while they themselves confined their incomes to larger extortions at the chief village passed in each district, i.e., Ahmedi, Borasjun, &amp;c. ” “ Auction” of stretches of caravan route .—But with Kashgai Ilkhani controlling the route to be followed, a system of “ auction ” of the ri^ht to secure passage of caravans came rapidly into vogue with the smaller Khans, more especially where alternative routes are possible. There are many examples of this system of auction—“ Kharid though most transactions remain secret to us. It started from the Bushire end of the road. In March 1907, the Khan of Angali bribed the Governor of Bushire with 500 Tomans and a horse to divert the road from Borasjun to Shief, vice the land route via Ahmedi. In May 1907, the Governor of Bushire was being offered 4,000 Tomans (£ 80J) for the Snief route by the Angali Khan (who wanted to charge 1 Kran for every three animals), while the price from the Khan of Ahmedi was 1,500 Tomans (£ 500). In consideration of the road passing by the land route, the Governor also demanded an extra 2,200 Tomans (£ 440) from the Kalantar (who w T as to take it from caravans). Ultimately, 1,700 Tomans (£3 0) were paid by the Khan of Ahmedi, and a cheque for 4,000 Tomans (£ 00) (actually seen by the writer, in May 1907) returned to the Khan of Angaii. In 1907 also the Khan of Borasjun took 5,000 Tomans (£ 1,000) from his tufangehis on account of “ Rahdari ” from caravans; hut as long as Haidar Khan of Kumarij was master of the road from the first Kotal to Kazerun, and had it under one control {viz., till his death, in Seprember 1909), “ Bahdari ” w r as low, not more than 1J Krans per mule from Konar Takhteh to Kazerun. In March 1909, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh undertook from certain Persian merchants in Shiraz and the Government of Pars to guarantee the safety of merchandise sent via Piruzabad and his own tribal country on a monthly payment of 1,000 Tomans (£200). Certain Persian merchants at Shiraz working for Sowlet-ed-Dowleh arranged to take from all muleteers arriving at Shiraz 2^ Krans (about 1 shilling) on every mule. This sum was raised to 4 Krans for the Jirreh route and again reduced by March 1910. It was reported then that the merchants engaged in collecting the impost in Shiraz “ have now found that a great deal more than 1,000 Tomans per month was realised by the tax of * Krans, and have reduced the payment to 2| Krans, which suffices to bring in a revenue of 1,00 ) Tomans a month to Sowlet-ed-Dowleh. One Shiraz merchant 1 ad in fact offered to Sowdet-ed-Dowleh to farm the road out for 2,500 Tomans (£.500) per mensem, but the Ilkhani had replied “no”, that 1,000 Tomans was quite sufficient, and he did not want un necessary payments to be extorted from muleteers and traders. “ Under Sowlet’s management, the Khans of Daliki and Borasjun had been forced to reduce their charges; formerly Daliki taxed mules to the tune of 3 Krans per head, and the tufangchis another 2 Krans out of the muleteers. Now Daliki charged only 2 Krans per mule, and had for bidden his tufangchis to take anything from the muleteers. Similarly, Sowlet-ed-Dowleh had instructed the Kalantar of the Parsimaidan that he might charge only 5 Shahis per mule at the 3 stages between Jirreh and Daliki.” There had been friction between Sowlet-ed-Dowleh and the Khan of Dashti over the section of the Piruzabad route through Dashti, the latter wishing to take more than half of the sum levied in Shiraz. Meanwhile, the Khans from Daliki to Bushire were now willing to pay any sum to secure the reversion of the road to Jirreh by way of their districts. The Khans of Borasjun and Daliki paid Sowlet-ed-Dowleh &lt;r,000 Tomans (£600), in Pebruary 1910, for this privilege. The two Khans (it should be remembered that the Shief and Ahmedi routes to Bushire branch ott in Borasjun territory, and are under the control of the former K an) en applied pressure on the Khan of Ahmedi to pay 700 Tomans (£ 140) an a ri e as his share in the price, and on his refusal sent for the Khan of Angali an offered to divert the road via Shief for 1,000 Tomans (£ 200).At the time of Sowlet-ed-Dovvleli’s visit to Busliire, at the end of December 1910, the Darya Begi, then Governor, stated “ Sowiet ed- Dowleh has taken 3,000 Tomans (£ tOO) and a horse from Shaikh Hussain Klnn and given him per mission to charge ‘ Bahdari’. He also wishes to take 2,000 Tomans (£ 400) from Mustapha Tul-i-Siaki and give him permission to exact ‘ Bahdari ’ 5 . Sowlet-ed-Dowleh’s official “ protection ” of the roads ceased in September 1911, and the guardianship of the upper part of the road tell into the hands of the Kashkuli Chiefs, whose tribal sphere of migration touched most prints on the Kazerun road between Shiraz and Khimarij. The object of the Nizam-es- Sultaneh’s expedition against Kumarij, in March 1911. was to obtain posses sion of this very strong position on the caravan road for the Kashgai tribe, So wlet -ed - Do w leh having applied for Kumarij in 1910, and the Kashku i clan having long coveted it. Whereas Sowlet’s selling of the road to the sedentary Khans applied to the road from Daliki downwards, the limits of possibilities for the Kashkulis of raising money lay over the road from Shiraz to Kumarij, or to Konar Takhteh. In October 1911, Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, told the writer at Shall pur that he was contemplating diverting the road from the Kazerun plain by a mountainous route, called Kuh-i-Surkh, so as to cut off Kumarij, and thus subject the road to Ka^hkuli exactions all the way to Konar Takhteh. In November 1911, the Kas'ikuli encampment had penetrated to the Khisht plain, with the object of further encroachments on the caravan road. In November also, while a guest with Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, I met the Khan of the Dushmanzi.ni, to whom the Kashkuli Khan then sold the “ protection ” of the road from Chenar Bahdar to near Dashtarjin. From April 1911 the Kashkuli Khans, despite their hostilities against Khurshid Khan on the Kumarij plain, insisted on all caravans passing hy the Tang-i-Turkan, so as to pay “ Bahdari ” at the ill-famed caravanserai at the Kazerun end of the pass. From that time till now the caravanseiai has been held in force either by the Kashkulis themselves, or leased out to their subordinates, such as Ali Muhammad, the Kumariji outlaw; and hs com manding situation at the entrance to the ravine makes caravans an inevitable prey to its garrison. The details given above of the growth of “ Bahdari and of the “ auction ” of stretches of the caravan route by dominant chiefs, for the time being, will, I hope, make it clear that the question of the security of the Busbire- Shiraz road goes deeper than the measures hitherto proposed for the remedy of its present condition, can be said to penetrate. The scheme put forward for subsidising the Khans of the road was understood by me as applicable, primarily, only to the sedentary Khans interested in the road to the South of Kazerun. Some of these Khans tired with their blood-feuds and enmities, and having nothing to hope and every thing to fear from an ignorant, fickle Government, would undoubtedly wel come guarantees for their families and a “ trucial ” undertaking with the British Government, in order to ensure tranquillity between district and district, and a certain fixity of tenure for themselves. It seemed, therefore, not unlikely that by “ buying the Khans out ”—pay ing them a regular sum as a subsidy or compensation—and at the same time employing a number of their tufangchis in their own districts as guards with regular salaries paid through the British authorities, the present iniquitous system of “ Bahdari ” might be eliminated altogether, as w^ell as hostility to the policing of the road. I thought the system might be tried, before cracking the much harder nut of an arrangement with the Khashgais for the upper part of the road. The incidents of last December have made the success of such arrangements with the Khons a much more difficult matter, but, even if the Kashkulis or the guilty sedentary inhabitants on the Kazerun plain are at length going to be punished, I am not at all sure that the proposal for subsidis ation and agreements would not still be the right line to take with the seden- ta»y Khans.. T' 16 second reason for unlikelihood of the success of Swedish recruitment in these parts is that the Khans need all their men at home to be ready to fia-ht for them in their tribal feuds, and to keep the districts fully under tillage. The Khan of Angali has a standing blood-feud with the Khan of Ahmedi; how is he going to deprive himself of riflemen by lettim- them &lt;&gt; 0 to the gendavmeue. The Khan of Ahmedi has feuds with Angali on the°one side, and Tangistan on the other; the Khan of Borasjun with the Khan of fehabancara ; the latter with Daliki, and so on. It is waste of time for the Swedish officers concerned with the present gendarmerie scheme to levy men from these road districts. Almost all that applied to the detriment of the Indian Calvalry scheme on the score of ‘ Rahdari applies to the Swedish scheme. The Khans can only regard the Swedish gendarmerie as an instrument to snatch a gold mine from their own hands, and they will, without the slightest doubt, resist it as they intended to resist tbe British troops. With its Swedish officers and imported elements it c o j he ^ 0 arded as a foreign body, interlopers in the district. What can the Swedish gendarmerie do, even in the unlikely event of their producing 1,000 men for the Shiraz-Bushire section within 18 months ? Approximately, the Kedkhuda of Chogadak has 50 men the Khan of Chahkutch and Ahmedi the Khan of Borasjun, not less than the Khan of Daliki Kedkhudas of Konar Takhteh plain Khan of Kumarij ... Chiefs interested on Kazerun plain Kashkuli Khans Puhi-Abgineh Kaluni 200 »» 5b0 it 100 n 1£0 a 70 a 80 a 400 i&gt; 30 a 40 n These numbers represent the minima of men, in my opinion, within easy summons, should an attack be made in any of the districts, or hostilities occur between the gendarmerie and the local tufangchis; and once hostilities do occur in any one district over the question of “ Kahdari ” or right to have tufangchis on the road, opposition will become general. The gendarmerie could not, for instance, do otherwise than cause the tufangchis in the caravanserai near Kahdar to evacuate such a strategic point; yet it is inconceivable that the Kashkulis and others interested would permit this without a struggle, or with out being bought off. In fact, it appears impossible to separate the policing of the road from the suppression of “ Bahdari ” and the tufangchis, who exact it; but in the romote contingency of tufangchis being still allowed to prey on caravans, and Khans to extort blackmail at their villages, the Swedish gendarmerie scheme is not going to be of the slightest use to British trade and British interests. I have myself been a witness, when marching with the Central- India Horse, of the impossibility of a military force of 250 men preventing the blackmail of the muleteers carrying their own transport; it will, therefore, be out of the question for the Swedish gendarmerie to prevent extortion and ill-treatment by sending detachments of 5 ) or 100 men with caravans—and they will not he able to spare that number for each caravan. There are bound to be hostilities, and the sedentary Chiefs have every- thing in their favour; when the gendar- ee Semi No. 39. merie have suffered a reverse*, and found i their men unequal to the task, what will be the position ? The gendarmerie will presumably either endeavour to fight down opposition, in which vase the road will become a scene of hostilities, impossible for caravan traffic; or they will be withdrawn from the road and so become a heavy drain on the exchequer, and useless from the British point of view. The net result . would be the firmer establishment of the power of the tribal Chiefs, the Khans and tufangchis, and a recurrence of the condition of affairs, for the rediess owhich we have already intervened very strongly. With the failure of the Swedish gendarmerie scheme and the non-existence of a Persian army capable of dealing with the situation, there will be no other alternative but to have recourse to a llritish military expedition on a large scale. The situation foreseen above is likely to arise directly the^Swedish gendar merie commence operations on the Bushire road a date that is announced for October 1912. It is striking to note in the four schemes for the policing of the road the rapid rise in estimate of the force required, as each measure in turn was recognised insufficient to cope with the situation, from 200 to 600, then 1,000 to 1,200 men and now 1,500 men, and the increased expenditure from £ 7,062 to £15,000 and now a Swedish gendarmerie, costing over £ 1:0,000 per annum, with an Indian Cavalry regiment whicn cannot be costing Goverment less than £ 10,000 per annum. Unhappily, we can only look forward to the employment of a much larger force, and far greater military expenditure before the abuses are properly crushed. We have thus good reason to expect a further deterioration of the state of the caravan route, notwithstanding that existing conditions are already almost intolerable. In amplification of the summary given to His Majesty’s Minister in^ telegram, No. 151, the following instances may be given :— (i) The first European to traverse the road after the attack was a young German merchant of Shiraz, Herr Roever, who came to Bushire to marry his fianede in early April. According to his statements, he was held up at Biris, and was told by Muhammad Ali Khan, Kashkuli, that after the blood which had been shed, it was lucky for him that he was not an Englishman; he was roughly treated at the Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai by tufangchis, and from the caravanserai to the mouth of the Tang-i-Turk an pass liad to pay 25 Tomans (£5), being menaced with arid* at the last point. He stated that altogether he had to pay 100 Tomans (£ 20). (ii) Mr. Lowen, an accountant of the Imperial Bank of Persia proceeding to Shiraz, was able to start, early in April, as some 30 Persian sowars had been sent to Bushire by Kawam-ul-Mulk for the purpose of escorting Lord Lamington to Shiraz, and he was able to return with them without being pestered by Wangchis. Yet his muleteers with him, he states, had to pay some 7 Tomans (£ 1-5-0) per mule in blackmail. (iii) Comte A. de Moustier and Monsieur Viollet, proceeding from Tehran to the Gulf, had shots fired at them on the Kazerun plain, and again at Jafferjin. They were much pestered by the tufangchis, and had to pay about 40 Tomans (£8) in blackmail. In a written report, which was later forwarded to the Erench Legation, they complained of the dangers of the road. (iv) Herr Heinicke and his wife, mother of Herr B-oever, arrived from Shiraz in May. They were unable to pass from Kazerun by the usual route to Kumarij, but w T ere hoisted up the Bah-i-Bardun route over the mountains and so down to the Kumarij plain, in order to avoid the caravanserai at the mouth of the Tang-i-Turkan, relations between Kazerun, Kumarij and that post being strained. They had to pay about 15 Tomans (£ 3) in exactions, mostly from Kumarij onwards, and Mrs. Heinicke was insulted by tufangchis at Jafferjin. (v) At the end of May, some Indian servants and camp followers of the Central India Horse in Shiraz, accompanied by Baluchis, who belonged to a camel caravan robbed near Yezd, in 1909, and who were returning to India after some years’ fruitless endeavour to get redress, were robbed at the Khwajeh Ibrahim caravanserai and at Jafferjin by tufangchis. It will be noted that three of the above cases concerned subjects of Continental powers; a continuance of this state of terrorism becomes, there fore, all the more undesirable from our point of view; while the impression conveyed to the natives of India and to our men by the defiance of our power by tufangchis, aud by our inability to obtain redress, is singularly bad for our prestige in Indian eyes.63 Conclusions.—The. points, which I desire to bring home in the foreeoW report, are :—» * 6 ° I. That the evil at the root of the insecurity of the Bushire-Shiraz road i s “ Bah flan , and not robberies from time to time by Boir Ahmedis, and other nomad tribes ; the possession of any part of the caravan route conferring a rio-ht to unlimited extortion from all that use the road. That fo r “ Rahdari ” to^be stamped out a large military force is required, for a large part of the sedentary population along the road is vitally interested in the maintenance of the present condition of affairs. That, in any case, even if military force is used there can be no settlement of the question unless the Khans interested are compensated in exchange for their present illegal revenues by subsidies. II. That the Swedish scheme, neither in its plans on paper, nor in the numbers proposed, can hope to crush “ Rahdari” successfully ; that there is every reason to fear they will meet with armed resistance and reverses, which will put the Swedish gendarmerie out of action, on the one hand, and, on the other, render conditions on the road still more embittered. III. That British prestige cannot be ieft in this unsatisfactory state. It is unfair on those Europeans in the country, and on trade interests, to allow a continuance of the dangers and menaces now run by travellers. IV. That, as the power on which the Khans and tufangchis have built up their independent force, and ability to blackmail, and on which they depend totally to-day, is the enormous traffic in smuggled arms and cartridges, it is imperative for us, whether in aid of the Swedish 'scheme or as a forethought for the success of any British measures in the near future, to stop smuggling and blockade the coast from Laristan to the Shatt-el-Arab. The KhanT and tribes would soon feel the effects of a strict blockade, and we have no stronger weapon, with which to bring them to terms and negotiate with them. 64 No. 1811, dated Bushire, the 11th (received 19th) August 1912 (Confidential).

No. 151, was not my intention to suggest that it was desirable to appoint the Kawam as Gov ernor-General, which seems to me an man is fettered by local considerations.64 My suggestion was that the Kawam should he given assurances proposed with a view to impel him to administer the province fearlessly himself in the event of the Persian Government being unable to send a Governor-General at once, or to secure his whole-hearted co-operation with a Governor-General (if appointed). The ideal would, I think, be a sensible Governor-G neral working harmoni ously with the Kawam, but the Nizam’s treachery has so thoroughly frightened the latter, that such co-operation is likely to be rendered difficult by his personal apprehensions. You may perhaps have seen Kawam’s telegram to the Sardar Assad in which he gave expression to his fears and announced his intention of leaving as soon as the Governor-General arrived. With the Kaw^am in opposition or merely without the energetic support of the latter, Mukhber-es-Sultanen, without adequate funds or troops, will have an appalling task, and he is not equipped with the necessary qualifications to juggle with the tribes dexterously, as the Kawam has been doing. The Kawam is far more respected by the tribes of Pars than the Central Government, whose authority is gone Without the invaluable support of the Kaw'am, tilings may be much worse after the arrival of the Governor-General than before. Hence the utility of an assurance to the former. Addressed Minister; repeated Bushire. Enclosure No. 2. Telegram No. 122 , dated (and received) the 5th August 1912 (Very Urgent).

Kawam’s five sowers, whom be had given to Siefvert to help latter locally at Ctenar Kahdar, begged Major to communicate first with Kaw T am, hut be refused. Kawam fears Siefvert, unfamiliar with tribal guerilla warfare, may lead bis men to defeat which would have bad effect on future prospects of gendarmerie and on present campaign against Sowdet’s free-booters. Arab riflemen entered town to-day and Kashgai reinlorcements are expected to-morrow 7 . Arabs are too tired to start out to-day. Kawam suggests I should use my influence to moderate Siefven’s martial ardour until Government army can join him. Of cour-e, above is all Kawam’s message, and I have not yet had time to check his information. As a civilian, I am reluctant to interfere with military dispositions of Major who might resent my interference. Moreover, if he has really gone to Shiakh, he must by now be within war zone. I propose, therefore, unless I hear from you by noon, to tell Kawam that I do not think it advisable to interfere. Addressed Tehran; repeated Busbire. * I Enclosure No. 3.

Major Siefvert and Captain Nystrom, with 80 * Enclosure No. 2. mounted, IfcO foot gendarmes and one mountain gun, marched towards Hivingun near which they encountered Sow let’s force. Great part of infantry gendarmerie fled without firing shot, and were surrounded by enemy to whom they surrendered without resistance. Best of force, with Swedisn Officers, fought for some time, but ineffectually. Gun, breech of which blew up whilebeing fired, wa^ abandoned. Gendarmerie generally scattered and fled, Swed ish Officers being then compelled to retreat with few men. Sowletis tried hard to catch them, but they succeeded in getting back to Chenar Rahdar, though Siefvert’s horse was shot in three places and himself wounded in stomach, but not seriously. There were a number of casualties, and enemy appear to have captured nearly all the rifles, only 14 having as yet been accounted for. Swedish Officers returned last night, and fugitive gendarmes are dribbling in! They apparently took no water with them on the march through waterless region, and it is to he feared that many of the wounded out there will die unless enemy succour them. Business was regular sauve qui pent, and it is impossible yet to ascertain exactly extent of losses, &amp;c. Sowlet’s men were in hillocks fortified with “ sangars ” and apparently got round gendarmes, un used to hill fighting and ignorant of country, very easily. Probably enemy Mill let prisoners go. This disaster will have worst possible effect on present campaign as utter rout of Government force will encourage enemy and make many new lebels. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Bushire.

Postponement Kawam’s departure to Khamseh tribes is having effect anticipated in penulti- mate paragraph my telegramf 319. Mirza Eazlullah Khan, Deputy Governor, Khamseh, telegraphs it is useless his re maining among tribes unless Kawam comes out by first of Ramazau, that already Arabs, Baseris and Baharlus, in bands of hundred strong, are on war path towards Ispahan, Yezd and Kerman, that loyal Kalantars cannot restrain their men any longer, &amp;c. Kawam is evidently very apprehensive of effect on tribes of Gendarmerie defeat. He has telegraphed to Eazlullah minimising defeat and ordering him contradict exaggerated “ tendancieux ” reports which mischief-makers are likely to spread among tribes. All hardened intriguers in town kept quiet for last six months are coming out of their holes again. Kawam has now about 1,000 Arab and 400 Kashgai riflemen in town whom he has not money to pay. He as yet holds them to control though they are of course robbing in and around town in recognised manner of Persian irregulars on war path. Kawam, in consultation with me, is taking precautions for protection of British houses distant from Consulate, but anticipates no danger at present. Kawam has summoned Baseri and more Arab riflemen, and he expects to have four to five thousand tribal levies in town within few days. Allowance must be made for oriental exaggeration in computation, but presence of large numbers of tribal bandits is unpleasant for town. Telephone message from Askar Khan to-day seems to hint that Kawam may have some difficulty in getting further Arab levies, and this difficulty is likely to be in creased by gendarmes' defeat. Force of Kashkulis and Earsi Maidanis is being collected in neighbourhood of Khan-i-Zinian. At present these are confining their attentions to method ical smashing of our telegraph insulators for extraction of steel stalks. Bushire mad is still closed. Northern wires are of course going down with daily regularity. Sowlet’s men have hitherto been inactive beyond raiding Karabagh, five miles south of town. Kawam proposes to make no offensive movement until his whole force is collected, as he hopes, if he can get any money, to make thorough job of business this time.Unpaid Sarbaz sent me round Uobin yesterday complaining of my failure to succour them and renewing threats of “bast”. It lias been usual for Consulates to accept Sarbaz “basts” in past, but with Indian soldiers, ignorant of language, encamped in and around Consulate, I cannot risk presence of Sarbaz which might be productive of misunderstandings leading to re grettable incidents. I propose, therefore, if I cannot keep t-arbaz quiet by further procrastinatiou, to accept in “bast ” few officers as representative. Addressed Tehran; repeated Bushire. Enclosure No. 5.

I am quite ready to give to the Kawam-ul-Mulk the fullest assurances of our good-will and support that may be consistent with the full measure of support that must be rendered by us to the Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. I fully realise that it is in the highest degree desirable that the new Governor-General should be able to feel assured of the cordial co-operation and support of the Kawam. He is already somewhat alarmed on this score, as he makes out that the latter is preparing a hostile situation for him.

The defeat of the gendarmerie force has much perturbed His Majesty’s Government, who are of the opinion that it is of the greatest importance that money should be forthcoming to meet the immediate requirements of the Governor-General of Ears. Eor this purpose I have authorized an advance to the Persian Govern ment of £ 10,000, which sum is to be devoted to the payment of the soldiery and the expenses of the expedition which the Kawam is about to undertake. I will communicate further with you on the subject, but it is essential that you should do your best to see that the money is spent upon the objects to promote which it has been granted; I shall pay the money to the Treasurer- General. Without mentioning so large a sum, you may tell the Kawam that funds will be forthcoming.

I fullv realize that it is in the highest degree desirable that the new Gov ernor-General should be able to feel assured of the cordial co-operation and support of the Kawam.

Following is my telegram 129 to Minister Begins. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has, on his own initiative and without even informing Kawam, telegraphed to Persian Director Telegraphs, Abadeh, notify ing appointment of certain Prince Jelal-ul-Mamalek, presumably Tehran friend of Mukhber, to Governorship of Abadeh. Governorship of Abadeh has for several years past been appanage of Kashgais, who, during summer, completely dominare that region, and Ilkhani has been wont to depute his own nominee whom Government accept without question as Governor of Abadeh. Presum ably Mukliber is not aware of this, as doubtless he does not wish to start his regime by alienating Kashgais. Kawam has telegraphed protesting to Persian Government and also to Amir-ul-Mulk, Ilkhanps present nominee, to Governor ship of Abadeh, telling him to inform Ilkhani that he can judge from this beginning value of Mukhber’s assurances of friendship. 1 am endeavour ing to pacify Kawam and Ilkhani, but I hope you can induce Mukhber to cancel immediately this incautious appointment, which, if persisted in, will provoke dai gerous Kashgai resentment. Could you also hint to Mukhber that he would be well advised to postpone interference with present delicate tribal fabric of Pars until he arrives here and is able to act with full local knowledge of necessaries and limitations of situation. If from Tehran, and entirely ignorant of local niceties, he continues to make arrangements offens ive to powerful susceptibilities in Ears, he will stir up hornet’s nest before his arrival, hnds. Enclosure No. 3. Telpgram P., No. 131, dated (and received) the 13th August 1912. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. conveyed to the Kawam-ul-Mulk the message contained in Enclosure No. 1. of it. He said that Government that he was not your telegram* No. Ill, and he begged me to transmit to you his grateful appreciation nervous, having frankly told the Persian never again, after the treacherous tragedy of last year, would he put himself in the power of any Governor-General, yet as he knew that the responsibility for the failure of the Governor-General would be laid at his door, be desired a post outside Ears. Nothing, he thought, short of efficient troops, could restore order, and in his view at least one tribe both of the Kashgai and of the Khamseh would have to be chastised ; the present system of using tribe against tribe, he said, must serve to increase the general lawlessness. What, he enquired, could the Persian authorities now hope to do against the tribes, seeing that a tribe, after engaging in pitched battle the regular troops, the only power hitherto feared in Ears, completely disregarded demands for reparation. I replied that if he was to co-operate with the Ilkhani, it was conceivably possible that a gradual improvement might supervene, if efficient officers could by degrees be raised locally, but this could only be done by skilful manage ment of local factors. Governor-General (he said ?) was too mild for Ears, which to-day needed a fire-eater, and the present nominee would not accept advice, obstinately persisting in a decision shown to be w T rong. Among other instances of this the Kawam cited the appointment, as Commander of the troops in Ears, of the Darya Begi. He had told the Minister of the Interior that the present Governor of Bushire should be replaced by the Darya Begi, or the latter should not come to Ears, because there was no doubt that he would intrigue against the Mowaggar-ud-Dowleh, with the result that the lowlands of Ears would he disturbed.V. % 70 The Minister of the Interior, he said, concurred in this common sense view of the matter, but the Governor-General flatly refused to reverse the decision lie had taken. Pi nail v the Kawam said that, though he would prefer to go, he would stay if it was your wish, and on condition that you would not hold him respon sible for the Governor-General. The conciliation of all opposing parties is an impossibility; and would it not be contrary to our assurances to the Kawam to ^ge such a thing ?. Of course the latter does not wish to be reconciled with the defeated Sowlet. We must make the choice. The Sowlet is not sufficiently strong to assert himself satisfactorily, and I, therefore, hope that we shall impress on the Governor- General that lie must work witli the Kawam-Ilkham combination. Any other policy will revive the Kashgai-Khamseh feud, and plunge the Shiraz valley into its former condition of strife. Addressed Minister, Tehran. Enclosure No. 4.

Bushire Postal Kossids have gone on strike for increased pay and thrown down at Kazerun up and down post-bags. Two months ago Kossids warned Molitor, who replied that Lecoffre would goon arrive here and enquire into their grievances. With present dangers of road and exactions of road-guards Kossids’ grievance is real. Pour months ago, small extra subsidy granted year ago was withdrawn because of Kossids’ irregularity in delivering posts. It is impossible to get new men to undertake job at present moment, and I hope Molitor will sanction grant of withdrawn subsidy and hold out hopes of further increase after proper enquiry.

Arab Chiefs in command of contingents brought to town threaten to leave with their men to avenge death of killed Chief, who was their relation. Kawam is endeavouring to persuade theinto stay, but hatS sent for Baseris and other Arab riflemen in case his persuasive efforts fail. Sowlet’s men made another descent on road between Chinar Babdar and Zinian and plundered Earsi Maidan donkey caravan. They have also again raided Karabagh whither Kawam has sent small force of Kashkulis. Kashgais last night sacked large tea-house just behind Consulate, and Arabs yesterday morning plundered large gathered harvest at entrance of town. Kawam has moved Arab force two miles away from town. Telegraph wires north an south are being cut every day aud all our preventive efforts are useless. Kashkuli band is plundering just north of Shiraz as far as Zerghan. Chiefs, wlether Khamseh or Kashgai, can no longer control their men iR town or outside even when they want to. Principal Babarlu Chief has writ en to Kawam that he has given up trying to control his tribesmen who are qui ~ out of hand.Two hundred Sarbaz without warning turned up this morning to take “ bast ” at Consulate. I induced tkem to go by taking ten representatives in “ bast ” pending arrangement of their claim. Anarchy in province is now beyond remedy with means local authorities dispose of. Not only Government authority but also tribal authority is in complete dissolution. We can only hope at present to open Bushire road bv driving Sowlet’s men out of Siakh, and preserve order in Shiraz valley by clearing tribal forces out of valley on their expedition to Firuzabad. Monev should be deposited in Bank here as soon as possible, to be paid in part 1 o Ka warn on assurance that, two days after payment, expedition will leave.

Reference telegramt from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz, No. 114, t Serial No si. dated gth August (repeated to Foreign as No. 820, 10th August). Although the presence in Shiraz of an inactive force is not a positive factor in the maintenance of our prestige, it is a sign to the tribesmen that the British here have still a power behind them, which might he vindictive it provoked too far. Its withdrawal without having obtained reparation would be tantamount to the removal of the last cause of apprehension for the tribes, and would entail the destruction of the last vestige of our prestige.^ Apart from our general political and commercial interests, which must go to the wall, we have to consider how we shall be able to relieve the escort in future, in view of the increase of tribal audacity and destruction of inflaenc which such a withdrawal would bring about. Small detachments could ntb sent along tbe road armed with rifles, as they would be an iresisuble temptation to the tribesmen: how, moreover, are we to 3 f cur ® t ' iep “ S t 8 thjs British travellers ?. Thanks to the impotence of the Central Government tins is only possible now with difficulty, by means of our own tribal Chiefs, by which means also the telegraph wires and the iepainn 0 paities are now precariously protected. One isolated telegraph line, chronically interrupted and a Copulate without influence to afford protection, in a o jitute a n nomads who are beyond the control of local ant ion y, impossible situation which must result in the redntr^ucton into Bars o^ o^ troops in much larger numbers to secure evacua ‘°“’ ’ r ^ the bounds the choice of a limited punitive expedition, such as is now wittnn of possibility.72 We hnve further to consider whether cavalry can get to the Coast through mountainous country with over 300 baggage animals to escort, and 250,000 rounds of ammunition without incidents, or whether it would be necessary to send up more troops to hold the passes during the withdrawal. The possibility of doing this would depend on the tribal situation at the moment. There are no indications that the Persian Government can, without assist ance, regain its control over the clans, and I submit that if we are desirous of attempting to avoid drifting into evacuation or occupation, we must devise some prudent constructive local policy. Ihe Central Government being impotent, the only hope seems to lie in forcing the most powerful accessible local elements, by giving them adequate assurances of our support for the protection of their legitimate interests to combine with the Govern or-General, and in supporting such a local Govern ment with small loans, under supervision, and by a regular force of, sav, 1,500 strong, gradually raised by British officers. The Swedish officers are destitute of the necessary qualifications. In this connection I beg to invite reference to my despatch,* No. 10, of * Enclo. to Serial No. 49. 15th July 1912. The essential preliminary to such action would be the rehabilitation of our influence, by securing reparation, sufficiently to give weight to our support to the local Government and enable our officers to form a local force. We might move troops to Kazerun from Shiraz in the autumn, which would obviously be necessary, build barracks, and demonstrate to all the limited aim of our action, and despatch to Kazerun from India additional troops, and then proceed to secure reparation from the Kashkulis and Diris bv negotiation, or, if necessary, by force, withdrawing as soon as we had attained this object. This would, especially as regards the Bushire road, greatly help the local Government, whose difficulties would be enormously increased by the with drawal of our troops, without the tribes who had attacked them having been called to account. I am fully aware of the dangers of such an intervention as regards Persian t Enclo. to Serial No. 46. independence, and of the limitations of our action ,—tide my despatchf No. 9, dated 23rd May 1912,—-and I am also alive to the possibility of our not succeeding in building up a local Government, but it' we cannot take these risks, we had better evacuate Ears at once.

I am not entirely satisfied with the Kawam’s protestations, and strongly, suspect him of deliberately stirring up a movement hostile to the new Governor- General. There is also little d^ubt that the gendarmerie scheme has been systematic ally opposed by him, though he was aware that His Majesty’s Government attached the highest importance to it. I am inclined to fancy that the whole of the present mischief is to be ascribed to him. If he can remedy such a deplorable state of things as your recent telegrams depict with 25,00 j tomans, my suspicions will be increased. The story you told regarding the Minister of Interior’s attitude with . * ^ regard to the appointment of the Darya * Enclosure No. s.

With reference to your telegramf No. 122, I beg to point out that the Amir ul-Mulk has been Governor of t Enclosure No. s. Abadeh since May of this year. I have of course not committed myself to the Kawam beyond conveying to him literally the message contained in the eon- j Enclosure No. i. eluding paragraph of your telegram^ No. 111. I have all along been anxious to oblige the Kawam to lend his suppoit to the Governor-General, and, of course, would never support him against the Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. Indeed but for the Kawam’s fear of me, it is probable that be would have already stirred up an agitation against the Governor-General, who is an object of bis suspicions. Anv assurances which I may have suggested weir, nee hardly say, conditional on bis loyalty. I see no icason to suppose that Hie Kawam encourages the Sowlet-ed-Dowleh to despatch a force to Siavh, w m. is a strategical position of some importance, lor the purpose of b oc ’in., ic migration of the Kashgai tribe. This movement made it impracticable tor the Kawam to go out to the Arabs, and prefit by the dissension which has now so inopportunely shown itself among them, and which I suspect e ias JJ 1 the nsual Persian manner, being capable of punishing the tribe t ns ^ &gt; and in this way regain bis authority.

Under the present circumstances Kawam, if abandoned by us, would still have to be regarded as a local power anl one which, if not restrained by us, might be fatal to the Governor-General unless we lend strong support to the bowlet who is more unreliable and less accessible than the Kawam, and who would even then have great diffieultv in asserting his authority sufficiently to make his support of the Governor-General effective.

Two bands of Sowletis made descent into Karabagh, one attempting to pillage large village from which they were repulsed by Kashkuli post, other proceeding along valley attacked two miles Shiraz side of Chinar Rahdar, snow caravan guarded by over dozen village tufangchis, one of w r hom was killed and one wounded. Band carried off 30 mules on which they loaded some plundered grain and returned to Siakh. This incident has two incon venient aspects. Firstly, snow caravans^ no longer being able to circulate^Shira^/ is deprived of snow supply, and we are condemned to tepid drinks. Secondly, it is now clear enemy can reach detouiy by which caravans have been avoiding first dangerous stage of Bushire road. British caravans from Bushire shou d be very careful not to pass Dastarjin without adequate special escort under Chiefs, which Kawam periodically arranges. Consignment 6.000 cartridges for Ears Government coming from Bushire has been seized by villagers of Jaferjin and Konar Takhteh. Kawam has made strong representations to Khan of Daliki, in whose jurisdiction these villages are, for recovery of consignment, but as latter has just arbitrarily seized Cherun village belonging to Kamarij, it is feared repiesenrations may be ineffective. Loss is most serious as Government must now buy cartridges locally and expensively for present campaign. It is thought possible Khan of Shabancara, who is friendly with Kamarij, may attack Khan of Daliki on account of seizure of Cherun. There has been fighting from Tang-i-Turkan to near Kazerun between Kamarijis and Kazerunis on one side and Ali Muhammad Kamariji on other. Latter being defeated retired to Shapur. Owing to this disturbance caravans are again using Bardoon route. Jabbara and Shaybani Arabs are encamped in hostile formation opposite one another round Murghab, whither Kawam has sent Mamoor to patch up peace. Shaybanis accuse Eazlullah, Deputy Governor Arabs, of having stirred up the discord and demand his recall to Sniraz. It is impossible in view of this strife to count on Arabs for present campaign. Departure of over half Arab contingent has left Kawam with mixed Khamseh-Kashgai force of less than 1,000. Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, is at Khani Zinian, where he with Earsimadani Chief is collecting Kashkulis and Earsimadani levies. Loyalty of Muhammad Ali Khan, who has been muc frightened by pressure of Kawam and Ilkhani for surrender of cuiprus or attacks on our troops, cannot be counted on. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Bushire.To—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran. With present confused situation and Arab difficulty, I fear expedition to Piruzabad is for moment inadvisable. Chiefs of different contingents being all equals, there is no leader now available whom they will all obey. Force may quarrel over spoil on the way and expedition result in disaster. Besides, tribal levies sent at distance from their tribes must be paid regular!}, and expenses of such expedition would far exceed funds available. With means now at Kawam’s disnosal it would be wiser to aim only at capture of Siakh and leaving there small garrison until Ilkhani within a month can descend with tribes. His authority will be accepted by petty Chiefs and then tribal riflemen, being close to their tribes, could be put in motion much less expensively. Ilkhani could then march on Firuzabad with much better chance of success, and failure even would not be so disastrous to Shiraz valley as tiibes must then remain in low lands. Fiasco now would lay Shiraz valley open to enemy. I spent all yesterday in acrimonious negotiations with Kawam who is besieged by tribal levies clamouring for pay. I told Kawam I could not approve payment 20,000 tomans to him unless I saw some prospect of his being able to effect something useful. Finally, by threatening to get money sent back to Tehran, I induced him to agree to following arrangements:— 12,000 to be paid to him to-morrow, 3,000 after capture of Siakh, 5,000 after arrival of Ilkhani on scene, except in case of grave emergency when last instalment would be paid sooner. I am sure Kawam, to keep things going, will have to pay something from his own pocket. According to Finance Agent’s receipts, Kawam has already spent on expenditure (?) over 7,000 tomans hardly borrowed from merchants. Kawam promises to despatch 1 000 men, which is considered adequate force to Siakh, three d .ys after payment of 12,000 tomans. Enemy’s force there is generally computed at 500. This plan of campaign, though disappointing compared with immediate march on Eiruzabad, is more prudent and will, if successful, at least open Bushire road and rid Shiraz valley of marauders. Something must be done to prevent tribal levies dispersing after probably getting their arrears by some effective plundering. Enemy, if left undisturbed much longer, must get more numerous and dangerous. I await Your Excellency’s instructions, which I hope can reach me this evening, as to whether money can be paid to Kawam under conditions des cribed above. To obviate fraud I am, at Finance Agent’s request, arranging for pay ment in Consulate to-morrow of 5,000 tomans to Sarbaz. Addressed Tehran ; repeated Bushire. * l Enclosure Ko. 3.

Shahbaz Snrkhi, wno is89 plundered first consignment. Loss of Government regimental and private j property estimated about £165. Sowlet’s brother-in-law, Muhammad Hassan Khan, leader of Siakh force, sent remnants in to me with letter promising to jend rest if I would give him list of missing articles. I am doing so, but recovery of anything substantial is unlikely. Muhammad Ilassan detained second consignment and asked me to arrange for its transference from zone occupied by him to Government zone. Muhammad Khan, Kashkuli, who has just arrived at Shiraz to take part in Government expedition, arranged at my request transference with Kawam’s co-operation and second consignment reached here safely to-day. This is third consignment for regiment which has come by Firuzahad mute. I managed to get first consignment through safely during Sowlet’s flying trip to Sarhad in May. One consignment of Livingstone Zeytoon also came by Fimzabad route and was partially robbed. Thousand bales of sugar belonging to Persian merchants have long been detained at Firuzabad by Sowlefc who refused to give them up unless merchants raised agitation for his re-appointment as Ilkhani. He is now said to be selling this sugar. I hope you can at Bushire do something to prevent muleteers charged with British goods from leaving official road. Ears Government refuse responsibility in such cases and risk of robbery is great. I think Sowlet and Muhammad Hassan would discourage robberies of British goods, but forces under them are not of one tribe which could be controlled but composed of very mixed insubordinate predatory elements.
