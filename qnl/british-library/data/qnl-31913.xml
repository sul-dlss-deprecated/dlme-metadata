V '•'• ‘^=— ^ External Department Cotton Piecegoods for xirab Sheikhdoms Just a year ago 'we had to reduce the quota of cbttdn piecegood- frcm India for the Arab Sheikhdoms from 400 tons a quarter to 200 as the Government of India reduced very drastically their global allocation. Up till the end cf* June our shipment figures showed that the Arab Sheihdoms ■were taking the whole of their quota and you will recollect that Intelligence Summaries drew attention to the inconvenience caused by the reduction of their quota. When we were con sidering allocations for the current quarter we stepped up that for the Arab Sheikhdoms from 200 tons a quarter to 300 but the more recent shipping returns which we have received show that the Sheikhdoms have been taking nothing like the amount of their quota. In the quarter ending September only 66 tons were shipped against the quota of 200. In view of these figures it is more than likely that we shall be pressed to curtail the quota for the Sheikhdoms as there are nothing like sufficient piecegoods to go round to meet all needs and it will be difficult to maintain the quota at the higher figure of 300 tons fixed for the current quarter. I suggest that it might be as well to ask the Political Resident to enquire and report why shipments^which are pre sumably based on orders placed by the Arab Sheikhdoms in Indla^have fallen off to the extent indicated. We are likely to have our meeting early in December to deal with allocations for the first quarter of 1944 and it would be advisable to have some reply before then.&lt; 3 &gt; Cover for Enclosures in Weekly Letter No. P.Z dated from Secretary, Political and Secret Department (External), India Office, to Foreign Secretary, Foreign and Political Depart ment, Government of India. 1</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003d7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/873</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0003d7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/873</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 6195/43 'Cotton piece goods for Arab Sheikdoms'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1943/1943</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-07-18T22:13:09</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (4 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 6; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence regarding a potential decrease in the quota of cotton piece goods from India allocated for purchase by the Arab Sheikhdoms, based on a reduction in orders.
