N( T p . ^ (7y0 e%L General Department Sir, In transmitting to you the accompanying copy of a letter from the Secretary to the Government of India, No. 1193, dated 21st September 1855,1 am directed by the Right Honorable the Governor in Council to request that you will punctually submit, within the month of May in each year, direct to Government, in the Department to which you are subordinate, a Report, brought up to the 30th of the preceding month of April, of the nature required by the Government of India, so far as your Office is con cerned, quoting in brief such orders or decisions of Government, &amp;c. as may have led to any of the events noticed in the Report. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient Servant, W. HART, ,, / Secretary to Government. Bombay Castle, /V • f t t i 1855. No. 1193. From C. Beadon , Esq., Secretary to the Government of India, To W. Hart , Esq., Secretary to the Government of Bombay. Home Department. Bated the 21st September 1855. # Sir, The general interest which has attached to the Reports upon the administration of the Punjaub, and the ^ood effect which the publication of them has produced, by conveying to the public, in an accessible and readable form, authentic and accurate information of the affairs of that Province, together with a sense of the value that must belong to a similar continuous record of the state and progress of every part of the British Indian. • [ 2 ] Fmoire have led the Government of India, with the concurrence and approbation of the each Depaftment, in such a manner as to present distinctly all facts of importance, and all public Authorities, and persons interested m the administration of In la ® m venient epitome of the events of each year, and a means of ready f ere J e ^^ and discussions 9 n points of importance in the various branches of Government wil also enable the Court of Directors, without delay % COm ^ S d S '^ 1 S f t before the people of England a knowledge of what is really doing m India and will at the same time not ha without value to the local Governments and Chiefs of Administra tion, by stimulating their energies, and quickening their care not to appear to be behindhand in the course of public improvement. 3 To answer the purposes in view, the Reports must be as brief as possible, con istently with perspicuity, and with a due regard to the importance of recording the main features of every measure of general interest, either commenced, advanced^r completed and of explaining, where necessary, the principles upon which such measures are based. The first Pun jaub Report, consisting of more than 400 paragraphs, was drawn up for a special obiect and is too long to be taken as a model for the Annual Reports now m contemplation, which,' if each were of nearly equal bulk, would be likely to repel many readers, whom the iriterestino- and instructive nature of their contents might otherwise attract. 4 To obviate this, it seems to the President in Council that each Report ought not in any case to exceed fifty printed folio pages, and should generally be less. The Reports should be so - drawn up as to present a complete but concise view of the entire result ot the year's administration, the narrative being generally confined to a statement of import ant facts, and no points being treated in any detail but such as are of indisputable^and immediate public interest, a 'list of documents, not the documents themselves, illustrative of positions in the text, should be subjoined, as a guide to inquiry, and an aid to the researches of those who may be disposed to go deeply into any portion of the subject ; and in an Appendix should be placed statistical and other figured statements, calculated to elucidate the Report, care being taken that they contain none but really useful and necessary information, and that such information is exhibited in the smallest compass. 5. The Reports should all be arranged in the same order, under the following heads, or such of them as are applicable ;— ft Judicial. —Ci vil J ustice. Criminal Justice. Police. ^ Jails. Revenue.-—l&amp;ndi. - * Customs. Excise. • Stamps. Salt. Opium. I®. Miscellaneous. Education. —English. » Vernacular. Industrial. Public TTV/es.-—Roads and Bridges. 15.jyr m 20. 25.

Emigration. ^ # ^ , Agriculture. Forests. Mining. Survey, Revenue, Topographical, and Geological. Conservancy. • Vaccination. Hospitals and Dispensaries And any other subjects of jmblic interest. 6. The Annual Reports should commence with the current official year, and should be uniformly brought down to the 30th April. They should be submitted in manu script to the Home Department of the Government of India not later than the 30th July following, and when all the Reports of each year have', been collected, they will be printed in Calcutta for general circulation, and submission in that form to the Home Authorities. I have the honour to be, &amp;c. (Signed) G. Beadon, Secretary to the Government of India. ^ Fort William, the 2\st September 1855. * In connection with the Electric Telegraph and the Post Oifice, only such facts need be noticed as seem to hear, whether favourably or unfavourably, on the general interests of the Province.
