The file also contains correspondence between Hickinbotham, Shaikh Rashīd bin Muḥammad, Chief of the Al Naim tribe and Charles Belgrave, the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.The file contains copies of British Government correspondence from 1874-1876 when similar tensions had arisen between Qatar and Bahrain over Zubarah (ff 178-197) and also includes a series of 12 black and white, aerial photographs of Qatar, mainly of Zubarah (ff 251-263).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="family"><namePart>Āl Na'īm (Tribe)</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Zubarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003aa#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003aa#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003aa#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
