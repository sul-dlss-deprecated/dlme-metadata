The text, in black Nasta'liq script, may have been written by an Iranian scribe in the 10th century AH/AD 16th in Ottoman Turkey. It opens with an illuminated medallion inscribed with the author's name (fol. 1a), followed by a double-page illuminated incipit (fols. 1b-2a). The text is illustrated with 181 paintings of different sizes that offer an interesting iconography for Tusi manuscripts. The red leather binding is not contemporary with the manuscript and probably dates to the 13th century AH/AD 19th.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/385", "Keywords": "Islamic; Persian; Book; Codex; Illumination; Illustration; Manuscript; Iran; Turkey; Cosmology", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [ex libris on upper board inside]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Muhammad ibn Mahmud Tusi (12th century)", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1501112, 1507667", "ExhibIDs": "2037, 2677, 125, 2831", "Images": "CPS_W.593_TopExt_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
