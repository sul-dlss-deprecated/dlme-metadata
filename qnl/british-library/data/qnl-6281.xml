The present practice, under which this Department issues secret and confidential books, maps, &amp;c., so published, and checks the charge certificates appertaining thereto, has been found to lead to prolonged and unnecessary correspondence; and it has therefore been decided that in future the Division of the Chief of the Staff will distribute their own publications direct to Local Administrations under the control of the Eoreign Department and that these Administrations will be directly responsible to that Division for the safe custody of the same, as well as of all similar works published by the Intelligence Branch in the past. 3.

Foreign Office Press—No. 61—21.4-09—133,SECRET, Instructions for the custody and disposal of secret and confiden tial documents and maps, issued by Army Head Quarters, India. (Revised May 1912—G. S. Case 4598-R. &amp; R.) 1. A document marked “Secret” is intended only for the personal information of the individual to whom it is officially entrusted, and of those officers under him whose duties it affects. He is personally res ponsible for its safe custody, and that its contents are disclosed to those officers and to them only. A confidential document issued by the Admiralty, marked “Not to be communicated to officers below tbe position of Commanding Officer of His Majesty’s Ships'” is to be treated as “ Secret”, if issued to officers of the Army, and must be so endorsed on receipt. 2. A document marked Confidential” is of a privileged nature. The contents are only to be disclosed to authorised persons, or in the interests of the public service. 3. An official document or map is not to be used for private pur poses, literary or other. It is not to be referred to in any catalogue or publication which is not itself a secret or confidential document. The only legitimate use an officer may make of documents or information of which he becomes possessed in his official capacity is for the further ance of the public service iu the performance of his duty. Publish ing official documents or using them for personal controversy, or for any private purpose, without due authority, is liable to be treated as a breach of official trust under the Official Secrets Act, 1889, and the Indian Official Secrets Act. 4. A letter of a secret or confidential nature is to he marked “ Secret/' or “ Confidential ” as the case may he. Such a letter should be enclosed in two envelopes, of which the inner one only should be marked “ Secret ” or “ Confidential ”, and the outer one should be inscribed with the address only. A confidential plan or other document is to be similarly treated. An envelope marked “ Secret ” or ft Confidential ” will only be opened by an officer. When sent through the post, letters or packets containing secret or confidential documents will be registered, and those containing secret matter will also be sent “Acknowledg ment due ”. 5. Secret, confidential and other documents and maps, issued by the Chief of the General Staff will be forwarded direct to [leads of Local Governments and Administrations who will be held personally responsible for their safe custody by the officers to whom they are entrusted, exception being made iu tbe case of issues n the Persian Gulf when such documents will be forwarded care of the British Representative at the nearest port, the Resident, Persian Gulf, being informed of the distribution made. Heads of Local Governments and Administrations will forward direct to the Chief of th% General Staff,3 fv\ rtm o. \ / r 8 ,'. o on the 1st December, a list of secret documents in their possession and in the possession of their subordinate officers, made out on A. F. A-24 with the certificate thereon duly completed. Subordinate officers in charo-e of secret documents will forward to their heads of Local Govern- menfs and Administrations, in time to reach them by the above-men- tioned date, a list with a similar certificate. Officers serving under the Resident in the .Persian Gulf will submit their certificates direct to the Chief of the General Staff. « 6. No secret document on any 'of the following subjects will Ire prepared without the sanction of the authority mentioned below who will keep a register of documents prepared under his orders Intelligence, Mobilisation, plans of ... Chief of the General offence and defence and Fire Charts. Staff. Defences, Class I, and minefields D. G., M. W. Ordnance Stores and works ... ... D. G., O. The term “ Secret document ” means a document classified as “ Secret ” by the authorities above-mentioned and duplicates thereof. No copies of such documents will be made, except with the authority of the issuing officer who sanctioned the original. When copies are so authorised, their number will be strictly limited to meet the necessary requirements; and no copy or extract will be issued to any person to whom its communication is not essential in the interests of the public service. Each copy will be given a serial number. 7. Books, documents and maps, issued by the Chief of the General Staff for the public service, will he preserved and dealt with a? public property. A list of them will be kept by the person responsible for them, who, when relieved in his appointment will hand over both the list and the articles to his successor, taking a receipt from him. When any deficiency is discovered, a report will at once be made to the General Staff who will take such steps as the case may demand. The above instructions are based on the rules contained in the King s Regulations and India Army Orders on the subject of “ Secret and confidential documents and maps ”, and are for the information and guidance of those officers who do not possess a copy of, or are not governed by, the King’s Regulations, but to whom secret and confi. dential worhs may be issued by the General Staff.
