From The COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF in INDIA, To The SECRETARY to the GOVERNMENT of INDIA, ARMY DEPARTMENT. &gt; I have the honour to submit the following Report on Minor Operations carried out bv the South Persia Rilles since 31st Octobei, 1J19. This operation was entirely successful. Sheikh Hussein was killed and his son. Sheikh Khayal, was wounded and later died of his wound. The enemy suffered over 20 casualties, while the losses of the South Peisia Rifles v ere - Killed— 4 Persian other ranks. Wounded — 2 Persian officers. 9 Herman other ranks. The tofangchis gave little or no assistance. This action had a most encourag- ing effect on the whole of the South Persia Rifles, and greatly increased their prestige throughout South Persia. On the 22nd July, 1920, an operation was undertaken by a force* under the command of Captain F. L. R. Munn, M.C., in co-operation with 250 tofangchis of the Darya Begi (Governor of the Gulf Ports) to seize or drive back into the Dashti hills the hereditary Khan of Chakutah, by name Sheikh Hussein, who was in the vicinity •Captain F.

The column reached Daliki before dawn on the 21st May, and after the village had been surrounded, the surrender of Nur Mohamed was demanded ; but he elected to light. The village, which was fortified and strongly defended, was captured with great dash after five hours’ fighting, and heavy casualties were inflicted on the enemy, of whom over 40 were killed, while Xur Mohamed died of his wounds. The casualties of the South Persia Rifles were— * Cap tain P. G. Villiers Stuart, M.C., Com manding ; 1A Troops, Cavalry ; i Section Pack Artillery ; 130 Rifles. Killed— 1 Persian other rank. Wounded — 6 Persian other ranks. All ranks fought with great gallantry, and an interesting incident was that a charge by the Cavalry accounted for six killed and four prisoners. 4. Disbandment .—During the latter part of 1920 and the’early part of 1921, the constant changes in the political situation and the uncertainty regarding the future of the South Persia Rifles added greatly to the difficulties of the command and administration of the force. On the 10th July, in accordance with instructions from His Majesty’s Minister, Teheran, the Inspector-General, South Persia Rifles, proposed a scheme whereby disbandment was to be carried out in three stages, approximately one- third of the force being discharged at each stage. On the 16th July, His Majesty’s Minister issued instructions for disband ment to be begun on the above lines, and between 17th and olst July, the numbers discharged were 71 Persian officers and 1,873 Persian other ranks. On the 28th August, as the Persian Government had made no acceptable proposal for the upkeep of the force, His Majesty’s Minister issued orders for disbandment to be completed. In consequence during September, 91 Persian officers and 2,221 Persian other ranks were discharged. The final disbandment, with the exception of small garrisons for posts on the Shiraz-Bushire road, began on the 15th October, and was completed during November. The arrangements made to carry out the disbandment reflect great credit on Major (temporary Lieutenant-Colonel) W. A. K. Fraser, D.S.O., M.C., and all those serving under him. The difficulties to be surmounted were groat, and the successful conclusion of the task, combined with the admirable behaviour of the Persian ranks during the disbandment, testify to the powers of command of the British officers. A list of recommendations will follow.
