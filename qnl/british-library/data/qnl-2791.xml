My dear Daubeny, Please refer to your letter No, 394-19/8 of the 27th of January, 2. The enclosure to my Printed Letter No.C/117 of the 24th of January 194^ and paragraphs 21(i), 183, and 226 of my Intelligence Summaries for 1944 dealt with this 'excellent fuel'. The coke is of very high calorific value and burns with a clear flame but has the disadvantage of eventually destroying the iron basket or grate which is used as a container. It is sold by the Bahrain Petroleum Company at Rs,10/- a ton with an additional charge of Re.l/- each bag which is used returnable on the return of the bag. A further charge of Rs.10/- a ton is levied to cover the cost of transport of coke to Manama. I am sending a bag of coke as a free-will offering. If you desire any further information I feel sure both Rogers and Hadow will be able to help for both of them have first-hand knowledge of the product. Yours sincrely, Id/- T.H 3-2-4f. .G.
