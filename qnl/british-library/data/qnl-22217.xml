It noxi a pear that he had 15eon sent to sound the HhaiJdi regarding an oil concession. o informed the ohaikh that it ^ r as kaom that the source of the oil no^ Doing found in ahrain arose somewhere in Doha and he aslaed Shaikh Abdulla if he would he prepared to grant a concession. Che Hhaikh told m that he had said that the .3.0.3 had examined his territory sometime back and liad left saying they viould let him- know what was decided 5 but thr..t he had heard nothing farther from them. 1 e told me that he had replied to Husain Hate era that he would not consider any application which we did not support and that if they wished to apply for a concession they should tic sc through us, I confirmed this information from private enquiries. Husain Yateen is a youn ' fellow who was educated **UL/v'hjC~^ under ajor Holmes 1 auspices in irighton ; cind is a younger of uliannad Ha teem, ho has been shadowing the •P.O.G activities in Kuwait on behalf of the astern and General Syndicate* Both .re, of course, employees of ajor Holmes. he on’ble ^t Ool Sir il.¥.Biscoe,Kt,,] Holitical Resident in the ersian Ju shire.~ ' T ■— r &lt;wy**-nr'-. - , '-V-.

The Political Agent ascertained that he had been sent to sound the Shaiich regarding an oil concession. He informed the Shaikh that it was known that the source of the oil now being found in Bahrain arose somewhere in Boha and asked the Shaikh if he would be prepared to grant a concession* The Shaikh replied that he would not consider any application which the British Government did not support, and that if they wished to apply for a concession they should do so through the British authorities* Captain Prior informs me that Husain Yateem is a young man who was educated under Major HolIaes , auspices in Brighton, and is a nephew of Muhammad Yateem, who is employed by Major Holmes as a go-between in Kuwait. 2. This is not the first occasion on which the Eastern and General Syndicate have attempted to obtain a concession in $atar. In 1923 they sought the Resident’s permission to approach the Hhaikh for a concession and the request was referred to His Majesty’s Government, who considered that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company then had prior claim, and on the 4th April informed them to that efiect, His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, Colonial Office, London.effect t etating at the same time that they considered the moment unsuitable on general political grounds for such nego tiations* A letter in a similar sense was also addressed to the ,.nglo~lersian i&gt;ll Company. In October 1925 the Anglo- Persian Oil Company applied for permission to make a reconnais sance, amongst other places, across natar, and it was then decided that there was no longer any prim facie, reason for discouraging oil development in that area - Tide telegram dated the 14th December 1925 from His Majesty’s Secretary of State for the Colonies, to the Resident,Bushire* in Aarch 1926 some geologists of the Anglo-i^ersian Oil Company visited the Shaikh and obtained from him anundertaking that he would not grant a concession to any other party for the next 18 months. They do not seem to have followed this up and the period of the undertaking has, of course, terminated* he Shaikh himself is bound by Article V of the treaty of 1916 not to grant any concession without the consent of the British Government.

Sir, With reference to your letter No.98116/32 of 4th July 1932, transmitting copy of a report from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, concerning a visit of Major Holmes to Q,atar to sound the Shaikh on the subject of an oil concession, I am commanded by My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. 2. The information contained in this report, when read in conjunction with the history of the Bahrein and Koweit Oil Concessions, would seem to indicate that the American interests behind the (British) Eastern and General Syndicate believe that the oil-bearing structure extends from the Eastern side of the Persian Gulf to the Western shores and runs under the Gulf itself (in the vicinity of the Farsi Islands); the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, however, have hitherto either been doubtful of the existence of oil in commercial quantities on the Western shores of the Gulf or have not wished to exploit it. 3. The fact that the Bahrein Petroleum Company has recently struck oil in some quantity would seem to confirm the opinion of the American geologists, while the recent ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. £31 4 Alia 1932 The n n d 8 r c Secr,t*ry f O^ta^ 0M 8ECRETARYj p 0LITI0AL AR0 S.W.l. renewal/ ——. SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICEmm : , wmm MM i;WM ^ ' «'«&lt;► renewal of interest in the Koweit concession on the part of the A.nglo-Persian Oil Company points to that company’s desire to secure a share in the exploitation of the orta- Western area of the Gulf* 4. It will he recalled that, although the Bahrein concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate several years ago and transferred to American control *id not include adequate safeguards for British interests, it has been decided that the Koweit concession at present being negotiated with the Eastern and General Syndicate is to contain certain minimum safeguards if it is eventually awarded to that Syndicate. It now seems likely that the Eastern and General Syndicate may apply ^or a concession at $atar, and that, unless the Anglo-Persian Oil Company also apply for concessions in Koweit and/or Qatar, the Bahrein concession may gradually be merged into a much larger undertaking, the whole of which will be under the control of American interests, for the exploitation of the whole of the Horth-Western area of the Gulf. 5. My Lords consider it to be of the greatest importance that the safeguards agreed upon for Koweit should be the minimum for such an undertaking. They consider that no opportunity of applying the oweit safeguards to the Bahrein concession should be missed and suggest that a favourable opportunity will arise if the Eastern and General Syndicate apply for a concession in Qatar. The Qatar peninsula is so close to Bahrein (Bahrein to Doha is about 90 miles) that They suggest that it might be possible to contend that the Qatar concession is, in effect, an extension of the Bahrein concession and, therefore, to insist that as a pre condition to advising the Sheik to grant the Qatar concession the original Bahrein concession must be amended if Anr W: Vto include the safeguards. 7 6. My Lords are of opinion, however, that before the Qatar negotiations are further advanced, it is very advisable, in view of Article V of the Treaty of 1916, to ascertain the policy of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with regard to Qatar. A British controlled oilfield in the Qatar district would be a strategic asset of great value owing to its comparative immunity from attack, and its proximity to the main sea lines of communication to the East. 7. Viewing the Persian Gulf oil position as a whole, My Lords regard it as unfortunate that American interests should already have secured such a strong position on the fringes of what was formerly an exclusively British- developed area and should now be seeking to extend their influence in that part of the area which is strategically the most important to British interests. They regard it as most important that no step should be neglected which might enable the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to bring this area within their sphere of control. 8.

Having regard to the embarassment caused to his Majesty’s Government by the altitude adopted by the Anglo Persian oil company in connection with the exploitation of oil in howeit, the secretary of state considers that., if they are interested in exploitation in Qatar n^ 1 r they intend at any stage to compete against any propo sals whiwh the Eastern and general Syndicate may decide to mane to the.sheikh, it would be preferable that they should enter the field at once, he therefore shares the view expressed in paragraph 6 of the Admiralty' letter of July 28th as to the advisability of ascertaining wi thout delay the policy of the Anglo-persinn Oil company in regard to w at.r . b» bir ^oim Simon also concurs in the opinion of the -Loras commissioners that, in the event of the eastern aiiu General syndicate applying for an oil concession in ^atax , 'j.e attitud. to be adopted towards such an anplica' tion should ue similar to that Agreed upon in the esse oi their application for a concession in foreit, n e con- siders, however, that it would be difficult to contend •w^t any concession obtained in fatar would be in effect an extension of the nahrein concession. m these carcums- iances he is, as at ^resent advised, unable to concur in Tne Under-8e c ret ary of State, Colonial cifice. * * * * concur inD.O.Ifo:C/£lOIG/4.
