The specific focus of the volume’s contents is a conference, taking place in Bushire and convened for November 1922 (eventually taking place 5-9 December 1922), between Persian, Indian and Iraqi delegates, to finalise the arrangements for the transfer of the British Indian postal services in Persia to Persian administration. The volume’s principal correspondents are: the Minister at the British Legation in Tehran (Sir Percy Lyham Loraine); India Office staff (David Taylor Monteath; Henry William Garrett; John Percival Gibson; Leonard Day Wakely); Foreign Office officials (primarily Lancelot Oliphant); the Government of India’s delegate at the Bushire conference (Major Alfred Angelo); the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Prescott Trevor).The volume includes:arrangements for the Bushire conference, including a list of Persian delegates (ff 199-203), which included the outgoing Director of the Persian Post, Camille Molitor;papers, notes and correspondence relating to the raising by Persian delegates at the Bushire conference, of the transfer to Persian authorities of the British post office in Bahrain, in reference to Persia’s historic claims to Bahrain, and British refusal to entering into negotiation on the matter (ff 194-196);a copy of the proceedings of the Bushire conference (ff 98-125), as well as a printed copy of the report of the Bushire conference, prepared by Major Angelo, which includes the conference’s
