Clive). “ I then mentioned visits of warships to Persian ports, and said you had been very surprised to learn that his Highness appeared to have gone back on the proposal which had in principle been more or less agreed to. He said that he could not accept the draft exchange of notes suggested, but he was prepared to authorise local Governors to allow the visit of ships duly notified in urgent cases without reference to Tehran.” Article III bis.— Abrogation of Existing Treaty Engagements. There never has been a definite British draft article on this subject. Annexed hereto will be found the Persian text put forward in August 1930, together with Feroughi’s covering observations. His Majesty’s Government had contemplated an article on the following lines :— “ From the date of the entry into force of the present treaty, and of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation also signed this day, between the High Contracting Parties, the following treaties, conventions and agree ments between the two High Contracting Parties shall cease to be binding :— 2. Here was to follow mention of the Peace Treaty of 1857. the Slavery 'Convention of 1882, the Commercial Convention of 1903, and the further )f Commercial Agreement of 1920—(this last, which was never ratified, to he described, if necessary, as a subsequent modification of the 1903 Convention). 3. With regard to the 1841 Treaty the decision was reached that its present validity was open to serious doubt, and that it would be useless to rely on it in any attempt to maintain the Political Resident at Bushire against the express wishes of the Persian Government. Consequently, it was decided that His Majesty’s Minister should merely remind the Persians of its existence, and lea\e it to them to say whether it should be alluded to in the present article. 4. From the outset, however, the Persians set their faces against the British proposal. In doing so they appear to have been actuated by two main motives : (1) the view that certain instruments, such as the 1882 Slavery Convention, were incompatible with their national dignity and already for all practical purposes dead letters, and (2) the fear that if they agreed to anything less sweeping than an “ omnibus ” abrogation on the lines of their own draft, they might later find themselves still bound by the provisions of some forgotten agreement. 5. As regards (1) it may be observed that in the most recent discussion with Teymourtache (in February 1932) on the subject of the Slavery Article itself, the ex-Minister of Court himself put forward a draft which mentioned the desire of the High Contracting Parties to conclude an agreement “ in place of the 1882 convention.” If this convention can be mentioned once in the treaty, it can surely be mentioned twice. 6. Motive (2) is much more serious, since in refusing to agree to an “omnibus” abrogation article. His Majesty’s Government have, in fact, been actuated (apart from considerations of form) by the exactly opposite motive, namely, the fear that some forgotten agreement of value may thereby be unintentionally swept away. 7. Realising that these conflicting apprehensions had brought about a complete deadlock, the Foreign Office, after a careful review of the existing treaty instruments, came to the conclusion that it would in all probability be necessary to take the risk involved in accepting a general abrogation clause. They accordingly proposed, in their letter of the 27th September, 1932, to the India Office and Dominions Office (copies to Colonial Office and Admiralty) that Sir R. Hoare should be authorised to agree, in the last resort, to an article on the following lines (i.e., on the Persian model, but with the specific exclusion of frontier agreements) :— “ Les Hautes Parties Contractantes conviennent que tons les traites. conventions et accords, n’ayant pas trait aux questions des frontieres, conclus entre elles avant le 10 mai 1928(') seront consideres comme^ abroges definitivement h partir du depot des ratifications du present traite.” 8. This solution was not, however, to be resorted to until a further effort had been made to secure acceptance of the original proposals of His Majesty’s Government, and in particular the following two possible solutions were to be explored before resorting to the “ omnibus ” abrogation scheme (a) the words “ shall cease to be binding ” (“ ne seront plus en vigueur ”) might, it was suggested, be abandoned in favour of “ auront cesse d’etre en vigueur ’’—which latter phrase does not indicate so piecisely at what moment the instruments lapsed ; or „ . . . (b) the High Contracting Parties might admit their difference of opinion m some such clause as the following :— “ The High Contracting Parties, who have been unable to agree on the question of the actual validity of the following instruments, agree that they will no longer be in force after the entry into force of the present treaty.” 9 It may be noted that while (6), and possibly (a) also, meet the Persian objection referred to in paragraph 4 (1) above, neither of them meets the more serious objection in paragraph 4 (2). . .. . . . . 10 The Government of India have now signified their concurrence in the above-mentioned proposals of the Foreign Office, but certain points recently raised by the Dominions Office are still under consideration. J H When a decision has finally been reached regarding the form of the article, it will be necessary to draft, in consultation with the Dominions, an (i) Date of the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian Tariff Autonomy Treaty.¥ 9 * » %_ y 9 exchange of notes putting on record their separate and several agreements to the abrogation of the treaty engagements involved. 12. When the issues to be dealt with in this article were originally considered, it was supposed that the conclusion of the new commercial treaty would precede that of the general treaty. As this is no longer a practical possibility, it will be necessary to make special provision for the preservation of 'the most-favoured-nation rights, and of the right of consular representation, hitherto enjoyed under article 9 of the Anglo-Persian Treaty of 1857. As this question will eventually be disposed of in the commercial treaty, the best plan seems to be an exchange of notes stating that notwithstanding the abrogation, under Article III bis of the 1857 treaty, the provisions of Article 9 of the latter shall remain in force until the conclusion of the new commercial treaty. There should be no difficulty in arranging for such an exchange of notes, since the matter is one which, in theory at any rate, affects both parties equally. (It might be supposed that an even better plan would be to exclude the whole of the 1857 treaty expressly from the general abrogation scheme “ pending the conclusion of the commercial treaty.” This, however, is open to the serious objection that the remaining articles of the 1857 treaty are very wounding to Persian susceptibilities.)

Immediate. 4th January 1934. Ply dear George, Piany thanks for your letter of 28th Octoher, No. E.6014/1329/34, about the provisional draft of the general Treaty instructions to be given to Hoare. The Foreign Office have since seen the Government of India’s telegram of 17th November, No.2727, and we observe that the further revise of the instructions to the Minister received by us unaer Foreign Office letter of 30th November, No. E.7322/1329/34, proceeds on the assumption that the Secretary of state will share the Government of India’s views on all the points in issue. This is, broadly speaking, correct, but there are various oiistanding points with which I deal below. I now write to say that subject to the observations that follow and to any comments which the Admiralty may have to make on the points of special interest to them, such as Henjam, Basidu, visits of ships, etc., we concur in the draft Instructions to Hoare enclosed in Foreign Office letter of 30th November and in the provisional draft of the Treaty attached thereto. For convenience I aeal separately in this letter with the draft instructions and with the draft Treaty provisions. G.W, Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., Foreign Office, \(&amp;) Paragraph Wa concur in this paragraph on the assumption that it is agreed taut our rights at Basidu shall be surrendered as part of a satisfactory general Treaty settlement, and that H.HhG. will be content with a '’gentleman's agreement' at Henjam. The Admiralty will no doubt develop in greater detail the question of the special conditions, if any, to be required of the Persian Government at Henjam in this event. (b) Paragraph 10 . 7/e will write separately about the Duzdap Hailway, your latest proposals on which were sent to the Government of India by the air mail of 22nd December. (c) Paragraph 12 . as you will see below, we are prepared to agree, in the light of the Government of India's views, to give Hoars discretion in the matter of the balance of the Debt. But Inula are equally interested in this matter with the Treasury ana we suggest, therefore, the following modifications in paragraph 12 of the draft instructions: Line 2 'His IVlajesty's Government and the Gove rnment cf India .' Line 4 'without prior reference to me qi Jh the Government of Ind ia. ' rt Line 7 'in which the suggestion, with which the Secretary ox state for Inala agrees , is made. 4. Articles of Treaty . (I comment on those only on which any specific question arises). (a) Article I and Annex . As regards Koweit, etc. we note the views expressed in paragraphs 5 to 8 of your letter of 28th October. I deal with the question of Bahrein under Article VII below. We would see no objection to your suggestion that the woras 'une tierce puissance quelconque' might/might he substituted ior the words 'une autre puissance Quelconque', though in the light of the explanation contained in your letter it seems hardly necessary. (b) Article III . Tnis is one of the Articles which is primarily of concern to the Admiralty and our concurrence in it is subject to any comments they may mak e. We agree with the Government of India that it is unnecessary to consider trie question of altering the title of the 'Royal Indian ferine unless and until the Indian Navy Bill is passed. (c) Article III bis . In the light of the Government of India's views we are prepared to agree to the procedure proposed in the Foreign Office letter of 27th September 1932, No. E.3889/2355/34. ( 6 ) Article IV . Heniam. This is, of course, subject to what has been said above in relation to paragraph 2 of the draft Instructions. (e) Article V . Basidu . our concurrence in this article is, of course, on the assumption stated above, in relation to paragraph 2 of the instructions. (f) Article VI . The position in regard to this is covered by paragraph 8 of the instructions to Hoare. (g) Article VII . Bahrein . We have carefully considered the suggestion put forward in your letter of 51st October, No.E.6512/4444/34. prims, facie there is, of course, a good deal to be said, firstly, for reducing possible points of difference between us and Persia over individual provisions of the Treaty so far as possible, and secondly, having regard to the importance from the Persian standpoint of the specific abandonment of their claim/4 claim to Bahrein which we are anxious to secure in the Treaty, for sweetening the pill if we can. Further, if Article I and the Notes appended thereto are, as we understand, sufficient to establish beyond question the recognition by Persia of the independence etc. of the other Arab sheikhdoms on the Persian Coast, it is arguable that that ought to be adequate in the case of Bahrein. On the other hana, as you point out, the abandonment of Article VII would mean that we should lose the provision regarding most favoured nation treatment, which, having regard to the ill-treatment of Bahreinis in Persia in recent years, it may be of considerable importance to retain. Moreover, it seems on the whole desirable, since so much has been made of the Persian claim to Bahrein, to have it expressly and specifically disposed of in a separate article of the treaty. Accordingly after balancing tne considerations carefully we should prefer to retain Article VII. (h) Article VIII . It is, I think, common ground between us that it would be necessary to exempt the lighthouse staff at Tamb from Persian customs dues, and visas in the event of tne island being leased to Persia, and the draft of 30th November covers the point. We note the views on the question of the lease expressed in paragraph 9 of your letter of EBthnQctober. As regards the point in connection with this Article raised in paragraph 10 of your letter of 28th October, we attach great importance to establishing positively Trucial sovereignty over Tamb and Abu Musa and therefore certainly could not agree to cutting out this provision in order to save the Persian face. We also think that it should be retained in the position it occupies, i.e. in the second sentence of the/the article itself ana not he relegated to an exchange ofaiotes in order to distract attention from it ( though we Quite appreciate what you say as to tho binding character of notes). We have never been very satisfied with the first sentence of the article which is entirely lacking in precision and merely perpetuates a status quo that is in some cases indeterminate, but the second sentence to some extent redeems the article. (i) Article XI * nuzdan Railway., We will write separately to you about this. (j) Article XII . Debt . In the light of the views expressed by the Government of India and the ireasury, the Secretary of state agrees that Hoare should be given discretion to offer the abandonment of the remaining £510,000 of the War and post-War Debt, in return for a satisfactory treaty settlement. He agrees with the suggestion made in Grieve*s letter of 10th November (see addition suggested above to paragraph 12 of the instructions). (k) Article XIII . Claims. We note that the examination of the claims has now been completed by the Foreign Office but that it is proposed to instruct Hoare to postpone discussion in the matter if possible pending further consideration here. subject to the result of such consideration we are content, in the light of the Government of India’s views, to agree to the understanding proposed by the Foreign Oflice and the Treasury (see paragraph 6 (n) of Walton’s letter to Fraser-Tytier, No.P.Z.6392/33 of 7th October) and we concur in the present text of paragraph 3 of the araft 5 ./ article.5 . The Residency. In the light of your letter No. £.5451/1329/34 dated 13th November and ox the Government of India's views, we agree that toe question snoula, if possible, be allowed to urop and that Hoare should not, be required to endeavour to obtain either a fresh treaty article aoout it or an exchange of notes. 6 . I am sending copies of this letter to Parlcinson at the Colonial Office, Kin^, c.t ti.e Admiralty, Grieve at the Treasury, KcClaughry at the Air Ministry, Toovey at the v/ar Office, and Bowyer at the Dominions Office.

'Copies of these drafts are enclosed herein, (enclosures 2 and 3). 4. The Secretary of State, while appreciating the force of the arguments advanced by Mr. Hoare on the&lt;5 question,feels that there are considerable objections to the particular solution referred to in the preceding paragraphs. The proposed exchange of notes would appear to amount to a virtual undertaking on the part of His Majesty’s Government that there are no treaties or agreements between the two Governments, included before 1928, which have remained unabrogated by the new treaty. The Persian Government will, however, wish the proposed exchange of notes to provide for the situation which would be created by the discovery at some date after the conclusion of the general treaty of a forgotten agreement of actual importance; and there is little reason to suppose that they would be satisfied with a statement that such an agreement ” would not be invoked to ’’justify a demand for a revision of the status quo , or as in !, any way impairing the validity of any part of the treaty ’’signed this day.” On the contrary, the Persian Government would wish to ensure that such a forgotten agreement would • be automatically cancelled. Whatever solution of this difficulty might be reached, the Persian Government would certainly contest tne validity of any such forgotten agreement, and would place His Majesty’s Government in the unenviable position of having to plead that, in spite of theirtheir knowledge no such their assurance that to the best of* agreement was in existence, this particular agreement had been overlooked. The general result of this proposal would be to give no practical satisfaction to tne views of His Majesty’s Government, and no theoretical satisfaction to those of the Persian Government. Prom many points of view, indeed, Mr. Hoare’s proposed exchange of notes would seem open to greater objections than the original Persian proposal for a general abrogation clause. jn view, however, of the strong arguments advanced by Mr. Hoare in favour of modifying the line ol action which he has been instructed to pursue with the Persian Government on this question, the Secretary of State has reconsidered the original Persian suggestion for a general abrogation clause. The acceptance of this proposal would inevitably involve a certain measure of risk, since it is impossible to state with absolute certainty that there is no way in which the Persian Government, if they wished at any time to embarrass His Majesty’s Government, might unexpectedly use the existence of the general abrogation clause to justify a demand for the cancellation of some arrangement which had long been in force. Prolonged discussion ol this question has, however, failed to bring to light any agreement not already accounted for at the outset of the negotiations, other than the 1841 Treaty (in so far as it may be held to affect the Bushire Residency) and the various agreements relating to the Persian frontiers. The Secretary of State is now, on reconsideration of the whole question, inclined to the opinion that the above-mentioned risk is so small0 that it might be accepted, subject to the specific exclusion of the frontier agreements, if it appears to Mr. hoare to be likely that the acceptance of the Persian proposals on this point would appreciably improve the prospects of a siisfactory and comprehensive treaty settlement. 6 . The Secretary of State considers however that Mr. Hoare should be instructed ir the first place, to make a final effort to reach a settlement of this question on the lines already approved by His Majusty f s Government. The further proposal, advanced by Mr. Hoarc in the last paragraph of his telegram under reference, that the phrase u ne sont pas en vig. eur” might be substituted for ’♦shall cease to be binding”, is not acceptable, for reasons which have already been explained to Mr. Hoare. At the same time, it may be possible to discover some solution which would be more acceptable to the Persian Government than the phrase ’’shall cease to be binding 1 ', which implies that the instruments in question are undoubtedly binding at the date of the signature of the treaty. Mr. Hoare might be authorised to propose to the Persian Government the alternative phrase:- ' auront cesse d'etrS en vigueur”. Or if necessary, it might be possible for the parties concerned to admit their difference of opinion as follows:- ’’The High Contracting Parties, 'who have been unable to agree on the question of the 'actual validity of the following instruments, agree that 'they will no longer be in force after the entry into force 'of the present treaty.” 77 # i an now to enc?-ose tile draft of a despatch on these lines (enclosure 4 herein) which the Secretary of State proposes to address to Mr* Hoare in ^his connexion, and to enquire whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in its terms. 8.

If* however, any such treaty or agreement at any time comes to light, the Persian Government have no intention of invoking its provisions to justify a demand for a revision of our mutual relations or for a modification ofthe situation created by the two treaties.

Mr. Hoare has always seen objection to this and we had great difficulty in January 1930 in bringing the Foreign Office to agree to it* The point is one which can be considered in connection with the future of the Residency, but so far as we are concerned it is very important to continue the system under which a single authority co-ordinates the affairs of the Gulf and under which the Political Resident would keep in touch with affairs in South Persia as well as those on the Arab side of the Gulf.

The latter procedure, in the view of His Majesty's Oovermienty is unusual; it is ambiguous, and it is also dangerous* It may result in the disappearance directly, or by Iriiplicetion, of some agreement of real value. It may give the rereien Government in the future an opportunity, or at least an excuse, for re-opening some difficult question which could otherwise safely be regarded as having been finally settled.

The only trectlos which could be affected by a general abrogation clous© Buch as that now under discussion are treaties which involve continuing obligations which are still operative. Still, it eecma clear that an article of general application ouch as that indicated above might, in the view of the r&gt;erBian Government, at lecst be held to strongthon their claim for a revision of the existing frontiers in thair fr^our, and even i.% legally there is nothing whatever in the argument, you will appreciate that the Persian Government are not shove invoking involve&lt; * arguments for the purpose of making trouble.

The most convenient procedure will probably be by exchange of noteso Drafts of such notes were enclosed in Mro Henderson’s despatch NOo 464 of the 26th September, 1929, but the wording of these drafts will obviously need revision and, as stated in the last paragraph of Mr* Henderson’s despatch NOo 54 cf the 30th January, 1930, it has always been realioed that the actual wording of the notes on behalf of the Dominion Governments cannot be settled until agreement has been reached on the relevant article of the Treaty, You should not youafcself refer to the position of the Dominions in this matter, and if the point is raised by the Persians during the negotiations, you should confine yourself to an explanation on the lines set out above, without committing yourself as to the form which may eventually be found acceptable to the Dominion Governments, I am, with great truth and regard. Sir, Your obedient Servant, (For the Secretary of State) Q. W, RENDEL,P.Z.3138/32 Department The Foreign Office have communicated for concurrence a draft reply to Mr. Hoare’s despatch of the 13th February (immediately below) regarding the question whether in the Treaty Article abrogating previous treaties these treaties should be named or merely referred to en bloc as 'all treaties before such and such a date'. The point, from a common sense point of view, seems to be one of not very great substance: 4- but is has been argued at some length in the past, and reference may be made to Foreign Office despatch of the 12th September,1930, P.Z.6313/30, which explains fairly lucidly the legalistic aspect of the matter. In practice, the real difficulty may quite probably be unfounded mutual suspicion between the British and Persian Governments. The position appears to be that we suspect the Persians* motives in wanting a general abrogation without enumeration, thinking that they intend by this means to abrogate, as it were by stealth, some treaty which we may want to keep in force, while the Persians suspect our motives in wishing the Treaties being abrogated to be enumerated, thinking that there may be some Treaty the existence of which they have forgotten but v/hich we particularly wish to retain in force by stealth. In fact, it seems more than probable that neither attitude of suspicion is justified, and Mr. Hoare’s analysis of the case in his despatch of FebruaryFebruary 13th is convincing enough. In it he as]:s in return for convincing reasons in favour of the view hitherto expressed by His Majesty’s Government, but it must be confessed that the draft reply now communicated by the Foreign Office is not very convincing. However, it does not seem necessary to take exception to its general terms, for obviously there can be no objection , from the India Office point of view, to sticking to our guns vis-a-vis the all Persians in this matter, and where/the issues are so theoretical there is perhaps no harm in accepting without question the fruit of the combined wisdom of the Treaty and Eastern Departments. The only practical point in which it seems desirable to take an interest is the wording of paragraph 7 of the draft, though even this point is not vastly important. It is common ground that the Commercial Treaty of 1841 would really be of very little use if it came to a question of trying to irast on the retention of the Residency at Bushire in the face of blank Persian resistance. From this the Foreign u ffice in their draft (encroaching in their usual manner from common ground into debatable ground with an appearance of innocence) go on to say that the question whether the 1841 Treaty need be mentioned or not in the abrogation article can be left to the Persian Government. It is however a different thing (a) to know that one cannot rely on a treaty provision and (b) formally to abrogate that treaty, thus implying that (in this instance) it is actually the intention to evacuate the Residency in any case. The question i ofMinute Paper.

This was because their relations with Mr. Hoare are strained in regard to the major issues involved in these negotiations and they are anxious to please him in minor matters: they hope to do so by answering his letter - as this draft is in answer to one from him dated 15th February there is perhaps something to besaid for their anxiety to get it off, but equally it is a little hard to expect us to deal w^th it in a day or two. However I have promised to expedite our letter as much as possible. ^ it should or could be removed is still a matter of though it is realised that it may be superogatory. Otherwise it^is submitted that we may concur. a draft implementing these submissions is submitted.' (jjp Draft Paper. P.Z. 3138/32.

Section 6. [E 1082/208/34] No. 1. Mr. Hoare to Sir John Simon.—{Received March 2.) (No. 73.) Sir, Tehran, February 13, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that in the course of the conversation recorded in my telegram No. 11, Teymourtache raised the question of the abrogation of former treaties. This question was, as you will remember, originally to have formed the subject of article 4 in the Commercial Treaty, but was subsequently transferred to the General Treaty. At the time when negotiations were suspended it had not been given a number among the articles of this treaty, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs had suggested that it might become article 3. The decision to transfer the question from the Commercial to the General Treaty was contained in Mr. Arthur Henderson’s telegram No. 70 of the 3rd April, 1930. 2. Teymourtache said that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government over the abrogation of treaties had not only puzzled him, but made him suspicious. He explained, as I find he has done before, the difficulties which confronted the Persian Government in making specific mention of the Slavery Convention of 1882 and still more of the agreement of 1919. The plan which they suggested of simply stating that all treaties concluded previous to 1928 had been cancelled seemed to him not only innocuous to His Majesty’s Government, who were prepared to admit in one way or another that all these treaties were, in fact, null and void, but neater as a piece of drafting. The conclusion which inevitably suggested itself to his mind was that His Majesty’s Government had in reserve some treaty or agreement which the Persian Government had forgotten and which would be sprung upon them at some later date. 3. I contented myself with remarking that I had read a good deal of correspondence on the subject, but probably not all, and that, if I was unaware of the reasons why His Majesty's Government attached importance to the procedure they advocated, I had until receiving his Highness’ explanation, been equally puzzled by the insistence of the Persian Government. I would go into the question. 4. I have not been able before the departure of the bag to make a complete search of the Legation archives and the fullest statement of the views of His Majesty’s Government that I have found is that contained in the memorandum ! enclosed in Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch No. 281 of the 6th June, 1929. This memorandum simply states that it is considered important that the treaties, &amp;c., to be abrogated must be enumerated,' but does not give any reasons, presumably because these reasons were well known to all those interested at the time. 5. From this memorandum and from other references in the archives I gather that the views of His Majesty’s Government were influenced by the effect that the abrogation of the treaty of 1841 might have upon the position of the Bushire Residency and the necessity of maintaining the validity of the various Telegraph Conventions, and the Slavery Convention. 6. I do not consider that the treaty of 1841 is now of any practical importance. His Majesty’s Government cannot, in these days, maintain a “ Resident ’’ upon Persian soil in the face of Persian opposition, because, treaty or no treaty, the Persian Government can render his position untenable. The Political Resident for the Arab principalities may or may not continue to reside at Bushire, but if he does so it will be simply, as at present, in the function of a consul-general. If, as consul-general, he has the good fortune to be able to spend prolonged periods away from his post, that is, or should be, no concern of the Persian Government. 7. The Telegraph Conventions have been superseded by a single Telegraphs Agreement, which I expect to sign any day now. 8. The Slavery Convention of 1882 will be superseded, if the negotiations succeed, by an article, with a dependent protocol, in the General Treaty. The [416 b—6]2 treaty of 1857 securing most-favoured-nation treatment will be replaced by the Commercial Treaty. In fact, according to Teymourtache, the whole field of Anglo-Persian relations will be covered by the Tariff Autonomy Treaty, the General Treaty and the Commercial Treaty. 9. The Arms Traffic Firman of 1897 perhaps remains. 10. The revised instructions for the control of the traffic in arms, enclosed in Lord Reading’s despatch No. 499 of the 2nd September, contain in para graph 4 a remark to the effect that the Persian Government would probably repudiate the agreement if brought to their notice. This seems to me very likely, and I would only remark that if it is even brought to their notice after discussions ending in the conclusion of an article purporting to enumerate all former treaties have taken place they would not only be able to repudiate it w r ith some reason, but would be able to accuse His Majesty’s Government of mala fides as well. 11. In so far therefore as I have been able to examine the question at this stage, I cannot see that His Majesty’s Government would have anything to lose by accepting the Persian view of this question. But if His Majesty’s Government continue to attach importance to the enumeration of the abrogated treaties, I should be glad if I might be furnished with convincing arguments to support this contention. I emphasise the word “convincing” because Teymourtache seems at present pretty sure that our proposed procedure confronts him with an awkward dilemma, which, I expect, would have its price.lby citing the 1919 Agreement as abrogated, the Persian Government would admit that it had had a validity; this they could not do; by refusing to cite it, at some future date a British Government might claim that as it had not been formally abrogated at the same time as other Anglo-Persian agreements, it was clearly still valid.
