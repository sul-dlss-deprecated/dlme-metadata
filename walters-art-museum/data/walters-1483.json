Kufic is an angular script with a rhythmic and strongly horizontal composition of letters and words. It is named after the city of Kufa in central Iraq, despite the fact that no link between that city and the script has ever been determined. In the early centuries of Islam, this script, or \"font\", was used for writing the sacred text, the Qur'an. The red marks serve as an aid to the individual reading or writing the text.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/80999", "Keywords": "Abbasid; Binding; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Illumination; Islamic; Manuscript;  Prayer;  Qur`an; Central Arab Lands (Near East); Kufic; Early Abbasid script", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Islamic", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544950", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.552.2B_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
