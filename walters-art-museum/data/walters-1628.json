They focus the reader’s eyes on the sacred words in this elaborately decorated copy of the Qur’an—the Muslim sacred text communicated by God (Allah) and dictated by the angel Gabriel to the prophet Muhammad. Inscriptions in the margins document readers’ interpretations of the text.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the seal of the Ottoman sultan Bāyezīd II (r. 1481–1512) on various pages indicates that this lavish copy of the Qur’an was sent from India to Istanbul, sometime between the late 15th and early 16th century, perhaps as a diplomatic gift. At the time, Indian Muslims participated in a network of commercial, diplomatic, and artistic exchanges that extended throughout Asia Europe, and Africa.\r\n\r\nThis folio from Walters manuscript W.563 is the right side of a double-page illuminated incipit for chapter 7 (Surat al-a'raf). The text is inscribed in gold muhaqqaq script, outlined in black with vocalization in blue and counters filled in in red and green. The ground is richly decorated with floral motifs. The margins contain various phrases and words with explanations of their readings according to different reciters.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/81374", "Keywords": "Koran; Qur`an; Arabic; Islamic; Persian; Timurid; Book; Calligraphy; Codex; Illumination; Manuscript; Medallion; Original Binding; India; Central Asia; Scripture", "Provenance": "Sultan 'Uthman Khan [1]; Sultan Bayezid II  [2]; Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; purchased by Henry Walters, Baltimore; by bequest to Walters Art Museum, 1931.\r\n\r\n[1] Erased bequest (waqf) statement and stamp on fol. 3a\r\n[2] Seal on fol. 8a", "Dynasty": "Timurid Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Indian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "CPS_W.563.137b_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
