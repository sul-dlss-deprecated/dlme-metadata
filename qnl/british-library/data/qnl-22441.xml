Kemball, Officiatiug Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government India in the Foreign Department. I have tlie honour to forward copy of a letter received by me from the vr a . a n u , nn . Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, No. 190, dated the 16th November 1901. . ^ 7 reporting an oner made to him by the senior partner of the firm of Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas to subscribe the sum of Bs. 5,000 towards the erection of a hospital at Bahrein in commemora tion of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. Mr. Gaskin is of opinion that, if the offer can he accepted and the scheme meets with the approval of the Government of India, he will he able to collect a further sum of Rs. 5,000, and that the amount of Rs. 10,000 will suffice for the erection of a suitable building for the accommodation of the hospital and the Assistant Surgeon who, he proposes, should be placed in charge. P. At present the services of the medical officer attached to the Arabian Mission House at Bahrein are retained on a monthly remuneration of Rs. 50 for attendance on the Assistant Political Agent and his establishment; this arrangement, which was sanctioned by the Government of India in their letter No. 923 E.-A., dated 7th June 1901, having come into force on the 1st Novem ber last. The arrangement is economical and satisfactory so far as the Assistant Political Agent and his establishment are concerned; hut there is, I believe, no doubt that a charitable dispensary of an entirely unsectarian nature would he appreciated by the people of Bahrein, and might at the same time have a beneficial effect from a political point of view. The scheme, therefore, is one which meets with my approval, and I have the honour to enquire if the Government of India would be willing to provide the services of an Assistant Surgeon, and if I may authorise the Assistant Political Agent to accept Mr. Gangaram Tikamdas’s generous offer, and to collect by public subscription the balance required for the erection of the hospital. An annual grant of Rs. 500 to defray the cost of medicines and a sum for the purchase of instruments will also be required, and it will be necessary to make provision in the yearly budget of the Assistant Political Agency for the small menial staff which will have to be entertained and for hospital contin gencies. The question of annual repairs to the hospital will also have to be considered. It is possible that a sufficient sum may be forthcoming by local subscriptions for this purpose, but of this I cannot be sure. No. 190, dated Bahrein, the 16th November 1901. From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that Mr. Gangaram Tikamdas, the senior partner of the firm of Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas, Lukomal Janimal and Ukkomal Jessamal, the leading Hindu merchants in Bahrein and farmers of the Bahrein Customs, called on me on the 11th instant in connection with the erection of a memorial to perpetuate the memory of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. He stated that, considering the great benefits and security the Bahrein Islands, and the Hindu trading community in particular, have enjoyed during the reign of Her late Majesty, he thought that some fitting memorial ought to be erected in Bahrein, and that his firm would be glad to subscribe Rs. 5,000* 2 4 towards tlie building of a hospital for such a purpose. I thanked Mr. Ganga- ram for his public spirit and generous offer, and informed him that I would refer the matter to you and obtain your views on the subject before I can accept the donation for the purpose suggested by him. The Arabian Mission, as you are aware, intend to build and equip an establishment to be styled the “ Mason Memorial Hospital ” at the cost of a wealthy American. This hospital will be used for the purpose of advancing the work of the Arabian Mission, and it is proposed by the Mission that those who attend for treatment shall be made to listen to Christian prayers and texts from the Gospels as well as sermons while they are being served. This practice has been adopted at the dispensary opened by the Mission, and while a fair number attend for medical treatment, there are large numbers of poor people who refrain from doing so on account of religious scruples, and persons of this class will greatly appreciate a hospital which they can visit without compunction and which will supply a much-needed want. I think it is unnecessary for me to dwell on the subject of the beneficial effect such an institution would have on our prestige generally and politically. If the scheme meets with, your approval, and I am permitted to give it my support, I think that another sum of Rs. 5,000 can be collected by subscription from the local merchants to meet the cost of a building with four rooms on the ground-floor for consulting-room, ward-rooms and dispensary ; and three rooms on the upper-story for the use of the medical officer in charge. The Chief of Bahrein will probably make a free gift of a site for the building. There would only remain the questions of a medical officer to take charge of the hospital and the cost of medical stores. I think that this may be made an opportunity to ask the Government of India for the appointment of a, European Assistant Surgeon to look after the Agency staff and the hospital in question, and for an annual grant of about Rs. 500 for medical stores. No. 286 E.-A., dated Fort William, the 4th February 1902. From—The Uuder-Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 214, dated the 80th November 1901, regarding the offer made by Mr. Gangaram Tikamdas to subscribe Rs. 5,000 towards the erection of a hospital at Bahrein in com memoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. 2. The Government of India, while appreciating the loyalty and public spirit shown by this generous offer, entertain some doubt as to whether it should for the present be accepted. It has been estimated that the initial expenditure connected with the establishment of a hospital will be about Rs. 2,000, exclusive of all charges for building, while there would be a recurring expenditure, including the salary of a Muhammadan Civil Assistant Surgeon its. of about Rs. 4,500* a year. It has also been ascertained that the services of a European Assistant Surgeon are not likely to be available for some years to come. On the other hand, the present arrangement, by which the Assistant Political Agent and his establishment are attended by the medical officer of the Arabian Mission, costs only Rs. 600 a year, and is said to be working satisfactorily. In these circum stances, I am to invite your further opinion in the matter, since it is not clear to the Government of India, as at present advised, what political advantages would ensue from the appointment of a Muhammadan Assistant {Surgeon sufficient to justify the outlay that would be incurred. * Salary of Muhammadan Civil Assistant Surgeon Do. of Hospital Assistant ...

Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 286 E.-A., dated 4th February 19&lt; 2, regarding the offer made by Mr. Gangaram Tikam- das to subscribe Rs. 5,000 towards the erection of a hospital at Bahrein in commemoration of Her late Majesty Queen Victoria. 2. On receipt of the views of the Government of India on the subject, I addressed a further communication to the Assistant Political Agent, a copy of whose reply I have now the honour to forward. There is, in my opinion, no doubt that a charitable dispensary at Bahrein would be appreciated by the people, and I do not consider it of much importance whether a European or Muhammadan Assistant Surgeon is placed in charge. Whether any great political advantage would be gained thereby, is a matter on which it is not so jseasy to offer an opinion, but I am inclined to think that, considered from this point of view alone, the actual advantage which would result is not very great. It might perhaps be considered to be a further “ material proof of our authority over the island ”, and in this respect useful from the political point of view; but I do not feel justified in urging the scheme very strongly. 3. In the event of the Government of India deciding that the circum stances of the case hardly justify the outlay that would be incurred, I propose to inform the Assistant Political Agent that the question of his accepting the amount offered by Mr. Gangaram Tikamdas, and devoting the same for the purposes of a public garden, is not one in which he is required to take the initiative, though, if Mr. Gangaram on hearing that his donation for the liospital cannot be accepted expresses a wish to apply it for the purpose of starting a public garden, he may give the scheme his support. No. 63, dated Bahrein, the 23rd March 1902. From —J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein, To— Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 150, dated the 25th February 1902, relative to the views of the Government of India on the subject of the erection of a memorial hospital at Bahrein and the appointment of a Muhammadan Civil Assistant Surgeon to take charge thereof. I would venture to report that, when submitting the proposal, I was much influenced in the matter by representations made to me by influential natives * as being an act which would be highly appreciated by the people generally, and a likely means to ingratiate ourselves with them. The natives are aware of the fact that the Government of India have dispensaries at Baghdad, Bushire and Maskat for the treatment of the poor, and consider that, as they have closer relations with our Government, they are more deserving of such atten tion than the inhabitants of the towns named. There is no doubt that such a hospital will be the means of bringing the rich as well as the poor both in Bahrein and from the mainland under our influence, and for this reason princi pally I would venture to urge the matter to the favourable consideration of Government. The American Mission have only one doctor here, and he has occasionally to make journeys to the Arab Coast, when the Agency staff is left without medical aid. It will, therefore, be seen that we cannot always depend upon the Mission for uninterrupted medical attendance. If an European Civil Assistant Surgeon is not available to take charge of the hospital, an experienced Muhammadan officer would, in my opinion, dod 4 ■until a European can be spared. A Mubammadan officer would be popular with the people, and if of the right class, would do much towards bringing about the ends in view. In the event of the Government of India deciding to abandon the proposal for a hospital, 1 would venture to ask whether I am permitted to accept the amount generously offered by Mr. Gangaram Tikamdas for the purpose of a memorial public garden with a view of introducing Indian fruit and vegetables, and teaching the local gardeners better methods of agriculture, which would be of great benefit to the islands. I am confident that Mr. Gangaram would be glad to apply the money to such a useful purpose which will be particularly appreciated by the Hindu community, since they are vegetarians.

I have the honour to report that the engagement of Dr. Thoms, of the Arabian Mission, which took effect from the 1st November 1901, will expire on the 30th April 1902, in accordance with the terms of the third paragraph of the letter No. 923-E.A., dated 7th June 1901, from the Undersecretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. The services of Dr. Thoms will be required until the Government of India are pleased to make some other arrangement for medical attendance on the establishment of this Agency ; I would venture, therefore, to request sanction for the further engagement of the Medical Officer attached to the Arabian Mission House at Bahrein either for a specified term, or else for an unlimited period to be terminated on a month’s notice being given by either party.

As regards the provision for the small menial staff which will have to be entertained and for hospital contingencies, I presume that this may be included in the annual Budget of the Bahrein Agency and will be sanctioned by Government. A small sum also will be required annually for repairs to the hospital, and this will, I presume, be sanctioned by the Government of India on special application being made. No. 174, dated Bahrein, the 23rd August 1902. From—J. C. Gaskin, Esq., Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, To—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 481, dated the 21st June 1902, on the subject of the Government of India’s under taking to incur an average annual expenditure of B3,650 and to provide the necessary surgical equipment for the hospital, on thp understanding that addi tional subscriptions are forthcoming sufficient for the construction of a suitable building, with quarters for the staff, and calling for a further report. I would venture to report that since the receipt of your communication, I have spoken on the subject to some of the leading native merchants, and from their replies to me I got the impression that they would give liberal donations towards the hospital: and subsequently Haji Mukbil-al-Tbakeir, the leading Bahrein merchant, called on me and offered to subscribe B1,000. Haii i ^i S -^ ia T 1 ^j 0me i 0 ^’ er influence the native merchants who usually follow his lead ; also other Hindu merchants probably will liberally support the movement, and consequently I feel confident that a further sum of R5,000 will be subscribed. As the pleasure of the donors will have to be awaited, it wul take some time to raise the necessary sum, and if the hospital is to be m\lt m time to be opened in the first quarter of the next financial year, it is desira fie to open the subscription list as early as possible. I would venture herefore to request that early instructions mav be sent me on the subject, the appointment of a Muhammadan Civil Assistant Surgeon need not be made f 13 1 w U n e nex ^ y ear * contingent expenses, sweeper and waterman, or which the Government have made no provisions, will come to about B21Hospital at Bahrein. per month, or R2£0 annually, and to meet this sum it would require the raising of R5,000 by subscription for an endowment fund, which I do not think can be obtained locally in addition to the amount for the building, and it would be a great pity if the project should fail for the want of this little extra grant ; I would therefore respectfully urge that the Government of India be asked to sanction the extra expenditure.

It may be applied to igs covered with iron, felt, or wood, and as it is completely waterproof it is specially suitable for wooden res, the use of which is restricted because they are not rainproof. It possesses the further advantage of resisting ages of white ants, which are so destructive in nearly all tropical countries. itESTONEiTE is extremely light (weighing only four-and-a-half lbs. per square foot one-and-a-half inches thick), and as iletely prevents oxidation a much thinner gauge of iron may be used, thus greatly decreasing the cost of iron buildings. ^ [Lestoneite will also adhere to perpendicular walls, whether constructed of brick, wood, or corrugated iron, ttther preventing the absorption of heat from the sun’s rays, and reducing the temperature within.

Compared with slates or tiles the saving is equal to fifty percent material, with the additional advantage that no skilled labour is required. For wooden surfaces, an inch being a officii thickness, one ton will cover five hundred and sixty square feet, while one ton of slates or tiles will cover only I hundred and twenty square feet, ' The numerous trials made in all parts of the tropical world have led to excellent results be obtained. The testimony of competent Architects is that Tilestoneite is invaluable as a non-condiii and rain-proof covering, making: a solid, impermeable and jointless roof. When finished it prese a perfectly smooth surface in one solid layer. It is recommended by the principal Consulting Engineers to Railway Companies in India, Afr and South America, and is used by Admiralty, War Office, Secretary of State for India, and Cr&lt; Agents for the Colonies. . , , TILESTONEITE is being extensively used by the War Office for covering Army Magafio Ordnance Store Houses, Filled-Shell Houses, and other buildings where explosives are stored Military Stations in hot countries. The Admiralty have adopted it for the same purpose. 1 principal Explosives Companies are using Tilestoneite on their Foreign Magazines. Showing a building which has been covered with TILESTONEITE. Special attention is drawn to the many purposes for which TILBSTONElJi may he used with obvious advantage. For Factories, Mills, and Warehouses. Ihe best means whereby the temperature of such important buildings may be reduced has long exercised the niujj Proprietors and Managers. We claim for Tilestoneite that it meets this requirement. It can be applied to any® building at a very small cost. Besides reducing the temperature it is fireproof and waterproof, and gives a per stone-like appearance to any iron or wooden erection.—(See illustrations.) For Dwelling-Houses, Bungalows, and Offices* am condo Ao proprietor who values the health of his managers and assistants should allow them to live in a house ■— - unprotected. We advise the adoption of Tilestoneite. Not only does it give better sanitary conditions, u i^| the risk of fever and other malarial ailments. The keeping in good health of employees is always a great financia For Station-Houses and Railway Stores. Tilestoneite has been adopted by the most important Government and other Railways in tropical c ^ ul ^ e ’ been found invaluable for covering Station-Verandahs, Railway Sheds, and Stores.

Tilestoneite is ““““ f invaluable for fermenting rooms, bungalows, coolies’ lines, and hospitals, From India. —“ I tried Tilestoneite on an iron plate, and put it on a furnace, and after heating applied my hand on both sides. On the ; side of the plate I could not touch it, but on the Tilestoneite side it was fairly cool. I am covering the iron awnings oi steame “ with it.” Front Bombay Our principal used Tilestoneite for covering the corrugated iron roof of his house, “West Grange,” Matheran. Theresil “ was very gratifying indeed, as it had the effect of reducing the temperature by about 12 degrees. We are having it adopted bytl “ Municipality, and Post Trust, and we have no doubt it will come into general use.” From Assam,_« J consider Tilestoneite excellent for covering iron roofs. Not only is it useful in keeping out heat, but by teducii “the expansion and contraction of the iron sheets, it helps to prevent the enlargement of nail, screw, and rivet holes, itthuskea “the roof water-tight, and lengthens the life of the sheets.” “ The buildings have been covered with Tilestoneite, we are highly pleased with the appearance and result.” —“ The buildings have been successfully covered, and the clerks who live in them inform me that they are much cooler tha formerly.

The roofs which are covered with it are well preserved, and it is a great factor in preventing their decay. It is a good non-conductor of heat, and reduces the temperature of buildings in a very marked degree. It constitutes for roofs of tarred felt a preservative against the danger of fire from without. In view of these results I have authorised the use of this material for other structures, and I recommend its adoption for iron and wooden buildings, and for felt roofs. ii»g !

The Nominal Muster Roll is the initial record of the labour employed each day on a work and must be written up daily by the Subordinate deputed for the purpose, each morning before the labourers begin woik. 2. In ease of large works where the work-people are not liable to be often removed from one class of work to another, the names of work-people should, if possible, be arranged according to sub-heads of Estimate. When this is done, the allocation sheet is unnecessary. a ( 3. The presence of labourers may be marked on the Muster Roll by letters indicating the sub-heads on which they are employed. 4. In case of labour empleyed on several works at one station or on a single work, where the workmen are liaole to be frequently shifted from one sub-head to another, the ‘allocation sheet should be used for the purpose of abstracting charges on each sub-head of a work. It should be attached ||to the Muster Roll when submitting the latter to the I Divisional Office. y S. Sub-divisional Officers and Executive Engineers should be most careful to see that the work is obtained commensurate with the labour charged for and should personally muster the men at irregular and unexpected times, noting such check musters at foot os date concerned. 6 . \The Muster Roll should be completed as regards totals, etc., immediately after the dose of the period for which it is kept and the labourers paid as soon as possible. 7. Owing to the introduction of the cash payment system cf maintaining Works Abstract, too much stress cannot be laid on the necessity for making prompt payment. Pre audit of Muster Rolls is not necessary (vide para. 124 o! Public Works Accounts Committee’s Report). 8 . Payment on Muster Rolls should be made or wit nessed by the Officer of highest standing available, and he should certify to the payments individually or by groups by a distinctive mark, hi; initials or signature.

To ca- f’he Political Agout, Bahrain. prr, feb&lt;± T fSt \916 Memorandum . Your Memorandum Ho.559 dated 1st Sentember 1916. The Deputy Political Resident does not think it advisable to stop the allowance of Rs.5o/- per mensem to the Arabian Mission doctor and divert it for the benefit of the Victoria Memorial Hospital. Although originally sanction ed for medical assistance rendered to the Agency the al lowance has now come to be considered more as a grant- in-aid to the Mission than a payment for services. The funds required for the Memorial Hospital can be ob tained for the present from savings under contract grants. These savings should be considerable in view of the fact that you have neither a native Assistant nor a steam launch at present. 3y order, I Major, Hirst Assistant Resident '-nut ' ' Id'+Kx.TELEGRAM From Fowle, Bahrain.

No. 1939 Dated 18th Heed 19th Octr October 14th 678. If present time is propitious at Bahrain for raising subscriptions for other things than that connected with war I see no objection to your raising money by subscriptions for hospital. Trevor. 0 O 0MusctfS 16th September 1916. jjy dear Fowle, Your letter of the 2nd instant did not reach until tlie 14th. So the delay in answering it is not my fault. But I hope that it has caused you no inconvenience. but it has only been lodged in its present buildingj which is a° fine one, since 1909. With the co-operation of the then Sultan a subscription list was then opened to which the rich of Maskat, Arab subjects as well as British, contributed with great liberality. In cluding a donation of Rs 11,500 from H.H. &amp; his family, nearly Rs 40,000 were collected locally &amp; the Government of India gave Rs 20, 000 &amp; the Admiralty RS 2,000. The balance left over after building charges had been defrayed was formed into the nucleus of an endow ment. At the beginning there seems to have been about Rs 2,000 in hand, but Major Knox tackled the difficulty boldly &amp; fixed Rs 20,000 as the limit to which the fund ought to attain. This was in 1911 &amp; subscriptions were again invited. All officials &amp; employes of local British firms gave two days* pay &amp; donations were invited from the public, Arab subjects as well as British. The progress of the fund is shown by its balances June 1911, Rs 2015; January 1912 Rs5335; January 1913 Rs 7262; January 1914 Rs 12,064; &amp; January 1915 Rs 13, 632. The credit balance at the opening of this year was Rs 14,473. It is customary to keep the balance in the P.C. Savings Bank. Kasib (llaval Contractor, Arab subject) Rs 100, Said Yusuf (AS) Do i Muhd bin Hilal (A.S) Do,ftw two British firms Rs 50 each. The The Maskat hospital is an old established institution, There are only eight regular annual subscribers. Apart fr oia the Admiralty, the I.E.T.D., &amp; the SI.B.I. Coy, they are-: total amount subscibed annually by these is Rs 800/-. I trust that this information may be of use to you.^0tgSSS3SSSBt ' No # of 1916.

Your Memorandum No. 667 dated 9th October 1916, forwarding RMOOO/- is made under your Office Allowance to meet increased expenditure on medical stores etc for the Victoria Memorial Hospital. In view of the fact that the expenditure under your Office Allowance for six months of the year shows a saving of over R 5 . 1000/- against the half years allotment I do not see the necessity for a further reappropriation at present of funds to this grant from the steam launch grant. The savings under the various sub-heads of the Office Allowance grant should more than suffice to meet the extra.expenditure on Medical charges.

Possibly other funds may be founds available by you at a future time to per -mit at least of the purchase of the former.

The correspondence subsequently follows the hospital's development through the initial fund-raising process, it's construction, the appointment of Ghulamah Khan as its first Assistant Civil Surgeon in 1905, through to the commencement of services there in 1907 and onward progress until 1917.Also included in the volume is correspondence regarding the purchase of a plot of land for the site of the hospital from Musa'ad bin Khalifah; correspondence and receipts regarding the purchase of building and construction supplies from local merchants; and correspondence and receipts regarding orders for medicines and medical equipment from British and Indian companies.Also included are office notes and correspondence between the Assistant Civil Surgeon and employees of the Bahrain Political Agency regarding the finance and expenditure of the hospital and requests for medicines, equipment, supplies and publications as required by the hospital and its staff.Later correspondence discusses the upkeep and repairs required for the hospital, undertaken by the Public Works Department in 1915; the lack of available funds in order to keep equipment and supplies up to date; and proposals for raising additional funds including diverting agency funds not in use owing to the war, and re-introducing a subscription list to encourage regular private donations.Folio 148 contains a typed note from 27 June 1951 recording that the deeds relating to the plot of land for the Victoria Memorial Hospital had been removed from the file and given to the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0001cf#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
