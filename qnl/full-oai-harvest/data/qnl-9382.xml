Linlithgow requested permission for the visit from the Secretary of State for India, Lord Zetland, because he felt it was important for Britain to strengthen her hold over the Arab rulers there. However, he acknowledged that the visit was dependent on the international situation [the impending outbreak of the Second World War].The file includes correspondence from Linlithgow and Zetland, and India Office minutes. The papers show that British officials had various opinions on the wisdom of the visit, which is discussed on constitutional grounds, and in terms of speed of travel, communications, and the international situation. Parallels are drawn with Lord Curzon's visit to the same region in 1903.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Visits</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001eb#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
