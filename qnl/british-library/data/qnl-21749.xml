He will also '4 visit the Wharf during daylight hours, 2, When a tanker is being loaded at the Wharf there will be an European official in charge who will be solely responsible for giving orders for any action that may be necessary in an emergency. 3, The police guard will live aboard a barge alloted to them and will use a small motor boat which is provided between the Wharf and the barge. Two sentries will be on duty at all times on the Wharf itself, doing 2 hours duty and having 4 hours off. 4, The guard will apprehend any strange persons endeavouring to land at the Wharf. 5* A Company watchman will be on duty at the Wharf at all times and will inform sentries if he suspects that any boat appr oaching the Wharf is bringing other than the Company’s authorized * personnel. 6* A Verey pistol and three red cartridges will be kept by the guard at the Wharf in case of emergency only. Verey pistols must be aimed high into the air. 7* The Company watchman on duty will be responsible for reporting by telephone every hour throughout the day and night to No. 188. The guard on duty will also instruct the watchman to report by telephone the presence of any boats of which they are suspicions. 8. The guard at the Wharf will be changed weekly.NOTE i The following instructions should be given at all police and naturs who have Verey pistols When firing a Verey pistol the man should stand firm with his legs well apart, with the pistol in his right hand, with the right arm well above the head and slightly bent at the elbow and with the left hand supporting the right wrist.Confidential Mr. M. H^Lipp, A w au 1 i« This Comp6oiy , s policy toward a program of defense during the existing state of emergency includes the following principles: 1* We wish to take reasonable steps to protect our own personnel, oil field, refinery and other equipment and property against damage resulting from sabotage• From the Company f s 'commercial' viewpoint 'reason- ability' is to be measured in terms of cost of reducing an excessive hazard to something like the normal hazard inherent in oil operations, -- compared to the loss which would be suffered if the hazard became an actuality, — qualified by the liklihood of its becoming an actuality Admittedly these factors cannot precisely be evalu ated in connection with possible belligerent action in time of war, but the principle must be recognized as the same one that guides us in ordinary times in connection with fire protection, safety, and ordinary insurance. From this 'commercial' point of view our aim should be to keep our expenditures for protection well below what we probably would lose without such protection. Otherwise it would be better to avoid the protection than the hazard. It should be recognized that protective measures which depend upon the human element quickly depreciate, and even though nominally in effect may quickly become worthless against a real hazard. It must be considered also that many, perhaps most, hazards against which precautions are taken would not result in the most complete disaster of which they are conceivably capable; either because they are stopped in progress or because of emergency remedies, alternate methods of operation or source of supply, etc. This principle may be summed up by pointing out that protection of commercial interests must be commercially profitable.^• ^- n Edition to protecting our ”coinr J ercial w interests as discussed above, this Company recognizes that its operations are, or may become, of considerable importance to those to whom we look for protection under our Conces sion agreement. We are therefore ready to assist in pro tecting our own operations in other ways than would be warranted solely by our M commercial' interests, if this should become necessary. Xn general what has been said above regarding hazards and protective measures applies sixailarly here. ' Moreover, since the appraisal of hazards to our operations and the probable efficacy of protective measures in most oases in- volye factors peculiar to our own industry, we should be critical both that justifiable measures are taken and that unwarranted measures are not taken by those less familiar with oil operations. iiie extent to which we incur expense in connection with what we may term our 'political' interest, wiU be determined as occasion arises. It probably will be based largely upon our own judgment as to the justification for the treasures proposed and the share borne by others. Particularly those who are inexperienced in ax^^raising the value of protective measures must be guided away fro.x blind acceptance of such time-worn proverbs as 'An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.' Y/hile tjiis may be true it is just as true that an ounce of cure is better than a pound of prevention. Completely effective prevention against any hazard is rarely warranted. Under present circumstances there are very many oossible channels through which trouble might visit us, all 'or practically all --of which would have to be closed to afford us substantial security by 'prevention.' The kinds of actual trouble that would result, however, are relatively few, and in many cases our ultimate protection will be served better by preventing the causes which can be prevented easily and effectively and those not capable of repair — and concen trating our remaining resources on effective repair of what ever injury is done 4. Some of the protective measures in which we are in volved will involve also the Bahrein Government and II.M.G.7o &amp; - 3 - To the utmost extent this Company wishes suoh joint activities to rest upon a voluntary basis. For this to remain so, the voluntary basis must prove effective. Therefore when joint agreement concerning a course of action is necessary and has been reached, no change in the action agreed to be taken by this Company 'should be made except by further agreement with those affected. To avoid this becoming burdensome, and a menace rather than an aid to the efficiency of joint activities, suoh agreements should be held to the fewest possible. It is probable that differences in personnel, policy, normal procedure, etc., will result in' best results if the several groups concerned operate as independently as possible, but with assigned functions, and toward a common aim; rather than from too intimate a fusion of such organizations. In other words, between organizations of such widely differing character, coordination is likely to work better than cooperation. 5. At least within our own organization no protective activity should be per dtted to continue after it has deteriorated to such a degree that it is ineffective against the hazard feared. If it cannot be resuscitated it should be replaced by another form of protection. Such changes will tend to increase the effectiveness of protection for several reasons. The more complicated or meticulous the precaution, the less likely it is to remain effective. This Company does not wish to continue any burden, fin ancial or administrative, unless the objective can be shown to be justifiable, and the leans to be effective. ...

The orders cover a range of roles and aspects of BAPCO’s operations: instructions for sentries at refinery gates; checks on motor and goods vehicles coming into and out of the refinery; instructions for motor patrols; instructions for motorcycle patrols (left blank as a result of a lack of motorcycles); orders for the officer-in-charge of the field, including checks for sabotage of wells, pipelines and tanks; standing orders for the officer-in-charge of the refinery; orders for
                           naturguards; orders for the second shift foreman; instructions for security personnel at Sitrah terminal, Sitrah pier, Sitrah wharf. Some pages of the standing orders are heavily annotated in pencil, presumably by Agency staff or by the Agent himself, with comments and questions relating to specific aspects of the standing orders.Also in the file is a letter (ff 2-4) from the Secretary of the Committee of Internal Refinery Defence, dated 25 September 1939, containing twelve proposals to improve security and reduce the need for labourers (referred to as ‘coolies’) to move around the refinery site unattended, and a letter (ff 69-71) from Max Weston Thornberg, Vice President of BAPCO, to Weightman, setting out BAPCO’s company policy towards the defence of its sites in Bahrain during ‘the existing state of emergency’.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Vice-President</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sitrah</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum refineries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Security of property</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00002d#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
