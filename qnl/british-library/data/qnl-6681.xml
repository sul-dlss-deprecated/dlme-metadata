THE annual royalty on this account for the years up to March, 1915, was paid up by the British Minister at Teheran to the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs. Subsequent royalties as they became due have been paid by the Director of this Department at Teheran to the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. CLAIMS against the Persian Government for the cost of repairs to the Teheran-Bushire telegraph line as a result of wilful damage (in accordance with Article XII of the Anglo-Persian Convention dated 2nd December 1872 for the supervision and construction of a third wire from Teheran to Bushire) are usually deducted from the royalty and only the balance, if any, is paid in cash. CENTRAL PERSIA LIKE . BY the Anglo-Persian Convention of August l6th,1901, the Central Persia telegraph line has been leased to the Indo-European Telegraph Department from the 1st July,1907 r the date of its completion, A% of the Capital cost of its construction is the annual rental. The total cost of construction was Rs. 18 , 76 ,21? which amount was on July 1st, 1907 equivalent to Frs.3 f 127£25 (at Prs, 25 equals Re, 15); or £125,08l (at £1 equals Rs.15). This figure was provisionally accepted by the Persian Government. They asked to be furnished with a more detaileo. account which was subsequently prepared by the Director at Teheran and submitted by him to the Persian Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. .u e rental due at A-% of the Capital cost is therefore Prs. 125*081 or Re.75*049, of ?$iich one quarter viz, Fie. 31,2/0 is payable to the Persian Government in two annual instalments of Frs. 15,635 comaiencing from July lot,, 1907, tip to the time of the provisional acceptance of The accounts by the Persian Government in January, 19l5 # vhc minimum rental cf Frs,25»000 was paid to that Government in two annual instalments of Frs 12,500 ; but inP.W. 2254/09 P.VV. 2503/20 Collection, Page 28.

Three quarters of the total annual rental of Rs.75.049, viz., Rs.56 286 is retained in recoupment of the advance made for the construction of the line; it is annually debited to the departmental Revenue Account and credited to the Capital Aocount to which account the cost of construction wl debited. The credit of these instalments for 33 years plus a credit of Rs.18,777 in the 34th year will, by t s year 1940-1941, reduce the Capital Account by Rs.lS,76 215, the cost of the work, IF addition to the expenditure incurred on the actual construction, charges were also incurred under Article II of the Convention for Salaries and Allowances of the Betahlishnent employed amounting to Rs.96,561 (£6,438) the hill for which it was decided should he presented to the Persian Government as a separate claim* A favourable opportunity does not appear to have yet occurred for the formal presentation of this account to the Persian Government. IT was understood at the time of the construction of the line that, under Art*VI of the Convention the Persian Government v/ould pay the cost and rent of any buildings required, an understanding which was concurred in by the then Minister of Telegraphs in Persia. Some buildings have been constructed at the cost of or purchased by the Indo-European Telegraph Department vaiile others have been rented and the question of recovering from the Persian Government the expenditure thus incurred has been under discussion for many years. A proposal is now being made to the Persian Government that the cost of construction and purchase of buildings, amounting to Rs.68,070, shall be added to the capital cost of the line with a corresponding increase in the annual rental and that the Persian Government shall refund to the Department, through the ^Persian Terminal and Traffic Account*, the expenditure, amounting to Rs.34,109 up to March 31st, 1917, plus future expenditure incurred on the hire and cost of repairs of buildings occupied by the Department.

THE work was begun in June and completed in December, 1905, but owing to the obstructiveness of the local authorities the cable was not connected with the Persian Telegraph Office at Bunder Abbas till 3 years later, while 8 months more elapsed before the office was opened for international traffic. THE expenditure incurred up to March, 1911, amounted to Rs.68,933:2:9 (£4,598.17»7) and a bill for this sum was forwarded through the Foreign Office to the British Minister at Teheran for presentation to the Persian Government at a suitable opportunity. The bill was not however presented. Accounts of the further expenditure incurred on this line year by year have been kept and bills including such further expenditure transmitted through the Foreign Office to the British Minister, Teheran, for presentation to the Persian Government but no favourable opportunity occurring they have not been presented. The total expenditure to March 1920, amounts to Rs.95, 922.11.5. (£9,592). ARAB ISTAIT TEL?

It was arranged that the share of the Treasury in the advance should not exceed £9,030 and that P.912/14 if the expenditure on the work exceeded the estimated cost of £23,0o0, such excess was to be net from the Indian T?xchequer. It was further arranged that the part of the advance made by the Treasury should be repaid in 18 annual P.66/14 instalments from Indian revenues, such repayment was not to depend on the realization of recoveries of equivalent sums from the Persian Ooverament.
