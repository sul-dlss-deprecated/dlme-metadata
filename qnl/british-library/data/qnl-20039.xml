SIR, I have the honour to report further developments in continuation of my letter No. 433 dated 24th August regard ing the doings of Aysa bin Saleh. (2). His Highness the Sultan returned to Muscat about noon on the 29th instant but only to take in stores and water and he left again early the following morning. He called upon me on arrival in order to put me in possession of the latest news from Rostak, and this I have the honour to repeat for the information of Government. (5). It will have been gathered from the closing sentence of Paragraph 4 of my previous communication above quoted that Seyyid Feisal was sceptical of the loyalty of his brother-in- law Seyyid Saeed bin Ibrahim of Hazm and his doubt proves to have been well founded. At first, in reply to the Sultan's letter desiring Saeed to present himself at Mesnaa, the latter excused himself from compliance on the score of indisposition, but he has since left Hazm and joined Aysa bin Saleh outside Rostak. According to the Sultan's information Aysa had been specifi cally invited to Rostak by the present holder of the Port, Seyyid Hamood bin Azzan, and on his arrival Hamood, after making a pretension of remonstrance with Aysa, for the sake of appearances, for his dubious conduct in coming, he and his household I -*£1household left, the precincts of the Fort and joined Aysa bin Saleh outside. The chief of the Beni Ruwaheh garrison however, by name Harth bin ITasir, refused to evacuate and explained clearly to his men thatany who wished to leave the Port must do so at once and that those who elected to throw in their lot with him must make up their minds to fight to the last. Having done that he closed the doors and prepared for eventualities, writing to the Sultan at the same time to say what he had done. He is believed to have plentT''* of stores but is short of ammunition. Meanwhile Aysa bin Saleh and his adherents have occupied the small Port of Mazara close by, which is understood to command the approaches to Rostall from the Coast direction and this means that the Sultan could not get from Mesnaa to Rostak withomt trying conclusions with him. His Highness on the other hand has sent Wali Suleiman bin Suweilim with about 150 Rii'lemen mounted on camels, to strengthen and occupy his fort at A^aoi, troin which, in the event of hostilities breaking out, he can menace Aysa's line of retreat and communication. Such was the state of affairs when Seyyid Peisal left Mesnaa on Saturday. (4). His Highness is in a difficult position. Although Harth is at present writing to him in professedly loyal terms and is possi bly prepared to hold the Port against Aysa bin Saleh and Saeed bin Ibrahim, Seyyid Peisal believes, and probably with good grounds, that he is holding it for the Beni Ruwaheh and that if he (Seyyid i'eisal) did go to his assistance he would refuse to evacuate thtC^ -r Port and would hold it against the Sultan himself. If the latter made an expedition against Rostak from the Batineh side he would have to come to terms with the Ayal Saad who dominate the country oetween R-ostai^ and the Ooast, and the loyalty of this tribe is very prod 1 enicxtical. It is true that at present the Shaikhs of the tribe are with him at Mesnaa, maintaining themselves and their followers at his expense, but seeing that the possession of the Ports of Rostak and Hazam would at once put the Ruler of Muscat in a positionposition to collect dues from them in the way of export duty and Zakat,which he has not of late years been able to do, it is diffi cult to believe that they are sincere in their offers of assistance or that they would allow him to possess himself of the Port.- The events of the next few days however will surely remove doubts on this point.

SECRETARY to the OOVliRTllCNT of INPIA P0R3IGN DSPARTISItT, SILHA. H.B.M.'a CONSULATE &amp; POLITICAL AGENCY. Dated Muscat 18th September ]905. In continuation of my letter No. 484 dated ISth instant I have the honour to report that I proceeded in H.M.S.'Sphinx' on that date and called first at Seeb and Burka to assure my self of the safety of British subjects at those 'oorts, and sub sequent y visited Mesnaa and Suweik; and though the populations of al. the ports of the Batineh Coast are naturally a good dea unsettled by the exaggerated and discuieting rumours that are for ever being passed round, I found that all reasonab e measures for the general safety were being taken and that there was no present cause for serious alarm. (2) The complaint of the British community at Burka, of which a copy accompanied my letter by ast mail, was found on inves tigation to have no reasonable foundation but to have been based on remarks made by irresponsible persons in the Burka bazaar by way of chaff or to frighten the Banians. At a 1 events no such threat could be traced to any of the Ayal Saad. Some 20^ men of the latter tribe forming the party sent by the Sultan with Seyyid .;adir to protect Burka were encamped, not in Burka itse f, but at an outpost 5 miles distant, and I re ceived a etter from the camp assuring me that the Banians had nothingnothing to fear from the AyaT Saad, and that their name had been taken in vain. On the contrary the Shaikhs of that tribe were Imown to have informed Aysa bin Sa eh and his following that their own interests were entire y dependent on the com- mercial prosperity of the liatineh Coast ports and that they would not put up with any attack on them. It is inevitable that at such a time bad characters of a denominations should b^kbroad on the look out for a chance of looting unprotected individuals, and foolhardy wanderers fron the coast are liable to be waylaid and robbed but the Sultan does not anticipate any organised raids at present and if our subjects keep together at night as directed and do not wander far abroad, there should be little danger of harm befa ling them. At the same time communities were informed on our out ward voyage that any persons who wanted passages to Muscat for their valuables or for themselves should be prepared to come on board on our return journey. As a matter of fact however none thought the situation serious enough to make this necessary. (S) We found the Sultan still ying off Ulesnaa; but having now broken up the force of various tribes which he had recent ly assembled there, by sending them to strengthen garrisons at threatened points, he was no longer tied to the ship and was able to spend some time on shore daily. His Highness was in possession of very ^ittle fresh news of importance. He did not believe, and I found that it was not generally be lieved by the public on the Batineh Coast, that Aysa bin- Sa eh's essay to set up an 'Imam' in the person of Seyyid - Saeed bin Ibrahim would be approved or recognised by the com munity at large, Saeed's character not being considered a sufficient y blameless one to command the re igious respect and consideration due to and necessary for an 'IiLam'. It is conjecturedconjectured moreover t/hat having so far accomp 1 ished. his object as to set the ball of disaffection rolling his mission in Rostak is finished and that he will now on'y remain in order to tire out the Sultan and put him to expense. His High ness on his part hopes that his brother-in-law Seyyid Saeed, on Aysa's departure, wi himself become the centre of dis sension and intrigue and will soon get into difficulties. In fact the late holder of Rostak, Hamood-bin-Aszan, who has been compe ed to cuit Rostak is already beginning to p^ot against his successor. (4) ieanwhi e the Sultan's expenses have increased to be tween 500 and 600 dollars per diem and he cannot keep it up much longer. He has then three courses open to him, either to attack Rostak in force and oust Saeed bin Ibrahim from it, and hold it himself; or to withdraw his outposts, merely hold ing the Coast ports and leaving the hinterland to take care of itse f; or, lastly, to make terms with Aysa-bin-Saleh and Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim., the former of whom could probably be got rid of if an appeal were made to his cupidity. The former alternative would, for the Sultan, entail a formidab e and expensive expedition which His Highness could not possibly find funds for at present, so that he will neces sarily adopt one of the two latter courses. In the first connection, being well aware that half a Batta ion of Native Iniantry or the J ue Jackets of the Squadron if landed exioedi- tiously with two or three Maxims and a couple of fie d-pieces, cou d, with little or no expense put the Su tan in possession of Rostak in 48 hours and probably without firing a shot, the thought of such an apparently simple undertaking naturally presents itself to my mind and may possibly have occurred to t&gt;he Government ot India also, but apart from any question of French ob iection I am of opinion that such a project cannot be recommended unless His .iajesty's Government are 'Prepared permanentlyr&gt; a permanently t,o modify the policy which they have hitherto ad opted towards the affairs of Oman. If such am expedition was promptly executed without any considerable previous warning to the natives I have little doubt that the holder of Rostak wou d capitulate without firing a shot, but the possibility is that the matter wou'd not end there but that un ess the Shaikhs of Oman genera' 1 y had been previously assured that our action in this case would not form a precedent, or had been informed on the other hand that it was the intention of Govern ment to modify their existing policy of noninterference, there wou'd be the danger that an instance of isolated action in that direction might only serve to aggravate Bedouin feeling against a Sultan whom they already chiefly disapprove of owing to his alleged European proclivities and want of sympathy with their petty triba politics. Such isolated action might also (notwithstanding that they might apparently take no objection to it) give the French an opportunity for pu ling the strings of anglophobe feeling in Oman. In the absence therefore of any deliberate modification of our general po icy I think the on y thing to be done is for us to leave 3eyyid Peisal to fight his own battles in his own way, giving him at the same time such pecuniary and moral support as we teel ab e to accord and^taking any steps that may be necessary for the protection of our subjects and trading in terests on the Oman Coast generally. If on the other hand any change of policy is considered feasible, now seems to be the time to inaugurate it. (5) I have to report in conclusion that the Shaikh of Debai and one of the many stalwart sons of Shaikh Zaeed bin Khalifa , of Abu 'Phabi have Joined the Su tan at Mesnaa since I left; probably with the idea of offering to mediate between him and his adversaries, but this is mere conjecture as I have no recent news from His Highness.

SIR, I have the honour to report the following deve op- ments connected with Rostak affairs ; (2). Por the last 10 days or so there has been a dearth of inionnation troin the interior and from what» news was received it appeared that most .of Aysa bin Saleh's men had left him but was not apparent ^vhat was Aysa s own immediate motive was in staying on, except to cause the Sultan expense. The latter, as reported, had drawn in his hornsand dismissed most of his protessed allies with the usual presents and had simply left strengthened garrisons at the most threatened places, with his two sons Taimoor and Nadir respectively at Mesnaa and Barka to represent him. (5). Yesterday however I received letters from Aysa bin Saleh and Saeed bin Ibrahim both to the same effect, assuring me that in accordance undertakings previously given me they were and would continue to be mindiul of British subjects and care— lu I that no harm should befall them but pointing out that they could not get the Sultan to agree to amy of their peaceful proposas and that if in the resu t amy harm did happen to BritishV British subjects I must quarrel with the Sultan about it and not with them. I showed these letters to His Highness and he expressed the opinion, which is probably correct, that they were written with the object of getting me to intervene and to put pressure on the 3ultan to get him to accede to their covert demands for blackmail. I replied civilly to the effect that as I had informed them be fore, my concern was only with the safety of British subjects and British property and trade and that I thanked them for their assurances that they would respect thegi. I continued that I did not feel able to enter into the question of their dealings with the Sultan which was their business,and his, but that I hoped that an adjustment would be arrived at. .The messenger with my reply left last night. .This morning frrHv ( V another messenger reached me the other end of Oman, from ShaiMi A Abdulla bin Salim of the Beni Bu Ali bearing a letter in which the Shaikh after many professions of friendship said he had urgent business with me and begged me on receipt of his letter to proceed at once to Soor, whether he would arrive to meet me on the 14th. He brought no letter for the Sultan and I had no idea what the Shaikh's object could be but it is impossible for me without losing the Sultan's confidence to have any deal- ings with his Shaikhs behind His Highness back, I therefore sent the letter contidentially to His Highness with a draft of the reply which I proposed to send, to the effect that I could not get to Soor just now and that if his business was really important he should write it and send it to me by a trusted / messenger. His Highness came over to see me in reply and said that as a matter of fact he would be grateful if I would go down and interview Abdulla bin Saliin and see at al 1 events what was in his iriind. He feared that his letter meant that he also vvaa meditating hosti.' ities against himself and was possibly intriguing with Aysa bin Saleh and wanted to sound me before committing himself. His Highness added that owin^ to other presiinfe needs he had not paid the Shaikh his subsidy for the last3 ^ j *r last three months and that also might be a reason for the Shaikh's disaffection. He asked me to take the arrears down to him with a letter from himself saying that as the Sphinx was going to Soor he took the opportunity of sending the arrears ot his subsidy (800 dollars) which he had brought down on his last visit, when he was suddenly called away to the Batineh Coast. As regards Aysa bin Saleh he is known to have no large force with him at present so the Sultan does not expect any sudden - developments on the Batineh side, but in order to be in touch with his garrisons he is leaving again for Burka and fv : esnaa today. I leave in the evening for Soor and the Sphinx can proceed to the Batineh again on my return a day or two hence it the Sultan's news shows that her presence is desirable.

Meanwhile the stipend which tlie sultan hiid promised S year® 0^50 t»o pay him morvthly had been stopped wltihout reason and on account of this the Hlnawis were on the one hand twitting him with this fact and on the other inviting him to combine with them against the Sultan# 'Che Shaikh then vent on to say that since the English expeditions to his country r at the beginning of the last century he and his trioeemen had always been loyal to their promises and recognising its great—^ ness and Justice had always been ready to serve the British Oovomment In any v^ay they could and that I might look upon them in tho light of British sub 4 iects # In view of the above consicloratious and our previous persoral acquaintance he felt that he had a claim on my good offices and had therefore wit- ten to ask me to rendesvous with him at Soor in the hope of • v - ' » ■ * &gt;• v- •« — *■ ■- &lt;•. ...... — obtaining my help and advice as to what attitude he should assume in his present difficult circumstances.

He assured me that ha would and was apparently sincere in liia expressions of thanks to me for answering his call, and in prebaing in his invitation to me to return to his country with him on a visit. This he lias repeatedly asked me to do and I had hoped to do so this spring but the French flag incidents in tthich he Vi,as concerned made it advisable to -postpone the project. . , .j-*'$% ■ (o). ^he Sultan returned from the Batineh Coast at the same time as I did from Soor and I learnt from His Highness that all was quiet there. Since his return he has had further letters j.rom Ayaa oin Sal eh and Saeed bin Ibrahim couched in much more oonoinstoiy terms. It &gt;vould appear that my replies to their letters had disax^pointed them of any hopes they may have had of uy putting pressure on the Sultan to bribe them into sub jection, and tliat they wish now to pacify the Sultan. Saeed- bin-Ioranin especially has written with some degree of humility and begged for payment of the arrears of monthly stipend which Seyyid Peisal allows him but which has been stopped since the arriaal of Aysa bin Saleh at Roatal;. Ehe Jul tan has replied or intends to reply tliat he will pay his brother-in-law nothing until Aysa bin Sa?eh quits Rostak and ra jums to his country, in which case he is prepared to resume it. Saeed bin Ibrahim will still remain in possession 0i osuyjc as well as Hazm but this seems to bother His Highness very little. He himself thinks that Aysa will now return to tns oharkiyah and that matters will end there, but I fear, in common with many of his subjects, that His Highness is too sanguine, lor the recent incidents have shown plainly that he ihe haa very few staunch adherents araong his subjects and though ml£5ht not be willing to taite up arcig against him, there are exceedingly few who would fight Tor hln. I rayself doubt « whether Aysa bin .Saleh will be tjot irid of in this way, and fe^ir that as long as he is in Rostak he will not cease dire ctly or indirectly to harass Mie Sultan.

I have the honour to report that on the morning of the 15th instant His Highness the Sultan was good enough to send me a pencil note informing me that he had just received the news of the murder of Sa'id bin Brahim at Rustak by the sons of Faisal bin Hamud. A further note came from TTk Highness in the late afternoon to announce to me that the murderers had been killed at the fort of Rustak by soldiers presumably those of His Highness' garri son in the fort of Rustak. 2. I have since received news from other sources which indicates that Ibrahim and Muhammad, the sons of Faisal, came pretending to visit Sa'id to enquire for news of their sister and his wife, Muznah, who was said to be ailing, and then treacherously attacked and killed him. It is said that this took place the day before the news was received at Maskat, viz., on the 14th March 1912. In the confusion and fra9as that followed the two murderers were killed, and altogether it is rumoured that about fourteen to fifteen persons were killed in the affair. 3. A pedigree is attached which, though in no sense complete and hastily drawn up, may prove interesting as showing the relationship of the victims of this tragedy to His Highness Sir Saiyid Faisal. I am told that the only surviving member of this family that have given so much trouble to His Highness in the past and have held the fort of Kustak in practical independ ence of the Sultan of Maskat, is the lad Ahmed bin Brahim. His relationship through his mother to the notorious Abdul Aziz ar Ruwaihi deserves to be noted. 4. It may be hoped that, owing to the prompt disposal of the authors of this crime. His Highness will have no difficulty in keeping the situation well in hand and that the trouble will end as soon as it began. 5. A reference may be solicited to the letter No. 484, dated 13th September 1903, which you. as Political Agent, Maskat, despatched to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. Said bin Brahim wrote one ^ of the letters, of which the translation formed an enclosure to the letter quoted above ; and, in the other enclosure written by Shaikh Isa bin Saleh, the names of Faisal bin Hamud bin Azzam, father and grandfather respectively of the authors of Thursday's crime, appear. 6.
