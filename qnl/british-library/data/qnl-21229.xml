Gray ackcnzle * Company's representative in Dubai has seated that it is the desire of their Bombay Agents that the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels should fly the flags of che Shaikhs of i )ubai and Sharjah at the foremast during their ships' stay in the Shaiichs 1 ports, as an act of courtesy Co the Shaikhs. 2. The Residency A^enC has enquired whether there is any political objection to their being supplied with specimen flags. 3. It appears to me that to concede the flying of the Shaikhs' fla^s by British ships in their terri torial waters is to admit their full sovereignty over these waters, wuereas their acceptance of our projection from attack by sea constitutes in itself a delegation of their sovereignty in our favour, although not in favour of any other power. protection appears to have been offered to the frucial Shaikh* and to the Shaikh of Bahrain in Article 10 of Treaty No. XIX of 1820 in Part II in Vol. XI of Aitchison's Treaties; and again to the Shaikh of Bahrain and to the shaikh of ^atar in Article 3 of Treaty No. X of 1861 and in Article 11 of Treaty No. XXX.III of 1916 in the same part of the same volume. 4. The divisibility of sovereignty was a principle well established in TUs Majesty's aovornment's relations with che Indian States; and, similarly, sovereignty in these territorial waters appears to be divided between the Shaikhs and ?Tis Majesty's Governnent. $ 5. Whether this view is accepted or not, I feel that, if we ^tart go advertise the sovereignty of che Shaikhs in these waters by flying their flags, it is possible that Persia - or any other power that may lay claim to these ports - rai^ht try to contest this recognition by instructing their vessels Co fly their own national flags in these waters. 6. This is a matter that affects all the Rulers in relations with the Persian Gulf Residency - with the possible exception of Muscat and I should be grateful for instructions.

I would mention that we have also had a letter from Bombay Agents asking us to forward them a specimen of the Bahrein flag as it is their desire that the Company 1 s vessels should fly the Bahrein flag during their stay at Bahrein. We wrote to the Adviser who kindly supplied us with a flag which we forwarded to Bombay on the 7th inst. Please let me know as soon as possible if it is also the wish of H.B.M's Government that the Company should not fly the Bahrein flag or in fact the flags of the Rulers of any of the Sheikhdoms in the Gulf visited by the Company^ vessels so that I may advise Bombay Agents accordingly.

Dear Sir Rupert, please refer to the correspondence resting with your demi-official letter iJo. 1743 -S dated the 9th October, 1947. 2. Melkle has no** informed me that the Bombay Agents o; the British India i&gt;todan Navigation Company had asked him also for a specimen of the Bahrain flag for use at the foremast- of their ships when visiting Bahrain. He has also enquired about other Gulf Rulers not in political relations with this Agency. I have informed him that the instructions about Dubai and Shaxjah apply to Bahrain also and that he or his Company's Bombay Agents should apply to the other political Agents regarding the Rulers in relations with them. 3. My demi-official letter No. c /995, dated the 4th of October, 1947, specifically referred to all Rulers in relations with this Agency, and I had In mind when I wrote the last paragraph thaw possibly the Company contemplated flying the Kuwait flag while their ships are at Kuwait. If the Company are permitted to do so', the attitude we have adopted here will be very difficult to maintain as soon as the Shaikh of Bahrain notices that the Shaikh*s flag is flown in Kuwait but not here. 4. Would it be possible to issue similar instructions to Kuwait,if this has not already been done ? I am constantly being embarrassed, when trying to apply exchange and other controls here, by being told that in Kuwait they do as they like. vours sincerely. /kf The Hon'ble Lt-Col.

The matter has been further considered in consultation with His Majesty's Government. The position seems to be that a ship always flies (e.g. at its stern) the flag of the State where it is registered or 'that of the State of which its crew are nationals and may sometimes also fly the flag of the State of which the Charterers are nationals. As an act of courtesy a ship may in / addition fly at the foremast the flag of the country of destination when coming into one of the latter's ports or anchorages. This it is understood is often done as a gesture of courtesy to the local sovereign or Ruler. 3. So far as the Gulf Shaikhdoms are concerned His Majesty's Goverrment feel that there should be no objection to the local flags being flown at the foremast of incoming ships as an act of courtesy but it would be better for this to be done only when ships are approaching and entering ports or anchorages and not in territ orial waters as such^ There is no objection to your informing the Shaikhs of Bahrain, Dubai and Sharjah at your discretion as well as Gray, Mackenzie and any other shipping companies of His Majesty's Government's views as outlined above.
