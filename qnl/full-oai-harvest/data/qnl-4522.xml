The file is a direct chronological continuation of ‘File 16/32-II Miscellaneous. Correspondence with the Residency, Bushire.’ (IOR/R/15/2/1531).The papers deal with matters of a routine nature, chiefly the order of goods from suppliers and merchants, and their shipment to consignees, with insurance papers included in some instances. Ordered goods include: alcohol and foodstuffs (flour, sugar, tea); automobiles and automobile spares; medical supplies, including quinine; vegetable seeds; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay’s photographs; office supplies and stationery; hardware, such as bolts and batteries; sports equipment. Some correspondence and file notes allude to the shortage of supplies during wartime. The file also includes some telegraphic correspondence notifying on the departure, movements and anticipated arrival of British officers and other individuals in the Gulf.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Supplies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Postal services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Office supplies</topic></subject><subject><topic>Motor vehicles</topic></subject><subject><topic>Freight services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00010b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00010b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00010b#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00010b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00010b#share">Copyright or data protection restrictions</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
