It will obviously be essen tial to arrange for a continuous watch by the Bahrain Radio f not only for aircraft but also for all types of messages; and though I understand you could arrange to keep such a watch temporarily with your present staff, it is clear that this could not continue indefinitely and reliefs would be required. 2. I should be most grateful if you would inform me whether this question has over been examined in detail and if there are any plans in existence to provide the necessary continuous watch.

Dear Sir Trenchard, r, r T . r. rf riiior^han” at Balirain, 7til October 1933. With reference to your D.O. IT0.0/709 of the let October, althoutfi I liave not yet herrd frori the Co nnnder-in-Chief whether he Intends to carry* out his original pro-ranne, I vrould lilce to offer the following remarks regarding the sug eetione contained in your letter. 2. Tlie proposed exercise in designed to finich v/hen the 'cncny raider' hao reached the lonr'itudo of 50 E (vicinity of Tnnb In.) and there is no time available for an investigation into hov; nach damage she could do before bei ig caugiit. 3. It would be ouite possible from my point of view to issue a warning by W/T to the Political Officers on the Arab side of the Gulf that on 'enemy raider' hod entered and was at large, but I would point out that this warning might reach them at any tine during the 48 hours of the exercise and the tine of receipt might not be an entirely suitable moment to exercise a black out' from the ooint of view of convenience to the local authorities and local firms. 4. Apart from exercising oonrmxni cat ions between myself and the political authorities, I do not think that there is much to be gained by cabining this tost with the proposed exorcise A trial of co i ruiicatiorio can, of course,'be arranged at any tine if desired. I eu ;geot also that more value would be obtained from a test 'black out' if aircraft co-operation wore available to observe the effect. During the proposed exercise all available aircraft will be eo—operating with the forces at the entrance to the Gulf. 5. There is one point in connection with comunications which I think is worth consideration .and that is that Bahrain Radio does not normally keep a constant watch by day and closes down at night. In the event of war there would almost certainly be none of H.M. hips at Bahrain and all V //T messages would have to go through Bahrain Radio. I do not know whether any increase of staff is contemplated in on emergency in order to enable a constant watch to be kept day and night, but I should consider it essential. G. In conclusion I am nuite prepared to co-operate iso the extent of issuing the necessary warning at the end of the exorcise if you still wish me to Jo eo 9 in which case I would inform you of the limiting dates when I know them. 7.

Your paragraph 2. Naval strategy and tactics are of course quite outside xqy sphere, but as a layman I should imagine that the importance of the question whether a raider can enter the Gulf depends in inverse ratio on how much damage she can do before being caught. However, doubtless other opportunities will occur of trying out this aspect of the question. 3. Your paragraphs 3 and 4. (1) I agree that in the circumstances 'black outs' would hardly be practicable during the present exercise - the more so as this coincides with Kamazan. (2) Should you wish 'black outs' to be practised at any time with theoo-operation of aircraft (as you suggest) I presume you will get into touch with the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, and will let me know, when I shall of course be only too willing to go into the question of co-operation from the Political Agents and local Rulers.

Farmer, The authorities in the Persian Ctulf have recently given attention to the question of wireless communications at Bahrein in the event of war. It is considered essential that in such an emergency a constant watch, day and night, should he maintained hy the Cable &amp; Wireless Station, on which dependence would be placed for communication with the Political Agent and with shipping and which, it is stated, does not normally keep a constant watch by da 3 ^ and closes down at night. I am desired therefore to enquire whether provision could be made by your Company for the maintenance of a 24-hour watch in the event of war. It is understood that under an agreement of April last between your Company and the Air Ministry an IG-hour watch is maintained by the Bahrein Station exclusively for the needs of Civil and Service aircraft, and that provision has been made for extending this to a 24-hour watch, which presumably would have to be done urgently in the event of war. Would it be possible for these facilities to be made available S.G.

We entirely agree with the views of the S.1T.0. Persian Gulf, that ir. emergency or war a 24 hour watch would be essential. The Political Resident and S.IT.O. may however, be unaware that the present agreement with Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, provides for an IS hour watch per day and allows for the extension of these hours to 24 per day on the understand ing that if the extended hours of watch are in excess of the capabilities of the existing Personnel, the Company v/ill be given six weeks’ notice.. We think there is little doubt that in emergency or war it would be found possible to extend the hours of watch to 24 per day with the existing staff until the arrival of additional personnel, but you may wish to confirm this with the Company. Later on in about two or three years time we hope to have a flight of Royal Air Force aircraft stationed at Bahrein. Our own wireless facilities would then provide an alternative channel of communication and, combined with those of Cable &amp; Wireless Limited, there should then be no difficulty in ensuring a 24 hours watch if necessary.

There was some doubt as to how far the proposed extension of wireless facilities for shipping might restrict those at the disposal of the Air Ministry. However, we have now been assured by Cable and wireless Limited that the probability of the Air Ministry requiring a 24 hour wireless watch was tafcen into account by the Company when they agreed to provide similar services for shipping. ^e therefore concur in your proposal to suggest to the Government of India that the arrangements offered the company might be accepted.

Dear Gibson, With reference to your letter of the 9th farch, No.P.Z.1351/39, on the subject of wireless communications at Bahrein in the event of war, we see no objection to your proposals subject to the following observations from a purely Admiralty point of view regarding the augmentation of apparatus, and the cost of any expenditure which the emergency watches would entail. 2. So far as apparatus is concerned, it is not thought that any augmentation would be necessary to meet naval needs, since any messages will be broadcast on the commercial wave on which the station normally transmits. 3. With regard to the question of cost, agreement has recently been reached with Cable and Wireless, that any messages transmitted in war from any of their stations included in the organisation for broadcasting official messages to British merchant ships (which includes Bahrein) shall be paid for at the rate of 3d. per word. This figure was suggested by the company. It would appear, therefore, that so far as the cost of any additional hours of watch required for naval purposes are concerned, it would be offset by the increased revenue to be expected on account of the official messagesthat would be broadcast. 4. I am sending a copy of this letter to Kyres at the Foreign Office arid aily at the Air Ministry. # fours sincerely, (sd.) N.J. iargetts. J. P.

Arabian Oovernfsent and to the Italian representative here, it would not be in the interests of theenefty to interrupt lie working. If, however, the cable should break down and to send a repair ship should be inconvenient 9 or if the ener^r should be able to sit on the cable or its continuing line in the Sudan or i gypt for a while, telegrams to or from the Legation might be held up to our great harm. / A • Baxter sq., «C., oreign Office.A wireless transmitting set could only be installed with the consent of the Saudi Arabian Government, and even if we were prepared to ask for this consent in an emergency we do not want to raise the question now# There are many sets in Jedda for the reception o± news and other broadcasts, and any of these could presumably be used for reception of official messages, by previous agreement. Ibn Baud possesses some sixty wireless telegraph receiving and transmitting sets, and ae several wireless telephone sets are being installed for Mm by the American oil company he might perhaps be willing to lend us one of the telegraph seta. If the Jedda wire less station was working it could perhaps reach some British station, but it isn’t and anyhow I don’t know its extreme range# Telegrams from Jedda to Kiyadh now go to Taif by land line and thence by wireless to Riyadh, and if the worst came to the worst we could send telegrams that way and have them sent on from Riyadh to Bahrain. But I don’t know how telegrams a t present go from uiyadh to Bahrain. 1 oreover, the process would be very slow, with at least two places whei*© the message had to be repeated, and my experience last November / showedshowed how corrupt telegrams could become even between Kiyadh and Jedda* The moat satisfactory policy, if Ibn iiaud would allow it, would perhaps be for us to have a transmitting set which could reach Bahrain or eome other place on that side, or possibly ,den. We have on otir clerical staff an expert who was a Marconi operator on a steadier for several years, and both the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and the Saudi Arabian t ining Syndicate have wireless experts for their wireless telephone who would probably be sufficiently well dlapoaed to help us if there was a breakdown which Johnston could not solve. AM alternative would be for us to use tue ;&gt;audi Arabian lining Syndicate e wireless telephone. The Saudi Arabian tining Syndicate is an American company, mainly# as to its capital, but for Income tax reasons it is registered in Bermuda. The manager, however, is an American citizen, and although we are on good terns with him and he speaks loudly against the totalitarian states, he would probably require orders from his principals before he would allow the Legation to use his wireless telephone. I do not know at present what its range is.■&amp;\ 7 o kZ x) but C«A*3*0«C* (the ./nericaa Oil company) speak ^uite easily to their people in hasa, and I fancy that the sets do not differ very much# so we might hope to be able to speak to Bahrain with the Saudi Arabian Wining Syndicate's set if Bahrain possessed a suitable receiver* This is all rather v*&gt;gue# but I thought it would be a good thing to send you all the information we have at present# and also to send copies to the Commissioner at Fort Budan and to Bushire and Bahrain# in the hope that they might perhaps be able to make suggestions.
