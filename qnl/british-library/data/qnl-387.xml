[The Memorandum which follows deals with the history of Bahrein from the point of view primarily of the political status of the islands at various periods and in particular with the claims to sovereignty over them put forward by Persia at various dates since 1783, and with the corre spondence and discussions which have taken place in connection with such claims. The principal authorities quoted, apart from original despatches and letters, are the following (1) Lorimer; “ Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.” (2) Selections from “Records of the Government of Bombay,” Vol. XXIV (1856). (3) Aitchison : “ Treaties ” (1933 Edition), Vols. XI (Persian Gulf) and XIII (Persia). (4) “ Precis of Correspondence regarding the Affairs of the Persian Gulf” (1801 to 1853), by J. A. Saldanha (1906). (5) Sir A. T. Wilson : “ The Persian Gulf ” (1928). (6) Curzon: “Persia.” (7) Hertslet: “ Memorandum on the separate Claims of Turkey and Persia to sovereignty over Bahrein ” (1874). (8) P.G. 13: “Historical Summary of Events affecting the British Position in the Persian Gulf, 1907-28.” I.—Geographical Situation. 1. The Principality of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Bahrein, Muharraq, Umm Na’asan, Sitra, and Nabi Salih, and by a number of lesser islets and rocks. Taken altogether these form a compact group almost ^ n ^ in the middle of the V-shaped gulf on the Arabian littoral Aj0K ’ of the Persian Gulf which divides the independent Arab Trucial Sheikhdom of Qatar from the coast of Qatif in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 2. The term “Bahrein” formerly embraced the promon tory of Qatar and the oases of Qatif and Hasa on the Arabian mainland, as well as the islands of the archipelago, and, according to Lorimer, “some authorities would attribute ^ n ^ to it in the past an even more extended application, affirming J01 ‘ ’ ' that it once denoted the whole western side of the Persian Gulf from Ruus-al-Jibal to the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab.” II.—Bahrein prior to 1783. 3. The very conflicting evidence available goes to show that Bahrein was subject to Persian rule for a period in the early part of the Christian era, and between i.D. 615 and 723. It is stated to have been conquered by one Keshan bin Abdul Malik, and to have come under the sway of the Oommiyyad Caliphs, in the latter year, and to have remained under the control of the Caliphs until the close of the Abbaside dynasty in the 11th century, when it again became subject to chiefs of its own race. Its mediaeval history is obscure, but a writer who visited the islands in A.D. 1051 refers to the fact that half of the pearls taken in Bahrein belong to the Chiefs of Hasa on the Arab mainland. Idrisi, the Arab geographer, writing about a century later, states 2953 200 7.34 A Bombay Selections, XXIV, 23. G. of I. Desp. No. 18 of 22.2.1870, pai’a. 2. Wilson, PersianGulf, pp. 85-6.

The inhabitants of the two shores are satisfied with his justice and piety, and when he dies he is replaced by a person of equal virtue and piety.” It was conquered about 1320 by the (Arab) rulers of Hormuz, a kingdom finally subdued by the Portuguese in 1506, but which appears to have been tributary to Persia in at any rate its later days. Bahrein appears at the same date to have fallen under Portuguese control. The Persians have adopted in a recent Note on the subject a statement that it remained under Portuguese control from 1507 to 1622. It would appear, however, that there are at any rate some breaks in the continuity of Portuguese control. An agreement of 1515 between the Portuguese and the 1 ersians, under which the King of Hormuz was to be “ ruler ot Hormuz in the name of King Horn Manuel, his Lord ” Wilson, 121 . provided inter alia that Portuguese shipping should be available to enable the Persians to invade Bahrein and Qatif Wilson, 124. Il1 1522 a revolt stimulated by the King of Hormuz broke out against the Portuguese at Bahrein among other places but was quelled, and in 1528 endeavours by the Portumiese to quell a subsequent rebellion in Bahrein against the KW were beaten off. In 1559 it was temporarily occupied by the lurks, who were, however, driven out by the Portuguese m the same year. In 1602 the Portuguese were forcibly expelled from the islands by the Persians. The Persian occupation was of uncertain duration, and in their Note of 2nd August 1928 they refer to 1622 as the date on which I ersia regained possession of Bahrein. They appear in any event to have had a military depot in Bahrein in 1622. Lurzon states that “the Portuguese ... in 1625 concluded* a treaty with Shah Abbas, by which they restored to BahreL COaSt ” 0SSeSS10nS ’ retamiDg0Dly the pearl bauks at 4. In or about 1 &lt; IS the islands were occupied by the , labs of Muscat, who, however, appear to have maintained tn occupation for a short time only. It is not clear whether at the date of this attack the islands were derelict or^whether they were held by a Persian garrison. About 1 /jo the fuller under the 1 ersian Government of the town of Bushire made a descent upon Bahrein, the chief resident inbe in which (the Huwalah Arabs-at the present dav stnl strongly represented in the islands) was seriously 'here 6 ' I ft In 1 established ]li 3 authority fdere. In this manner the islands again became, at least in name, dependent on Persia. In 1782 the Arabs of Zubarah on the Arabian mainland, efforts to reduce which had been made by the Governor of Bahrein under the Persians in the years immediately preceding that date, retaliated by a descent on the island of Bahrein. They defeated bm I ersian Governor, drove him to his fort, plundered and destroyed the town of Manama, and took possession of a usnne vessel, noth which they retired to Zubarnh a counter attack was repulsed, and'in the fo/wlng yt tht Lttabi Aiabs of Zubarah, assisted by contingents from various tribes of Qatar, occupied the Bahrein islands T T^fT 01104 . 4116 Maua,1 ‘ a Fort capitulating on 28 th • 11 y 17b3, aftei a siege of about two months’ duration and being allowed to return to Bushire. ’ an(1 Summary. ■ 5 ' Aol f e Seeu , that while the history 0 f Bahrein pnor to 1/63 is very obscure, it would appear that Persia oi not inconsiderable periods exercised control over the islands.

From the Expulsion of the Persians to the conclusion of the Treaty of 1820 with His Majesty’s Government. Bahrein pays Tribute to Persia, 1799. 6 . Projects by the Persian Government for the re establishment of its authority in Bahrein between 1783 and 1800 did not materialise. In 1799 the Imam of Muscat declared war on the Uttabis of Bahrein, who, alarmed by his proceedings, opened a correspondence with the Persian Governor of Bushire, in the course of which they stated that the island originally belonged to the Turkish Government, but that it was many—about 70—years since the Turks had been in possession of it.* He, on their offering to become Lor - h 841 - tributary to Persia, proceeded privately to Bahrein and received from them an instalment of revenue on account of the preceding year. Muscat occupies and loses Bahrein, 1800-01. 7. In 1800 Bahrein was occupied by the Imam of Muscat, the occupation lasting until 1801, when the Muscat forces were invested by the Uttabis and compelled to surrender and evacuate Bahrein. In 1802 the Imam of Muscat, having obtained some assistance from Bushire, again landed in Bahrein and attacked the Uttabis. The latter had, however, by now secured the support of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia and the Muscat project was abandoned. Bahrein under Wahabi influence, 1803-11. 8 . From 1803 to 1809 the Uttabis of Bahrein appear to have been under the influence of the Wahabis' (the Bombay Government declined to take action on an enquiry made by them in 1805 as to whether, if they withdrew from the Arabian mainland and withheld their assistance from the 2’^^ lg Wahabis, the British Government would give them a ship or ^22 2 70 two to enable them to remain undisturbed at Bahrein) and p ara . 5 . they were under strict control by the Wahabi Government Lor. 1 , 842-3. during 1810-11. Dispute with Muscat, 181G. Persian Envoy to Bahrein, 1816-17. 9. In 1811 the islands were freed from Wahabi rule by the Imam of Muscat, when the Uttabis were restored to power, though according to a claim subsequently made by' by the Imam, in subordination to Muscat. In 1816 the Uttabis sought the protection of the Wahabi rulers of Central Arabia, and the Imam of Muscat undertook an armed expedition against Bahrein, explaining to the British authori ties that he was compelled so to act by the repudiation by the Attabis of his suzerainty, which they had admitted in 1811, by their alliance with the Wahabis and by their piratical practices. The Muscat expedition, to which three Bushire vessels were added by the Persian Government, effected a landing in the summer of 1816, but was signally repulsed and withdrew. Unsuccessful negotiations took place later in the same year between Muscat and the Persian Bo. Sel., Government with a view to a fresh attempt on Bahrein. XXIV, 372. Subsequently, but apparently in the same year, a Persian emissary, one Sikander Khan, arrived in Bahrein, who * This was, of course, incorrect. Turkey does not appear to have held the island since 1559 and then only for a few months.4 Teh. Desp. No. 6 of 16.4.1817. Teh. Desp. No. 10 of 6.5.1817. Lor. I, 846. Teh. Desp. No. 16 of 25.5.1819. accepted presents from the Sheikhs of Bahrein for the Prince of Shiraz and conferred on them in return Persian Robes of Honour. 10. In April 1817 His Majesty’s Minister in Persia reported the arrival at Tehran of an agent from the Imam of Muscat, the object of whose mission was credibly stated to be to inform the Shah that His Majesty’s Government contemplated the capture of Bahrein, and to ask for armed assistance for the Imam in order that he might thwart their design by taking possession of the island in the name of the Persian Government. His Majesty’s representative stated that an agent of the Sheikh of Bahrein was also at Tehran, bearing a letter which stated that as the inhabitants of the island were of the same sect as the natives of Persia, they had alwaj’s looked up to the Persian monarch as their protector and head, and that they therefore hoped for the assistance of His Majesty to cloak them from the oppressions of the Wahabis. Approval for the grant of the military assistance desired was stated to have been given by the Shah to the Imam, but no action appears to have followed. 11. In 1818, on the appearance of the Egyptians inHasa, the Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have offered to assist them with sea transport. In February 1819 the Sheikh entered into an agreement with the British Government, with the terms of which he subsequently failed to comply, for preventing the sale of captured British property in his dominions, and in the same year he expressed great indignation at the violation by the British authorities, under a misapprehension as to the nationality of certain vessels, of the neutrality of his port. 12. On the 19th April 1819 His Majesty’s Representative at Tehran reported to the Government of India that the Imam of Muscat had complained bitterly against the non- fulfilment of the engagements contracted with him by the Persian Government for the capture of Bahrein. The Minister added that letters received by him showed that the troops of Ibrahim Pasha, the Viceroy of Egypt, had occupied Bahrein (this appears to have been incorrect) and that the Imam had suggested to the Shah that he should send a messenger to the Pasha asking him to evacuate the island. The Imam is stated to have urggd upon the Shah the necessity of endeavouring to recover a possession which according to him “ had for ages acknowedged the sovereignty of Persia.” He was, however, unsuccessful, and in J une 1819 His Majesty’s Minister reported that the Shah had “ for the present ” dropped all intention of taking any steps in pursuit of his pretensions to the sovereignty of the island. It may be added here that the Government of Bombay in a despatch of 21st July 1819 to the Government of India, in which they discussed the desirability of assisting the Imam of Muscat, in return for assistance in connection with the expedition proposed against the Gulf pirates, to establish his claims te Bahrein, referred to an “ arrangement some time since concerted ” between the Shah and the Imam, whereby the former “had agreed to relinquish all claims to the island of Bahrein in favour of the Imam, under the condition of receiving a portion of its revenues.” Bahrein submits to Muscat, 1820, 13. The Persians, at the beginning of 1820, moved apparently by a desire to anticipate any attempt by Muscat to establish control over Bahrein with the support of His Majesty’s Government, unsuccessfully requested the Imam to convey their troops to Bahrein. They addressed a similar0 application, equally unsuccessful, to the Commander of the Lor. I, 847. British Expedition in the Persian Gulf. In the early part of 1820 the rulers of Bahrein made full submission to the Imam of Muscat and agreed to pay him a tribute of 30,0 )0 dollars. An instalment (12,000 dollars) of this tribute appears subsequently to have been actually remitted. Policy of British Government, 1819-20. 14. The policy to be adopted by the British Government in regard to Bahrein was examined between the Government of Bombay and the Government of India in 1819-20, and was ultimately defined as one of complete neutrality. 4 he Govt of transfer of Bahrein to the Imam of Muscat had been contem- Bombay to plated, but this project, so far as the British Government 15 12 .1819 l were concerned, was now abandoned. The Government ot p aras . 2 . 3. Bombay suggested that the Sheikh should be informed that so long as he restrained his subjects from piracy he would reap the advantage of a friendly neutrality on the pait of Britain, whereas should a piratical spirit manifest itself forcible measures of coercion would be applied to him. They added that the conclusion of an engagement m general terms with the Sheikh “ would probably tend to convince the Uttabi Arabs of the integrity of our intentions. British Offer to Persia of Mediation with Bahrein, 1820. 15 Simultaneously the Government of Bombay, in a despatch to the Charge d’ Affaires at Tehran, remarked that Dated “ we mean to avoid all interference in respect of the island ’ of Bahrein. . . . There is, however, reason to believe that p provided the Persian Government will consent to the Uttabis continuing in the undisturbed occupation of Bahrein the Sheikh would readily agree to pay them tribute, and for this purpose the mediation of the British Government would be gladly afforded provided it could be employed m such a manner as to avoid anything which might m any shape involve us m the transactions of the paities aftei the conclusion of the negotiation immediately refened to. . . . Treaty of 1820 between Bahrein and His Majesty’s Government. 16. On the 17th January 1820 the Sheikh agreed to surrender certain pirate craft which had taken refuge in his territories, and undertook to the British Government not to admit any more boats of the same character until authorised to do so by the British authorities. On the 5th February 1820 a preliminary Treaty of Peace was signed between the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, and on the 23rd February 1820 the Sheikhs were admitted to the benefits of the General Treaty of Peace which had Aitchison, been made between His Majesty’s Government and the Arab Vol. XI rulers of the Persian Gulf and under which His Majesty’s Government undertook, in return for abstention by those rulers from piracy and the slave trade, that “if any shall ^ xiXj ’ attack them the British Government shall take notice of it” 245-9. (Article 10). The Sheikh of Bahrein went so far as to pt. McLeod claim subsequently that the treaty in question established to Govt, of relations of protection and dependence between the British ®° m 8 ba ^ ted Government and himself, but it was made cleai to him by 17 2 .1823, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf while on a visit raras . 30 ’ to Bahrein in 1823 that this was not the case. 64-5. Precis, 297. Proposal for British Mediation with Bahrein not taken up hy Persia, 17. On 10th May 1820 His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reported to the Government of Bombay that he had been received 111 audience by the Shah on oth Mn\ and had put 2953 B- ^ &gt; i- 6 Teh. Desp., 10.5.1820. to him the proposal referred to in paragraph 15 for British mediation with a view to securing tribute to Persia from Bahrein. The Shah had replied that “ he wished that advices should be received from Shiraz before the mediation of the British Government to render Bahrein a tributary to Persia can be accepted.” Sir H. Willock remarked that “ the great repugnance of the Shah to the formation of any British settlement in the neighbourhood of Persia was strongly manifested by His Majesty's not immediately accepting the British mediation to obtain a tribute from the island of Bahrein, an object which he so urgently desired and which His Majesty was aware must at a future period be difficult of attainment from the already advanced stage of negotia tions between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Imam of Muscat.” and withdrarvn (1820). No. 1485 to 18* On the 3rd October 1820 the Government of Bombay Tehran. instructed Sir H. Willock to take the earliest opportunity of informing the Persian Government “ that as our views are exclusively limited to the extirpation of piracy, it would be contrary to our policy, in the present state of the Gulf, to afford the mediation we formerly 7 offered between His Majesty [the Shah] and the Uttabis of Bahrein.” Summary, 1783-1820. 19. In 1799 the Sheikhdom, independent since 1783, professed allegiance to Persia and paid a year’s tribute, but it was immediately 7 afterwards conquered by the Imam of Muscat, and thereafter fell under the influence and ultimately the control of the Wahabi Amir. Liberated by Muscat in 1811, it appealed to the Wahabis in 1816 against the Imam and defeated him. In 1816 or 1817 a Persian envoy 7 was received at Bahrein and presents exchanged. While no details are available as to what precisely took place on this occasion, the incident had no effective sequel. Persian authority was not asserted in the island between the date of the visit and 1820, and in the latter year the island became temporarily subject and tributary to Muscat. In 1820 Bahrein entered into its first formal treaty with the British Government, and that Government, on condition that the Sheikhs abstained from piracy, undertook to “ take notice ” ” if any shall attack them.” Capt. Bruce to Govt, of Bombay, 3.9.1822. IV.—1820-30. Unauthorised Agreement between Captain Bruce and the Prince Governor of Shiraz, 1822. 20. In 1822 C aptain Bruce, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting on his own initiative and without any authority from or prior reference to Government, having proceeded of his own accord to Shiraz there signed an agreement with the Minister of the Prince Governor of Shiraz, on the part of Persia. This agreement alleged, inter alia, in regard to Bahrein, that the islands had always been subordinate to the Governor of Pars, against whose authority the Uttabi Sheikhs had lately become rebellious; that the flag assigned to the Uttabis of Bahrein under the General Treaty of Peace with Britain in 1820 should accordingly if already granted, be withdrawn, that no assistance should’in future be rendered by Britain to the Uttabis of Bahrein, and that on the contrary the British Government should if requested, assist the Persians against Bahrein with “one or two ” vessels of war. In other words, the title of Persia to the possession of Bahrein was explicitly admitted. The arguments which carried weight with Captain Bruce in concluding this unauthorised agreement appear to have been7 that the reversion of Bahrein to Persian authority would tend “ more to the tranquillity of the Arabian side of the Gulf than almost any other act.” 21. The Resident’s action was immediately disavowed and disapproved by the Government of Bombay, in letteis from the Governor to the Prince Regent of bars (which stated that “it is not the intention of this Government to take any part in the claims of the several Powers and States of the Persian Gulf further than may be necessary to prevent a renewal of piracy. . . . There can be nothing in the flag [granted to the Uttabis] to give offence to Persia, as there is not the smallest connection between it and the British flag, nor the smallest pretension to superiority on the part of the British Government ”), the Imam of Muscat, and the Sheikh of Bahrein, and as a mark of dis approbation he was removed from his appointment. W ith regard to the clause of the agreement affecting Bahrein the Government of Bombay remarked: “It acknowledges the Govt of King of Persia’s title to Bahrein, of which there is not the Bombay to least proof, and which the British Government cannot assert Capt. Bruce, without injuring the pretensions of the Imam [of Muscat] and the Uttabis. . . .” On the Persian side, the Shah not only para 6 ’ refused to approve the arrangements which had been made, but expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz Teh. Desp. should have entered into any engagement with the British ^ ^ 1823. Government without his knowledge and injunctions. The agreement was thus repudiated by both sides. 1822-29. Bahrein—Muscat Disputes. 22. By 1822, if not earlier, the Sheikhs of Bahrein had Lor. I, 851. ceased to observe the engagement undertaken by them in Govr. to 1820 to pay an annual tribute to Muscat. In August 1822, an attack by Muscat on Bahrein seeming in consequence G ^ vr to ' imminent, the Governor of Bombay, in letters to the Sheikh sheikh, and to the Imam of Muscat, suggested that if this tribute 19.8.1822. was of ancient origin it should ^be regularly paid, but that IJrecis &gt; 307 - otherwise it should be dropped. In January 1823 the Lor. 1,850. Political Resident (Lieut. McLeod) visited Bahrein to Resdt. to reassure the Sheikhs in regard to the unratified treaty concluded by Captain Bruce with the Prince Governor of ^o. 8, Shiraz, and to inform them that that treaty was of no effect -27.2.1823. and that no change of policy was contemplated by Govern- Lor. I, 852. ment. In the spring of 1823, on rumours of a contemplated G ovt. of joint attack on Bahrein by Persia, Muscat and the Arabs of Bombay to the mainland, the Minister at Tehran was asked at a suitable juncture to dissuade the Persians from disturbing the 26.3.1823. tranquillity of the Gulf. 23. In February 1824 the Resident composed for a period of two years the acute internal disputes between members of the ruling house which were for many years a feature of the history of Bahrein. In 1825 the Governor of Bombay personally remonstrated with the Imam of Muscat on an endeavour by the latter to interfere in the question of the Bahrein succession consequent on the death in that year of Sheikh Salman, who had ruled the Sheikhdom since 1796 (in association in his later years with his brother Abdulla). Lor. I, 851. Lor. I, iii, X, Table 9. Reassertion of Persian Claim, 1825. 24. In 1825 an intimation was made by the Political Resident to the Prince Governor of Pars, who had been meditating an expedition to subdue Bahrein, and whose Minister had requested the Resident to give directions to the Sheikh to strike the flag which the British Government had authorised the Uttabis of Bahrein to fly. “He was informed that no control was assumed over the people of8 Bombay Political letter dated 2.7.1825.

In October 1828 a last attack by the Imam of Muscat 'was severely defeated and driven off, ‘‘after several undignified attempts to conclude a peace with the ” Sheikhs of Bahrein, and on 2nd December 1829 peace was finally made between the Sheikhs and the Imam. The main provisions of this agreement were that tribute should not in future be paid by Bahrein to Muscat, and that neither ruler should henceforth interfere in the affairs of the other. By a supplementary verbal agreement the parties bound them selves to aid one another in the event of an attack by a third party. Summary, 1820-30. 26. During the first two years of this period the islands acknowledged the supremacy of and, for a time, paid tribute to Muscat. From 1822 to 1829 they were intermittently at feud with Muscat. In 1829 a treaty was concluded by which Muscat withdrew its claims to supremacy and to tribute. The Persian claim was alluded to in 1822 and 1825 but not pressed. V.—1830-40. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1830-35. 27. In the course of 1830-31 the Sheikhs, His Majesty’s Government having refused to intervene in their favour, and fearing a combination between the Amir and Muscat, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir of the Arab mainland. They agreed to acknowledge the Amir’s supremacy and to pay a tribute to him. He on his part undertook to protect Bahrein against external aggression. In 1833, however, the Sheikh felt strong enough to repudiate Wahabi supremacy, and he conducted a not unsuccessful offensive against the Wahabis between 1833 and 1835. Bahrein and the British Government. 28. Sheikh Khalifah-bin-Salman, who had been joint ruler with his uncle Sheikh Abdulla since the death of Sheikh Salman in 1825, died in 1834, and was succeeded as joint ruler by his son Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifah. Effective control continued to rest with Sheikh Abdullah. Internal dissension in the ruling family became morn marked between 1834 and 1839, and the misgovernment of the island continued to grow with unfortunate effects on its prosperity. His Majesty’s Government, although in 1834 they had to take forcible measures against the Sheikh to secure reparation for an insult to their Residency Agent in Bahrein, were, however, content to abstain from any interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein so long as the Sheikhs discharged the obligations undertaken by their Treaty of 1820. Restrictive Line applied to Bahrein, 1836. 29. In 1835 the British Government renewed the maritime truce which they had imposed in 1820 on the Arab rulers of the Gulf in the interest of the suppression of piracy. The Sheikh of Bahrein was not, however, included in the renewed truce, partly apparently because he had behaved so well that this was thought unnecessary, partly because he could be easily punished in the event of this proving desirable, and partly lest in the event of his inclusion he might claim British intervention if attacked by Muscat. In March 1836 the Sheikh agreed, however, to thet 9 application to Bahrein of the “ Restrictive Line, this being a line laid down in that year by His Majesty s Government between which and the Persian coast no naval hostilities were in future to be permitted. Reassertion of Persian claim. Bahrein tributary to the Wahabis, 1836. 30. In the middle of 1836 the Sheikh, alarmed by a Bombay^ communication from the Governor of Shiraz calling on him XXIV - &gt; 38 ’ 5 as a Persian subject to tender his submission to the Shah ^ i g5g and by the possibility of the co-operation of the Imam ot Muscat in a Persian attack on Bahrein, took steps for a reconciliation with the Wahabi Amir. As a result, he agreed to pay a nominal tribute of $2,000 to the Amir, the Amir on his side agreeing to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks and to retrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a \V ahabi attack on Muscat by sea. 31. In 1837 the Sheikh, with the prior approval of Her Lor. I, 860. Majesty’s Government, was allowed to punish certain pirates. In 1839 the Resident was invoked to settle internal disputes in the ruling family, but the parties would not agree to any settlement without a guarantee by Her Majesty s Government, which Her Majesty’s Government were not prepared to give. Egyptian Invasion of Hasa : Sheikh professes to be a Persian Subject, 1839. 32 In 1838-39 the Egyptians conquered Hasa and cap- Bombay tured the Wahabi Amir. They thereupon demanded the l^ 10118 ’ payment of tribute and certain territorial concessions from 387 _ 8 / the Sheikh of Bahrein. The Egyptian Commander about the same time intimated to the British authorities his inten tion to attack and reduce the island. The Sheikh appealed for assistance to the Government of India, but in the absence of instructions from Her Majesty’s Government the Govern ment of India were at first not prepared to give him any pledge and the Sheikh was instructed to decide for himseft as to waiting on the Egyptian representative. Much alarmed by the proceedings of the Egyptians, “and perhaps even more so by a rumour, apparently well founded, that the Saiyed of Oman was intriguing with the Egyptians to obtain and hold Bahrein as a fief under the Viceroy of Egypt,” the Sheikh thereon professed, in reply to demands made on him in the name of the Egyptians, to be a subject of the Persian Government. Apparently as the result of overtures by the Sheikh designed to substantiate this, the Prince Governor of Shiraz thereupon sent an envoy one Lor. I, 862. Haji Qasim, formerly supercargo of a trading vessel—to reside in Bahrein as Persian agent, “ and to be the medium of receiving and transmitting the annual tribute which the Persian authorities vainly flattered themselves the Bahrein Chief was disposed to pay for their countenance am protection,” and to bear a Robe of Honour and a letter to the Sheikh. The envoy was accompanied by a guard of Selecti ^ nSj 10 Persian infantry. No details appear to be available X XIV,388. about his mission, which was apparently a failure. 33 On 1st April 1839 Admiral Sir F. Maitland, then Precis, 375, commanding the Gulf Squadron, was instructed by the Govr of ^ Government of Bombay to give the Sheikh ail support Res?N( y 66 p against the Egyptians, short of actually entering on dated 4.1839 hostilities. If the Sheikh asked for a new engagement with Her Majesty’s Government he should offer to transmit his proposals to India. The Resident was simultaneously to send a formal protest to the Egyptians. On the 18th April10 'S the Government of India empowered the Admiral, if the Sheikh claimed British intervention and offered to place his territories under British protection, “ to assure him of the temporary protection of Her Majesty’s squadron in the Gulf,” to inform the Egyptians that this pledge had been given and to urge them to abstain from futher military proceedings until the views of both Governments were known, failing which Bahrein would be defended against intervention by them until the pleasure of Her Majesty’s Lor. I, 864. Government had been communicated to the local authorities. In the same month the Sheikh promised the Assistant Political Resident to take no steps to place himself under the authority or protection of a foreign Power without first consulting the Political Resident. Sheikh submits to Egyptians (July 1839). 34. In ^July 1839 the Sheikh “suddenly and un expectedly” acknowledged the supremacy of the Egyptians and agreed to pay them a tribute of 2,000 dollars a year, on the understanding that his local authority would be observed and that no representative of the Egyptians would be sent to reside in Bahrein. The Resident protested in writing to both the Sheikh and the Egyptians, and expostulated with the Sheikh on the way in which he was sacrificing his independence. The Sheikh explained that his action was the result of the refusal of Her Majesty’s Government to give him advice or a specific assurance of support. For a trifling financial payment he had now secured immunity Govt R of' t0 fr °- m interfer ® nc : e - He offered, however, in return for a Bombay written and distinct pledge of protection, to repudiate his 4.7.1839.’ agreement with the Pasha and to avow himself a dependent of Ilei Majesty s Government; but on being pressed he refused to confirm this in writing and said that in any event it would be necessary for him to justify his change of attitude to the Egyptians on the ground that it was the result of compulsion by Her Majesty’s Government.

As a consequence of the activities of the Egyptians discussion appears about this time to have taken place as to the desirability of declaring a regular protectorate over Bahrein. ^ On 1st July 1839 the Secret Committee of the East India Company informed the Government of India that if necessary they would “ not disapprove of your entering into an engagement with the Chief of Bahrein to protect him against encroachments from Mehemet All, but we concur in the doubt expressed by Captain Hennell [then Political Resident] as to whether it would be expedient for that island to be taken under the protection of the British Government.” On 24th February 1840 the Foreign Office wrote to the India Board (with reference to an enquiry from the Bombay Government) that it was important that the Egyptian troops should not be allowed to take possession of Bahrein and that if the Company’s troops could occupy it even provisionally, such a measure could not fail to be attended with advantage. On the retirement of the •Egyptians fiom Hasa in 1840 their relations with the Sheikh came to an end. Summary, 1830-40. Bahrein was subject and tributary to the YV ahabi Amirs. She revolted from them in the latter year but in 1836 again entered into an understanding, which..... ■' M 11 l/i » * appears to have lasted until 1838, under which Bahrein paid a tribute and received guarantees of assistance against external attack. In 1838 the Wahabi Amir was himself conquered by the Egyptians. . . . The Persians reasserted their claim in 183G, the Bahreini nnswer being a renewaJ of their understanding with the Wahabi Amirs. In 1830, when faced by a demand for tribute irom Egypt, Bahrein appealed to Persia, claimed to be a Persian subject, and received a Persian envoy. But immediately after she formally acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and paid tribute to Egypt. The vdsit of the Persian envoy had thus no effective sequel. VI.—1840-50. 37. In 1840 the Government of India, provoked by the attitude which the Sheikh had adopted, decided not to restrain the Imam of Muscat in the event of his wishing to conquer Bahrein. On 27th March 1840 the Secret Committee remarked to the Government of India “We consider our- selves . . . relieved from all regard to the interests of the p r ^ c - S) ‘394 Sheikh of Bahrein, and we should be glad to hear that his island was in possession of a friendly chieftain.’ 38. Towards the end of 1840 the Imam of Muscat India Board informed the Resident that while his views in regard to 22 .10.1840. Bahrein remained unaltered, he had been restrained from giving effect to them by his impression that Her Majesty’s Government were averse to the prosecution of his claim and that without their assistance or that of the Egyptians, he would have no chance of success. Expulsion of Sheikh Abdullah. Succession of Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa (1843-68). 39. Internal dissensions in the Sheikhdom between the ruler, Sheikh Abdullah, and his grand-nephew and co ruler, Sheikh Mohamed, became increasingly bitter, and Sheikh Mohamed was finally expelled from the island. In November 1842 he was given permission by Her Majesty’s Lor. I, 866. Government to attack Sheikh Abdullah. After a civil war which lasted from January to April 1843, Abdullah was expelled by Mohamed, who thereafter held the Sheikhdom, no reply being sent to an appeal to restrain the attackers which was made by Abdullah to the British authorities in February 1843. Intrigues of ex-Sheikh, 1843-49. 40. Between 1843 and 1849 the ex-Sheikh appealed at various times for the assistance of the Wahabis, the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sheikh of Koweit, and the British and Persian authorities to enable him to recover his position. In 1843 Lor. I, 873. Her Majesty's Government dissuaded Muscat from trying to conquer Bahrein—considerations which weighed with them being inter alia the risk of provoking the Wahabis and the danger of giving Persia an excuse to espouse the cause of the ex-Sheikh. In the same year the ex-Sheikh twice visited Bushire, where he failed to find any consolation from the Resident, who, on his stating that if disappointed by Her Majesty’s Government he was ready to throw himself into the arms of Persia, informed him (October 1843) that the adherence of Persia to his cause would not be recognised by Britain unless it was open and declared. 41. In the course of his visits the ex-Sheikh entered into discussions with the nephew of the Persian Sheikh of Bushire, who, while holding no official position himself,12 Teh. Desp. 86 , Oct. 1848. Lor. I, 875. F.O. to Teh., No. 23, of 21.8.1844. Hertslet, 6. Lor. I, 876- 7. promised him military assistance from Persia. On repre sentations being thereupon made to the Persian Prime Minister by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, the Prime Minister “ informed me that Sheikh Suleiman had acted with great presumption in having interfered in political affairs without having any authority from the Government, and he said that he would reprimand him for his conduct. His Excellency added that Bahrein belonged to Persia and that she would take possession of it when more pressing affairs were disposed of. As I looked on this as mere idle boasting which was never likely to be fulfilled, I thought it unnecessary to pursue the conversation.” 42. It may be recorded that on a second visit of the ex-Sheikh to Bushire from December 1843 to March 1844, he is stated to have been received with distinction by the Persians, and to have offered, if reinstated, to pay the cost, to remit in future a large annual tribute to the Shah, and to leave one son as a hostage in Persia. His proposals were not, however, accepted by the Persian Government. 43. In 1844 the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was instructed by the Government of India to resist by force any attempt by Persia to establish troops on the island of Bahrein. During the same year the ex-Sheikh, having, while residing at Naband in South Persia, captured two Bahreini vessels, the ruling Sheikh appealed to the Resident, with the result that an injunction was issued by the Central Persian Government at the instance of the British envoy directing the Governor-General of Ears to compel Sheikh Abdulla to give up the boats he had taken and abstain from disturbing the peace of the Gulf. Views of His Majesty’s Government on Persian Claim and on future Policy, 1844-45. 44. Consequent on indications that Persia intended to intervene in the succession at Bahrein on behalf of the ex-Sheikh Abdullah the general question of policy was considered by Her Majesty’s Government in the early part of 1844, in the light of an intimation by the Government of India that they would see the strongest objections to any such interference by Persia, which could not but react adversely on British interests. As a result, Her Majesty’s Minister was informed (Foreign Office Despatch to Tehran, No. 23, dated 1st May 1844) that “ the question of the right of Persia to interfere and of the Indian Government to prevent interference necessarily depends upon the validity of the pretension put forward by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Her Majesty’s Government are ignorant of the grounds of such pretension, and, assuming those grounds to be insufficient, they would claim for the British Govern ment the right to prevent, if it accorded with its policy to do so, any direct interposition of Persia in the quarrels of rival claimants to the possession of Bahrein. The British Government in India at present consider that any such disturbance as may be occasioned by military operations on the part of Persia directed against'the island of Bahrein would be injurious to British interests, and, therefore, unless Persia can show that she has a clear and indis putable right to the sovereignty of Bahrein; that she has exercised it without interruption under the dynasty of the Kajar family ; that consequently her present policy is directed to the maintenance of her lawful claims and not to the assertion of a pretension not founded on law, she must be13 prepared to encounter in any scheme of this kind the active opposition of the British Government m India. In these circumstances the Minister was instructed to inform the Persian Government that “ Her Majesty’s Government had heard with regret that that Government contemplated taking part in the disputes respecting the Government of Bahrein ; that such a proceeding would be viewed with much jealousy by the British Government in India; and that unless the right of Persia to interfere in the matter is beyond dispute, any interference on her part might lead to unpleasant discussions with England. For, although Her Majesty s Government do not dispute the right of Persia as an independent power to adopt any line of policy not inconsistent with its engagements to foreign states which she might think advantageous to herself, they claim for themselves a corresponding right to judge and act in such matters as they may think fit.” Discussions with Persia, 1844-45. 45. On a communication in these terms being made to Teh. toF.O., the Persian Prime Minister, the Prime Minister said he 69 would undertake to prove the right of Persia to possession of that island, and that in the meantime he would not make any movement against it without giving previous notification of such an intention to the British Government.” 46. In February 1845 the Minister at Tehran sent home T eh. to F.O., a letter received from the Prime Minister, from which it No. 19 of appeared that the Persian claim was essentially based on the 25 ^ °- Convention of 1822 between Captain Bruce and the Minister of the Prince Governor of Fars. (See paragraphs 20-21 above.) 47 In a subsequent despatch the Minister said that he Teli. tol.O., had informed the Prime Minister that the Bruce Agreement was unauthorised and had been repudiated at the time, and that the Prime Minister had thereupon sent him a fuller statement of the grounds of the Persian claim. The result of enquiries which His Majesty’s Minister had made con sequent on the receipt of this statement conhimed me m the opinion that this island has not formed part of the dominions of Persia since the accession of the Kajar dynasty [1795]. It is true that the Chiefs of Bahrein have in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to this country [Persia] as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat continue to do, without an acknow ledgment of subjection,* and it is also not unlikely that the rulers of that island may have declared themselves to be subjects of the Shah when threatened with subjugation from Bagdad, but I cannot ascertain that Persia has exercised any real control over it within the last 50 or 60 years.” The Minister added that in further support of their claim the Persian Government had sent him a gold coin struck at Bahrein in 1817 in the name of Fateh Ali Shah Kajar, which he believed to be genuine. 48. The fuller statement of claim put forward by^ the Persian Government was investigated by the Secret Com- of c 0nt r 0 ^ mittee of the East India Company, who, after detailed 31.7.1845/ examination of it, reached the conclusion “ that Persia has no legitimate claim to the sovereignty of Bahrein.” It may be remarked that the Persian claim was largely based on a general claim that the Persian Gulf from the Shatt-el- Arab to Muscat and all the islands in it belonged to * On this point the Secret Committee of the East India Company remarked : “ Presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia.” (Secret Committee to India Board, 31st July 1845.) 2953 D14 F.O. to Teh No. 38 of ■7.8 1845.

Persia i that the employment in English of the term “ Persian Gulf ” was itself evidence of this; that from about 1300 A.D. the island of Bahrein had always been in the possession of the Governors of Ears and had paid revenue to them until its conquest in 1783 by the Uttabi Arabs, from which tribe “itself, likewise, presents have generally been sent to the Governors of Ears ” ; that Her Majesty’s Government had recognised the position when they warned Mehemet AH of Egypt in 1840 not to attack Bahrein, which did not form part of Arabia, but rather of the Persian Gulf ; “ and that accordingly the British Govern ment would not allow him to extend the hand of possession over that island ’’; that the British authorities had formally and repeatedly asked Persia to rent the island to them and that British representatives at Tehran had frequently declared that Her Majesty’s Government had no right what ever to the Gulf or its islands [there is no foundation for either statement] ; aud that the fact that Captain Bruce’s treaty was on record supported the Persian claim. The following extract, which (except as regards the initial date) appears correctlyr to represent the true facts, may, however, be placed on record from the Prime Minister’s memorandum : “ I n the commencement of the reign of His Majesty the late Shah, the Arabs of Beni Attabi came from the desert and conquered the island by sea. The object and desire of the Persian Government has since always been and is the recovery of that island from its spoilers.” 49. Her Majesty’s Government, in view of the unlikeli hood that Persia had, or could give effect to, any serious designs in Bahrein and the undesirability of engaging in those circumstances in a correspondence which might merelv cause irritation without serving any useful purpose, instructed tlm Minister at Tehran not to revert to the subject unless it was forced upon him by the Persian Prime Minister. In that case he was to employ certain arguments supplied to him (apparently the critical comments of the Secret Committee of the East India Company on the Prime Minister’s memorandum) to show generally the grounds on which Her Majesty’s Government were “ unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein, and you may add that they would . . . very much disapprove of any attempts on the part of Persia to interfere in the affairs of that island and thus disturb the peace of the Gulf and to afford an opening to piracy.” The question appears to have dropped for the time being. ireaiy oj reace with Wahabis, to whom Bahrein pays Tribute (1847). 50. Meanwhile, the ex-Sheikh (who in 1845 had unsuccess- Y ^tempted to capture Bahrein with the aid of the VVahabis) had been invited in June 1846 by the Governor- General °' 1'arsto return to liushire, where he should be liberally entertained “until ... the season for action had fi m w \ ^ A dec , lln , ed , the invitation. In October 1846 the Wahabi Amir asked the permission of the Resident to call in the 1 racial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahi an. This was refused. A request by the ruling Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to call in the assistance of the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis was equally refused in November 1840. In August 1847 a Treaty of Peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh 'uim/n 1 tlle ruliD « SheiWt agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed not to encourage the ex-Sheikh. 0t t0 uuivery i reaty with Ureat Britain, 1847 51. On the 8th March 1847 Her Majesty’s Government enteiod into a Slavery Treaty with the ruling Sheikh.15 Turkish Designs on Bahrein, 1847. 52. In the same year the first Turkish claim to suzerainty Lor. i, 881. over Bahrein was put forward, the Turkish Mutasallim of Basra writing to the Sheikh inviting him to declare his allegiance to the Sultan and to submit lists of his shipping for registration. These overtures were evaded by the 28 91847. Sheikh, while the Porte assured Her Majesty’s Government that they did not intend to use compulsion against him ; but that “if the Governor of Bussorah had attempted by negotiation to induce any of the Maritime Chiefs of the Persian Gulf to return to their allegiance to the Porte, they could not disapprove his doing so.” Persian Intrigues, 1848. 53. In the following year correspondence took place between the Persian Consul-General at Bagdad, the ex- Sheikh (whom he advised to press ahead, since Persia would surely assist him) and the ruling Sheikh, whom he addressed in friendly terms. The correspondence was put a stop to consequent on representations by the British Resident at Bagdad. In 1849 the ex-Sheikh died. Bush ire to Tehran, No. 177 of 5.6.1848. Views of Her Majesty’s Government on Future Policy, 1847-49. 54. The overtures made by the Turks in 1817 gave rise between 1847 and 1849 to consideration by tire Government of Bombay, the Government of India, and Her Majesty’s Government of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein. The Sheikh hinted in 1847 that unless certain grievances Lor ^ 88L were met he might become a Turkish subject. His Bo to grievances were accordingly remedied by the Government ftes. 334 0 f of Bombay. That Government represented, however, that it 31.7.1847. was desirable to exclude interference in Gulf affairs by foreign Powers, since unless tier Majesty’s Government retained the supreme control they could not secure the permanence of the objects (the suppression of piracy, &amp;c.) on wdiich so much money had been spent. The Court of Directors concurred in the Government of Bombay’s recommendation “ that any attempts upon Bahrein ought to be resisted by the British Naval l^orce” and that the Resident should be so informed. 55. On 11th October 1847 the Foreign Office, in a letter to the India Board, in which they referred to recent Turkish assurances that the Turkish Government had no intention of using compulsion with regard to Bahrein, added that “ if the Indian Government has any further apprehensions on the subject, and if the Bahrein Chief is really an independent ruler, the best course would be to make with him a treaty of alliance which would secure his independence and his friendly connection with England.” The Resident, who deemed it inexpedient that Her Majesty’s Government should involve itself in the embarrassments likely to arise from a closer alliance with Bahrein (letter of 25th January 1848), was, however, opposed to making the existing connection closer, as were the Secret Committee of the East India Company, who expressed the view that the Resident “ had exercised a w r ise discretion in not taking any step for the negotiation of a new treaty with Bahrein.” The Resident was, at the same time, authorised, while avoiding discussion with the Turks, to ascertain whether the Sheikh was inclined to enter into a closer connection with Her Majesty’s Government. Sheikh’s Request to re taken under British Protection refused (1849). 56. In January 1849, however, the Sheikh spontaneously JP^ 882 ' asked to be taken under British protection. The Resident, who, as stated above, had originally opposed, ultimately X XIV, 429. supported this request, but after a lengthy discussion the India Bd. Government of India and Her Majesty’s Government agreed to*- 16 that a change of policy was inexpedient, and the Resident was instructed in September 1849 to decline the Sheikh’s overtures, but to assure him of the continuance of the good • will and friendship of Her Majesty’s Government. No 1 l? eSP Government protested against British interference in the 17.2.1848 affairs of Bahrein, whereupon they were informed by the Teh. Desp. Minister at Tehran in February 1848 that the British Government were unable to recognise as valid the claims advanced by Persia to the sovereignty of Bahrein. Designs of Muscat, 1849. F.O. to I.O., 68 . In June 1849 the Imam of Muscat, having intimated 11.6.1849. his desire to send an expedition to take possession of Bahrein, and having asked the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, 59. The ruling Sheikh was expelled in 1843 and con tinued to intrigue to regain the throne till his death in 1849, appealing for assistance during this period to the Wahabis, Persia, Muscat and Great Britain, in all cases unsuccessfully. In 1847 Turkey asserted a claim to Bahrein. In the same year the islands submitted themselves to the Wahabi Amir and agreed to pay tribute to him. Claims by Persia were advanced, but rejected, in 1844- 45 and 1848. Muscat was dissuaded from attacking Bahrein in 1849. Her Majesty’s Government, on consideration of the policy to be adopted in regard to Bahrein, decided against establishing a protectorate and refused a request put for ward in 1849 by the Sheikh to be taken under British protection. They assured him at the same time of their general goodwill, and their deliberations made it (dear that they regarded the island as independent, but were reluctant to assume further responsibility in relation to it so long as its independence and the performance of the engagements undertaken by the Sheikh could be secured without their doing so. CO. In 1850 the Resident found it necessary to take disciplinary action against the ruling Sheikh—an individual of “irresponsible character.” Consequent on strained relations between the Sheikh and the Wahabi Amir, the Amir, with whom the sons of the ex-Sheikh Abdulla ’were associated, in 1850-51 threatened Bahrein, whereupon the Sheikh “ against his own better judgment . . . tendered a small annual tribute to the Amir,” a circumstance from which it may perhaps be inferred that he had failed to observe the agreement of 1847 referred to in paragraph 50 above. The Amir rejected the offer and made exorbitant demands instead. The Sheikh was about to surmimh o Persian Protest, 1848. 57. During the course of these discussions, the Persian was strongly dissuaded from doing so by Her Majesty’s Government. Summary, 1840-50. VII.—1850-61. Disputes with Wahabis, 1850-51.

But I infer from what has been stated in the despatches which you have communicated to me, that if that independence could no longer be maintained, and if the ruler and the people of Bahrein were determined to place themselves under some foreign protection, the Fast India Company would think that less evil would arise from affording to Bahrein British protection than from allowing French, Persian or Turkish authority to be established in that island.” Attitude of the Wahabis and of Muscat, 1852-53. 63. In i 852 the Sheikh proposed to withhold his tribute Lor. 1 , 885. from the Wahabi Amir, but on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In the same year tiie Consul at Zanzibar was instructed to inform the Imam of Muscat that Her Majesty’s Government saw no reason to alter the views regarding the possession of Bahrein communicated to His Highness in 1849 (paragraph 58 above). In May 1853 the Government of India authorised the Government of Bombay to offer every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabi Lor. 1,887. Amir (who was now nominally subject to the Turkish Government) on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government would not permit the occupation of Bahrein by the Turkish Government or by anyone acting for them or in their interest. Principle of Non-interference in Internal Affairs laid down by Bombay Government (1854). 64. On 20th November 1854 the Government of Bombay in a letter to the Resident laid down the principle of non interference in the internal affairs of Bahrein, and authorised the Resident simultaneously to inform the Sheikh of Qatif on the Arab mainland that the British Government would not tolerate his further interference with the affairs of Bahrein. Slavery Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government (1856). 65. On the 10th May 1856 an agreement supplementary Aitchison, to the Treaty of 1847 (paragraph 51 above) regarding the J ol -. x h slave trade was made with tlie Sheikh. Its contents were x °- lx ’ • identical with that of corresponding engagements entered into at the same time by the Arab rulers of the Trucial Coast. 66 . The Sheikh’s internal government continued to go from bad to worse. In September 1858 reparation was secured from him for the ill-treatment of British subjects in Bahrein. In 1859 a W^ahabi attack was averted by British intervention. The local Wahabi Governor sued for pardon Lor. 1,887. to the Senior Naval Officer; the Wahabi ruler, however, made a formal protest, asserted his authority over Bahrein, and declared that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey. The Resident, in reply, informed him of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to preserve the independence of Bahrein, and pointed out the inconsistency of his piratical attacks on Turkish shipping with his professions of dependence on the Ottoman Government.

The Turkish answer was delayed. A Persian agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan), bearing a Persian Firman to the Sheikh, arrived in April 1860. The Persian flag was hoisted, Persian sovereignty proclaimed, and the Sheikh’s agreement to pay tribute secured. These ceremonies were, however, scarcely over when a Turkish emissary arrived. 'The Persian flag continued to fly during the Sheikh’s negotiations with the Turks, but on the latter withdrawing, and subsequently communicating assurances of a character satisfactory to the Sheikh from the Turkish Government, the Turkish flag was hoisted on the forts in place of the Persian flag in May 1860 and the Sheikh agreed to pay tribute to Turkey. The Persian emissary, however, refused to leave Bahrein “ or surrender his imaginary authority in the Sheikhdom.” The Resident reported in July 1860 that “ the Ottoman flag has now become the national one.” The Sheikh appears to have endeavoured to play off each party against the other. Views of the Minister at Tehran and the Government of Bombay. 68 . The Minister at Tehran regarded the matter as one of relatively small importance. Be pointed out to the Persian Government “ that under no circumstances can the British Government be expected to concur in the proposed transfer of the sovereignty of Bahrein to the Persian Crown, since \ve have contracted engagements with the Arab Sheikhs of the island as independent Chiefs, and since the mainten ance of their independence is indispensable to the successful working of those plans of maritime police in the Persian Gulf which we have been at so much pains and expense to establish ” ; and obtained an assurance from Persia that no military occupation of Bahrein should be attempted until the title to the island had been settled through the diplomatic channel. He advised the Resident that, while hostilities against Bahrein were to be repelled by force, a voluntary tender of allegiance by the Sheikh to any other Power might, so long as it was unaccompanied by any military occupation, be ignored as of no particular importance. In the light of the Minister’s views the Government of Bombay instructed the Resident that he should not interfere with the occupation of Bahrein, whether by Persia or Turkey, save bv protest and by an intimation that the matter had been referred to Her Majesty’s Government; but at the same time that the agents of both 1 owers (turkey and Persia) should be warned that aggression by or in the name of Bahrein on neighbour- ing tribes would not be allow 7 ed and would, if necessary, be prevented by force. In representing the matter to ’the Secretary of State for India they urged that in the interests °[ ^ peace of the Gulf it would be better that Bahrein should be regarded as independent and as subject neither to Turkey nor to Persia, that its^ independence should be recognised, and the engagements into which in the interests of humanity we had entered with its rulers for the preservation of the peace and good order of the Gulf should be maintained. Ilbll MAJESTY S GOVERNMENT DECIDE THAT BAHREIN SHALL BE REGARDED AS INDEPENDENT (1861). 69. In February 1861 Her Majesty’s Government, after discussion between the India Office and the Foreign Office approved the recommendation of the Government of Bombay Ihe Resident and the Minister at Tehran were so informed. During part of the time at any rate that the question was under consideration in London the Turkish and Persian agents or their representatives appear (though it is not clear how consistently) to have remained hi Baluein, and the flags of both Powers to have been flownJ / 19 simultaneously. On the 27th February 1861the Fohtmal Resident reported that “ the Persian and Turkish flags still fly on the forts of the island and in an interview that Com mander Cruttenden had with Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah at his own request he (the Chief) remarked in respect to them that they were displayed ‘merely to^ suit his own fancy. What did he care for Turk or Persian? He valued the friendship of the British Government highly.’ ” British Convention of 31st May 1861 with the Sheikh. 70. In May 18G1 the Sheikh, refusing to^ discontinue a blockade which he had imposed on the Wahabi coast, was informed by the Resident of the decision of Her Majesty’s Government that he was regarded as an indepen dent Chief and that in these circumstances he must be held responsible by them for any piratical activities in which he might indulge. The Sheikh proved obdurate; he was threatened with forcible measures by the Resident and two of his ships were seized. He accordingly submitted, and on 31st May 1861 he signed a Friendly Convention with the Resident, acting on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, by which he entered into a '‘perpetual treaty of peace and friendship ” with Great Britain, and in which, as “ indepen dent ruler of Bahrein,” he acknowledged as valid and in force the earlier conventions entered into between Bahrein and Her Majesty’s Government, and undertook in^ return for a guarantee of protection against aggressions “ by the Chiefs and Tribes of the Gulf ” to abstain from maritime aggression, piracy, the slave trade, &amp;c., and to agiee to certain conditions in regard to residence and trade in Bahrein by British subjects and to jurisdiction over them. One of the ships seized from him was thereupon returned; the second, the Hamrah, was retained. 71. The Turkish and Persian agents would seem to have disappeared from Bahrein before the Resident s arrival. The Persian authorities at Bushire in June 1861 asked the Resident for an explanation of his proceedings. The Resident, however, contented himself with forwarding their enquiry to Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. The Convention was approved by the Government of India in 1861, and the Turkish and Persian Governments were informed of what had happened. tiurmnamj. 1850—61. Pol.

The Turkish Government weie informed in 1851 that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any claim on their part to Bahrein. The Sheikhs appear to have continued to pay tribute to the Wahabi Amir in the early part of and possibly through out this period. i rp . In 1859 the Sheikh appealed simultaneously to lurkey and to Persia, as the result of apprehensions of a Wahabi attack, and received a Persian envoy, who hoisted the Persian flag. Ou the arrival immediately afterwards of the Turkish envoy the Persian flag was hauled down. Sub sequently the Sheikh for a time flew both flags side by side. The envoys seem to have left Bahrein in the early part of 1861. No action was taken by the British authorities pending a decision by Her Majesty’s Government as ^ to whether they regarded Bahrein as independent. The Persian Government undertook not to endeavour to occupy the islands until the title to them was settled. ^ Her Majesty’s Government decided in February 18()1 to regard the Sheikh as an independent ruler and so hold him responsible for piracies, &amp;c. Punitive action against him by Her Majesty’s Government having proved necessary in May 1861, he entered in that month into a convention with them in which he was described as independent luler of Bahrein,” and secured certain guarantees of protection.\ Lord Cowley to F.O., No. 15, 7.7.1862.

In January 1862 the Persian Minister in Paris protested to Her Majesty’s Ambassador in Paris against the seizure ol the Hamrah.

Between 1863 and 1865 the Sheikh continued to misbehave, and in the latter year his ship, the Dinar, was seized under the instructions of the Resident. The Persian Government in 1866 made a complaint in regard to the Dinar proceedings on the ground that Bahrein under the unratified agreement of 1822 was a dependency of Persia. The Government of India, after ascertaining from the Government of Bombay the*nature of the agreement of 1822, Lor. 1,691. communicated the result of their enquiries to the Minister at^ 4ehran, and added their own opinion that “ whatever might have been the pretensions of Persia or the grounds of the same to the sovereignty of Bahrein in former days, the Shah could not now be regarded as possessing in point of fact any rights in the principality.’ This communication was approved by Her Majesty’s Government in the same &gt; ea r, and the matter appears to have dropped. Nature of Relations between Bahrein and Wahabi Amir (1867). ^ 75. In 1866-67 the Resident, on the instructions of the Government of India, investigated the relations of the Sheikh of Bahrein and the ahabi Amir. He reported as a result that the Sheikh claimed to be independent so far as his J. S AAA d j A ere con ? erned ! and . that the annual tribute of 4,000 dollars which he indubitably paid ’ (cp. paragraph 50 above) to the Amir was on account of the possessions held by him in Qatar on the Arabian mainland, the object of the payment being to secure those possessions against attacks by Arab tribes under Wahabi influence. The Government of India, m the light of the Resident’s investigation, expressed the view in March 1867 that the Sheikh was independent of all other lowers in respect of his insular possessions and owed fealty to the Wahabis only in regard to Qatar. Summary, 1861-67. 76. This period is marked by assertions of the Persian claim m 1862 and 1806. Her Majesty’s Government on both occasions made it clear that they could not regard that claim as well founded. a. s J lowed ^hat the tribute still paid (1867) bv the Sheikh to the Wahabi Amir was in respect of Bahreini possessions on the mainland of Arabia, and not in respect Powers' 6111 ’ WhlCtl the held independently of all other IX.— Discussions and Incidents, 1868-70. 77. Questions of considerable importance as bearing on the status of Bahrein arose in 1868-70 consequent on- (а) the disciplinary action taken by the Government of India against the ruling Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa iGT'’ v i' S b, TG eS of the Maritime Truce of .1820, which resulted m his flight from Bahrein in September 1868 and the succession as sole ‘-heikh of his brother, Sheikh All bin Khalifa- (б) the punitive action taken at Bahrein by the Govern ment of India in November-December I 869 ' consequent on the invasion of Bahrein by the e.\-.Jieilvh Md. bin Khalifa, the murder of SheikhN- 21 Ali, and the attempt of Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah to establish themselves in control of the islands. 78. In view of the weight attached by the Persians to the declarations made in the course of those discussions as indicating the view held by Her Majesty’s Government on the status of Bahrein, of the Persian allegations that over tures to Persia had been made by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, and by the ex-Sheikh, Md. bin Khalifa, and of the misleading but categorical accusations made against the Resident by the Persian Government, it seems desirable to examine in some detail the correspondence which passed and the sequence of events. Punitive Expedition of August—September 1868. 79. In 18G8, consequent on an attack on Qatar by the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Government of India resolved to take disciplinary action against Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifa. The Sheikh sent an agent to Bush ire to satisfy the Resident, but the agent having no powers from his master, his mission proved fruitless, and he returned to Bahrein in August 1868. An armed expedition was thereupon sent against the Sheikh in August-September of that year. Before it reached Bush ire Bahrein the Sheikh fled to the Arab mainland, and he was thereafter regarded by the people of Bahrein and by Her z b Majesty’s Government as having abdicated the Sheikhdom. The expedition found it unnecessary to use any force, a full submission being made on its arrival by Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa, brother of Sheikh Mohamed, who had previously been associated with Sheikh Mohamed to some extent in the Sheikhship. An agreement was reached by the Political Resident with Sheikh Ali, which disposed of the matters in dispute, on 6th September 1868. The agreement was signed by “ Ali bin Khalifah and the inhabitants and subjects of Bahrein.” It declared inter alia that “ Md. bin Khalifah having repeatedly committed acts of piracy and other irregularities at sea, and having now, after his recent Aitch. XI, piratical acts, fled from Bahrein, has forfeited all claim to his title as principal Sheikh and Chief of Bahrein.” 80. Subsequently to the conclusion of this agreement the Resident, by way of punishment, destroyed the fort of Muharraq by gunfire and burnt certain vessels of war belonging to Sheikh Mohamed bin Khalifah. His despatch, Pol. Res. to which contains a detailed report on the course of events, ^ ovt - of makes no reference to any flying of the Persian flag by Mohamed bin Khalifah, and the bombardment of Muharraq 25.9.1868. and the punitive destruction of the warships took place after the submission of Bahrein, and so after Mohamed bin Khalifah had fled from the islands. Persian Protest, November 1868. 81. The facts appear to be as stated in the preceding paragraph. It was some time before a full account of these proceedings reached either India or London. Meanwhile, as will be seen from the correspondence, extracts of which Teh- Deep, are quoted below, the action of the Government of India 28 101868 drew a vigorous protest from the Persian Government. The protest, after appealing to the treaties concluded between England and Persia in 1809, in 1814, in 1822 (unratified) and in 1857, urged that the Resident, instead of respecting the rights of Persia in the Gulf to the extent provided for in those treaties, had, without any prior intimation to the Persian authorities, attacked Bahrein, which island had been and still was the property of Persia ; had bombarded and destroyed the Governor’s fort and house and caused considerable damage ; had appointed the Sheikh’s brother 2953 F Teh. Uesp. 149 of 17.11.1868.'S 4- 22 F.O. to I.O. 1.2.1869. From Gen. ilohsin Khan, 11.2.1869. To Gen. Mohsin Khan, 5.3.1869. as Governor over the island on the flight, through fear, of the Sheikh ; had imposed a fine; and had required the new Sheikh to find his brother and deliver him up to the British authorities. These proceedings had taken place at a time when “ Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah, the Governor of Bahrein, was openly avowing his submission to and dependence upon Persia and declaring that he considered Bahrein to be indisputably Persian, in proof of which the Persian flag was flying over his fort.” 82. Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran was instructed to communicate a suitable explanatory statement to the Persian Government. The Foreign Office suggested, how ever, that it might be advisable, in the event of similar proceedings again becoming necessary, that communication should be had with that Government. While this question was still under consideration a formal protest against the Resident’s action was received (11th February 1869) from the Persian Charge d’Affaires in London, who complained, inter cilni, that the Resident had sunk three ships belonging to the Governor of Bahrein and fired on his palace on which the Persian flag flew, and requested that the British Govern ment would give orders for the repair of the damage caused. He was informed in reply that “ the Sheikh of Bahrein was an independent chief with whom the British Government had treaty engagements and whom they must hold strictly to the performance of those engagements.” Gen. Mohsi Khan to Duke of Argyll, 13.4.1869. 83. This contention the Persian representative disputed, and in support of his view he forwarded letters addressed “ from 1858 to 1869 by the Sheikh of Bahrein to His Imperial Majesty the Shah and the Prince Governor of Shiraz.” The translations of these letters are dated 9th April and 12th April 1869 respectively. From internal evidence it seems probable that they were, however, written in 1860 on the occasion of the visit to Bahrein of the Persian envoy, Mirza Mehdi Khan (paragraph 67 above). They acknowledge the leceipt of a Fnnian from the Mirza (apparently recognisin 0. Sheikh Md. as Sheikh and accompanying a Firman and a Sword of Honour for Sheikh Ali). They state emphatically that Bahrein forms part of Persia, and has always done so. They refer to an agreement reached for the future payment of tribute; remark that “the slight neglect which was lately shown on our part towards Your Imperial Majesty’s Government was because they had not for a while superin tended and protected us, but as now the Government of Your Imperial Majesty has intended by sending over Mirza Mehdy to enquire into and_ manage the affairs here, I, with my brothei and all the inhabitants, feel quite ready to declare at once that we are most willing to render any services required from us towards Your Majesty’s Government being already aware that Bahrein (Persian Gulf) is part of Persia ” and add “ . . . I will hasten to hoist the flag on my residence bearing the Lion and the Sun which are the sicms of the Persian Standard.” I.O. to F.O., 21.4.1869. •Britisn Note o! 29th April 1869. 84. The question of the reply to be given to this further protest was carefully considered between the India and th e Foreign Office. The Duke of Argyll, then Secretary of State for India, remarked that although he was of onininn that the line of policy which had hitherto been mirsned of regarding the Sheikh of Bahrein as an independent sovereign, and of refusing to recognise the ridit of sovereignty advanced by Persia, as had been done in 1848 and 1860, could not now be abandoned “ thout ve,w serious risk of endangering the peace of the Gulf, Yet he was not blind to the expediency of avoiding all causes of unnecessary irritation at the Court of Tehran and' that23 he was willing, therefore, should Lord Clarendon desire it, as a matter of courtesy to the Persian Government, to issue instructions to the Government of India to^ direct the Resident in the Persian Gulf (whenever he might on any future occasion, under orders from India, be about to call the Chief of Bahrein to account for any breach of his engage ments with the British Government) to notify the fact to the British Minister at Tehran for the information of the Shah s Government.” Circumstances might, however, arise in which the Resident might, in the general interests of peace and order, be called upon to act promptly on his own responsibility, and in such cases the Secretary of State was not willing to waive what he considered “ as not only a right rp 0 Q en pertaining to, but a duty incumbent upon, the British Mohsin Government.” The Foreign Office concurred in these views and the Persian representative was informed accordingly. 85. The Persian representative on receipt of the Foreign F.O to! O., Office letter asked that in order to make it more palatable to the Shah, certain modifications should be made in it. 5 After private discussion between Lord Clarendon and the 5.6.1869. Duke of Argyll, of which no record exists, and an interview between the Envoy and Lord Clarendon, it was finally agreed to accept the modification embodied in the opening para graph of the letter which follows, but also to make the addition contained in the last paragraph of that letter ; and a letter so amended was despatched to him. The text (omitting an introductory paragraph) of the amended letter, which is of importance as one of the principal pieces of evidence subsequently adduced by the Persian Government in support of their claim that Her Majesty’s Government have recognised Persian sovereignty over Bahrein, is as follows. The sentences in italics are those which were added in deference to the further representations from General Mohsin Khan referred to above : — “ The British Government readily admit that the Government of the Shah has protested against the Persian right of sovereignty over Bahrein heing^ ignored hg the British Authorities, and they have given due consideration to that protest. But it is the fact, as yourself and the Government of the Shah are un doubtedly aware, that the Sheikhs of Bahrein have at different periods entered directly into engagements with the British Government; and I beg to assure you that the British Government hold the Sheikh to these engagements solely for the purposes oi preventing Piracy and Slave Trade, and of maintaining the police of the Gulf. If the Persian Government are prepared to keep a sufficient force in the Gulf for these purposes, this country would be relieved of a troublesome and costly duty; but, if the Shah is not prepared to undertake these duties, Her Majesty’s Government cannot suppose His Majesty would wish that in those waters disorder and crimes should be encouraged by impunity. “ I need scarcely assure you of the friendly feelings entertained by Her Majesty’s Government towards Persia, and their desire on all occasions to meet as far as possible the wishes of the Shah ; and, in regard to this question, I have the honour to state to you that, whenever it is practicable to do so, Her Majesty’s Government will cause the Persian Government to be informed beforehand of any measures of coercion against himself which the conduct of the Sheikh of Bahrein may have rendered necessary. “ But the British Government cannot consent to debar its officers, to whom the superintendence of the police ofPol.

In August—September 1869 Bahrein was invaded by the ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifak, who was joined by one Mohammed bin Abdullah, son of the Sheikh who had been deposed in 1843 (paragraph 39 above). The ruling Sheikh Ali was defeated and killed, while Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah assumed the leadership of the usurping party. ^ 87. Hei Majesty s Minister reported on 14th IS^ovember 1869 a conversation on this incident with the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs in the course of which the latter admitted that Persia had not acquired sufficient power or authority in that part of the Gulf to enable j° re P ress ac t' s piracy and to maintain order, but added that he hoped that before long the Shah’s authority would be fully established at Bahrein, when full redress would be given for losses suffered through the recent events, and that m the meanwhile it would not be considered necessary that the British authorities should undertake coercive measures Her Majesty’s Minister further reported t^t. Ali bin a hall fa having forwarded letters to this Court admitting his allegiance to the Shah and offering his services to the Persian Government,” an agent (Mirza Mehdi Khan who had been Persian Envoy to Bahrein in 1859 (para- giapli above)) had been despatched with a Royal Firman recognising Sheikh Ali bin Khalifah as Chief of Bahrein’ but that on receipt of the news of the murder of the Sheikh by the ex-Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah, the Firman had been recalled and the name of the ex-Sheikh substituted (from paragraphs 94-5 below it will be seen that these statements subsequently proved to be incorrect in material particulars).

The Persian agent referred to in parasranh K 7 nP arriving in the Gulf at this stage addressed letters to sfeikhMohammed bin Abdullah (see paragraph 86 above) intimating his recognition as Sheikh, and despatched them by a special messenger, who proceeded to the island in a native boat belonging to a Persian. The messenger was, however, on his arrival prevented by the Resident from landing or communicating with the Sheikh, and his letters were Bushire detained and ultimately handed by the Resident to Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdullah after the submission of that Sheikh, who returned them to Colonel Pelly after perusal. The messenger stated that he had himself no authority from the Shah’s Government and was deputed by the Chief of Payer, who was acting in obedience to Mirza Mehdi Khan. Submission of Usurping Sheikhs. Sheikh Isa bin Ali becomes Sheikh. 91. The punitive operations against Bahrein resulted in the complete submission of Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah and Pol. Res. to the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah in September 1869. It may Govt, of be remarked that prior to the opening of operations Sheikh ^ ^ ’ Abdullah made overtures to the Resident, which were, how- n.9.1869, ever, rejected, with a view to securing recognition by His 181 of Majesty’s Government. He also appealed to the Wahabi 25.9.1869, Amir for recognition and protection. Sheikh Isa bin Ali, son of the murdered Sheikh Ali, voluntarily assumed the vacant Chiefship and was recognised by the Resident on behalf of the Government of India (“in no way did Colonel Pelly influence the succession ’’) and the ex-Sheikh and Mohammed bin Abdullah were deported to India. Shortly Teh.^Desp. after his installation the new Sheikh received a letter from J869. one Hydar Khan, Zabit of the Dashti district on the Persian Teh Degp ' coast, advising him to place himself under the Shah s 7 0 £ protection, but the incident appears to have been unim- 12.1.1870. portant. Persian Protest, 1869-70. Views of Government of India. 92. The Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs appears at first to have received news of the removal of the ex-Sheikh with equanimity and is said to have remarked that Persia and Great Britain had an equal interest in the maintenance of peace by sea and that Persia had therefore no reason to object to the punishment of the delinquent. But he protested in strong terms against the Resident’s action in preventing the Persian agent from landing and holding communication with the Sheikh, and a still stronger protest was made by the Persian Minister in London. The Govern ment of India, in the exhaustive reports they submitted on the Resident’s action, urged, after a review of the history of the islands, that the Shah had no legitimate control over the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that his Government had nevertheless encouraged the piratical faction in the Persian Gulf by sending letters of recognition to the piratical leader; that in styling Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah Chief of Bahrein the Persian Government ignored the facts that he had never held sway in Bahrein, belonged to the younger branch of the ruling family, and so had neither by right nor possession claim to this title; and that, so far from the Shah having any just cause of complaint against the Resident, the Persian Government should be called upon to give some explanation of the conduct of its officers in encouraging a piratical expedition which was prejudicial to British interests in the Persian Gulf and for the successive appointment by them of Ali bin Khalifa and Md. bin Khalifa to the sovereignty of a district over which they had no legitimate control. The Government of India added that they had no confirmation of the alleged overtures of Sheikh Ali bin Khalifa to Persia (paragraph 87 above), as to which further enquiry was being made of Her Majesty’s Minister 2953 G26 *5=-&gt;cr To Teh., No. 22, 30.3.1870. f (see paragraphs 94-95 below), but in any event could not admit “ that such overtures, made without its knowledge and consent, can in any way affect its treaty relations with Bahrein. British Reply to Persia, March 1870. 93. Her Majesty’s Minister was therefore instructed by the Foreign Office that it appeared possible that Her Majesty’s Government, instead of furnishing explanations to Persia, might have cause to complain “ of the proceedings of the Persian authorities in endeavouring to communicate with a piratical chief who had been guilty of a breach of the Mari time Truce, and who had attacked the Chief placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government,” and was informed that no notice would be taken of the complaints against the Resident until the Persian Government gave a full explana tion of the intercepted letters. Supplementary Reports by Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, April 1870. 94. On 6th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran reported as follows to the Government of India : — “ In my Despatch No. 81 ... I reported that the Firman of appointment was originally in the name of Ali bin Khalifa, but that, on hearing of his death, it was altered in favour of his brother, Md. bin Khalifa. This information had reached me from a relation of . . . one of the principal Persian officials in Shiraz, and not . . . from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs. When further intelligence reached Shiraz from the Gulf and it was supposed that Md. bin Abdullah would retain possession of Bahrein, the Firman was probably again altered in his favour, as it was to him that it was eventually forwarded. In conversation with the Persian Minister this afternoon His Excellency admitted that this was probably the case. He said that Mirza Mehdi Khan on leaving Tehran had received general instructions for his guidance respecting the Bahrein question, but that the details were settled at Shiraz and the Finnan was issued in the name of the Persian Governor of Fars and not in that of the Shah. The name inserted in this document had certainly, he said, been altered once to his knowledge, and it was not unlikely that it had been changed a second time before being forwarded to its destination. “ With regard to the overtures said to have been made by Ali bin Khalifa to the Persian Government, as reported in my Despatch No. 81, I have the honour to state that that information also reached me from a private source and not from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. His Excellency has, however, asserted very positively to me to-day that Ali bin Khalifa had repeatedly written to the Persian Government professing allegiance to the Shah and that a number of letters containing assurances of this kind are now in his (the Minister’s) possession. “ It appears to me that on the receipt of a correspon dence which passed last April between Her Majesty’s Government and the Shah’s representative in London, the Persian Ministers, believing that the Bahrein Chief was himself well disposed to further their designs resolved to take measures with a view to establishino-’ if possible, the Shah’s authority in that quarter and make good his claim to exercise sovereign rights over Bahrein. Mirza Mehdi Khan was accordingly dispatched to Shiraz and Bushire and a certain latitude was given to him as to the mode in which he should proceed to carry out the wishes of his Government. The Persian authorities in Shiraz finally determined that a Firman should be addressed to Md. bin Abdullah, conferring27 upon him the government of Bahrein and with this the Khan hoped to be able to come to terms with the Chief then in possession of the place. But in this matter the sole object of all concerned would seem to have been to carry out the policy of the Persian Govern ment at Bahrein without reference to the interests or wishes of Her Majesty’s Government in that quarter.’’ 95. On 8th April 1870 the Minister at Tehran addressed the following despatch to the Government of India : — “ With reference to my despatch of the 6th instant, in which I stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had informed me that Ali bin Khalila had icpeatedly made overtures to Persia admitting his allegiance to the Shah, I have the honour to report to Your Excellency that Mirza Sayed Khan has just sent to inform me that he was mistaken in making this assertion, and that he finds on enquiry that the letters to which he referred were not from that Chief, but from Md. bin Khalifa. Vieics of Government of India, May 1870. 96. The Government of India, commenting on these facts, remarked that Mehdi Khan appeared to have left Pehian with a general discretion as to which of the various Sheikhs should be recognised as ruler. “At the capital no more definite plan appears to have been resolved on than that measures should be adopted to establish ^ the Sheikh s assumed right of sovereignty over the island. 97. The Government of India proceeded that they had already pointed out that any disposition to admit the claims of Persia would probably lead to the revival of similar claims on the part of Turkey, a result which had in fact now been brought about (cp. paragraph 99 below). “ This (i.e. the Turkish) claim rests on no better foundation than that of Persia. It was summarily rejected by Lord Palmerston in 1851 and in our opinion should not again be reopened. With equal reason the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat could claim the sovereignty of the island, if the nominal and temporary tender of allegiance, in times ^of difficulty, and as a security against foreign intervention, be considered sufficient ground on which to base such preten sions. On the same ground indeed we might claim Bahrein as a part of the British dominions. But, as we have repeatedly observed, the real status of the island, and the only one which we have recognised and admitted, or are prepared to recognise and admit, in all our dealings in the Persian Gulf and our negotiations with the Chiefs, is that of an independent State, subject neither to Persia noi to j) eS p i^ 0 28 Turkey, neither to the Wahabis nor to Muscat, nor yet to 0 f 20.5.1870. the British Government.” Review of Discussions of 1868-70. 98. The matter ultimately lapsed. But from the facts and the correspondence summarised above it will be seen, in the first place, that there appears to be no foundation for the alleged overtures to Persia by the ruling Sheikh, Ali bin Khalifa, or for the statement that the Persian flag was flying at the time of the punitive expedition of 1868 ; and that if any overtures were made to Persia in 1868-69 (and there is no confirmatory evidence of any such overtures) they would appear to have been made by the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifa, presumably in his anxiety to secure Persian support for his restoration. Secondlv, while the statements contained m the Note sent by the Foreign Office on behalf of Her Majesty s Government to the Persian Charge d Affaires on 29th Apiil 1869 were widely phrased, and afford some justification for the interpretation placed on them by Persia, and while the Persians may have been confirmed in their view by the absence of any protest by Her Majesty’s Minister against the mission of Mirza Mehdi Khan, the terms of that Note donot, in fact, constitute more than a recognition that Persia had in the past repeatedly pressed her claim to Bahrein, and that Her Majesty’s Government did not claim sovereignty over that island and interested themselves in its affairs onl } 7 to the extent necessary to discharge their treaty obligations to its rulers (which included a guarantee of defence against external aggression) and to ensure the peace of the Gulf. Finally, that while Her Majesty’s Government agreed to notify Persia, w r hen circumstances permitted, before taking punitive action against Bahrein, on the only occasion on which (immediately after) they appear to have given effect to this undertaking, the terms of their communication made it clear that they regarded themselves as at liberty to punish the usurping Sheikhs Md. bin Abdullah and Md. bin Khalifa (in accordance with the obligations assumed by them under the Treaties of 1820 and 1861 with Bahrein) for their piratical attack on Bahrein and murder of the Chief pla'ced in power there by the British Government. X.—1870-80. From the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the First Exclusive Agreement. Turkish Protest, 1870. 99. In January 1870 a protest was received from the Turkish Government against the recent actions of the F.O. to I.O., Resident at Bahrein. In reply the Turkish Government 531870°’ were informed that Her Majesty’s Government could not Lor I 901. recognise the Turkish claim to sovereignty over Bahrein; and were courteously reminded of the intimation made to them in 1851 on Lord Palmerston’s instructions (para graph 61 above). Turkish Occupation of Hasa. British Assurances to Bahrein, 1871. 100. In 1871 the Turks occupied Hasa. Protests at Constantinople in April and May 1871 against rumoured Turkish designs on Bahrein resulted in a repudiation by Turkey of any such designs. The assurances received from the Turkish Government were communicated to the Sheikh of Bahrein, who had asked Her Majesty’s Government for their advice and their protection against the Turks in Lor.

M a y 187] ) and he was informed that so long as he observed the provisions of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) the reciprocal obligations towards him of Great Britain w r ould be fulfilled. 101 . Protests about the same time at Constantinople led to a Turkish repudiation of the designs which the Turkish Lor. I, 919. Government were alleged to have entertained at Bahrein, and the Turkish authorities in Hasa were given instructions by their Government which debarred them from approaching Bahrein. In May 1871 the Shah enquired from Her Majesty’s Representative at Tehran as to the probable effect on Bahrein of the Turkish occupation of Hasa and was informed in reply of the assurances which had been given to Her Majesty’s Government by the Turks. Reply to Persian Legation at Constantinople as to meaning of British Note of April 1869. 102. In November 1871 the Secretary of the Persian Legation at Constantinople made enquiries of Her Majesty’s Ambassador in connection with a rumour that a Turkish expedition was to be sent for the reduction of Bahrein “ which island the Persian Secretary stated had been acknowledged by the British Government as a portion of Hertslet, 28. the Persian dominions and ... in proof of this assertion . G of x he had handed to Sir H. Elliott a copy of the note which No. IE Lord Clarendon addressed to General Haji Mohsin Khan on 15.3.1872. 28th April 1869. Sir H. Elliott, however, observed that he7T*&gt; 29 saw in that note nothing more than an acknowledgment that the claim had previously been made, but that he was unwilling to discuss the point, as he believed there was no danger of any attempt being made to interfere with tl e position of Bahrein as it then stood. Turkish Claims, 1871-79. 103. Consequent on the murder of a Turkish messenger in Bahrein in August or September 1871, the Turkish Government demanded reparation direct from the Sheikh and received a conciliatory reply. On their demand being pressed the Sheikh, on the advice ot the Resident, suggested that the matter be arranged between the British and the Turkish Governments, by whose joint decision he would abide, but the Turkish Government preferred that it should be settled direct by the parties by agents. Her Majesty s Government saw no objection to such a procedure so long as no compulsion or show of force by Turkey was involved. The Turks, however, let the matter drop. The incident is of some interest as illustrating the view taken by tier Majesty’s Government of the Sheikh as an independent ruler who might deal direct with foreign Powers. 104 In August 1872, a further complaint having been received from Turkey of British proceedings in regard to Bahrein and the commission of “ acts of sovereignty on the part of the English, the Ambassador was informed m reply that enquiries would be made into the point raised by him and that his Government might rest assured that it was not the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to interfere in the affairs of the Persian Gulf beyond what was imposed upon them by treaty for the preservation of peace m the waters The Ambassador was finally informed m April 1873 after investigation, that there were no grounds what ever’for the statement that the British Government had attempted to exercise acts of sovereignty over Bahrein. 105. In 1874, consequent on a Turkish claim to conscript Bahreinis resident m Basra, the Turkish Ambassador ni London was referred to the British Notes of 1851 and 1870 (paragraphs 61 and 99 above), which stated that Hei Majesty’s Government did not admit the claims of Turkey to consider Bahrein as part of the Ottoman dominions. In the same year, on a piratical attack being made on the island by certain Bahreini exiles who had signed a petition claiming Turkish protection, the Ambassador at Constan tinople 'handed a memorandum to the Porte in which it was stated that Her Majesty’s Government could not recognise any rights or pretensions of the Porte over Bahrein. In 1875 a rumour that Her Majesty’s Government were forti fying Bahrein led to representations from Turkey. The rumour was unfounded and the Turks w'ere so informed. On its becoming known about the same time that the Turks themselves contemplated building a lighthouse on the island, the British Government entered a protest at Constantinople (October 1875), with the result that the project was abandoned. 106. In 1876, consequent on steps taken by the Turkish authorities to enforce the claims of Qatar merchants against Bahreinis, a Note was addressed to the Porte reminding them of the determination of Her Majesty’s Government to protect Bahrein against any attack on its independence. 107. In 1879-80 the Turkish Government took up the cause of the rebels of 1869. Her Majesty’s Government, after again disclaiming the exercise of sovereignty over Bahrein, which they regarded, they said, as independent, promised to make enquiries as to certain acts of which com plaint was made by petitioners to the Turkish Government. 2953 H F.O. to Turkish Ambassador 8.8.1872.

In 1880 the Political Resident, finding that the Sheikh was disposed to conclude a special arrangement with the British Government, entered on the 22nd December into what is known as the First Exclusive Agreement with him. By this Agreement the Sheikh undertook on behalf of himself and his “ successors in the Government of Bahrein to the British Government to abstain from entering into negotiations or making treaties of any sort with any State or Government other than the British without the cousent of the said British Government, and to refuse permission to any other Government than the British to establish diplomatic or consular agencies or coaling depots in our territory, unless with the consent of the British Government. This engagement does not apply to or affect the customary friendly correspondence with the local authorities of neighbouring States on business of minor importance.” The agreement was approved by Her Majesty’s Government and ratified in 1881. Summary, 1870-80. 109. The claims of the Wahabi Amir disappear with the subjugation of Hasa by the Turks in 1871. The Turkish claim was repeatedly pressed during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government. The Persian claim appears to have 'been dormant. Her Majesty’s Government repudiate suggestions that they have committed “ acts of sovereignty ” and continue to express their view that the Sheikh is an independent ruler. In 1880 the Sheikh entered into his first exclusive agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XI.—1880-92. From the conclusion of the First to the conclusion of the Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. Persian Demarche, 1886. 110. In SejMember 1886 the Shah sent a verbal message to Her Majesty’s Government through the Minister at Tehran that he considered the communication made to him in April 1869 as tantamount to an admission of his rights in Bahrein and that he was anxious to establish his authority effectually over the islands either by sending a Governor to Bahrein or possibly by recognising the Sheikh as representative of Persian authority, but that he wished the maritime police to remain in the hands of the British authorities. An answer was prepared by Her Majesty’s Government to the effect that they did not concur in His Majesty’s interpretation of the communication of April 1869. They had treaty engage ments with the Sheikh, whom they considered to be indepen dent, and must hold the Sheikh to his engagements while fulfilling those they had contracted towards him. As, however, the Shah did not return to the subject, the message was not delivered. 111 . In the same year presents sent from the Persian Governor of Lai* to the Sheikh were returned to the sender. 112. In 1887-88 Persian intrigues took place with a view to the establishment of Persian influence on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. These were of little importance in the case of Bahrein, but it may be recorded that it appears that in the case of that principality the Persian Government had sanctioned a scheme for the seizure of Bahrein by Sheikh Jasim of Dohah in Qatar, who had seemingly undertaken to put the Persians in possession of the Sheikhdom. Two British ships were in February 1888 stationed off Bahrein, with instructions to prevent by force any hostile attempt to land by the Turks, Arabs or Persians, and the Minister atTehran was asked by the Government of India so to inform the Persian Government. As, however, the Amin-us-buitan, “on being questioned disavowed all designs on Bahrein, tier Majesty’s Minister thought it better to avoid the reference to forcible action.” . QQe Warning to 2 urkey, looS. 113 In March 1888 the Turkish Government were informed that any attempt to effect a landing in Bahrein would be opposed by force, and that no claim by the Poite to jurisdiction over Bahrein could be admitted, since Her Majesty’s Government regarded the Sheikh as an independent ruler with whom they were in treaty relations. Second Exclusive Agreement between Her Majesty’s Government and Bahrein (1892). 114. On the 13th March 1892 the Political Resident signed a second Exclusive Agreement with the Sheikh ol Bahrein on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government, 9 he provisions of the Agreement (which was ratified on 12th May 1892, and which was expressed to be binding on the Sheikh, his heirs, and successors) were as follows (1) “That I will on no account enter into any agreement ^» 80T1 or correspondence with any Power other than the y o | British Government. _ No. xiii, 238. (2) “ That without the assent of the British Government I will not consent to the residence within my territory of the agent of any other Government. (3) “ That I will on no account cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of my territory, save to the British Government. Further Warning to Turkey, November 1892. 115. In November 1892 the Ottoman Government were Const. Desp. warned (apropos of the position of Bahreinis at Basra) that Bahrein was under British protection, and that no interference with its natives by the Ottoman authorities could be admitted. In the same year the Porte was informed, with reference to a rumoured intention to land Turkish troops, that such action would be opposed by Her Majesty s ships. Summary, 1880-92. 116. The Turkish claim was again pressed vigorously during this period and was consistently rejected by Her Majesty’s Government. The Shah raised the question of the Persian claim in 1886, but did not press the matter. In 1892 the Sheikh entered into his Second Exclusive Agreement with Her Majesty’s Government. XII.— 1892-1913. From the Second Exclusive Agreement to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. British repudiations of Turkish Claims, 1892-98. 117. In 1895 steps were taken at Constantinople by Her Majesty’s Government to check an attempted invasion of Bahrein from Qatar, which seemed not improbably to have Lor. I, 935. been inspired by the Turks, and later in the same year Her Majesty’s Government twice reiterated to the Porte that Bahrein was under British protection and that no inter ference with it would be tolerated. The views of Her Majesty’s Government on the status of the island were again officially repeated at Constantinople on two occasions in 1896. In 1897 the Constantinople Board of Health proposed to establish a sanitary post in Bahrein. The proposal was abandoned on the objections of the British delegate, who represented that Bahrein was an independent principality under British protection. 118. In 1898 a Turkish request that a British Vice- Consul alleged to have been appointed at Bahrein should32 Lor. I, 935. Lor. I, 935- 6 . Teh. Desp. No. 140 of 18.9.1901. Lor. I, 938- 42. Lor. I, 944. apply to the Turkish Government for his exequatur was refused on the ground that Her Majesty’s Government could not admit the right of the Turkish Government to insist that a British Consular Officer in Bahrein should be provided with a Turkish exequatur. In 1899 the Minister at Tehran informed the French representative at that capital that since 1880 the Sheikh was precluded by treaty from holding direct relations with any Power other than Her Majesty’s Government and that his subjects abroad were now under British protection. 119. A native British Agent had for a long period of years been maintained in Bahrein. In 1900 a British Political Agent was appointed at Bahrein. The post has been maintained since that date, and has been filled by an officer of the Indian Political Department since 1904. The Incident of 1901. 120. On 31st August 1901 a Belgian customs official in the service of the Persian Government visited Bahrein, where he called on the Sheikh and informed him that he had been deputed by the Shah to obtain his consent to place Persian custom officials in Bahrein. An official protest was at once made by His Majesty’s Minister to the Persian Government, in the course of which Sir A. Hardinge remarked that no intimation had been given to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 44 of this Persian mission to an Arab State under British protection and bound by special treaties, of which the Persian Government cannot be ignorant, to the Government of India ... It is my duty to place on record in the clearest maimer that His Majesty the Emperor of India cannot acquiesce in any foreign interference in the affairs of Bahrein . . . and that any attempt to disturb the relations established by treaties of long standing between those Chiefs and the Government of India will be regarded as an unfriendly act.” The Attabeg- i-Azam, in a note received on the 17th September 1901, replied : “As I have told you verbally, M. Simais has had no instructions from the Persian Government on this matter, and if there have been any steps on his part it must have been by mistake and he will be reprimanded for it.” The Disorders of 1904-05. 121. In 1904-05, consequent on a series of attacks on Persians and on German subjects in Bahrein, the Persians appealed to the Shah. The Persian Government replied that His Majesty’s Government would take action on their behalf. The text of their telegram was as follows : “ To the Merchants and Traders of the High Government living in Bahrein. Your telegram on the subject of the assaults which have been made upon you by the Arab roughs of Bahrein has been received. Certainly let your minds be at rest. Con sultations with the English Legation have taken place on this subject, and it will shortly be settled in such a way that the oppression will be removed and that the offeuders will receive their proper punishment.” 122 . The Germans complained to the German Vice- Consul at Bushire, who made a direct request to the Sheikh for reparation, in reply to which he was referred by His Excellency to His Majesty’s Government. The Sheikh was ultimately compelled by llis Majesty’s Government to give redress. Turkish Protest, 1904-05. 123. On the Turks pressing in 1904-05 for an explanation of the action taken by I l is Majesty’s Government in connection33 with the ill-treatment of the German subject, the Turkish Ambassador was informed by Lord Lansdowne that it was a matter of common knowledge and well known to the Turkish Government, that His Majesty’s Government had direct relations with the Sheikh of Bahrein ; that the island and its natives were under British protection; and that His Majesty’s Government were within their rights in taking measures to obtain redress for the outrage committed there. On the Ambassador reverting to the subject later m l JUo, he was informed (20th May 1^05) that His Majesty s Government must decline to entertain any further represen tations from the Turkish Government on the subject. F.O. to Con stantinople, No. 59 of 22.2.1905. Reassertions of Persian Claim, 1905-13. 124 In 1905 the Persians again reasserted their claim. On the 19th February 1906, in reply to a further reiteration which appears to have been based on the treaties ol 1809, 1814 and 1857, the Minister at Tehran informed the Persian 19.2.1906. Government that “ The Treaties of 1809, of 1814 and of 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty s Government have never admitted the ownership or sovereignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible. His Majesty’s Government consider the island of Bahrein and its inhabitants to be under British protection, and must decline to entertain any further representations on the subject. I am further to mention that this reply has invariably been made to the Ottoman Government, who have on several occasions advanced a claim to Bahrein. Ihe Note concluded by a reference to the Persian appeal for our assistance in 1904-05 and quoted in extenso the telegram of reassurance (paragraph 121 above) to the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein then sent on behalf of the Persian Government. 125. On 13th September 1906 the Persian Grand Vizier Teli D revived the Persian claim in a letter referring to Captain 3 0 £ Bruce’s unauthorised agreement of 1822. He was reminded 3 . 1 . 1907 . in reply that that agreement had been expressly disavowed by His Majesty’s Government and that Captain Bruce had Teh. Desp. been recalled. In a supplementary note the Grand Vizier s 27 * 31907 . attention was drawn to the fact that the then Shah himself had “refused to recognise ” the stipulations of the Treaty of 1822, which had never been ratified, and had “ expressed his displeasure that the Prince of Shiraz should have entered into any engagements with the British Government without his knowledge or instructions.” Teh. Desp. 126. On the Ala-es-Sultaneh reviving the Persian claim, on the ground of the Agreement of 1822, in August IbOT^ his attention was drawn in a Note dated 13th August 190/ to the Notes referred to in the preceding paragraph; and to the fact that the Agreement had been disavowed alike by His Majesty’s Government and by the Shah. The Note added that “ since 1822 the Turkish Government have raised claims on Bahrein, and, like the Persian Govern ment, have been informed that Bahrein is under British protection.” 127. In 1908 the Persian Government, in a correspondence regarding the punishment of a Bahrein subject at Lingah, intimated that instructions had been sent to Lingah that 0 reparation should be made, but added that Elis Majesty s Minister would admit that “ the proprietary right of the Persian Government over the island is not a matter to be disputed.” The Note was returned as inadmissible to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A modified version was sub- ^ sequently accepted by His Majesty’s Government, which 10 ef 1 was acknowledged by a Note from His Majesty’s Minister, 22.1.1909. 2953 134 Teh. Desp. No. 95 of 26.4.1910.

Early in 1910 the Persian Government assimilated the formalities to be fulfilled in the case of persons visiting Bahrein to those prescribed in the case of travellers to Persian ports, a measure which, as pointed out by the Foreign Office at the time, constituted a fresh attempt to assert Persian sovereignty over the island, but it was agreed that in view of the undesirability of raising the general question, no protest should be made to them. In July of the same year it was reported that internal Persian coastal passes issued to persons proceeding to Bahrein from Persian ports were vise by a Persian merchant residing in Bahrein. In 1912 the individual in question was forbidden to take any action in regard to the endorsement of passes held by Persian subjects for travelling in Bahrein. The endorse ments in question were, however, henceforth granted by the Political Resident—a practice, as pointed out by the Political Resident nine years later, “of itself open to objection, as it might be construed into a tacit admission that the Persian passport authorities are justified in giving passes for another Persian port to persons going to Bahrein.” Withdrawal of Turkish Claim to Bahrein in Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. 129. On 29th July 1913 His Majesty’s Government signed a convention (which still awaited ratification on the outbreak of the War of 1914-18) with the Ottoman Govern ment. under which that Government renounced all their claims to the islands ol Bahrein, the independence of which they recognised. His Majesty’s Government on their part declared that they had no intention of annexing the islands and undertook not to allow the Sheikh of Bahrein to disturb the autonomy of the peninsula of El Katr or to annex it, and to ensure that the Sheikh should not discriminate against Ottoman subjects in the matter of dues levied upon pearl fisheries. The Turkish Government on their side accepted a reservation of the right of the population of Bahrein to visit Zakhnuniyah Island for fishing, and recognised the rights of subjects of the Sheikh to British consular protection in Turkey. This arrangement, followed, as it was, by the disappearance of Turkey from the Gulf after the War of 1914-18, disposed of the Turkish claim to Bahrein, which had been reasserted on numerous occasions and with great insistence since 1817. Summary, 1892-1913. 130. The Turkish claim was repeatedly raised during the early part of this period, but consistently opposed by His Majesty s Government. It was finally abandoned in the (unratified) Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913 While Aat Convention was never ratified, the abandonment ot the lurkish claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Ireaty of Lausaune of 1923. The Persian claim was also frequently pressed and was consistently repudiated in strong terms by His Maiestv’s Government. J J Xin.—1913-34. Exercise of Jurisdiction over Foreigners by British Agent in Bahrein. 131. In virtue of the Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70 above) and of subsequent delegations by the Sheikhs the British hepresentative in Bahrein has for over 70 years.35 /■4 &gt;1 / r\ exercised important judicial powers in the islands. The Sheikh io 1909-12. formally requested ills Majesty s Government to exercise jurisdiction oyer foreigners in Bahrein other than the subjects of Arab potentates. An Order in Council conferring such jurisdiction on the 1 ohtical A gent was made in 1913. It was supplemented by a further Order in 1922. Since 1920 jurisdiction over ail foreign subjects has rested with the British authorities within the limits of the Orders in Council. 132. The Sheikh, on 14th May 1914, undertook not to Aitch., XI, entertain any overtures for an oil concession save after No.xvi, consultation with the Political Agent and with the appiovai of His Majesty’s Government. Undertakings secured from Ibn Saud, Decembei 1 91j. 133. In 1915 His Majesty’s Government, in entering Aitch&gt;j X l, into an Agreement with Ibn Sand, then ruler of Nejd, No. it, secured an undertaking from him “ to refrain from ail 2C6-8. aggression on, or interference with the tenitoiies of . . . Bahrein. . . .” Persian Claim reasserted, 1922-23. 134. In 1922 His Majesty’s Consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Persian passport officials at Lingahhad ruled that Bahreinis were Persian subjects and should be given Persian passports. They seized two British certificates of identity granted to Bahrein subjects, but on representa tions being made by the Minister at lehran insti actions were given by the Central Government that there was to be no repetition of this incident. In 1922, also, the l eisian ^ delegate at a Postal Conference held at Bushire stated that ^ 2 6 . while not for the moment pressing for the transfer to Persia of the Bahrein post office, his action was without prejudice to the Persian claim to Bahrein. 135. In 1923, consequent on a Press campaign and a discussion in the Majliss on the desirability of giving Bahrein the right to return a member to the Persian Parlia ment, which was referred to a Commission for report, His Majesty’s Government decided that it was desirable to address a formal Note to the Persian Government in terms similar to those employed in 1906 (paragraph 124 above). Owing to the difficult internal situation m Peisia this p ^ proposal was dropped, but in September 1923 the Persian ^ ^ 27- Government was informed that the island was now a British 9 protectorate, and that His Majesty’s Government did not contemplate any alteration of its status. ihe Peisian Minister for Foreign Affairs replied that the Government of which he was a member had no intention of laying claim to Bahrein on behalf of Persia. But despite this statement the Minister for Foreign Affairs again reverted to the question in the following month. His Majesty's Government remove Sheikh Isa for Misgovemment (1923). 136. Consequent on the gross misgovernment of Sheikh Isa, who had been ruler of Bahrein since 1869, the Sheikh was deprived by His Majesty’s Government of his control of affairs in Bahrein on 26th May 1923, and was granted an pQ. allowance, his son, Sheikh Hamnd (whose right of succession 63-4, had been recognised by His Majesty’s Government in 1901) §§ 11-14 being appointed to act for him as his father s fully empowered agent.” Oil concession granted by Sheikh, 1925. 137. In 1925 an oil concession was granted by the Sheikh of Bahrein to the Eastern and General Syndicate, a British corporation, with the approval of His Majesty s Government.36 .. in* Aitch., XT, No. vii, 227-9. 26.11.1927.

The Treaty of Jedda, concluded on 20th May 1927, between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand, the ruler of Saudi Arabia, in substitution for the Treaty of 1915 (paragraph 133 above), provided inter alia that “His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies ’’ should “ maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of . . . Bahrein and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Consequent thereon, a strong protest was received on 26th November 1927 from the Persian Government, copies of which were despatched to the League of Nations. The Persian protest was based essentially on the recognition stated to have been accorded to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein in Lord Clarendon’s Note of 29th April 1869 (paragraph 85 above). A reasoned reply to the Persian Note was despatched by His Majesty’s Government on 18th January 1928, and circulated to the League. While avoiding any definite statement as to their own position in Bahrein or its basis, His Majesty’s Government in their Note repudiated the Persian claim in the strongest terms, and intimated that no argument such as was suggested could be based on the communication of 29th April 1869. Attitude of Sheikhs to Persian claim (1928). 139. The Sheikhs of Bahrein, on being apprised of the revival of Persia’s claim, gave a letter to the Political Resident, requesting His Majesty’s Government in accordance with their treaties “ to defend Bahrein from outside inter ference ” and to act as their agents in rebutting the Persian claims, and intimating that the Sheikhs proposed to send Sheikh Mohamed, brother of Sheikh Hamad, the deputy ruler, and son of the deposed ruler, Isa, as their representative in answering the claim should the case be taken to Geneva. Further Persian Protest, 2nd August 1928. 140. On the 2nd August 1928 the Persian Government P. 4184/28. communicated a lengthy and reasoned reply to the British Note of 18th January 1928. The Note based its reiteration of the Persian claim on the principle that territory belonging to a sovereign State could definitely be detached from that State only with the consent of the State in question, which had not been given in the case of Bahrein ; and alleged that the terms of the Foreign Office Note of 29th April 1869 were con clusive evidence of the view then held of the rights of Persia by His Majesty’s Government; that Bahrein had consistently recognised Persian sovereignty, as could be proved by documentary evidence, up to the date when the Sheikhs were instigated to rebellion by a foreign government; that no valid argument could be founded on the direct relations into which the Sheikhs had entered with His Majesty’s Govern ment, since their action had been without the approval of their suzerain ; that the relations of Bahrein with Persia were more highly developed than with any other independent civilised country; that the Persian claim had been con sistently and uninterruptedly pressed ; and finally that even if the Treaty of 1822 was disavowed by His Majesty’s Government, it was material evidence of the view held by a British officer of great experience at the time of its con clusion, and that its disavowal by the then Shah of Persia was not because of any doubt on his part as to the true status of Bahrein. P. 1640/29 141. A reasoned reply, which examined in detail the arguments put forward by the Persian Government and reached the conclusion that they were without substance was despatched and circulated to the League at the request of His Majesty’s Government on 18th February 1929. V 'Sr s i 37 Assignment of Bahrein Oil Concession to American Interests, J 1930. Fresh Persian Protest. 140 On 9.3rd July 1930, the oil concession granted to P- 572:3 30 the Eastern and General Syndicate in 1925 having been assigned by that Corporation, with the approval oh the Sheikh and His Majesty’s Government, to an American subsidiary of the Standard Oil Company of California, a formal protest against such assignment was received from the Persian Government, based on the ground that, Bahrem beino- Persian territory, neither the Sheikh nor His Majesty s Government had any right to grant a concession. I he protest reserved the right of Persia to claim damages. Treaty negotiations were at the time proceeding with 1 ersia, and it was thought unnecessary to send any reply to this Note, which was, however, circulated, at the request of the Persian Government, to the League of Nations. Discussions between His Majesty’s Government and Persia, 1928-34. 143. Between 1928 and 1934 treaty negotiations, with a view to the conclusion of a general treaty which should dispose of outstanding points of difference, were in progress with Persia, the question of Bahrein figuring prominently in those negotiations. The general attitude taken by the Persians was that Bahrein was a poiut of great importance to them, but that in return for a sufficient quid pro quo they would be prepared to abandon their claims. His Majesty s Government on their side consistently maintained that the Persian claim was worthless, and that while they would gladl} see it finally disposed of as part of a general settlement, they would not be prepared to make any specific concession m return for its abandonment. \ aricus formulae were worked out in discussion between His Majesty s Representatives in Tehran and the representatives of the Persian Government w ith a view to an agreed solution. The negotiations have, however, failed to reach any conclusion and are at the moment suspended without any prospect of early resumption. 144. In 1932 the Persian Government protested to His P.Z. 4902/33 Majesty’s Government against the issue of British Indian postage stamps surcharged “ Bahrein,” and repeated their protest to the League. Their protest was rejected by IBs Majesty’s Government, and the stamps issued in August 1933. On 22nd May 1934 a further protest against the operation of the Bahrein oil concession was addressed by P.Z. 4343/34 the Persian Government to the United States Minister at Tehran, the United States Government and His Majesty’s Government, and copies were circulated at Hie request of Persia to the League of Nations. Uis Majesty s Government propose to reply to this communication in a Note dinwing attention to their Notes of Januar 3 T 1928 and 1 ebruaiy 1J-J and to request the League of Lations to circulate this iepL to the States Members of the League. XIV.—Conclusion. 145. It may be convenient in concluding this memoran dum on the recent history of Bahrein to summarise very briefly the claims to sovereignty over the island which have Been advanced by various countries since 1783 ; the particular basis of those claims in the case of Persia (whose claim is alone at the present time of any importance), and the basis and development of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government. A —Claims to or Assertions of Sovereignty over Bahrein, 1873 to 1934. 14G.—(u) Muscat .—Bahrein subject to Muscat 1800-01, 1811? to 1816, 1820-22. Tribute paid to- Muscat 1820. 2953 Kr 38 Bahreini independence recognised by Treaty 1829. Muscat thereafter deterred by His Majesty’s Government from pursuing its claims. (6) Egypt .—Representative of Mehemet Ali, Viceroy of Egypt, informed by Her Majesty’s Government in 1839 that no claim upon Bahrein could be admitted. But in 1839-40 the Sheikli acknowledged Egyptian supremacy and he paid tribute during this period. (c) Wahabi Amirs of the Arab Mainland .—Bahrein under protection of or subject to Wahabi Amirs 1803-11 ; 181(5; 1830-33 (tributary); 1836—1838-39 (tributary); 1847 (tributary); 1852 (tribute). In 1867 (see paragraph 75) it was held b}^ Government of India that tribute was paid to the Wahabis only in respect of mainland possessions and not of Bahrein. The claims of the Amirs disappeared with the conquest of Hasa by Turkey in 1871. {d) Turkey .—The islands have never in the period subse quent to 1783 been occupied by Turkey or (if the incidents of 1860-61 (paragraphs 67-9 above) are ignored) subject to Turkish sovereignty. But Turkish claims to them were advanced, directly or indirectly, in 1847, 1851, 1870, 1874, 1875, 1876, 1879, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1895, 1896 and 1905, and on each occasion, save in 1847, when certain assurances were given by Turkey (paragraph 52), were rejected by the British Government. The Turkish claim was finally withdrawn in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. That Convention was never ratified, but the withdrawal of the claim was confirmed by Article 16 of the Treaty of Lausanne of 1923. (e) Persia .—The Persian claim lias been consistently urged on a variety of occasions through the period in question. The Sheikhs momentarily submitted themselves to Persia in 1799 and paid tribute. In 1816-17 they received a Persian envoy and apparently appealed for help to Tehran. They again momentarily submitted to Persia and received an envoy in 1839. Persian aid was invoked and a Persian emissary received at Bahrein, in 1860-61, while in 1869 the deposed ex-Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa may have made overtures to Persia (though there is no confirmation of this) to enable him to re-establish his control over the island. The Persian claim appears, apart from this, to have been asserted in 1822, 1825, 1844, 1848, 1861, 1862, 1866, 1868, 1869,1886, 1901, 1905, 1906, 1907, 1910, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932-33 and 1934, and to have been rejected by His Majesty’s Government in 1822 (as part of their refusal to accept Captain Bruce’s Treaty), 1825, 1844,1848, 1861,1862 1866-67,1869, 1901, 1906, 1907, 1908-09, 1923, 1928, 1929! 1933 and 1934. B.—Basis of the Persian Claim. 147. Ignoring contentions such as that the use of the term “ Persian Gulf ” is a recognition of Persian sovereignty over the various islands of the Gulf, Persia has at one time or other based her claim on the nine grounds examined below': (1) History of the Islands prior to 1783. The history of_ the islands prior to the expulsion of the Persians in 1783 is dealt with in paragraphs 3 to 5 above. It will be seen that at various periods since the beginning of the Christian era, Persia has exercised a degree of control over the islands, and in particular that during the 30 years prior to 1783 her control vras of a more definite character. On the other hand, the facts recorded above do not support any claim by Persia to an uninterrupted occupation or control of the islands. ''vfwafpewH v 39 Persia lias on various occasions in tne past appealed to the early history o£ Bahrein in support of her claim that it is historically Persian territory. Since 1930, too certain Persian newspapers, presumably inspired, have dealt at considerable length with the history of Bahrein in the more or less remote past, and have supported their statements by quotations from, or references to, Arab or Persian eeoin-aphers or historians. Owing to the absence of records amfthe shortness of time available, it has been impossible to check these statements in detail, or to conduct elaborate researches into the writings of Arab geographers and others from which further information might be secured. But it is arguable that the position of the islands prior to li&gt;3o is almost only of very indirect importance in the present connection. ' The essential weakness in the I ersiau claim is it is suggested, that there has been no effective exercise of authority in the islands by Persia since her expulsion in 1783, and that the Sheikhs, who originally established themselves by conquest, have now acquired a prescriptive title, based on an uninterrupted occupation ot lull years bv the present ruling family. (2) The Absence of Persian Consent to the Detachment of Bahrein from Persia. The Persian Government, in paragraph 2 of then; Note of 2nd August 192S (Appendix B), invited attention to “the following international juridical principle. . . . A territory belonging to a sovereign State cannot lie lawfully detached so long as the right of ownership has not been transferred by this State to another State in virtue ot an official act, in this case a treaty, or so long as its annexation by another State or its independence have not been officially recognised by the lawful owner of the territory.” They added (correctly) that Persia has never renounced her sovereignty or ceded it to another State or ever recognised any of the Sheikhs of Bahrein as independent rulers. The argument put forward by the Persian Government under this head is examined in detail in paragraphs G and 7 of the Note despatched by the Foreign Office on 18th February 1929 in reply to the Persian Note ot 2nd August 1928 (Appendix B). His Majesty s Govern ment expressed their inability to agree that an} such principle, if alleged to be of universal application, formed part of international law. The deciding factor in the question of international title in cases in which territory has effectively established its independence of the former sovereign is the effective establishment by that territory of its independence, “ and in the case of Bahrein His Majesty’s Government regard as wholly untenable the pro position that effective possession and administration by the present ruling family for 145 years, during which these rulers have been independent of Persia and during which no Persian authority has been exercised in their dominions, can be affected by the mere consideration that the Persian Government have not set their signature to a document formally recognising the fact of their independence.” In paragraph 7 of the same Note His Majesty s GovemmenL cite historical precedents to show that the theory of the necessity for the formal consent of the dispossessed State is not one which has ever obtained international acceptance. (3) The Unratified Treaty of 1^22. The circumstances in which the r l reaty of 1S_:2 was concluded by Captain Bruce with the representative of the Prince Governor of Shiraz are set out in paragraphs 20-21 above. As will be seen, Captain Bruce concluded it without40 §SH ' r '’ the authority of or reference to Government. The treaty into which he had entered was immediately officially dis avowed, and the Persian Government so informed, and Captain Bruce, as a sign of disapproval of his action, was removed from his appointment. The Persian Government on their side equally disapproved the action of the Prince Governor of Pars in entering into any treaty discussions ' without the prior approval of the Shah. [The Persian Government were reminded of this in 1825, 1845, 1866, 1907, 1928 and 1929.] It appears impossible in these circum stances to base any legitimate claim to Persian sovereignty over Bahrein on the provisions of the Treaty of 1822. (4) The Gold Coin alleged to have been struck at Bahrein in 1817. Please see paragraph 47 above. A Persian Mission appears to have visited Bahrein in 1816 or 1817 (paragraph 9 above) and it is conceivable that a coin might have been struck on that occasion. On the other hand, it would probably be extremely difficult to prove that the coin had not in fact been struck elsewhere, though with an indication that it had been minted at Bahrein. The incident is in itself of relatively small importance, and it would, it is suggested, be impossible for Persia to use such an incident, even if it could be proved, save in support of arguments of much more sub stantial character. (5) Payment of Peeshhesh, Offerings or Tribute at various Stages by Bahrein to Persia. From paragraph 6 above it will be seen that tribute appears to have been paid by Bahrein to Persia in 1799. The rulers of Bahrein may also have offered to pay tribute in 1839 (paragraph 32) and appear to have offered to do so in 1860 (paragraph 67). In assessing the importance of the payment of tribute in 1799, or, if it then took place, in 1839 or 1860, it is relevant that such payment or promise of payment was immediately followed by the submission of the riders of Bahrein, in 1800 to Muscat, in 1839 to.the Egyptians, and in 1860 to the Turks. In estimating the importance of such payments as evidence of a recognition of Persian suzerainty, the arguments advanced by Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran in his Despatch No. ’28 of March 1815, in which Colonel Sheil remarks that the Chiefs of Bahrein “ had in all probability from time to time given peeshkesh, offerings, or tribute to Persia as a mark of superiority, as Kandahar and Herat still continue to do, without an acknowledgment of subjection and the comment thereon of the Secret Com mittee of the East India Company that “presents and complimentary messages do not imply an acknowledgment of sovereignty, and they have not been confined to Persia ” are also relevant. (6) Flying of the Persian Flag by the Sheikh of Bahrein. (a) The Persian flag was hoisted by the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1860. But as will be seen from paragraph 67 above, hardly had it been hoisted when, on the arrival of a Turkish emissary, it was lowered and the Turkish flao- hoisted in its place. At a later stage in 1860-61 the Persian and Turkish flags were apparently flown side by side by the Sheikh. It appears difficult in these circumstances to base any substantial argument on the incident. (b) The Notes addressed by the Persian envoy in London to the Foreign Office in February 1869 alleged that the Persian flag had been hoisted by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and that the Resident had in September 1868 bombarded the41 Sheikh’s palace on which the flag was flying, there appears to be no foundation for the suggestion that the I ersian flag was flying when the Resident reached Bahrein or that it was fired on (see paragraph 80). If previously hoisted it had, by the time of the Resident’s arrival, been hauled down (,.) i n the undated letters from Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah communicated to the Foreign Office by the Persian envoy in April I860, the Sheikh stated that he was hoisting the flag ot the Lion and Sun over Bahrein. If, as seems probable from internal evidence, these letters date from the peiiod ot the abortive Persian Mission to Bahrein of 1800-01, it is relevant in assessing their importance that immediately after the reception of the Persian envoy, a lurkish envoy was received, the Persian flag hauled down and the lurkish 'flag substituted, and that in the early part of 1861 the flags of Persia and Turkey appear to have been flying side by side on the forts at Bahrein. There is nothing to show that either flag flew in Bahrein between the conclusion ot tfie Convention of 1861 (paragraph 70) and lb08. (tl i Jn September 1809 the ex-Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah attacked the islands, and with the assistance of Sheikh Md. bin Abdulla killed the ruling Sheikh Ah. Ihe Persian flag may have been hoisted on this occasion. But there is no reference to this in the detailed reports of the capture of the islands by Sheikh Md. bin Khalifah and Sheikh Md. bin Abdullah or of the operations as the result of which those Sheikhs were reduced at the end of 1869. (Enclosure to Government of India’s Despatch No. 7 of 2oth January 18.0; Resident’s Despatches of Uth September, 25th September, and 5th October 1869.) (7) Letters from past Rulers of Bahrein admitting Persian Suzerainty. It is by no means improbable that in If99, IS 16 17, and 1839 the rulers of Bahrein addressed letters to the Persian Government acknowledging Persian suzerainty over the island, and they appear certainly to have done so m 1860 But the only letters the text of which has ever been communicated to Her Majesty’s Government are the two letters communicated by the Persian envoy m London m 1869. Those letters indeed categorically acknowledge Persian suzerainty over Bahrein, and state that it has been uniutei- ruptedly exercised in the past. But they appeal to date from 1860, and the submission of Bahrein to Turkey and the hauling down of the Persian flag in the same year are, it is suggested, material in assessing the weight to be attached to them. (8) Declarations made by Per Majesty's Government to the Persian Minister in London, April 1869. (a) These declarations are examined in paragraph 98 above. The text of the Note addressed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Persian envoy on 29th Apiil 1869, on which the subsequent Persian claims have to a considerable extent been based, is given in paragraph 85 above. The wording of that Note, and the general attitude adopted by Her Majesty’s Government, as evidenced by their acquiescence in the despatch of a mission to Bahrein o\ Persia, undoubtedly afforded Persia justification foi the inferences she appears to have drawn. But, as pointed out in paragraph 10 of the Note addressed to the Peisian Minister on 18th February 1929 and reproduced in Appendix B, the Note in question, while very loosely expressed, was 2953 L42 never intended to bear the interpretation now placed upon it by the Persian Government (cp. in this connection para graphs 102 and 110 above), and in stating that due consideration had been given in the past by Her Majesty s Government to the Persian claim it did not in any way admit that that claim was valid. The Note, indeed, con firmed the intention of the British Government to continue to hold the Sheikhs to the treaty engagements which had been entered into with them as independent rulers. (b) The undertaking given by Her Majesty’s Government in the same correspondence to communicate in future with Persia before undertaking punitive action against the rulers of ’Bahrein is prima facie consistent with a recognition by Her Majesty’s Government of Persian claims to that island. But it appears, however, in fact to have been no more than a courteous indication by His Majesty’s Government of their desire to pay the fullest possible attention to any Persian claims. It will be observed that the first (and apparently the only) communication made to the Persian Government in discharge of this understanding, intimated to that Government the intention of Her Majesty’s Government to proceed at once against the “ Chief now in possession of Bahrein ” consequent on his breach of the maritime peace and his attack on the Sheikh who had been placed in power at Bahrein by the British Government. (9) Closeness of Relations at the present Day between Persia and Bahrein. The Sheikhs of Bahrein are strongly opposed to any recognition of Persian suzerainty (cp. paragraph 139). The Persian suggestion that relations are at the present time closer between Persia and Bahrein than between Bahrein and any other independent civilised State is without founda tion. Relations are at least equally close with Saudi Arabia, and the closest relations are maintained in addition with Great Britain and with British India. The Terms of the Treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 between the British Covernment and Persia. 148. In addition to the nine arguments examined above, Persia has on more than one occasion appealed to the provisions of her treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 with the British Government in connection with her claim to Bahrein. Her appeal is based substantially on the fact that those treaties provide in certain circumstances for the evacuation of Persian territory occupied by British troops. The relevant passages of the treaties are as follows :— Aitch. XIII, (i) By the preliminary Treaty of 1809 between His No. v, 53. Majesty’s Government and Persia, the Persian Government undertook not to “ permit any European force whatever to pass through Persia either towards India or towards the ports of that country ” ; while His Majesty’s Government undertook “ in case any European forces have invaded or shall invade the territories of His Majesty the King of Persia ” to “ afford to His Majesty the King of Persia a force, or in lieu of it a subsidy, with warlike ammunition . . and officers. ...” Article 5 of the same treaty provided : “ If a detachment of British troops has arrived from India in the Gulf of Persia and, by the consent of His Persian Majesty, landed on the island of Karak or any of the Persian ports, they shall not in any manner possess themselves of such places, and from the date of these preliminary articles the said detachment shall43 m 'x be at the disposal of His Majesty the King of Persia,^the amount of which shall be settled in the definitive treaty. Article 6 provided that “ If the said troops remain by the desire of His Majesty the King of Persia either at Karak or at anv other port in the Gulf of Persia ” they shall be treated in a friendly manner by the Governor and arrange ments made for the supply to them of provisions, &amp;c. at fair prices. (ii) Treatii of 1814.— Article (2) provides that “ His Aitch. XIII Britannic Majesty further engages not to interfere in any -°- vn ’ dispute which may hereafter arise between the Princes, noble men and great chiefs of Persia, and if one of the contending parties should even offer a Province of Persia with a view to 1 171 1 '- 1 - Government shall not obtaining assistance, the ~ ; 1 agree to such proposal^ nor by adopting it possess themselves of such part of Persia.” , , rT . ri . .. . . Article 11 provided that “ bhould His Persian Majesty require assistance from the English Government m the Persian Gulf, they shall, if convenient and practicable, assist him with ships of war and troops. I he expenses of such expedition shall be accounted for and defrayed by the Persian Government, and the above ships shall anchor in such ports as shall be pointed out by the Persian Government and not at other harbours without permission, except horn olenl iit.p. neoessitv. English Aitch. XIII, Xo. xviii, 81. (iii) The Treaty of Peace of Ath March 1857, drawn up on the conclusion of the war between Persia and Great Britain, provided that “ Peace being happily concluded between Their said Majesties, it is hereby agreed that the forces ot H.M. the Queen shall evacuate Persian territory, subject to the conditions and stipulations hereafter specified (Art. -), and that “ immediately on the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty the British troops will desist from all acts oi hostility against Persia, and the British Government engages further that as soon as the stipulations in regard to evacua tion by the Persiau troops of the Herat and Afghan tei iitoiies as well as in regard to the reception of the British Mission at Tehran shall have been carried into full effect, the British troops shall without delay be withdrawn from all ports, places and islands belonging to Persia. ...” If Bahrein were Persian territory and if it had been occupied by British forces at the^ times envisaged by the treaty provisions to which appeal is made by Peisia, there might be some force in the Persian argument, though even then His Majesty’s Government might claim that the fact that their actual relations with Bahrein had in no way been affected by the provisions of those treaties, and that Persia had made no protest at the time against any railure to implement those provisions clearly showed that Persia had accepted in the past the fact that Bahrein fell outside her territorial limits. In fact, neither in 1809, 1814 nor in 1857 was there any British occupation of Bahrein while His Majesty’s Government, never having admitted Persian sovereignty over Bahrein or regarded Bahrein as an integral part of Persia, have in the past adopted the attitude that the terms of the treaties referred to above are irrelevant for the present purpose. As stated by His Majesty s Government in 190b in reply to a Persian Note which cased the Persian claim upon the provisions of those treaties, the treaties of 1809, 1814 and 1857 on this subject have always been scrupulously observed by His Majesty’s Government, but have no bearing on the present question. His Majesty s44 Government Lave never admitted the ownership or sove reignty of Persia over Bahrein. Such a claim is in their view entirely inadmissible.” Review of the Persian Claim. 149. It is relevant in the first place that from 1847 to 1913 the Turkish claim to Bahrein was pressed with at least equal vigour to the Persian claim, and that through much of that period the Turkish claim had a stronger practical justification than can be claimed by Persia since a period long prior to 1783, in that Turkey was the suzerain of the adjoining continental littoral of Arabia and held or preferred claims to both sides of the Gulf by which Bahrein is enfolded. Moreover^ Muscat, which in the early part of the 19th century on more than one occasion established a temporary control over Bahrein and drew tribute from it, was deterred from urging its claims by force from 1829 onwards only by the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, while the Wahabi Amirs brought effective pressure to bear on Bahrein and drew tribute from it, though latterly probably in respect only of Bahreini possessions on the mainland, at frequent intervals through the early part of the 19th century, and desisted only with their subjugation by Turkey in 1870. Persia, in other words, vas up to 1913 one only of the claimants to Bahrein, and through much of the period 1847 to 1913 if anything a less insistent and to some extent a less plausible claimant than Turkey. 150. These considerations, however, apart, the general effect of a review of the history of Bahrein over the last 150 years and of an examination of the specific arguments put forward by Persia and referred to in paragraphs 147-8 above is to suggest that there is no solid basis for a Persian claim to suzerainty or sovereignty over the islands. The geographical remoteness of the islands from Persia and the fact that their population is Arab are admittedly not decisive arguments. The real weakness in the Persian claim appears to be that there has been no effective exercise of Persian authority in the islands since the expulsion of Persia by the ancestors of the present ruling house in 1783. Such incidents as the momentary hoisting of the Persian flag in 1860, its flying side by side with the Turkish flag in 1860-61, or the temporary tender of allegiance to Persia in 1799, 1816-17 and 1839 must be considered in relation to the history of the islands as a whole, in the period now under consideration, and in particular to the consistent claim of Turkey between 1847 and 1913 and to the absence of any sequel to such momentary acknowledgment of or appeals to Persian power; and they cannot carry the weight of a long- dealing extending over a course of years. The remarks of the Government of India in 1870, quoted in paragraph 97 above, are relevant in this connection, as are the observa tions in paragraph 8 of the British Note to Persia of 18th February 1929. It may be added, too, that during the period from 1783 Bahrein has at various dates been in a position to enter into treaty engagements or discussions with neighbouring States such as Muscat (paragraph 26), Turkey (paragraph 103), the Egyptian Viceroy, Mehemet Ali (paragraph 34) and His Majesty’s Government on a basis inconsistent with her being at the time subject to Persian jurisdiction. A further point of some importance is the'absence, so far as available records show, of any reference to Persia by the Sheikhs of Bahrein, at any date since the conquest of Bahrein by the ancestors of the present rulers in 1783, on the occasion of\y 45 their accession, or o£ any formal acknowledgment by Bahrein on such occasions of sovereignty or suzerainty such as might be expected from a Sheikh who regarded himself as a vassal of Persia Nor does any protest at the absence ot any such formal acknowledgment appear at any time to have been made by Persia. 151. The correspondence of 18C9-70, to which particular attention has been paid by Persia in the past, and which may be thought the strongest contention that Persia is m a position to put forward, may indeed be quoted as evidence of the view taken by Her Majesty’s Government at that period of the relation of Persia to Bahrein. But it cannot be valid as against the Sheikhs, and while it is sufficiently loosely expressed to afford some justification for the construction which has been placed on it by Persia, it is relevant that the construction placed on it by Her Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople, and supported by the Government ot India, passed without challenge in 1871 (paragraph 10^ ^ that a similar interpretation was placed on it, with a minimum of preliminary discussion, m } 880 (paragrap i^ ), that at frequent intervals between 1870 and 1880 ilis Majesty’s Government maintained the independence ot Bahrein against Turkey (paragraphs 99-107 above) ; that so earlv as January 1870 they drew the attention of the Turkish Government to the British Note of 18ol (para graph 61 above); and that His Majesty’s Government have uninterruptedly maintained the independence of Bahrein against Persia and Turkey alike since the date of the correspondence in question. 152 The Sheikhs themselves appear, particularly in the earlv part of the past century, before their relations with Her' Majesty’s Government were placed on a more definite footing by the Agreements of 1880 and 1892, to have been guided by a consideration of their own immediate interests in deciding on the line of policy to be adopted towaids the stronger rulers by whom they were surrounded. But not only is it now almost three-quarters of a centuiy since an\ appeal, however flimsy, appears to have been made to I ersia by Bahrein, but the* present Sheikh (like his predecessor) is' keenly apprehensive of any recognition of the Persian claim, to which he is most strongly opposed. C,—Attitude of British Government, 1820-1934. 153. From 1820 onwards His Majesty’s Government consistently dealt with the Sheikhs as independent mlers. They concluded treaties with them on that basis in 1820, 1847, 1861, 1868, 1880 and 1892, and they have been prepared to maintain their independence by diplomatic, or on occasion bv forcible methods against challenge from outside, whether from Persia, iurkey, Fgypt oi the Wahabis. They originally entered into relations with the Sheikhs and promised them a measure of protection i^paia- graph 16) in the interests of securing the peace of the Persian Gulf. In the early stages of those relations the} appear to have been solely concerned to achieve this object (in 1820 they even offered their mediation, which was, however, not accepted by Persia, to secure the payment of tribute to Persia by the Sheikhs), and they restricted their inter ference with the internal affairs of the Sheikhdom to the minimum required to secure the interests of Butish subjects. They were consistently reluctant to establish a piotoctoiate over Bahrein in view of the probable local embarrassments in regulating the succession, Ac., in which this might 2953 M &gt;446 involve them, and in 1849 they formally declined a request T)v the Sheikh that he and the islands should be taken under British protection. In 1861 (paragraph 70) they gave the Sheikhs more categorical guarantees of protection in return for more binding undertakings. Their corre spondence with the Persian Minister in London in 1869-70 shows the Home Government, however, still ready at that date to adopt the attitude that if any other Power would discharge the objects which had led Great Britain to undertake certain responsibilities in relation to Bahrein, she would gladly see them do so. Closer relations with the Sheikh and closer control over his freedom of action were established for the first time by the Exclusive Agree ment of 1880. Relations became closer still with the conclusion of the Exclusive Agreement of 1892. Since that date the position of Bahrein, though His Majesty’s Government make no claim to sovereignty, though the Sheikhdom continues to be regarded as independent from the international standpoint, and though the Sheikhs enjoy a very large measure of internal autonomy, has tended increasingly to approximate to that of a State under British protection. J. G. Laithwaite. India Office, 14th July 1934. %(Heceived under India Office endorsement No.r.Z. 5552/1934). (E.5277/2369/91). Confidential. Copy sent to India . Foreign Office,S.W.l. 23rd August 1934. My dear Laithwaite, I send you herewith, for your confidential information, a copy of an interesting minute by Beckett about the legal side of the Bahrain case. 2. His views, as I think you will agree, have an important bearing on the question of the formula which should be employed to describe, in public pronouncements, the status of the Shaikh and that of the other Arab Rulers in the Persian Gulf. Hitherto, as you know, we have always been careful to emphasise the independence of these Rulers, while mentioning the fact that they are in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government; and in the Anglo-Persian draft general treaty we have been prepared to put oursleves on a par with Persia in recognising the Shaikh of Bahrain's 'independence and sovereign rights'. But while we have thought it useful on many occasions to efface ourselves, in dealing with other Governments, behind the independence of the Shaikh, the desirability of declaring a protectorate over both Bahrain and Kuwait has more than once been broached. 3. tfe have gone into this point further with Beckett on the basis of his minute, and his view is that the phrase 'an independent Shaikhdom in special treaty relations with 'His Majesty's Government' does not really even suggest a completely normal independent State, but rather something J*G.Laithwaite Esq closely/- 2 - closely akin to a protectorate. The hitherto accepted formula is, therefore, sufficiently accurate in his opinion. He considers, however, that we should be careful to avoid speaking of the independence of Bahrain without at the same time referring to the special treaty relations, and should in particular avoid anything which might be held to mis represent the legal position in cases where the international aspect is important. 4. As regards the general treaty, Beckett thinks that it would be preferable that there should be a reference to the special treaty relations between His Majesty’s Government and the Shaikh of Bahrain in close connection with the passage in which we associate ourselves with Persia in recognising his independence. It may be, therefore, that the draft would require alteration in this respect, for, as you know, the two relevant passages are at present separated by the bulk of the treaty But this, though a point to be borne in mind, is of no immediate importance. 5. Beckett has pointed out that it is an accepted international principle - to which inter alia Kis Majesty’s Government have expressly subscribed (vide League of Nations. Codification of International law, volume C.75.N.69.1929 V. pages 122 and 124) that the conduct of foreign relations of another entity entails full international responsibility for what happens there• 6. It might, I think, be useful to have a talk about the matter some time. (sd.) 0 .F.A.'.Varner.Copy. (E 5277/2369/91). ..^ptdepartment. I have now read through carefully the complete dossier of papers sent to the Law Officers with regard to Bahrain and the Law Officers’ Opinion. Having read the whole case, I am not surprised that the Law Otiicers stated that there was no foundation whatever ior a Persian claim to sovereignty over the Islands and I do not think there can be any possible doubt on the matter. I have recently been studying an arbitral award given by a former President of the Permanent Court of International Justice, Mr.Huber, between the United States and the Netherlands and relating to sovereignty over a certain Island in the China Seas. From two pointsof view this award is extremely useful in connection with the Bahrain case, and I think it is as well to call attention to it in this connection in case the matter has in the future to be argued further. Inthe Palmas Island case the Netherlands who won the case cased their claim on the tact that tney had in fact been exercising sovereignty over Palmas Island for a number of years; the Arbitrator decided in the Netherlands favour and his wholecward is based upon the recognition of the actual exercise of sovereignty as creating prescriptive rights which override a previous 11 title. Secondly the method in which the Netherlands in fact exercised sovereignty was by reason of treaties entered into by the native ruler, which they regarded as establishing suzerainty. Under the Netherlands treaties/- 2 - treaties the native ruler retained his independence with regard to the administration of all native affairs on the Island but the Netherlands Government controlled his foreign relations and also exercised jurisdiction over foreigners. The two cases have, therefore, considerable analogies. The Arbitrator discusses what is the actual position in international law which is created by such treaties with native rulers. His answer shortly is that in these cases the essentials of sovereignty are made up by the addition of the functions possessed by the Netherlands to those still left to the native ruler; add the two together and you get all that is required to make complete sovereignty, and the Netherlands were entitled to include the 1unctions left to their vassal as part of the necessary elements of their own sovereignty. This is what Mr. Huber says in his own words: - 'As regards contracts between a State and native princes or chiefs not recognised as members of the community of nations, these are not in the international law sense treaties or conventions capable of creating rights and obligations such as may, in international law, arise out of treaties. But on the other hand, contracts of this nature are not wholly void of indirect eifects on situations governed by international law; if they do not constitute titles in international law, they are none the less facts of which that law must in certain circumstances/-3- cireurnstances take account. From the time of the discoveries until recent times colonial territory has very often been acquired, especially in the Fast Indies, by means of contracts with the native authorities, which contracts leave the existing organi sations more or less intact as regards the native population, while granting to the Colonizing lower, besides economic advantages, also the exclusive direction of relations with other powers and the right to exercise public authority in regard to their own nationals and to foreigners. The form of the legal relations created by such contracts is most generally that of suzerainty and vassal or of the so-called colonial protectorate. In substance, it is not an agreement between equals 5 it is rather a iorm of international organisation of a colonial territory, on the basis of autonomy for the natives, in order to regularise the situation as regards other istates, this organization requires to be completed by the establishment of powers to ensure the fulfilment of the obligations imposed by international law on every State with regard to its own territory, and thus suzerainty over the native State becomes the basis of territorial sovereignty as towards other members of the community of nations# It is the sum total of functions thus allotted either to the native authorities or to those of the colonial power which decides the question whether at any given period the conditions required for the exercise of sovereignty are fulfilled • It seems to me that what Mr.Huber says applies to Bahrain# The elements necessary for the constitution of sovereignty in regard to Bahrain are at the present day made up of the addition of (a) H.M#G#'s right under the exclusive treaties/treaties in force since 1880, viz. control of foreign relations and jurisdiction over foreigners, and (b) the govern ment of the native affairs of the territory still left with the Shaikh. Bahrain is a State under British protection and is really under the sovereignty of H. M.G. from the point of view of international law. The only criticism which occurs to me of the very admirable way in which our case has been presented in the past and of the arguments in the material held before the Law Officers is that much too much stress has oeen laid upon the M independence' of the Shaikh of Bahrain. Up to 1880 this was correct; after that it is not really legally correct to state that the Shaikh is independent. A ruler who has no control of his external relations is not fully independent under international law. We have rightly stressed the complete absence of effective Persian sovereignty during all the relevant periods, but I do not think we have made qirte enough of the evidence of effective exercise of sovereignty by H.M.G., which is really equally striking; such as the deposition of unsatisfactory Shaikhs, the control exercised over them by political residents, and the fact that it is H.M.G. who have resisted the claims not merely of Persia but of Turkey and Muscat and the .i/ahaois. The second point is that Persia has based her case on the alleged doctrine that a State cannot lose sovereignty over part of its territory unless it cedes it by a treaty or recognises the independence of a new State. The Persian case denies the doctrine of prescription. Mr. Huber's award, as I have stated above, is based upon the recognition of this doctrine, and he clearly states that effective display oi sovereignty for a number of years in independence ot a ^ta^e formerly possessing title creates a new title to sovereignty and causes the previous one to lapse. Here is a quotation of what Mr.Huber says about prescription as a ground for the acquisition of a new sovereignty. It is extremely to the point./-5- point• M Pract/ice, as well as doctrine j recognises though under different legal formulae and with certain differences as^to the conditions required - that the continuous and peaceful display of territorial sovereignty (peaceful in relation to other States) is as good as a title ’’Territorial sovereignty, as has already been said, involves the exclusive right to display the activities of a State. This right has as corollary a duty: the obligation to protect within the territory the rights of other States, in particular their right to integrity and inviolability in peace and in war, together with the rights which each State ma$ claim for its nationals in foreign territory. Without manifesting its territorial sovereignty in a manner corresponding to circumstances, the State cannot fulfil this duty. Territorial sovereignty cannot limit itself to its negative side,i.e. to excluding the activities of other States 5 ior it serves to divide between nations the space upon wh_ch human activities are employed, in order to assure them at all points the minimum of protection of which international law is the guardian. ”Although municipal law, thanks to its judicial system, is able to recognise abstract rights or property as existing apart from any material display of them, it has none the less limited their effect by the principles of prescription and the protection of possession. International law, the structure of which is not based on any super-state organisation, cannot be D presumed to reduce a right such as territorial sovereignty,/ 1 s o B- 6 - “sovereignty, with which almost all international relations are hound up, to the category of an abstract right, without concrete manifestations* “The principle that continuous and peaceful display of the functions of State within a given region is a constituent element of territorial sovereignty is not only based on the conditions of the formation of independent States and their boundaries (as shown by the experience of political history) as well as on an international jurisprudence and doctrine widely accepted; this principle has further been recognised in more than one federal State, where a jurisdiction is established in order to apply, as need arises, rules of international law to the interstate relations of the State members* This is the more significant, in that it might well be conceived that in a federal State possessing a complete judicial system for interstate matters - farmore than in the domain of international relations properly so-called - there should be applied to territorial questions the principle that, failing any specific provision of law to the contrary, a jus in re once lawfully acquired shall prevail over de facto possession however well established* “It may suffice to quote among several non-dissimilar decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of America that in the case of the State of Indiana v. State of Kentucky (136 U.S*479) 1890, where the precedent of the case of Rhode Island v.Massachusetts (4.How*591,639) is supported by quotations from VATTEL and WHEATON, who both admit prescrip tion founded on length of time as a valid and incontestable title.“ (signed) W.E .Beckett.

It would be manifestly Imposeible to contend that clalap of thie clae* did not come within the ecope of these articles of the Covenant. It is true that Hie Majesty’s Government maintain that in thie particular ✓ case the Pertian claim is without legal foundation; but, as the Council clearly cannot accept the ex carte assertion to this effect of one of the parties to the dispute, the Council would necessarily have to go into the merits of the Persian claim in irder to reject it on thic ground. This argument, therefore, cannot be advanced ae a preliminary objection to the Council dealing with the matter at till, since it ia only an answer to the '‘errian claim on the merits. fir John Simon does not think, therefore, that there is any argument which His Majesty’s Government could successfully advance before the Cou oil as a valid objection to the Council’s dealing with the merits of the case under trticlec 11 and 16. 6. The Council would, then, be obliged, regardless of the attitude adopted by His Majesty’s Government, to deal with the dispute If the matter were referred to It under articles 11 or ^6 of the Covenant, and a refusal on the part of His Ma jetty’s Government to co-operate, by furnishing the Council with all the evidence available in support of their case, could only react unfavourably on their own Interests. 7. In the case of disputes brought under article 16, th^. procedure is for the Council to call on both parties. In the first instance, for statements of their respective cafes. it then endeavours to settle the dispute by conciliation; and if thie proves impossible, it isruee areport giving Ita own opinion as to the popltlon and atating should be done* Tn the preaent caae (jonclliation eould clearly be iflsposeible, and the rotmoil would at an early atage r 'ind Iteelf faced with a airple queBtlc»i of lawi i» the &gt; rr Ian claifa to Boverc ignty over theee ialanda bouh 1 or la it not*’ The Council ie in general loth to give a ruling on A* purely legal questions, and having explored without rucceae the poaoibilitiee of conciliation, it would in all probability peek the consent of the two partiee to the reference of the diepute to the Permanent Court of International Justice of The Hague* Hailing ruch oon»ent, the Council would appoint its own committee of Juriete to advise it and, on the etrength of their advice, would issue a report containing recommendations as to the settlement of the dispute* 8. It will be observed from the foregoing exposition that no action or inaction on the oart of His Wijesty f a Government could prevent the Persian claim being considered el Uier by the Permanent Court of Intemat 'onal Justice or by the Council of the league* 4 reference o^ the question to the Hague Court could, on the other hand, be prevented by either party to the dispute, and it is therefore relevant to consider which of these altematives would be preferable from the point of view of T?ie Hijesty’s Government* nir John I imon is etrcangly of the opinion that a reference to the Hague Court would be the more advantageoua course fro* the point of view of Hie Ha^erty’a Government* The dispute is a clean-cut legal issue and the Law officers of the Crown have recently advised that ‘ersia hae no right in or over Bahrain* Kxcept, therefore, in the most unlikely event of the Persian Govem»t*nt being able to establish further relevant facts which were not placed be ore the Law Officers when the ease was referred to the*, 8ir John fimon has no doubt whatever that,/that, if the case came before the Permanent Court, judgment would be given against Pereia* \ confideration of the pereormel of the Permanent Court and a careful etudy of the judgments given by the Court up to date afford no ground whatever ^or the view that there i® any possibility of the Permanent Court deciding wrongly a legal question where there i® no reasonable doubt aa to what 1® the right comclnclon from a legal point of view. It is perfectly true that many of the past judgment® of the Court have been given by narrow majorities, and it ie equally true that In one or two of these cure® there are lawyers who are of the opinion that the majority of the Court has come to the wrong boncluision; but these were case® where the legal question submitted to the Court was admittedly a doubtful one on; which lawyers might be expected to differ. It may be that, In circumstance* where the legal arguments on either side appear to be equally cogent, an individual judge’s conclusion® may be influenced by hie own personal prejudice® or eympathiesj but there seMar no ground whatever for eupposing it to be possible that the Permanent Court would decide a clear legal issue wrongly through perronal and national prejudice. Further, even If it were to be supooeed that the Permanent Court was strongly influenced by extra-legal considerations (a hypothesis which ie not thought to be true), it is difficult to conceive of any reaeon® why, in a dispute between His Vajeety # a Government and the Persian Government a® regards sovereignty over islands In the Persian Gulf, the prejudices of the majority of the Court should be in favour of Persia rather than of Hie Majesty’s Government. Indeed, it would appear to be natural that the contrary rhould be the case, peeing tha t/that the aupport and confidence of IUb Vajeety’s Qorenmmt is absolutely eBsentlal to the Court if it Is to naintain its present high position. The view® of Persia are relatively uniwportant from thie point of visa. 9. If, on the other hand, the Council were obliged to give an opinion baned on the findings of a legal committee set up under ite auspices, while there is little If any reason to doubt that in so clear a cae© the legal point would be decided in accordance with ite merits, it is possible that in an attempt to spare Feruian sueceptibllltie*, the Council might frame their report in such terms as would not diepoee of the Persian claim in to final and definite a manner. Sir John Simon does not with to euggest that this would necessarily, or even probably, be the result; for the Council has been known on occasion to give an entirely clear-cul decision, as for example in the dispute between Colombia and Peru on the point relating to the sovereignty over the Letitia trapezium. He considers, however, that in the circumstances envlnaged, there would be definite advantage in the reference of the Persian claims to the Permanent Court of International Justice, 10, r, hie conclusion of course depends upon the hypothesis wh'oh would appear to be a reasonably ea^e one, that the Persian Government cannot establish a series of facts relevant to their claim over Bahrain, which are at present unknown to His tfajesty’s Government and which might warrant a less confident view of the strength of their legal case. If Bir Bamuel Hoare conceives this to be a danger, it could be avoided if Hie Majesty’s Government allowed the Persian Government fully to develop their case before the council before.1 *#/ before they announoet their readiness for the waiter to he decided hy the Permanent Court, If, when Pereia deyeloped her oaee, the facts upon which she relied appeared to he substantially different from those at present taown to T!is Majesty's Government, the decision as to the line to he taken hy His Maiefty** Government could he reconsidered; hut, in the event of the Persian expord not adducing any such new facte, then 8ir .Tohn r imon coneidex*c that it would he the widest policy for flie Majesty's Government at the commencement of their reply to Indicate Kls Majesty’s Government’s willingness to have recourse to the Permanent Court# l 1 # The foregoing paragraphs deal with the situation which would arise if the Persian appeal were made under Article 15 of the Covenant.

If the Persian delegate should assert these claims in the course of this year 1 s general discussion before the Assembly, Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that it would be sufficient for the United Kingdom Delegation to make a short counter-statement. Such counter-statement should, in his opinion, be quite brief and summary, in order to avoid giving the Assembly any impression that :iis Majesty’s Government regard Persia’s claims as deserving of serious consideration. So far as tke 4»eaguQ of Natrona is concerned a reference to the published correspondence would probably be sufficient. If the Persian claims to Tamb and Abu Musa should also have been referred to, he suggests that it would suffice to state that while the history of these barren islands prior to 1750 is obscure, since that date authority over them, and such effective occupation as has existed, has had its origin in the Jowasimi Arabs of the Trucial Coast of Arabia, that their representative, the bheikh of Shargah on that coast, who exercises authority Government raising the question of Persia’s claim to Bahrein, Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, over/2 over these islands, is an independent ruler in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government and that the Persian claim, which appears to have first been put forward so recently as 1887, has been repudiated by His Majesty's Government acting on his behalf. 3. If, however, Persia should seek to raise her claims before the Council, unaer either Article 11 or Article 15 of the Covenent, Sir Samuel Hoare has considerable hesitation in accepting without qualification Sir John Simon’s vLw that there is no argument which could be advanced as a valid objection to the Council's dealing with the merits of the case under either of these articles. He would have doubted whether either article is strictly relevant. Persia’s claim to Bahrein for example, is in effect a refusal to recognise the status of Bahrein as an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty's Government. The most relevant words in Article 11 are those which declare it to be the friendly right of each Member of the League to bring to attention ’’any circumstance whatever affecting international relations which threatens to disturb..... the good understanding between nations upon which peace depends”, while Article 15 relates to disputes 'likely to lead to a rupture”. Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be desirable for the British representative to point out that the independence of Bahrein is not a circumstance which in any way endangers peace, and that it is not likely to lead to a rupture unless Persia proposes to attack Bahrein, which His Majesty’s Government presume is not her intention. He suggests that it would be desirable to make this point in order, from the commencement, to set the matter in its proper light before members of the Council. But/3 But it might perhaps he wise to acid that His Majesty's Government, while doubting whether the articles of the Covenant are in any way applicable, nevertheless have no desire to prevent the Council being seized of the question on that account, on the understanding that, whatever might be the result of the proceedings, His Majesty's Government consider that they will not be precluded thereby from resisting aggression by Persia if the latter should be so ill-advised as to embark upon such a course. 4. As regards the position which would arise,if, as maybe anticipated, the Council suggested a r ef erence to the Permanent Court of International Justice, Sir Samuel Hoare has the following observations to offer to Sir John Simon's view that it would be preferable to accept such a reference rather than allow the Council to arrive at its conclusion on the advice merely of its own committee of legal experts. He would be prepared to accept Sir John Simon's reasoning on this choice of alternatives if the case were one in which His Majesty’s Government could afford to run the risk, however small, of an adverse decision by the International Court. But in the present case it is necessary to envisage the consequences which would follow if the totally unexpected happened and the Court gave a decision in Persia's favour. In that event Sir Samuel Hoare cannot see that His Majesty's Government would have any alternative but to refuse to implement the decision, having regard alike to their strategic and other interests, their obligations of honour and justice to the Sheikh and finally their own reputation for faith and loyalty throughout the Middle East. He would therefore suggest that before it is decided to agree to a reference of the Bahrein case to the Permanent Court a preliminary decision is/4 is first required on the question whether, in the conceivable event of an adverse decision. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to depart so far from their policy of co-operation with the League as to decline absolutely to implement a decision by the Court- He would be glad to receive an expression of Sir John Simon’s views on this point. 5. If, on the other hand, the Council dealt with the matter after reference to its own expert committee and made an adverse or inconclusive report, though the risk of this appears to be regarded as slightly less remote than that of a wrong decision by the Court, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the evil consequences wouldb e far more tolerable* In the first place it seems probable that an adverse report by the Council would not be unanimous, but that at least some members other than the parties to the dispute would lend their support throughout to His Majesty’s Government. In this event it does not appear that any grave consequences would ensue, since under paragraph 7 of Article 15 the effect of a'i'iion-unanimous report is merely that members of the League retain their freedom of action. Even on the gravest and least probable hypothesis of an unanimous report in Persia’s favour the only effect appears to be that under paragraph 6 of Article 15 no member of the League would go to war with Persia in order to assist His Majesty’s Government in resisting possible Persian aggression. But if Persia were so foolish as to resort to war, presumably there could be no question of this country’s own right to resist aggression, especially if the caveat ouggested at the end of paragraph 3 above had been entered at the outset. There remains the hypothesis suggested in paragraph/paragraph 9 of your letter that in an attempt to spare Persian susceptibilities the Council might frame its report in such terms as would not finally dispose of Persia’s claim. The result of this, however, would be the continuance of the status quo and His Majesty’s Government would not be in an appreciably worse position than that which obtains at the present. 6. On this comparison of the possible results of an adverse decision by the Court of International Justice and of an adverse or inconclusive report by the Council, Sir Samuel Hoare feels, having regard to what is at stake upon each event, that it is preienable to run a slightly greater risk of the far lesser evil. 7* If Persia’s claim is taken up by the Council, it would certainly seem desirable to wait for Persia to develop her case before finally deciding on the exact line to be taken in reply. Sir Samuel Hoare considers, however, that, for the reasons suggested above, it would in any event be preferable to decline a reference to the International Court, and he also suggests that, with a view partly to explaining to the members of the Council the reasons of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude, it would be highly desirable that the British representative, at the commencement of his counter statement before the Council, should give an adequate account of the actual status of Bahrein and of the reasons why His Majesty’s Government is a party to the dispute. 8. In making this last suggestion Sir Samuel Hoare has had the advantage of reading Mr.Beckett’s minute of 15th August 1934, enclosed with the demi-official letter from the Foreign Office of 23rd August, £.5277/2369/91, which suggests that Bahrein is really under the sovereignty of His Majesty’s Government from the point of view of international/6 . international law* Whatever may he the exact position in international law&gt; Sir Samuel Hoare agrees that the international responsibility of His Majesty’s Government in respect of Bahrein is a practical and necessary consequence of the fact that by treaty with the Sheikh they are in exclusive control of his external relations* But it is also an important fact that Bahrein is not a British possession and that the Sheikh is an independent potentate in the sense that he exercises sovereignty in his internal affairs. It is necessary to bear this aspect of the case in mind as well as the international responsibility of His Majesty’s Government, and Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that it would be particularly desirable to lay great stress on these facts in any argument before a political body such as the Council of the League of Nations, some of whose members might otherwise be so ill-informed as to suppose that His Majesty’s Government may have acquired, or may seek to acquire, by usurpation or otherwise, jurisdiction over Bahrein as a British possession. 9. The Secretary of State accordingly suggests that if the Council of the League take Persia’s claim to Bahrein into consideration, the statement of the British case should give prominence to the following points (a) that Bahrein is not a British possession but an independent State in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government, and that the latter make no sort of claim to internal sovereignty; (b) that although His Majesty's Government is a party to the dispute with Persia because the Sheikh has entrusted the control of his external relations to them and Bahrein herself is not a member of the League, nevertheless, in a matter of such importance as a claim by a foreign power to bring Bahrein into subjection. His Majesty’s Government naturally could not take any action contrary to the wishes of her ruler; that His Majesty’s Government are in honour bound to protect his independence; that he repudiates the Persian claim; that though both he and His Majesty* s Government are convinced that the Persian case is entirely frivolous, he naturally objects/7 . obiects to the submission oi a dispute involving the very existence of the Bahrein State to arbitration or settlement by an outside authority* and that if His Majesty’s Government were so to submit it against his wishes* such action would be a clear abuse of their position as his trustee. 10. Sir Samuel Hoare hopes that bir John Simon may be ible to agree to the suggestions made in this letter. If, however, the matter has to be further considered, it is dlear that it will not be practicable to give final instructions to the British representatives at the forthcoming meetings of the Council ol the League, as the questions at issue will need the careful consideration of the Cabinet. It is observed that Tehran telegram No.114, of 25th August indicates no special reason for supposing that the Persian Government intend to bring up their claims at those meetings. If, however, they should place them on the agenda before a decision has been reached as to the line to be adopted by His Majesty's Government, Sir Samuel Hoare suggests that the British representative on the Council should be instructed to secure a postponement, as any such claim is obviously a matter of which due notice should be given and which possesses no degree of urgency.

Dear Laithwaite, A Question has arisen whether the Bahrein Islanas are within the British Empire for the purposes of the import Duties Act, 1932. section 21 aefines the expression 'British Empire' as meaning,- 'His Majesty’s dominions outside the United v\ nedom TincluaintT all”parts of India), territories nnrtpr Hi. maiestv^s protection, territories in respect of^which a mandate of tne League of Nations is toeing exercised toy the Government of any dominion within the meaning of the statute of Westminster, 1901, and o n v territory in respect of which a mandate of tne f^Lul of Nations is toeing exercised toy .the Government of the United Kingdom and to whicn section xive of Act h!s toeen declared toy Order in Council to apply as if it were a territory under His Iv^ajesty s protection. I understand that certain protection is afforded to the Islanas under a Treaty witn tne Government of India, which is represented hy a political agent, and the question whether tnis amounts to His majesty’s protection within the meaning of the above quoted aefinition appears to depend upon what, in fact, is the nature of the protection enjoyed. I believe that you were gooa enough to say that you woula let me have your opinion on the matter, ana I shoula be very grateful if you would ao so. If it is not too mucn trouble, It would be very useful to have your views on the other places mentioned, namely, Kaweit, Muscat, &amp;c. Yours sincerely, (3d.) C.V. WALKER. J.G.

The definition of ’’The British Empire” in Section 21 of the Import Duties Act, 1932, is, of course, a definition of the British Empire for the purposes of this Act and not for general purposes and the question at issue is merely whether Bahrein is or is not covered hy any of the words of this definition section. The only words hy which it could he covered, if it were covered at all, are the words ’’territories under His Majesty^ Protection”. 3 / V* walker. Esq. . Solicitor's Office, Custom House, E.C. 3.2 3 . Tne position is that under treaties concluded w ith the Rulers of Bahrein the Sheikn of Bahrein has no relations with any power other than Hxs Majesty’s Government and His Majesty’s Government deal with foreign powers over any questions which arise in relation to Bahrein and have also undertaken certain oh ligations to protect the territories of the Sheikn from forei b n aggression. As regards the internal government of his territory the sheikh is left lull independence, except that jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners is exercised by His Majesty, who is represented in Bahrein by a political Agent. Though it must te recognised that the expression ’’territories under His Majesty* s protection' is hela to cover territories such as the Malay States, Sarawak, Brunei and Zanzibar, where there is a native ruldr who enjoys independence in the matter of internal government of his territories in which His Majesty uoes not directly exercise jurisdiction except over foreigners and where from the formal point of view the position is rather similar to that of Bahrein, nevertheless there are grounds for distinguishing Bahrein from those territories. In the first place, the measure of control exercised in fact by His Majesty’s Government in the other/3 otfter territories mentioned above is b reater tnan in Bahrein, and in the second place, there are political difficulties which would he caused by regarding Bahrein as covered by these words in this Act,which ao not apply in the case of the other territories mentioned. For political reasons it has been deemed expedient in communications to foreign governments to stress the independence of Bahrein. Apart from this, the Ruler of Bahrein would probably take exception to the inclusion of his territories as part of the British Empire, even under a purely statutory definition of the British Empire for a particular purpose, the niceties of which he would never understand. In these circumstances, although from the point of view of strict international law it would be correct to regard Bahrein as a territory under His Majesty's protection, it aoes not necessarily follow that Bahrein should be regarded as coming under these words in this particular Act of Parliament, and the view might be taken that the connection with Bahrein is in practice so loose that it should not be regarding as coming within the intention of Parliament in enacting this section and we would therefore suggest that the Board of Customs should/Should act on the view that Bahrein is not covered by the section. If f 116 ruling of the Customs in this sense were challenged the question mi &amp; ht, of course, come before a court, which would then have to decide the natter on the basis of such information as was officially communicated to the court on oehalf of the Crown. 4 Itio posi'tion in ro^arci t&gt;o Kowoli and tiie Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast is the same as that in regard to Bahrein, as described above. The sultanate of Muscat and Oman is, however, in a wholly different position ana though His Majesty's Government exercise a particular influence there and protect nationals of the sultanate in foreign countries, the sultan is still free to enter into direct relations with other powers and therefore even from the point of view ox strict international law his territories would not be covered by the expression 'territories under His Majesty's protection' and a fortiori not covered by this expression in an Act of Parliament of the United Kingdom.

British Policy in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, Treaties of the Shaikhs of the Islands. T Iraq and Bahrain. Peaceful policy sometimes construea as weakness. Iran should occupy Bahrain Islands with the force of bayonets as Germany occupied Rhine, Japan Manchuria and Italy Abyssinia with the force of bayonets. The established right of Iran from every point of view and from any side is clear. Numerous articles which have constantly beenpublished in this paper for the last few years onward established proofs on the subject which the readers remember and there is no doubt and hestitation about it. The Imperial Government of Iran who consider the said Islands as an inseparable part of the Bapire did not want to occupy them with the force of bayonets as they did in other parts of Iran such as Khuzistan, Baluchistan, Luristan etcetera which had separated on account of the disinterest of the authorities of the bS^ck time of Q&amp;jar and in every side there was a Government and a leader. The only object of the Imperial Government was to settle the question of Bahrain in a peaceful and friendly way. It is regretted that an important matter has caused the delay of this question and that is the British policy in the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean. The British Government, when started 200 years ago to extend their colonial/-2 . colonial influence in India aid not miss any opportunity in adopting any measures to strengthening those factors which would cause their success. Also they fully endeavoured to take actions against those problems which were not ensuring their success. This is the reason why we see all countries ana waters situated between Britain and Inaia have become more or less under the influence and protection of Britain. The M&amp;nsh sea (Baglish Channel),Pacific Ocean, Gibraltar have come under the domination of the British. The British Naval influence in the Mediterranean bea is even more than those powers which are situated on the coast of this sea. In Egyptian water, Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab el Mandab, there exists no foreign influence but the British. The domination of this naval Government in the T Iraqi coast ana the Arabian peninsula is extraorainary. And it is for tnis only that Britain triea from the beginning and is trying to extend their influence on the Persian Gulf waters in order to bring the Islanas and places situated between Arabia, T Iraq &gt; and Indian waters under their control. In the past the then Government of Iran who had no news even of the capital how could it be possible for her to know about the distant places of tne country. The British (Government) were doing wnat- ever they liked in our v/aters. Their warships used to anchor group by group in the waters of the southern ports ana no one could dare ask what these ships were doing in our waters. I remember in 1302 when I was in Bushire tnere appeared at nights from the middle of the sea a grand illumination which in tax comparison with/dimmed lignt of Bus^ire was ^uite grand and magnificent. I asked/-3. asked a friend of mine from wnere this illumination was and he replied that those were British snips which had anchored on these sides, ana had given the sea such beauty and magnificence. This was the state of our waters then. By and by the page was turned and the conditions changed. Despite the expectation of powers seeking for colonies there appeared a leader and rescuer who was able to give life to the soulless Ira^, protecting our national interests and affairs in the interior of the country and abroad. Gradually he put an end to the tribal chiefdoms of the past and the farthest spots of the country became unaer the control of the Central Government. The Persian Gulf Islands also joined the mother of the country one after another. The Bahrain Islands which are one of the Gulf Islands a,id inseparable part of Iran were expected to become under the control of Iran but it is regretted that the British have not yet agreed to desist from their colonial intrigues. From one side they are adhering to their treaties concluded with the Shaikhs appointed by themselves and have taken these torn papers as their documentary proof and with these documents they hold themselves as protectors of the islands, their interests and Shaikhs. The more ridiculous thing to mention is the nritish intrigues towards countries which are neighbours of Iran, that is, that Bahrain is independent; it is considered(only under the British protection) hence they may exchange consular and diplomatic questions with it. ihe messages of a few days ago stated that the ^ra^i 'government expect to have a political relation with Bahrain Islands and to exchange consular officers. In other words all protests of the Imperial Governement to the/-the League of Nations ana the last diplomatic and friendly measures of Iran have proved fruitless# The British try to bring, as soon as possible, Bahrain Dslands under their complete control. It is obvious that the Imperial Government of Iran, under instructions of our crownea fatner, was desirous to have a peaceful policy and to sectle its political difficulties in a friendly way. It was for this reason that they adhered to legal means and produced tne case before the League of Nations and in the meanwhile correspondence had been exchanged between the Imperial Government and the British Government. But i^ seems that our peaceful way has been construed as weakness and inability otherwise there would have been some effect to it. The friendly and peaceful manner has always good enect in international policy but in tne meantime it might bring about extraordinary dangerous injuries. For example, alter the Great „ar and the victory of the allies, Italy who considered herself a partner in the war booties, tried her best to obtain from the said war booties her share or at least a part ol it but could not succeed. Because Italy which at that time was confronted with a range of internal uiliiculties and even the tribal chiefs were so powerful as to conquer it at any moment, had no power to bring her rightful requests into effect and no one,therefore attended to her statement. When the past time was over and Italy was strengthened under the leadership and dictatorship of Musolinni, the nations still were not prepared to enter into a peaceful way with her. In consequence/-(!V 5. consequnce the dictator of Italy, depending on his financial power, naval, air and Military lorces, dreamed for the only indepenedent country in Africa, that is, abyssinia. His dream was also,as a result oi efforts made hy the Italian forces, interpreted. To-day Abyssinia, despite the long proteats of the Governments particularly the British, came under the flag of Italy. Before Italy Japan started a heart broken cry saying 0 T nations, so many millions of the population of my country sleep on the coastal boats on account of want of room on the islands. There is noisufficient foodstuff in this country. Q T people in whose empire the sun does not set, have /mercy on me and give me a piece of land so that some oi tne people may go to live in and cultivate, d&amp;a Japan T s cry was not heard by anyone but by themselves. Consequently Japan discontin ued the peaceful policy with the nations, occupied Manchuria with her military force and did not care for the protests of the nations. She is now comfortably increasing her national interests and nas nothing to do with others. She dared, however, say that she is in need of China and China is in need of her, 'Charity begins at home', because it is possible that a European Government might come to Asia and occupy such a vast country like India and she (Japan; should sit ^uiet while China is two inches distant from her and when a European nation^ came and occupied China whose political and internal conditions are not better than India, she(Japan)must put her finger in the mouth and look what is going on. The Rhine parts which belong to Germany were occupied by the Allies’ forces after the war and it was under their occupation until a few years ago. At last tne Allies withdrew their/-6 * their military force after fifteen years from there. In this period, howsoever, Germany shoutea, tnisis our land, the Bhine parts are a part of Germany, why should it be unprotected] No one cared for her statement. When they completed iix&amp;icx their forces, they occupied tne said place with an international oisturbance and as there was an air force ready to protect the national honourj nothing moved from its place. Only long and detailed protests of France and others are kept in the records of the League of Nations to-day. In our opinion the peaceful policy of the Imperial Government of Iran in restoring its political right in Bahrain Islands has been met with coldness and no weight has been given to it. Iran should protect her right with the force of bayonets. Our legitimate right in Banrain is established and now that our party want to deprive us witn tne olden time intrigues^ we should also leave aside our peaceful policy and prove for the 8Qtn time to the gentlemen that Iran can protect their political interests with their military force and act reciprocally with those who, despite the past experience, are not prepared to listen to the real fact. No one can deny to-day tne extraerdinary improvements of Iran effected by the special attendance of His Imperial Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi during the last 15 years. The military force of His Imperial Government on account of discipline, arms, education, drill and number can be compared with the best European force. Our air force is considered to be second in ^sia after Japan and the naval force is increasing year by year. Those who/-7- who are not prepared to recognize our legitimate right,will be made to recognize it. It is preferable if they take a e lesson from the past experynces and listen to our real statement otherwise they themselves will be held responsible for unexpected consequences on account of this treatment.CONFIDENTIAL. c n r£) ' 7 No. 538-S of 1936.

Tne sooner the Persian Government realised tnis the better. 5. fne Minister then reverted to the idea of Arab unity and began making tentative enquiries in regard to the Saudi-lraqi Treaty. I explained that it had always been a principle of our policy to further friendly relations between Powers-with whom we Aere on friendly terms ourselves. “e were on excellent teims both with Saudi Araoia and Iraq, anu it was largely due to our e.i.iorts that these two States had made friends with each other some years ago. They were perfectly free to maite a new treaty of friendship ana we were glad to see close ana friendly relations growing up between them.

WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 24th June, 1936. entlal. Dear 7/a; 7/ould^/ou kindly refer to Laithwaite's letter of the lUth February 1935 and connected correspondence about the position of Bahrein, Shargah, and other Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf in respect of Section 21 of the Import Duties Act, 1932. 2. We have now had occasion to look into this question again, and have come to the conclusion that the political difficulties to which Laithwaite referred as likely to he caused by regarding Bahrein (or the other Sheikhdoms) as covered by the words territories under His Majesty’s protection' in the Act do not any longer exist. We do not, eieiore, in existing circumstances, desire to suggest that the Board of Customs should act on the view that the Sheikhdoms are not covered by the Section. 3. The Board may accordingly wish to recons 0Wn attitude in regard to the construction of the question for the purposes of the Import Duties Ac reconsider its Act in the/ words in ker, Esq* , orns House, E.C. 3.&lt;s&gt; 2 . the light of the facts regarding their status. In ease this is so, we think it may he useful to give you the following information regarding the relevant treaties with the Sheikhdoms. Bahrein. Article 3 of the treaty of 1861 states:- ’'The British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the neceasary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury.....by sea upon Bahrein.... or its dependencies”• Bahrein being a collection of islands, this clearly constitutes protection. Sfoargah and the other Trucial Sheikhdoms. Article 10 of the Treaty of 1820 with these Sheikhs states:- If any shall attack them /I. e. the ships of the Sheikhs 7 the British Government shall take notice of it.” This in e^xect means protection by sea (though not by land). jf.93 701 In 191U a letter was sent to the Sheikh in which he was given an assurance that ”Koweit shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection'. Thus, as regards Kowext, the position is quite clear. /. We also have Agreements, dated 1892, with.'Bahrein and the Truoial Sheikhdoms whereby they agreed (1) not to enter into any agreement or correspondence with any other Power than the British Government:3 . (2) not to receive the agents of any other Government: and (3) not to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territories save to the British Government. Thus His Majesty’s Government have exclusive control of th e foreign relations of all these Sheikhdoms, and consequently international responsibility for their affairs. 8. It may perhaps be felt that the provisions of the treaties, combined with the de facto position in which His Majesty’s Government find themselves in the Gulf (which would necessitate intervention in any major crisis affecting the safety and peace of the Sheikhdoms) point towards tnc inclusion of the Sheikhdoms under the phrase territories under His Majesty’s protection” in the Act. I arn sending a copy of this letter to Rendel at the Foreign Office and Ferinelly at the Board of Trade. Aiiioor'oVy* C r WALTON2 - Translation of an article which appeared in the Sh f ab of Baghdad, dated 8th July 1936. No. 539. Continued from the article which appeared in the same paper dated 7th July. No. 538. England seized this opportunity and ordered the Shaikh of Bahrain to visit Iraq on his way to England, and he obeyed the order. Thus all peaceful objections and diplomatic communications submitted by the Iranian Government to the League of Nations proved ineffective. England on her part is becoming more active in taking possession of Bahrain by establishing any sort of government provided that it remained completely under her influence. There is no doubt that the Imperial Iranian Government under its father, the King, has always shown sympathy for a peaceful policy, and desire to end her external problems by any possible means of conciliation and friendship. According to this policy the Iranian Governmsit wished to end the Bahrain problem by submitting all her documents to the League of Nations and entering into several negotiations with Britain. But Britain regarded our peaceful intentions as weakness and believed that we are afraid of her and overlooked all that had happened in this connection. The peaceful and friendly policy between the nations has its good effects sometimes as well as its dangers. Eor example after the Great War, when the Allies were successful, Italy counted herself a partner in the booty, and endeavoured to get her share, but she could not, as then she had several- 2 - several internal difficulties and was weak. So the Allies vuould not listen to her and shared the booty among themselves. Now Italy was able to end her difficulties and her dictator Signor Mussolini has given Italy the spirit of power and ambition. Yet the Allies refused to cede any territory to her howsoever barren that land may be, in spite of her peaceful efforts and friendly supplications. The result was that the Italian Dictator depending on his material power, the strength of his well organised army and his naval and air forces, as pired to win the independent African Kingdom of Abyssinia. He obtained what he spired for by force of iron and fire and conquered the whole of the Abyssinian Empire in spite of the loud talk of the nations that applied economic sanctions against her, especially her previous Ally, England. Japan, before Italy, cried and shed tears, saying, 'Millions of our people are homeless living on boats near shores, as there is not enough land in our islands for tnem to live on; our cul tivations are not enough to provide food for our hungry people. The sun never sets on your Empire. Have mercy and be kind to us, give us a piece of land in order that some of our people shall live thereon and cultivate.' No one would hear her, at last Japan left her peaceful policy with the nations, and with the might of her army occupied Manehukuo and never allowed any nation to interfere. She directed her interests as she wished. No one meddled with her. She declared openly that she was in need of China and China, in need of her.-3- C¥&lt; A proverb goes, ^useful light in the ho'ose should not be sacrificed even be it lor use in a temple. ,f A European kingdom has come to Asia and occupied a vast and the largest oriental kingdom, India. We are only two knots away from China. We keep quiet while another western power cones and takes China which is lir^e India, in i^s political attitude and its internal discord. We should blame ourselves for merely watching what is going on while our principle is 'Asia for the Asiatics.' ?he Rhineland was a German territory and was separated from Germany after the Great y&lt;ar, and occupied by the allied forces tor not a short Lime. It was evacuated by the allied forces, but Germany was denied the right of occupying it militarily, and it was thus made a demilitarized zone. How much Germany shouted that the Rhineland was a part of her country, and its population, Germans and that it should be allowed to join the union! She said 'We want peace, and the Rhineland is a part of our country.' No one would care for her$. At last, after she became prepared and her army organised she availed herself of an opportunity and occupied the Rhineland on the morning of a certain Saturday. The German army was ready to defend the honour of the Germans. None of the nations bestirred themselves except the French wiho made long protestations and certain other nations sent notes which now fill the files of the League and will later find their way into the waste basket. Accordingly our peaceful efforts to retake 4-4- retake Bahrain islands will not meet but with heedlessness and disregard. The Iranian Government should maintain her rights in Bahrain on the point of bayonet. Our rights are proved but our opponent tries to deny us these rights with his old intrigues. Vue are ready to prove to the world that we can protect our political interests with our military forces, and treat those who give us their backs whenever we ask for our rights in the same way. Today nobody can gainsay the rapid progress made during the reign of His Majesty Reza Shah Pahlavi in fifteen years. Our army can be com pared to any European army for its arms, knowledge and organisation. Our air force is next to^ Japan in Asia. Our navy is advancing year by year. Those who do not wish to recognise our rights will be forced to do so whether they wish or not. \le only ask them to give up their present attitude $ and recognise our rights, otherwise they shall be responsible for any unanticipated results.t- P-Z- l!&gt;% INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, ~zw&gt;ms Forwarded with the compliments of the Secretary, Political Department, India Office.

Separate articles.— Where a number of separate articles are included in one parcel or shipment, each and every article is to be considered separately in applying the percentage test. 10. Items which make up value. —The value of manufactured goods for preference purposes is to be taken to be their cost to the manufacturer at the factory or works and to include the following items:— , molasse is fixed a t in the St. fo. 3 Regmft e Import (see Apper: 50 per ceo: er finished idolites, st ; and cot Customs at (a) the cost to the manufacturer of materials as received into the factory, not including any Customs or Excise or other duty paid or payable in respect of such materials, which is subsequently refunded on the exportation of the finished goods , (b) manufacturing wages ; (c) factory overhead expenses, that is to say, expenses in respect of rent, rates and taxes, motive power, gas, fuel, water, lighting and heating of factory ; factory supervision, including wages and salaries of manager, foremen, time-keepers and watchmen; repairs, renewals and depreciation of plant, machinery and tools; interest on capital outlay on plant, machinery, tools and factory buildings ; Free States. 1932.

Tobacco and sugar. —Where the Board of Trade is satisfied ii regard to certain classes of goods to which the preferential rate apply that those articles are to a considerable extent manufactured \ in the British Empire from material which is not wholly grown 01 I produced in the Empire, that Board may by order direct that tbe [ preferential rate shall be charged only in respect of such proportioE of those goods as corresponds to the proportion of dutiable material used in their manufacture which is shown to have been grown or produced in the Empire. This provision has been applied by order of the Board of Tsdt (see Appendix III) to manufactured tobacco, refined sugar, mote and extracts from sugar, e.g. syrup. It is in view of this limitati that the percentage under paragraph 6 has been fixed as low as 5 per cent, for these articles, the combined effect of the two nil* being to allow preference where any of these articles are theresolti | an appreciable expenditure in respect of work done in the Bnta Empire, but to confine it to the extent to which the finished art** | is the result of Empire material. 14.

This provision applies to tobacco manufacturers who work in bond. Claims to Preference : Evidence of (1) Consignment and (2) Origin The preferential rate of duty must be claimed by the importer m writing at the time of making entry. ic Consignment.—The importer should be prepared to sub- stantiaSTclaration on the entry that the goods were cons.gned from the British Empire by the production of the bill of lading, supplier^ Invoke, bu/er’s order, or in any other way if called upon to do so by the Customs Officers. 16. Transhipped goods.-Where Empire goods consigned to the United Kingdom have been transhipped en route or have been shipped from a foreign port after overland transit from the Empire country of origin, the importer at the time of making entry will be required to produce the through bdl of lading or consignment note &lt;Ai the country of production to the United Kingdom. Where a through bill of lading or consignment note is not available, the buyer’s order, the invoice, local bill of lading or consignment note from the original point of origin, and a certificate of arrival or landing at and exportation from, the port of transhipment will be required. Such certificates are to be signed by the proper Colonial or foreign Customs Officer at the port of transhipment, and in the case of the latter the signature must be visaed by the British Consular authority. It is essential to prove that the goods were consigned from the Empire to the United Kingdom and not to a foreign country from which they were subsequently re-consigned to the United Kingdom. The condition as to consignment from the Empire is not fulfilled in the case of goods consigned from a foreign country through the Empire to the United Kingdom. 17. Origin. —As regards origin, the importer will normally be required to produce a certificate from the British overseas manu facturer (in the case of manufactured articles) or the grower, producer or supplier in the country of origin (in the case of growth or produce), supplemented, if that person is not the exporter, by an additional certificate from the latter. Certificates of Origin 18. Prescribed forms. —The prescribed forms of certificate of origin are illustrated in Appendix IV to this Notice. Each form comprises two separate certificates, viz.:— (i) A certificate that the dutiable articles in respect of which preference is claimed are wholly the growth or produce (Certifi cate D) or the manufacture or refining (Certificates E and F) of aspecified country in the British Empire.* This certificate mrJ be given, as regards Certificate D, by the overseas growl producer or supplier,! and as regards Certificate E by the ov seas manufacturer. In the case of goods to which the Boar3 Trade have applied the provision referred to in paragraph h above, viz., refined sugar, molasses and extracts from sugar or manufactured tobacco, the amplified certificate (Certifiii F), giving also the proportion of Empire-produced dutiabj! material, must be given by the overseas manufacturer or refiner (see also paragraph 19). - Where, owing to local trade conditions, it is impracticable for Certificates D to be signed by the up-country growers or producers, there is no objection to the certificates being signed by their accredited agents in the country of origin having the necessary knowledge of the facts, provided that (1) the certificate clearly shows that the agent is authorized to sign on behalf of the grower or producer, and (2) the certificate is a personal one signed by a responsible member of the issuing firm. This con cession does not extend to agents for suppliers, nor to agents merely as carrying agents. (ii) A supplementary certificate by the actual exporter in cases where the grower, producer, manufacturer, refiner or supplier, who furnishes Certificates D, E or F, is not himself or by his agent the actual exporter, and is not in the position to give the particulars as to place whence consigned, con signee, shipment and destination, which are required to render | the main certificate complete. This supplementary certificate J is not, however, required to be given on Certificates D, E and F, when the latter are given in conjunction only with Cer tificate FF (see paragraph 19) in which case its place is taken by a similar supplementary certificate on Certificate FF. 19. Composite goods. —An additional form of certificate (FF) is required in conjunction with Certificate D, E or F, where the dutiable article in respect of which preference is claimed is a component of a composite article. This additional certificate is to be given by the overseas manufacturer of the composite goods, as evidence that the dutiable articles, in respect of which preference is claimed and in respect of which certificate D, E or F has been furnished by the grower, etc., have been used in the manufacture of the composite * Where preference is claimed in respect of fish taken outside the territorial waters of an Empire country by boats of Empire ownership and registration, and consigned from the Empire to the United Kingdom, the Certificate D must be amplified to show that the fish in question was taken by boats owned and registered in the British Empire. f By the term ' supplier ' is meant any person who, though not being the grower or producer, is the actual overseas owner of the goods at the time of export to the United Kingdom, provided that he has the requisite knowledge of the facts. Such persons should be careful to describe themselves on the certificate as “ suppliers ” and not as “ exporters ” merely.A 3 (34353) ° n b ' respect of such duty ; in addition it is liable to the duty on condensed ™ PerS T °: milk under the Ottawa Agreements Act, 1932, and where preference , ] i s claimed in respect of that duty Certificate E must be given by the ° manufacturer of the condensed milk. ?pTtificate FF also contains a supplementary certificate to be given il expo: t he actual exporter where the manufacturer of the composite rer, refcg 00( j s w h 0 furnishes Certificate FF is not himself or by his agent, is not k t he actual exporter, and is not in a position to give the particulars as n the p t 0 place whence consigned, consignee, shipment and destination, which &gt;nsigned are required to render the Certificate FF complete. Where this ired to:. SU ppi eme ntary certificate is given on Certificate FF it is not to be aiy cengiven on the Certificate D, E or F relating to the dutiable components, tificates: it is to be noted that Certificates D, E and F are to be given in mly wit respect of the dutiable articles or components themselves, placer 20 . Goods containing more than one dutiable component. —If ate FF com p 0 site goods contain more than one dutiable component (e.g. ificate (icocoa and sugar in chocolates and confectionery) the appropriate re thedrCertificates D, E or F must be given separately in respect of each Dmponerdutiable component or proportion of a dutiable component for which : given ^preference is claimed, but one Certificate FF may be given to cover all lence tkdutiable components contained in one description of composite goods, [aimed ai^he preferential reduction of duty will be regulated accordingly. letheterof Customs and Excise is satisfied that the preference conditions md r egi~have been complied with, he will forthwith admit the goods to entry bv^b'^' aS preference.

As negotiations for a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom are about to conmenoe and are expected to be concluded by the end of July 1937, the Government of India do not now consider it worth while to extend the existing scheme of preferences to Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Trucial ohaikhdoma. it is possible, however, that the question of such preferences may have to be considered in connection with the new agreement, pnH the Government of India v^ouid therefor* be glad of your views on the following points, 3. Under rule 4 (1) of the Ottawa Trade Agreement Rules, (copy enclosed) an article in order to obtain preference must be consigned direct to India from the producing country named in the list. If therefore Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Trucial ■Via iithHemn are each mentioned in the list separately, it will mean • • •2 - mean that articles exported, for instance from the Shaikhdoms j^a Bahrain, will not be entitled to any preference. If necessary therefore it is proposed that the entry in any list of countries entitled to preference should be in the following form : 'Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf', (i.e # Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms). 4. The only article of any importance exported to India from the places concerned, ifchich would be entitled to preference under the Ottawa Agreement, is dates, which are imported annually to India from the Bahrain Island to the value of over Rs, lakhs, 'ifcese would be granted a 10 per cent preference, provided they were the actual produce of such places ( vide rule 4(2)(a) of the Ottawa Trade Agreement Rules), It would probably therefore be necessary to make some arrangement whereby dates which were entitled to preference under this rule isould be accompanied by a certificate of origin. It is suggested that this should be granted by the local authorities and countersigned by the political Agent concerned. It will however be a matter for serious consideration how far the Political Agents will feel themselves in a position to countersign such certificates of origin, having regard to the possibility that dates produced in other territories my be brought to Bahrain, etc., for shipment. This difficulty has been felt in respect of certain cosmodities imported from other Colonies, For example, it was found necessary entirely to refuse the benefit of the preferential rate of duty in the case of the copra imported from Penang owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the copra waA really the product of Malaya. Again, it was not found possible to apply the preferential tariff to coconut shipped from Penang or betel-nuts shipped from Kalantan until an assurance had been obtained from the local authorities concerned th*t there was not in fact any import trade in these commodities into these settlements from territories outside Malaya. The issue of the above has been authorised. Deputy Secretary to the Gov* it of India. (iMJMNo C/515-1. c;/i. Froffi Political Agency, Bahrain, the 4th July 19S7. Captain T.

Minister for Foreign Affaire informs me that the Persian ^mister on instructions from Tehran, called upon him and said that iiews haci re &amp;ched the Persian Government to tiie effect that it was the intention of the Shaikh of Bahrain shortly to visit Bagdad in order to discuss some questions of common interest with the Iraqi Government. Persian Minister stated that he was to inform the Minister i or Foreign Aflairs that his Government considered Bahrain to l e ar ^ tegral part of the Persian Empire and would hold the participation of the Iraqi Government in any such discussions io oe an act unbecoming in a friendly neighbour state. Minister for Foreign affairs replied that there was no truth in the report that the Shaikh of Bahrain was coming to Bagdad and that in any case the dispute between the Persian Government and His Majesty’s Government about Bahrain was not one in which the Iraqi Government had any concern. I told the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, inasmuch as the Iraqi Government were conscripting Bahrainis on the ground that they were ex-Ottoman subjects, thought that his reply might have gone a little further.

As negotiations for a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom are about to commence and are expected to be concluded b y the end of July 1937, the Government of India do not now consider it worth while to extend the existing scheme of prefe rences to Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Trucial Shaikhdoms. It is possible, however, that the question of such preferences may have to be considered in connection with the new agreement, and the Government of India would therefore be glad Of your views on the following points. 3. Under rule 4(l) of the Ottawa Trade Agreement Rules, vcopy enclosed) an article in oraer to obtain preference must be consigned direct to India Irom the producing country named in the list. If therefore Bahrain, Kuwait and the Trucial Sh&amp;ikh- doms are each mentioned in the list separately, it will mean that articles exported, for instance from the Trucial Shaikhdoms via Bahrain, will not be entitled to any preference. If necessary therefore it is proposed that the entry in any list of countries entitled to preference should be in the following form: 'Arab Littoral of the Persian Gulf', (i.e. Bahrain, Kuwait, and the Trucial Shaikhdoms). 4. The only article of any importance exported to India fromthe places concerned, which would be entitled to preference under the Ottawa Agreement, is dates, which are imported annually to India from the Bahrain Island to the value ol^ks.li lakhs. These would be granted a 10 per cent preference, provided they were the actual produce of sucn places ( vide Buie 4(2)(a) of the Ottawa Trade Agreement Rules). it would probably therefore be necessary to make some arrangement whereby dates which were entitled to preference under this rule would be accompanied by a certificate of origin. It is suggested that this should be granted by the local authorities and countersigned by the Poli tical Agent concerned. It will however be a matter for serious consideration how far the Political Agents will feel themselves in a position to countersign such certificates of origin, having regard to the possibility that dates produced in other territories may be brought to Bahrain, etc., for shipment. This difficulty has been felt in respect of certain commodities imported from other Colonies, For example, it was found necessary entirely to refuse the benefit of the preferential rate of duty in the case ol the copra imported from Penang owing to the difficulty of ensuring that the copra was really the product of Malaya,. Again, it was not found possible to apply the preferential tariif to coco nut shipped from Penang or betel-nuts shipped from Kalantan until an assurance had been obtained from the local authorities con cerned that there was not in fact any import trade in these com modities into these settlements from territories outside Malaya. The issue of the above has been authorised. (Sd.) Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. (Copy)Bahrain, the 28th October 1939. From H.

Thus, once again, there was a connection between Persia and the Bahrain islands, but this time it was a very tenuous one. This shadowy Persian authority was terminated by the Portuguese during the first quarter of the XVIth century. The Portuguese hold over the Bahrain islands lasted until 1602, when 3hah Abbas ^I succeeded in establishing his authority over them? Bahrain remained for rather more than a centurv part of the Jafavi empire. Barly in 1718 the Arabs of Muscat took advantage of the growing weakness of the Jafavi state to descend upon Bahrain but Persian control was temporarily re=established in the following year. The Arabs, however, equipped a further expedition and once more ousted the Persians.

Great Britain’s snecial connection with Bahrain began in 1820, when Shaikh Sulaiman Inn A,.mad a! naalifa, as one of the signatories of the genera., treaty for the pacification of the Persian Gulf, entered into treaty relations with her. Shaikh Sulaiman’s grandson Muhammad concluded a further treaty with the Company in 1^:47 for the suppression of slavery. In 1861 the conclusion of the Perpetual Treaty of Peacre and Frie rid ship between Great Britain and Bahrain resulted in the latter becoming an independent AT»ab State under British protection. io sum up, it will be seen that Persia has, during the last seventeen centuries, had Bahrain intermittently ' in her possession for some 570 years. It is‘to be noted however, that over 350 of these years belong to the pre- Muhammadan era, and that there is, apparently, no concrete evidence available to show that Persian authority was absolute throughout the Period of Sasanian occupation. In more recent times, Persia cannot be said to have exercised effective rule for more than 167 years in the aggregate, and it is now over 160 years since she last he Id'the islands.

The communication, which was Jddressed by the “Freedom Front Association of demociatic Iranian newspapers on behalf of the Iranian people, claims Iran's legitimate right o the islands which form an inalien able part of Iran and for many years served as the object of British ag gression.” The 'Freedom Front” resolutely demands discontinuation by Britain of “unlawful interference into the affairs of Bahrein islands.” It is further gathered that the Freedom Front” has also urged the Sultaneh Government of Persia to refer this problem for consideration by the UNO Assembly and assured | bim of the support of entire Iranian People on this matter.
