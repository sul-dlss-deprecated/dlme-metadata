Hamid bln Buti, maternal uncle of the Shaikh of Abur ^^habi, recently visited Sharjah to make peace with the Beni 6 itab but left on the 3rd 3ept©nber as Shaikh Muhammad bin Ali bin Huwaidin, Chief of the Beni Qitab, did not come to Sharjah to meet him. It appears that Shaikh Rashid, eldest son of the ohaikh of Dubai, recently had a secret meeting in the desert with Shaikh Muhammad and extracted a pledge from him that the Beni Qitab would not make a separate peace with Abu Dhabi. He also supplied the latter with rifles, ammunition ready cash, and provisions. (ii) This agreement was followed by a raid wiiich a body of the Shaikh of Dubai's forces made in conjunction with the Beni Qitab in Abu Dhabi territory. The villages of Sijya and xviqi were attacked, 100 camels looted, and one Manasiri and one Amiri tribesman killed.■Abu Dafrbi-Dubai Camel Dispute Last October the Sheikh of Dubai sent an armed expedition to capture Xhor Ghanadhah, which lies in disputed territory between Abu Dahbi and Dubai - see sketch map at flag X, The Sheikh of Dubai was, however, persuaded by the Political Agent to withdraw and the Sheikh of Abu D^ibi to promise not to take reprisals. In January this year some fifty armed men from Dubai with the knowledge of the Sheikh looted about 100 camels from Abu Dc^ibi. The Sheikh having refused to return them unless ordered to do so,and the giving of such an order being contrary to our policy in camel disputes, the Political Agent stopped travel facilities for Dubai subjects indefinitely. The Political Resident considered that the risk that this might lead the Sheikh to interfere with the B.O.A.C., the R.A.P. or P.C.L. was small, but must be taken. Later the Sheikh of Dubai deployed 1,000 armed men in the desert to guard the camels and tried by bribery to detach Abu Ds^ibi supporters from their loyalty. The stoppage of ' traffic facilities made the Sheikh of Dubai anxious to make peace and restore the camels (whose upkeep was costly) but Abu D^ibi refused to take them back. The Sheikhs of Sharjah and Ras al Khaimah were asked to mediate, but had no success. Diversion of mail steamers and tea and sugar supplies was the next sanction applied, and, this too having failed, the Political Agent informed the Sheikh of Dubai that he would not be protected if attacked by the superior Abu D^hbi forces. Next day, the Sheikh gave in and, after prevarication and haggling, a settlement was reached, for which Colonel Hay gives a great deal of credit to Colonel Galloway. The dispute is now considered closed and normal facilities to Dubai have been restored. /Froir.

I have the honour to refer to this Residency Printed Letter iNio. 18S-S, d ated the 5th Feb ruary 1946, and to report that a settlement of the dispute mentioned above has been effected. 2. Larly in February the Political Agent, Bahrain, reported that the Ruler of Dubai had deployed 1000 armed men under his son, Shaikh Rashid, in hie desert to guard the looted camels, and to meet any counter measures by the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. The stoppage of travel facilities to inhabitants of Dubai caused the notables of the Principality to approach the ohaikh to effect a settlement and he expressed himself willing to resort to the normal tribal procedure for settlement namely, arbitration, and requested the ohaikhs of Sharjah and Ras ai Khaimah to mediate. 3. it became apparent soon after that the shaikh of Dubai was not sincere in his attitude, that he vjas plotting against the shaikh of Abu Dhabi, and that he had spent some Rs. 17 ,000 in bribes to this end. Further pressure was therefore considered neces ary and this was applied by the diversion of mail steamers from the port of Duoai and the transference to Sharjah of the tea and sugar supplies for the Trucial Coast. As this action failed to have the desired result the Political Agent informed the ohaikh of Dubai that since he had gone back on his word no further action would be taken to protect his interests in the event of a direct attack on him by the shaikh of Abu Dhabi’s superior forces. This, coupled with the earlier measures, had the desired effect, and the next day he sent his son with a draft for Rupees two lakhs to be paid as compensation to the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, offered to withdraw his forces and to return the looted camels and begged for the Political Agent’s assistance in effecting a settlement. With the assistance of the ohaikh of umm al Q,uwain, who served as mediator, the parties were brought together by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, and after some haggling over details, during which the Political Agent found it necessary to inform the ohaikh of Duoai that he would not permit the introduction of any fresh issues, a settlement was finally effected. The armed forces of the two parties have been withdrawn and arrangements are in tram for the handing over of the looted camels. The diversion of mail steamers from i;ubai has been cancelled and i have authorised the Political Agent, Bahrain, to restore travel facilities to Dubai. / 4.4* i consider that Colonel Calloway showed much tact and patience m/handling of this dispute and that he is to De congratulated on its satisfactory settlement. 5. i am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India. i have the honour to be, d ir.

DUBAI-ABU DHABI BOUNDARY DISPUTE. During the night of the 17th of October Shaik Rashid, son of the Shaikh of Dubai, occupied Khor Ghanadhah with about 300 armed men. Many of these were carried by sea and they brought with them large quantities of building material and shov/ed every intention of building a fort which would coinmand the Khor. As in the other Trucial Coast States, the boundary between the shaikdoms of Dubai and Abu Dhabi has never been defined and while negotiations between these two were nearing a conclusion in 1937 G-hanadhah was not included in the Shaikh of Dubai* s most extreme claim. His son* s act therefore, apart from being a breach of the treaty with His Majesty* s Government of 1853 - which forbade aggression by sea - war a Hitlerian attenpt to present Government and the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi with a fait accompli. The visits of the Assistant Political Agent and of the Political Agent to the Trucial Coast recorded in the first paragraph of this summary were made as a result of this move. The Assistant Political Agent reported that the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi was preparing, by calling in his tribal supporters, to meet force with force, and it seemed no improbable that hostilities, perhaps ultimately involving every shaikhdom on the coast, were imminent. Acting on instructions from the Hon*ble the Political Resident the Political Agent demanded from the Shaikh of Dubai that he withdraw his forces forwith from G-hanadhah. This demand was complied with on the 29th of October and the status quo restored; at the same time a promise was extracted from the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi that he would not take any retaliatory action. The whole incident had for its causes the Shaikh of Dubai*s greed for more territory inspired by his belief in impending oil development, and the ability to exploit that greed which his recently acquired wealth - obtained by the war profiteering of his subjects - has afforded him.compliments to '^The Secretary of State for India, India Office, London.

In reply I have written that I am referring matter to you. 3. I visited Shaikh of Dubai on 24th and pointed out that he was inviting Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to retaliate and was endangering peace of desert. The Shaikh did not, of course, admit organising raid but admits that venture ?was carr ied out by his people and that he has camels in his keeping. He said he could not restrain his Bedouins because of provocations ?from Abu Dhabi. This statement is not according to facts as we believe them to be and I am sure the Shaikh is continuing in his inimical attitude to incite Abu Dhabi. By end of interview the Shaikh agreed to return camels if I ordered him to do so but not repeat not of his own free will. He maintained this attitude on 26th. A. • • • •4 V»e do not normally interfere with camel looting incidents and I have declined to order the return of loot. It is, however, diff icult completely to separate this case from that of Khor Ghanadhah and I suggest, therefore, that I am authorised to inform Shaikh Said that this latest incident is a violation of his undertaking, vide enclosure to my Printed Letter No. C/1049 dated November 6th 1945, and for this reason and because of his violation of Treaty at Khor Ghan adhah in October last I am directed to inform him that all travel facilities for his subjects are being withheld sine die . At the same time I would add that we expect him to settle this and any fut ure incidents arising from raids in normal tribal manner. 5. I should give Abu Dhabi to under stand so also. part of Shaikh of Dubai that may result from act ion proposed by you be likely to interfere with likely that Shaikh would interfere with unloading of ships via Dubai creek and same applies to B.O.A.C. operations in creek.

Subject: Tmcial Coast Possibility of hostilities between Sheikhs of Dibai and dbi j) • foi it!, regard to Ghanadhah The Political Resident’s telegram of 2Sth October below reports the possibility of hostilities between the Sheikhs of Dibai and Abu^habi arising out of the action of the former sending an armed force of 300 men to Glianadhah which lies in territory claimed by both Sheikhs, but to which Abu^habi has probably a more justifiable-claim (see sketch map below). Article 1 of the llaritime Truce Treaty of 1853 ; v^iich v/as signed by all the Trucial Chiefs, runs as follows - 'That from this date, viz. 4th May 1853? and hereafter ; there shall bejconplete cessation of hostilities at sea between our respective subjects and dependants, and a perfect maritime truce shall endure between ourselves and between our , * successors/ (26020) Wt.88611/P.141 6,000 10/48 A.4E.W.Ltd.

In the last paragraph of his telegram the Political Resident mentions that it might be necessary to use force in the last resort if the Sheikhs prove recalcitrant, The usual manner in riiich we have in the past applied force in this area has been by bombardment^ or threat of bombardment^ by naval sloop. * 7&lt;r 4 / • ?/</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3828</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00018c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3828</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/105(1) 'Trucial Coast.
