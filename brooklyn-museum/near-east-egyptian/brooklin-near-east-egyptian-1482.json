Three lines of Greek inscribed below. \r\nThe stela is purely Greek with no Egyptian influence whatever and may well have been set up by a Greek temporarily resident in one of the Greek cities in the Delta. Alexandria is a possible find spot for the piece. The piece was probably of excellent quality judging by the scant remains and presents in its simple background and realistic treatment of the draperies a strong contrast to Egyptian work. \r\nCondition: Extremely bad. Due to the great height of the reliefs the surfaces of each figure are almost entirely destroyed. Nothing can be recognized of the features and of the draperies only the details above the feet are preserved. Edges chipped. \r\n\r\n \r\n", "medium": "Marble", "dimensions": "9 5/8 \u00d7 2 5/16 \u00d7 19 in.
