(5) The threat ultimately implied to the security of supplies elsewhere, notably to Europe* is however countered to a great extent by the very high promise of the petroliferous areas in the Middle East where the developed and undeveloped reserves are so considerable that they may eventually have a marked effect on the period of sufficiency referred to at (2) above# (6) The fulcrum of the world’s export market, hitherto established in the Y/est by virtue of the preponderance of surplus American resources* may therefore be expected to shift to the Middle East at no distant date, possibly within one decade; almost certainly within two.

(1) From time to time since the conclusion of the last war various geologists have endeavoured to estimate the world’s exploitable reserves of natural oil, particularly in the U.S.A. which, so far, has held the predominant position amongst producing countries. Many of the earlier estimates which tended to take a very despondent view of the outlook, have been entirely falsified by later discoveries and there has consequently been ”a disinclination on the part of many to trust the common Anticipation of a coming shortage of oil, a disbelief which gains w strength from the large potential over-production at the present ’’day”. / (2) However, during the last 12 to 15 years there has been world wide activity in the search for new oil areas, and this search has been greatly aided by a steady advance in scientific knowledge and engineering technique. Exploration and exploitation have alike proceeded apace, and hypothesis has in many cases been either confirmed or disproved. Knowledge has advanced its frontiers. (3) The range of actual and potential discovery is still doubtless very great, but the statistical approach to the question of world’s reserves involves less speculation and conjecture than in earlier days; and a correspondingly increased significance can therefore be attached to the view that (a) World reserves of oil will, v/ithin a few decades, begin to prove inadequate to world demands and the effect of a prospective shortage will be felt internationally long before the situation becomes acute. 0 (b) Those countries will first feel that effect - to a greater or less extent according to their degree of industrialism - which possess neither indigenous resources nor the means to control supplies from producing areas under their influence. (c) The undeveloped resources of (l) the U.S.S.R. and (2) the MIDDLE EAST, are of exceptional magnitude and may therefore be expected to play an increasingly important part in world policy. (4) The purpose of this memorandum will be sufficiently served without recourse to a mass of statistics, or to elaborate quotations from geological sources, but one statement is attached which furnishes certain figures relating to the main producing areas, and their contribution to world market exports, during the 18 years preceding the present war period. Reference to certain of these figures will be made later. / Dr. G.M. Lees. ’’The Search for Oil”. Geographical Journal January 1940. 0 So far as g^)logical views are concerned the writer has recently had the Opportunity of discussing the subject with Dr. Lees - a geologist of wide experience, who has given much attention to the subject of world reserves. On the basis of a purely arithmetical equation Dr. Lees considers that the time/reserve ratio might be as high as 8 to 10 decades. This estimate, though greatly in excess of, and therefore much more encouraging than, most of those hitherto current, in no way vitiates the general argument and conclusions of this memorandum v/hich are based on the extreme geographical disparity between needs and resources.4 1 (5) On the_geological sidej a brief survey of the facts and prospects v/i 11 best assist to put the world position in its proper perspective. In large'outline this can best be done by taking each concinent oex^aracely. Three of the five continents have entirely inadequate oil resources; two are fortunate. ( 6 ) AFRICA. There is only one oil producing area (EGYPT) and that of relatively little consequence, in the whole of Africa. Such geological and exploratory work as has been done elsewhere — mostly in the coastal provinces — has been very disanpointinp*. Actual drilling, in such widely scattered zones as Portuguese nast, Uganda and Angola, has proved abortive; and prolonged and expensive efforts in FREKCH MOROCCO have produced very little oil or evidence of more to come. Some possibilities have yet to be teste m Nigeria and tne Gold Coast, but there is no expectation of large scale results. Most oi the African interior is excluded on grounds of geological age. Sven allowing for the fact that the history of oil is full of surprises, there is no optimism in geological regarding the T^rospects of this continent. discovery circles ( ? ) AUSTRALASIA The same remark holds good of Australasia with the possible exception of PAPUA, where extensive research is being undertaken by certain of the major oil groups. AUSTRALIA itself has seen the flotation of many small and speculative oil concerns, mostly inadequately financed or technically equipped. Apart from small oil deposits nothing as so -l ar been discovered, and the investing public, on whose money and credulity many of these concerns have heavily drawn, 1 S / q n0 I / further enterprise. The exploratory work so far undertaxen by major oil groups has apparently failed to give such positive evidence as would justify the expense of further expenditure on drilling. Similarly, in NEW ZEALAND, although small oil deposits have A( en fctually worked, and an important oil group is now engaged i • ?f : f'l ora 't or .y drilling, the prospects of discovery, even on the limited scale necessary to make New Zealand self-supporting, do not seem hopeful.

It is5 © © 7 believed there is no present reason for assuming that it is inspired by political motives- As to the nature of the Russian reserves in Europe and Asia, which are known to be very great, the following extract from “The Search for Oil” is of interest:- 'The bulk of both present and past Russian ’’production has come from the European side, but the ■’possible future resources for both European and ’’Asiatic U.S.S.R, are immense. Garfias has given 'the ■ proved reserves as 700 million tons, but Gubkin ’’has published estimates far in excess of this. He 'gives a possible total, i 9 e. proved plus possible, of ”6376 million tons, and while this may be over optimistic there is no question of the importance for the future ”of the oil reserves of the U.S. S.R.”m At the present time there is known to be a very considerable lag between the ever increasing home industrial demand (which, in 1938, was within measurable distance of that of the whole of the rest of Europe) and the technical capacity of the Russian oil control to meet it; and this state of affairs may continue for a long time to come. According to a well informed technical publication / this is ascribable to wide spread technical and administrative inefficiency qualified throughout by 'amateurishness and a policy of drift'. It is certainly in no sense due to any lack of physical resources. Indeed, assuming the above quoted reserve estimates are not much wide of the mark and even allowing for a very large expansion in internal consumption, the oil reserves, if mainly conserved for internal use, are likely long to outlast those of the U.S.A. It is not necessary to stress the great advantages that would then accrue to the U.S. S..R., industrially and politically, in competition with countries faced with an ever increasing penury in this vital raw material; nor to exclude some degree of suspicion as to the manner in which she might exploit them. All this is, of course, conjectural, but it seems clear that, the manner in which the U. S. S..R. will eventually co-operate, or fail to co-operate, in meeting external demands have a considerable bearing on the period during which aggregate world reserves will suffice to meet aggregate world demands.

October 1940.6 $ % s situation is precarious, partly through gradual exhaustion of the exploited areas, partly through a rigid and unimaginative mineral legislation policy. The eventual development of State lands hitherto unexploited may, for a time, tend to counterbalance the decline^elsewhere, but there is reason to think that production may have passed its peak. A gradual decline is rather to be expected and consequently a steady decrease in exportable surplus, which, even in 1938, only represented about 5&gt;i of the world’s import demand. Elsewhere in Europe there seems little chance of large scale discovery. The oilfields of GALICIA are declining steadily, with little prospect of any compensatory discoveries. P,mn 1 1 rvi 1 fM rl c?

The search for oil continues in the UNITED KINGDOM but, notwithstanding one or two interesting discoveries, it would be rash to assume that any considerable contribution to British needs is likely to be forthcoming.

The future outlook of the American hemisphere is dominated hy the position ot the U*SoAoj ™ 'by far the greatest producer and greatest consumer in the world. From the statement attached it will 'be seen that (a) UoS.A, production* keeping pace with UoSoA, has practically doubled in the last 18 years. consumption* (h) U 080 A 0 production in 1938 represented about 60% consumption about 53% of the world aggregate. 09 (c) U.S.A, exports in the same year were about 25 of the world’s import demand* but only 13% of the national production. So far as (a) is concerned* there is some ground for assuming that U.SoAo consumption w r ill not continue to increase greatly in the future* since* - taking the automobile industry alone as a criterion - the country would appear to be in the entirely unique position of approaching the high level of potential demand; indeed* should there be need for national oil economy* there are probably many services which might turn to other sources of heat and power with little economic disadvantage® But assuming the- .maintenance of consumption at no higher level than its present level (about 15- million tons yearly) it is clear that the country must command huge natural reserves to satisfy such a demand indefinitely. It is just on this point that assurance is lacking. In a recent estimate Garfias (already mentioned) estimated the proved U.S.A. reserves on 1st January 1939 as two thousand million tons (say 13 years). Three thousand million tons had already been expended. 'Notwithstanding past errors' states Dr. Lees/ there is no doubt on the part of all responsible 'American oil geologists* and my own study of the situation 'adds confirmation* that the bulk of American oil has already 'been discovered'. Later on* he states 'The proved reserves 'of the United States have been estimated at 12 years supply 'at the present rate* but new discoveries can be expected to 'extend this to twenty or thirty years or perhaps even longer* 'A decline in total production from the great oilfields of the 'States* is* however* in sight within a measurable number of 'years* and a realisation of this fact is responsible for the 'recent intensification by American interests of the search for 'oil supplies elsewhere in the world'. The opinion®of many other geological authorities could be quoted in general support of this view. Considerations of this nature have already led to demands for certain measures of c onservation and it is possible that these demands will in a very few years gather such momentum as to lead to national legislation. The obvious sources for meeting any eventual deficit in U.S.A. production are the major oilfields of MEXICO* VENEZUELA and COLOMBIA* which the U.S.A. has done so much to develop. It will be seen from the statement attached that these three countries (which are not highly industrialised) exported about 80% (28 million tons) of their total 1933 production. / 'The Search for Oil'.

The countries comprising the areas to which, from an oil point of view, supreme importance must be attached fall into two groups, viz:--9- (1) Those which are known to he extremely rich in oil deposits 9 viz;- Iran I rag.

Geological knowledge of the country is not so far advanced as in Iran, since the concessions have been held for a much shorter period. The only exploited structure (Kirkuk), which is of quite exceptional size, is believed to contain something in the order of 1000 million tons; other structures are, however, known to exist in Mosul; structures so far examined in the ex-vilayet of Baghdad, west of the Tigris, have been proved to contain large quantities of a very viscous and, sulphurous oil, which eventual development of refining technique may render a valuable asset; hopes are also entertained of new discoveries of a more suitable type. The Basra area, - of which high hopes are entertained, - is still in the early stages of exploration. An assessment of the total oil resources of Iraq involves more speculation than in the case of Iran; but it is known that, in certain informed quarters, the belief is held that these resources are second only to those of Iran and are of almost comparable magnitude. As in the case of Iran, the level of actual production to date has been determined by market demands, and bears no relation to potential output. (14) S.W.IiITTOEAL OF PBBSIAJ'T GUTJ (aITD ARABIA ). Various oil groups have been active in recent years in examining this littoral, and discoveries already made support the view that the oil prospects, taken collectively, are of an extremely high order, though not as great as those of Iraq. Three separate groups have been active, and successful, in their researches on this coast, notably in the Sheikhdoms of Koweit, Bahrein and Qatar, and in the Saudi Arabian province of Rasa. In each of these areas large structures have been drilled and highly productive wells successfully ’'brought in'. i Apart from Bahrein (where production seems now stabilised at about 1,000,000 tons per annum) development in all these areas is still in its infancy, but eventual production on a high scale is assured. Many other districts (not excluding submarine coastal areas) which await examination will possibly add their quota to the output of this great oil zone./ 2 &gt; - 11 - ConGessionary rie^hts are (it is ‘believed exclusively) in tbe bands of tbree separate oil groups vizi— I RAQ PETR OLEUM COMPAN Y INT'SHSBIG .

It will thus be seen that British, French and American interests are all represented by these several groups, Americans alone being concerned in all three. The prospects of the Red Sea Littoral of Saudi Arabia (where concessions are held by I.P.C. interescs) are not regarded as very promising. (14) If the above review of Middle East reserves be accepted as substantially accurate, it is logical to conclude that the effects of a gradual diminuation of American exporcs need not be greatly feared, since by an easy calculation (vide statement; it is demonstrable that such reserves would suffice quantitatively to meet the import needs of all other countries, and paroicu-ar^y of Europe, for - a very large number of years to come, even on an increased level of consumption. (15) Turning now to those countries referred to onpage 8 as of supplementary importance (Turkey, Syria, Palestine an Transjordan), whilst their oil resources may not be relatively great it is difficult to over-emphasise their future value to Europe and especially to Great Britain, as a briagehea ^ western markets and the major oilfields of the East, - the role of Turkey in this connection being policical rather ha physical.

Please refer to Prior f s derai-official letter Ho.18 (OQP/12/2/41) t dated the 12th December 1941. I enclose a copy of a revised note on the Bahrain Petroleum Company prepared by Alban. It will be noted that the last sentence of paragraph 2 (a) of the original note has been entirely omitted. 3* The position regarding the rights of the British Government in war time has been examined by Alban ana in this office. These rights are defined in paragraph 9 of the Political Agreement with the Company ana Articles 1 and 2 of the Schedule attached to the Agreement* and are as fo Hows»- (a) To take over at an agreed price all the crude oil and all the products thereof ( Art. (1) ). (b) To take over control of the works* plant and premises of the Company subject to payment of compensation for any loss or damage to the aforesaid works* plant and premises ( Art. (2) ). (c) To require the Company to produce oil fuel according to Admiralty specifications to the extent of their refining capacity ( Art.l (i) ). (d) To require the Company to increase* as far as is possible with existing facilities* the wkpply of oil ana/or products thereof to the extent re quired ( Art.l (ii) ).

(e) To require the Company to conform to and obey all directions leaned by or on behalf of His Majesty’s Govermaent ( Art, 2). 4. In order to enforce these rights it would be necessary to issue under Article 2 of the Persian Gulf States (JSfljergency) Order in Council, 1939, a King^s Regula tion based on Regulation 55 of the Defence Regulations (Great Britain) 1939, 5. It will be seen from the above that we can take over the whole or any part of the Company’s production of crude and/or products thereof at an agreed price arid we can require them to increase the production of these ae far as existing plant will allow. We can also control the plant , premises, etc., although the ownership would remain with the Company and we can issue orders to the Company which they will carry out as far as possible. The agreement does not, however, appear to give us the right to orcer the Company to instal additional plant to produce 95 - 100 octane fuel, as conteiaplated by paragraph 2 (a) but the Company in revising the note have not offered any comments on paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) and it seems likely therefore that they would not eefuso to instal the special plant if required to do so. We could presumably also, if we wished, enact legislation to give us any powers we require which are not covered by the Agreement, compare Article 55(4) of the Defence Regulations (Great Britain) 1939. I have asked Hickinbotham to bring the note on the Kuwait Oil Company up-to-date and will write to you further on the subject when I hear from him. 7# I am sending a copy of this letter ano its enclosure to Prior, arid without its enclosure to Wakefield.KUWAIT POTROL A 3TD OIL * ©il. In January 1934 the Kuwait Oil Company was formed Uy agreement 'between the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. and the ^ynerican Gulf Oil Co. The control of the Company is on a 50% basis but by the terms of the agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company British control is ensured. This is satisfactory as the oilfields in Kuwait are strategically well placed in that naval dispositions to protect the present source of supply in South Iran would in a large measure afford, protection to the sources of supply in Kuwait. Further Kuwait would be a convenient alternative requiring little diversion of shipping or change in protective dispositions should the A.I.O.C output from Abadan be interrupted. Early in 1935 the Shaikh granted a concession to the Company which covered the whole of Kuwait territory. Drilling was first commenced in May 1936 at Bahra, on the northern shore of Kuwait Bay, but this was abandoned after drilling had been carried without results to an approximate depth of 8,000 feet. A second well was commenced at Burgan, 30 miles south of Kuwait, in October 1937 and 011 was struck in February, both the quality and pressure being good. The present situation (January 1942) is that there are, in the Burgan area 8 completed and sealed wells, and a nin|th is being drilled. Prospects for oil development are, therefore, definitely good. There is a^sket no refinery or oil pipe laid; the Company have built a small jetty at Shuwaikh two and a half miles west of Kuwait Town, where there is a water pumping station. Other developments of the Company are the Oil Personnel Camp at Magwa, 12 miles south of Kuwait, and buildings in the town at both of which the accommodation is to be increased. Water for Magwa is pumped through a pipe line from Shuwaikh and storage tanks have been erected there. At present all petrol or oil required must be imported. Motor spirit for use by the Kuwait Oil Company is brought in barges from Abadan and stored at Shuwaikh in three 12,000 gallon tanks.( 3 ^ qQMffiMim.

Political Resident, at Bahrain. Government of India, New Delhi. ‘X correction received 28th November 1943. Proposals have recently been under discussion here at high level regarding development of oil supplies in Middle East. Plans have already been formulated in itmerica for development of oil fields there to highest capacity and it has now become matter of urgent necessity in face of change in war situation to con sider as complementary measure opening up more crude oil production in Iraq Persia and Persian Gulf. Factors concerned are growth of needs of Pacific and Indian Ocean areas, requirements of occupied areas of Europe as these are freed and easier to movement of oil from Middle East through Meditterranean. 2. Following schemes have now been approved in principle here for joint consideration of Washington in regard to supply and priority of equipment in following order of priority. (i) Drilling of Agha Jara field in Persia and linking with abadan refinery which will represent additional supply of four million tons crude oil per annum. (ii) Laying of second pipe line from Kirkuk to Haifa with capacity of three million tons. (iii) Resumption of field development at Qatar. 3. xis regards (iii) Petroleum Concessions Limited have put forward proposal for resuming development of operations. Original drilling rig now stored at Karachi cannot be satisfactorily reconditioned in absence of workshop facilities at Qatar and Company wishes to order three new deilling rigs in U.S.a. to enable them to run continuous two rig programme at Qatar. Shaikh will no doubt welcome proposal but he should not be informed of it at present stage. 4. Instructions have been approved for issue through Mideast and PaIC permitting relaxation v/here necessary of denial measures including permission for Bahrain Petroleum Company to prepare well sites to facilitate installation of drilling equipment and general preparations to minimise delay once sanction received to return wells to production.

The Hon’ble the Political resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire• Sir I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter No*C/PA~121 dated the 3rd February 1944 which I have received from the Chief Local representative of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 2 * I understand that this matter has been under consideration for some time but the enclosed communication is the first indi cation which I have r eceived that agreement has been reached between the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company. Provided the pipeline lies within the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s leased area I can see no objection to the proposal, but I have not had time to study my records and discover whether any mention of this project has occurred before . As the matter is of some urgency and as the mail is due to leave to-morrow morning I am not delaying these papers to do so. 3* Provided you see no objection 1' propose to acquaint the Bahrain Government with this proposal and suggest that their Land Department should examine the route to be followed by the pipeline with a view to determining whether or not it is in fact upon land lying within the Concession area.

His Britannic Ilajesty r s Political Agent, The Agency, panama, Bahrain . Bear 3ir, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and California Arabian Standard Oil Company have agreed to construct an oil pipe line from the coast of Saudi Arabia to the refine^ of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited in Bahrain (the approxi mate route of the pipe line is indicated on the attached sketch), provided that the critical materials required for the project can be obtained from the United States. The necessary appli cation for the critical materials has been filed with the appropriate agencies of the United States Government in ' ashington, D.C. to supplement the crude production in Bahrain so as to ensure the continuous operation of the Bahrain refinery to the required capacity is a matter of critical importance, and especially so during the present world conflict. As you know the Bahrain refinery is being enlarged so that increasing amounts .of crude oil will be required to be transported to Bahrain. I.orever varying amounts of crude oil may be demanded on short notice to meet the rabidly changing requirements during the present conflict. Under such conditions the proposed pipe line is the most practicable solution of transportation problem. Accordingly, if the pending application to the United States authorties is approved, so that the critical materials for the proposed pipe line can be obtained, this Company and California Arabian Standard Oil Company propose to employ the same contractor to construct the pipe line, with the understanding that the expense involved will be shared by the two Companies, /and The transportation of the crude oil from Saudi Arabiaand with the further* understanding that the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited will own that portion of the pipe line lying within the area covered by its lining Lease and California Arabian Standard Oil Company will own that portion of the pipe line lying within the area covered by its concession. ihe ^oute of the proposed pipe line, as indicated on atO'Cnec the^sketch, has been selected not only from the view point of ohe snor i.6£ t. distance so as to use the least amount of brit*cal materials but also from the viewpoint of constructing the nine line over uncultivated lands which the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited now has theright to occupy: if, however, the pipe line should cross any lands for which the said Company i;® requirea to pay compensation the Company is preoared to oav such compensation. i he Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited is taking the liberty of supplying the India Office of tti s Majesty's Govern ment in London with several copies of this letter and attached sketch, in order that all interested parties may be informed of the proposed project with the least delay. California Arabian Standard Oil Company also informs us that it is con veying similar Information to the Government of Saudi Arabia.

This Government believes that it'may be found desirable to extend scope of conversations beyond a discussion of problems of Kiddle Bast oil but that a determination of v/hether that should be done, and to v/hat extent, can be made best in the light of progress of itsjdiJcussion of original Kiddle Bast oil. desire for some indication of aspects of question which this Government believes should oe discussed, there follows a teptativeiist of general topics which it is believed could be profitably covered in conversation. ( 1 ) Interests of producing and consuming countries in Kiddle Bast petroleum (2) The quantity 7 of Kiddle Bast oil that should flow into post war world mar Bets. (3) Existing ? precedents to proposed ^reduction. (4) Transport problems. (5) Concession rights. (6) Trice and marketing policies.

Unless there have been any recent developments of which we are unaware, it seems improbable that the Sheikh has changed his mind and is now ready to discuss the Neutral Zone concession. As regards our attitude to a visit by Holmes, I think the situation remains as it was last September, Y/e have no objection to his visiting Kuwait and have ascertained that the Political Resident is agreeable, but we still feel it would be difficult to justify support for an application for an air passage on his behalf. If the Company could show that he was engaged, on work connected with the war effort, it would be different.

Dear Peel, 'Then we received your letter of January 28th we were in full agreement with your views that the position was not such as to justify the grant of a return air passage for Major Holmes to. Kuwait. Since then, however, there has been an announcement in the press about a new hrabian pipeline project to be undertaken by the U.S. Government. As this is likely to involve Kuwait as well as Saudi Arabia, we are particularly anxious to get some first-hand information regarding the reactions of the rulers in that part of the world to this project, together with an indication of any more detailed negotiations w?hich the Americans have been, or may be, carrying out in regard to the route of the pipeline, and other local arrangements. Mr. Geoffrey Lloyd is therefore anxious that Major Holmes should visit Kuwait as soon as possible, since any first-hand news we may get from that part of the world may well be of value in connection with future Anglo-American negotiations. I should therefore be grateful if you would let me know whether you agree that a return air passage may now be sponsored, in which case I will inform the Company.

Dickson informs me that Holmes may repeat may have in mind an attempt to approach Shaikh in I.p.C. interest and to obtain for them permission to run a pipe line through Kuwait territory issuing at Kadiiama front weiis supposeoly to be opened at Jubal Sanaa*m. in part return for this I.P.C. would, Dickson conjectures, supply Kuwadt with fresh water pipe which in any case they would lead to Kadhama for tneir own operations. 5. A second conjecture of Dickson’s is that Holmes is ? in favour of double crossing A.P.O.C. by offering nimseif to A.A.O.C. in tne role of negotiator in their behalf for a concession in Kuwait’s share of tne neutral zone. visit here has some specific object or objects other than the development described in my telegram B54 April 1st.

Uie Kuwait Neutral Zone lies between two proven oil fields and it is not difficult to comprehend the irritation caused by the bar on exploitation due tc its indeterminate political status. Ibn Baud is, we understand, committed to the California Arabian Standard Oil Company so far as his interests are concerned while the Shaikh of Kuwait steadfastly declines to negotist e with any oil company in respect of hie rights. It may beIt may b© that there is some intention of raising the matter again with the Shaikh during Holmes’ forthcoming visit to Kuwait and, if so, it seems to us a matter for consideration whether sane political support should not be given to the suggestion that was mooted earlier that, in the absence of any prospect of an agreed settlement of the Saudi-Kuwait frontier, the Shaikh should follow Ibn Baud’s example in granting rights oyer his share of the Neutral Zone to the Kuwait Oil Company, the two companies then exploiting jointly and the two Hulers sharing royalties. 4, Jebel Nakhsh, at the base of,the Qatar peninsula, has hitherto been the mam stumbling - block in the way of a settlement with I bn Baud in regard to his sa uth-east frontier. (A most lucid account of the discussions which have proceed ed with I bn Saud on the subject of this frontier is contained in Foreign Office Memorandum No.15996 of the 30th June 1940) The discovery of oil by Petroleum Development (Qprtar) Limited at Jebel Dukhan close by - in part of the same geological feature - will not, we imagme, dispose Thn Saud to diminish his claim on Jebel Nakhsh while His Majesty’s G-overnment on the other hand, are committed to the Shaikh aid Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited in respect of this area. If this difficulty were got out of the way it might be possible to reach a settlement with I bn Saud over the rest of his South-Eastern frontier, for with development at Has Tanura it may well be that I bn Saud no longer regards his claim on Khor al Odeid as a vital interest, while his gratitude to His Majesty’s Government for favoursfavours received during the srar continued dependence on their support aiigjht incline him to come to a settlement acceptable to His Majesty’s Government, the Trucial Coast Shaikhs, the Sultan of Muscat, and Aden. Is there then any solution Of the Jebel Kakhsh difficulty ? ffouia it be worth while considering here too, as we have suggested in the case of the Kuwait Heutral Zone, a joint concession granted by the two Rulers to their two oil concessionaires ? We recognise the objections to such a course, but it may be that on a broad view the advantage of achieving a settled frontier to the South-East and South is sufficient to outweigh other considerations. 5. It is of course true that even when It*i Baud’s 'Forward Folicy*'towards the south-east is checked by an agreed frontier definition there remains the consi derable problem of sorting out the rival claims of Trucial Coast Shaikhs and hinterland tribes over potentially valuable areas such as Jebel Faiyah and Jebel Hafit; and we must not forget that Muscat claims extend as far to the north-west as the Baraimi oasis. This is a sufficiently ugly problem in itself but once given a settled frontier with Ifcn Saud it would not seem impossible to claim that the remaining problem is a more or less domestic affair for settlement between the rival claimants under His Majesty’s Government’s auspices, and that for all practical purposes the whole area from Khar al Udeid round to Dhofar, east, south-east and south of acknowledged Saudi territory, is covered by concessions already granted to Petroleum Companies Limited by the Sultan and the Trucial CoastCoast Shaikhs, (file acquisitive Ras-ai-Khaimah and the microscopic Ajman have only granted exploration permits so far but it should be assumed that these are preliminary^to the grant of fully- fledged concessions). As it seems to us, the essential thing is to halt I bn Saud on a definite line somewhere between his claim of 1935 and the 'Riyadh line' as finally adjusted before he begins +o believe, possibly as the result of suggestions made by or on behalf of California Arabian Standard Oil Company that his claims in this area have hitherto been far too modest. It is well to remember in this connection that wmle Ion Baud’s boundary claim in 1935 lay well to the south west of Baraimi, he has from time to time exhibited a certain interest in the oasis. 6. Similarly it stall remains for the Sultan of Muscat to make his influence sufficiently felt in the Dhahirah and Jebel Akhdhar regions for Petroleum Companies Limited to be able to explore ,, — uoauaw tuiu sal; T&gt;xiu Dfc'KXiirang tne wa* ana still continues the at tenant to t^lations with the principal Shaikhs, though his lengthy visits to Siofar must, have diminished the effect- Indeed, it mav be that, he ^ll 5 a6( ^ considerable encouragement 1 'from Bis Grovernment actirig pres^raably in concert witn the oii. company, anti assistance In money and arms before he achieves any real result. ?• To turn now to other frees in which we are interested, namely Persia arid Afghanistan. In tne iormer country India’s interests, at any rate xrom the consumer angle, are largely protected oy His Majesty’s Government’e control of Anglo Iranian Oil Company holdings and so far as we are awareaw&amp;re, the Persian Coast south-east of Bushire is geologically not particularly promising. But we understand that applications are being made for concessions in other parts of Persia both by British and United States interests and we should be glad to be kept informed of developments, particularly in Kast Persia, for it is perhaps not altogether unreasonable to expect that* the interests succeeding in East Persia would be well claced to extend into Afghanistan. There have been pointers to indicate an American interest in the Afghan oil potential and we have yet to learn that any British company has displayed any concern. While admittedly we are dealing with possibly far-fetched hypotheses it is, we conceive, not* impossible that there might be considerable oil strikes on both sides of the Heimand. and if these were of real significance then it is again not beyond the realm of possibility that in the absence of deep water ports east, of Bandar Abbas a demand might arise for pipe-line construction to Karachi. However distant this prospect may be, it is one which cannot be entirely ignored ana it is not one which we should particularly wish to see developing from American enterprise. ®. To revert to the ®uli. We recognise that Delhi is not the best (pentre from which to view the problems involved in +heir true perspective, since we have neither the close acQuaintance with the problem on the ground that prior posseLses nor the world view which can only be taken in London.

Apart from fact that refusal to talc e part in dis cussions would be out of harmony with our. general co-operation / with U.S.A, it would play into hands of enemies of such co operation including members of Senate Commission which have been investigating activities of Petroleum Reserves Corporation. Moreover we are greatly dependent on U.3.^. for release of equipment for oil production, refining and' distribution including pipe lines and tanker tonnage, restriction of which would bring to a standstill development of oil resources in Middle Bast.2 In tlie clr dums tances it was decided that our proper course was to maintain offer to have preliminary and exploratory dis- o us si one with L'.S at official and expert level in Washington on the understanding th^t this 'would cover a world wide field, that no question arises of any ? trcu.isfsr of existing right or *? pr oper tie s in oil and that when ground is clear and facts established there should then he discussion on higher level. 4 2.

Dear Sir, Please refer to my confidential letter No. C/PA-121 dated 3rd February 1944. The Company wishes to apply for a reserration of land for installing and maintaining the pipe line described in the above-mentioned letter. Attached are copies of the Map BRA-1553 showing the route of the proposed line and also copies of a description of the reservation. The pipe line will follow approximately the centre of the reservation and sufficient room is provided on each side of the line for maintenance. In routing the line the Company has endeavoured to avoid cultivated areas. Provision will be made for roads and pathways by burying the line or providing ramps over it. Markers are being installed along the oentre-line of the reservation. I would be pleased to go over the proposed route with a representative of the Government to determine whether or not the reservation includes any privately owned lands. From the coastline north of the village of Jasra the course of the pipe line will be in a more-or-less straight line to A1 Khobar, Saudi Arabia. The Company will be pleased to have the Bahrein Governments approval of this reservation at its earliest convenience in order that the company may proceed with the preliminary work.

This memorandum is designed to give some account of those interests, , to explain our relations with the Rulers of the States in the Pei'si an Culf and our policy generally, and to describe the various oil concessions that have been granted in these States. 2 * iiTRaO a P lli cal Situation and Treaty position of Sheikhdoms . Except 1 or tne Has a area between Koweit and Bahrein, which forms part ox the uerritories of Saudi Arabia, the Arab Sheikhdoms and Muscat cover the whole of the western and southern coast-line ox the Persian Culf and the eastern half of the south coast of Arabia. They consist of:~ (a) Koweit, (population 70-90,000; area including the Neutral Zone about 6,000 square miles) occupying a strategical position at the head of the Culf between Iraq and Saudi Arabia. . (b) Bahrein, (population approximately 130,000; area about 200 square miles) a group of islands some 200 miles to the south of Koweit, off the Hasa coast. (c) Qatar, (population about 23,000; area3000 square miles) a promontory south of Bahrain. (d) The seven petty Sheikhdoms of the Trucial Coast (so-called from the maritime truce imposed in 1820 by the East - India Company on the chieftains of this district). Their names in order eastwards from Qatar areAbu Iliabi (population 10,000), Bibai (population 20,000), Sharjah population/ I i f r? M 2. (populr-tion 12&gt;000)&gt; ijnan (population 2,000), Urn al Qawam it ion 4,000); Has al Khaimh (population 12,000 j, and Kalb a (population' 2,000).

With the exception of Muscat, all these states are British protected states in special treaty relations with h.h.O. Under the common form of treaty the ruler undertakes to have no negotiations with or receive representatives of any power other than the British Government without whose consent he'is precluded from alienating any part of his territory or from granting any concession for oil, pearl fishing etc. We further exercise jurisdiction over British subjects and foreigners in their territories and are under certain obligations to protect then at least on the seaward side. Muscat is in a special position; its independence is guaranteed by a joint Anglo-French declaration made in 1862 and Muscat is thus entitled to have direct relations- with foreign powers, but in accordance with his treaties with us the Ruler undertakes not to alienate any part of his territory except to the British Government and not to givo any oil concession without our permission. H.H.G, exercise jurisdiction in Muscat ever British subjects but not over foreigners. Muscat's relations however with us, particularly India, are so close that in practice its position resembles that of a Protectorate. In all the states we respect the independence of the Rulers in internal affairs and intervene only in the case of serious mal administration or of the threat of a breach of the peace likely to endanger our own or foreign interests. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, together with three political Agents-at Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat-represent British interests on the spot and by their/their advice mii.de the T?iii r.-^e • ^ ^ n l inos cf policy favourable to ur interests. None of the .Rulers, except the Sultan of Muscat, tj '' h “ n a ' ,£,rtinu subsidy h!iS Tseen Sraated in consideration of the.strategical facilities uhich he has placed at ovr disposal, receives any financial assistance fren the British Government. 4 - British interest in thu pars:Lali Gulf datos 1 ' rom tho 17th and 18th Centuries and in the earlier stages uas concerned primarily uith trade. At the beginning .11 tne 19th Century Great Britain entered upon the task at considerable cost to lierself of clearing the Gulf' of piracy, oi putting Bu\m the slave trade and,, later, gun-running, and of buoying and beaconing its waters for the peaceful developnent of the co mere e of all nations. As a result the states have for long ejoyed prosperity, a period of x^olitical tranquillity and relative 'while Great Britain on her side has insured herself against the establishment of any hostile power in the Gulf to threaten her comunications with India. 5* In recent years, however, and particularly since the last war, the strategic importance of tho Persian Gulf has greatly increased, for two reasons, firstly because of the developnent of air transport and, secondly, through the discovery of large and strategically placed oil reserves in the territories of tho Sheikhdoms, As regards the first factor, the Persian Gulf is on the most direct air route between this country, the Mediterranean and India, Bahrein being an important stopping place. It is considered probable that the importance of the Persian Gulf from this aspect will be greatly increased after the war and that Bahrein nay well be a place of considerable significance as a link on the Empire route to India and the Par East. The area is also of considerable importance to the R.A.F. and the question is now under consideration of the acquisition of permanent rights on Masirah Isian South-/ j.

Thus, they have provided the R.A.P* with all tin xacilities in their territories which have been required. V/hen at the xiiiie oi .the Geman tlireat to the Caucasus and beyond, it was considered necessary to construct an alternative port to Basra on the territory of the Sheikh of Koweit, the latter offered us all the assistance at his command with the utmost readiness. Again, when it was found necessary to p3.ug a proportion of the oil wells already drilled and to cease further exploration, the Rulers accepted this 'without serious demur in spite of their natural desire for the expeditious exploitation of the concessions, 8. It may well be asked what is the reason that we have hitherto been able to secure 'with so little difficulty and such conspicuous goodwill our requirements in these states, TRo answer is that the Sheikhdoms regard H.M.G. as their natural protector both within the limits of our Treaty obligations and outside then. They consider, with some truth, that it is only H.n.G-. that stands between then and absorption/4.

Oil concessions in Muscat, the Tru cial Coast and Qatar are held hy subsidiaries of Petroleum Concessions Ltd., the capital of this Company being divided in equal shares between British, French, Dutch (Royal Dutch Shell) and American holders. In none of these areas, except Qatar, has oil development passed the exploration stage. In Qatar three test wells had been drilled before the Company received orders from in June 1942 to plug their wells and suspend operations for the duration of the war. These restrictions have now been relaxed and it is under stood that plans are under discussion at Washington for the renewal of., operations at Qatar. A separate note dealing in-.more detail with ail these concessions is attached as an Appendix. H«h«G~ ts interests in the oil concessions . In the. case of all the various oil concessions in the Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms the Company concerned has signed a political agreement with H.M.G. whereby in recognition of H.M.G’s special position in the Sheikhdoms undertakings are given designed to safeguard the position oi the political authorities, to ensure that British strategic and ether interests are respected and to enable the production and resources of the Company to bo placed at the disposal of H.M.G. Should this be rendered necessary by national emergency or war* The Companies further undertake to remain British by registration with at least one of their Bireetors a British subject, and to employ as. me.ny British subjects or subjects of the Ruler as is consistent with the efficient carrying on of the undertaking. Thus it is ensured, that relations with the Rulers should be through, or at any rate under the supervision of, the British Political authorities. This safeguards our own interests and is, as a matter of fact, also of considerable assistance to the Companies since it would be quite impossible .tor them without such/ L' • iii Mi ! i8. such co-operation to secure'from the Eulers the'assistance they require in developing oilfields in the hinterland and in . 1 securing protection ag^inut tribetanen. 13- ^ ~i rilmrcMTts ,in tho Puri^ian .Gulf . The United States have been, talcing an increasing interest in this' area both iron • the point of view of oil developrnnt and with an eye to post-war civil aviation. ' As stated above, the important oil concession in Bahrein is owned by the Americans. Ahilo our relations with the Bahrein Petrolcri Company have always been most friendly, the Company co-operating 'duly in th^dpirit of the agreement, there have, nevertheless, been indications that the United States Government• arc not altogether satisfied witn the arrangement whereby political relations with the Sheikhs, affecting as they do the interests of American subjects, are left cnoiroly in the hands of the British Political Authorities* The United States Government recently put forward a proposal for the opening of an American Consulate at Baifrein which was successfully resisted on our pent, mainly on the grounds that to allow them Consular representation there Y;culd open the way to other countries, such as Iraq, Persia and Saudi-Arabia, and that the proposal could not be justified by the number of American subjects living in Bahrein or the magnitude of American interests there. 14. It therefore appears not improbable that in any discussions with us they, may press to be allowed greater freedom in conducting direct relations with the Sheikhs, Any such request should, from our own interests, be most firmly opposed on the ground that to admit such a request in the case of the United States bfA f Would oe to open the door, to intrusion by other countries such as Iraq, Persia and Saudi ^jrabia, which would certainly be detrimental in tho long run both to our interests and those of thu United States, It may not, however, be easy to resist such proposals Dy the iunericans in the case of Muscat, since the latter is/ 'Wmo9.

States hirnsell will no^ welcome the opening of direct relations with toth any other foreign power than ourselves* ^ post^' 15. As regards the immediate question of the development of Session s latioK oil in the Sheikhdoms, it is, of course, to the Sheikhs* immediate interests that this should proceed as fast as possible ^t frieii: in view of the royalties which they will obtain. Hitherto the British Oil Companies have lagged somewhat behind the Bahrein Oil Company (and C.A.S.0,0. in Saudi-Arabia) in the matter of Mted State development. Insofar as they have financial interests in the mgenent British Companies (viz-, the Kuwait Oil Company and Petroleum, tng as thej Concessions Ltd.), it is also to the interest of the American %-in tie snai oholaers concerned that development should be speeded up. aited State; 16. If in connection with any discussions with the United Dcning of 21 States the question were to arise of requiring the Sheikhs to resisted make adjustments in their existing agreements with H.M.G. or the a Consular oil companies, or to enter into new arrangements in the interests ntries, sis of Anglo-linerlean policy (for example the U.S. have already put sal collide forward a suggestion of piping Koweit oil across Arabia to a ngiiB*: Mediterranean port) it may be said that, while we could in the last resort no doubt induce the Sheikhs to f^ll into line, this jr discuss 1 ® would probably not be without detriment to our general relations in cond^ with then, and we should be reluctant to put pressure on them t should) unless it could be shown that they themselves would stand to e ground benefit from the measures proposed^ ud Stat« s .trios sue External Departne nt, India Office, March, 1944. ^ tlio 33 u o 7 lice ^ vAPPENDIX Details of the Oil Concessions gnanted. in the Anal Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. 1. Bahrain ,. B'phro.in ■ ■ broleun Company estahlished itself in Bahrein in 1930 'by purchasing from the Eastern and General Syndicate a concession dating from 1925, which granted exclusive rights of exploration throughout the Sheikh's territories and promised a mining lease for a maximum area of 100,000 acres to Be selected By the concessionaires. In 1934- the Company secured a lease covering the greater part of the two ma.in islands comprising the Sheikhdom and in 1 940 this lease was confiimed and extended to include the whole of the Sheikh's present and future dominions, including the reefs and territorial waters surrounding the islands. Up to the present the Company has drilled 7A wells in the area of their 1 93A lease But in the early months- of 19A-2 4-0 of these wells were plugged with cement in order to facilitate the denial of the whole field in case of emergency. In the Additional area obtained By their deed of 1940 the company has done some exploratory work which is understood to hs.ve shown promising results, But they have Been obliged to suspend their programme owing to war conditions. These denial restrictions have now Been relaxed, Oil production from the Bahrein field has averaged about a million tons a year - in 1942 it was 836,000 tons. The Company have Built a refinery on Bahrein Island of which the normal rate of processing crude oil is 33,500 Barrels a day. The refinery is now Being enlarged in order to produce 100 octane aviation fuel, the project Being largely financed By the United States Government and planned to Begin production in July 1944 at the rate of 232,000 tons a year. The Bahrein Petroleum Company works in very close co-operation with, the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company who are engaged in production in the Hasa area of Saudi-AraBia, Both Companies Being owned By the same American interests. The C.A.S.O.C’s. oil is refined in the Bahrein refinery and a project has now Been put forward of/2 of connecting the Hasa coast vith Bahrein hy a pipe line to facilitate transport of crude oil to the refinery from Hasa. 2. Koweit. The oil concession here was secured by the Kuwait Oil Company in 1934. This is a British Company owned - ! equally by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Gulf Exploration Company (U. S. h.), Soon after obtaining their concession the Company started exploratory work and their first wells were drilled in 1936. Early in 1939 they embanked on a large development scheme but this was cancelled on the outbreak of war and they continued to drill with onu rig only. They have not yet reached the stage of producing oil. In July 1942 owing to the war situation, denial measures were considered necessary and the Company were ordered by H,m,G, to suspend drilling operations and plug all their wells with cement, These restrictions have now been relaxed and the question of re-starting operations is under consideration. South of Koweit lies a considerable area known as the Neutral Zone in which Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Koweit enjoy equal rights under the Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922, until such time as through the good offices of H.M.G. a further agreement is made between the two Rulers. There is every likelihood that oil will be found in the zone. In 1 939 the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company signed an agreement 'with the Saudi-Arabian Government under which their oil concession was extended to cover, inter alia, Ibn Saud’s rights in the zone. There is keen competition to secure a similar agreement ■'with the Sheikh between Messrs, Petrol Concessions Limited,, a British Company already holding various oil concessions in the ,,rabian Peninsula, and the Eastern Gulf Oil Company which although registered in the United Kingdom, is con trolled by the same innerican interests as the Gulf Exploration Company, The Sheikh, however, has consistently refused to discuss the question of his lights in one neutral zone with any would-be concessionaires, probably because he hopes/3 hopes that on Ihn Saucl 1 s death, he will he able to inplenent his claim to the whole of the Neutral Zone. 3. Dubai . A Political Agreement on the usual lines between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., was signed on the 5th February, 1937, and an Agreement between the Sheikh and the Company on 22nd May, 1937? with a provision for transfer to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd. The latter Agreement, which is for 75 years grants the Company exclusive rights to develop oil in the Sheikh’s territory, islands . and territorial waters, and covers his rights in any neutral zone., it specifically excludes Hatta-Al-Jabaliyah and the area at Dubai Khor surveyed by Imperial Airways under the Dubia Civil Air Agreement. The Company has the right to import oil by pipe line from adjoining territories. No work appears to have been done, and in 1939 and 1 94-0 the Sheikh was informed that the Company had been forced to abandon their exploration survey programme owing to the war, 4. Sharjah . An Agreement for 75 years was signed on 17th September. 1937? between the Sheikh and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., with a provision for a transfer to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd, This Agreement grants the Company exclusive rights to develop- oil in the territories, islands and territorial waters of the Sheikh, and covers his rights in any neutral area, but excludes the sites being used by Imperial Airways and the R.A.F, In a schedule attached to the agreement it is stipulated that drilling shall begin within 9 calendar years after its signature. The usual form of Political Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and Petroleum Concessions Ltd. was signed on 12th November, 1 937* Drilling does not yet appear to have, commenced at Sharjah, but during 1938 and 1939 / 4 - 0 , various expeditions were made into In 1940 the Sheikh was informed that owing to the/ the hinterland.1 r ■i 1 \ - 4 - the War the Conipany ®;re unah.le to undertake further exploratory survey expeditions* 5* Kr.lba, On 20th Decanter, 1938, an Agreement tor 75 years v/as signed between Petroleum Development (Tracial Coast) Ltd., and the Regent of * KaXba, Sheikh Khalid Bin Ahmad Bin SiiLtan, who signeu as Ruler of K '.Ita, The Agreement covered the Sheikh's territory and territorial waters, and contained provision for the Building of a refinery and the construction of a pipe line through the Sheikh's territory. Article A in which the Sheikh 'undertakes to offer to the Company all assistance in its relations with other Rulers and neighbouring tribes with a view to securing the free access and movement of the Company in their territories' is unique in oil Agreements on the Trucial Coast, and emphasizes the value which the Company set on the assistance of the Sheikh in their future efforts to obtain access to the hinterland. iL-t tnc ohe_kh fully understood this is shown by his stacement in his letter to the Political Agent, Bahrein, of the 23rd July, 1939, that part of the concession money would be spent 'to ensure facilities 1 or the future and to obtain the necessary security for the geologists and all other work'* An agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company which took into account the exchange of letters between the Company and the Regent mentioned above, was signed on the 11th April, 19A0, In 1 939 the Regent was informed that the Company had had te abandon their explora fcovy dxd 11 ing programme owing to the War# 6. Ras- al-Kh aimah .

BEGINS s ue a Tieregrau • ' 'C • **/ '*?- following is text of draft memorandum referred to in my immediately preceding telegram BEGETS: ^ PREAMBLE• The Governments of the united States of America and the united Kingdom whose nationals hold to a substantial extent j o M-ij rights to exploration and development of petroleum resources in other countries recognise: (1) That ample supplies of petroleum (petroleum throughout this document solely used to signify crude petroleum and its derivatives) available in international trade to meet increasing market demands are essential for both the security ard. well bein ~ of nations. b (2) That for forseeable future the petroleum resources of the world are adequate to asfsure availability of such supplies. (3) That such supplies should be derived from various producing areas of the world with due consideration of such factors as available reserves sound engineering practices aLmvaMttafo** relevant to economic factors ani interests of producing ani con suming countries and with a view to the full satisfaction of expanding demand. (4) That such supplies should be available in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter. Article I. The two Governments agree that the develop ment of petroleum resources should be expanded in an orderly manner on a world wide basis with due consideration to factors set forth in paragraph Ho. 3 of the preamble and within the frame work of applicable laws, or concession contracts. To this end they will concert their efforts to ensure with regard to petroleum resources in which the rights are held or may be acquired by nationals of either country (1) That petroleum shall be available in international trade to nationals of all peace-loving countries in adequate volume and on fair prices on an equitable and non discriminatory basis. (2) That the development of petroleum resources and benefits received therefrom by producing countries shall be such as to encourage the sound economic advancement of those countries. (3) That the development of these resources shall be conducted with a view to availability of adequate supplies of petroleum to both countries as well as to all other peace-loving countries subject to provisions of such collective security arrangements as may be established. I i- 2 - with reapect to acquisition exploration ani development righta in araaa not now under concession the principle of equal opportunity shall be respected by both Governments. (5) That Governments of each country and nationals thereof shall respect ail valid concesaions and lawfully acquired rights and shall make no effort unilaterally to interfere directly or indirectly with such rights. ( 6 ; That exploration for and development of petroleum resources construction and operation of refineries and other facilities and distribution of petroleum shall not be hampered by restrictions imposed by either Government or its nationals inconsistent with the purpose of this memorandum of understanding. ARTICLE II• The two Governments recognise that principles declared in Article I hereof are of general applicability and merit adherence on the part of all nations interested in the inter national petroleum trade world. Therefore with a view to direct adoption and effectuation of principles embodied in this memorandum of understanding they agree that as soon as practicable they will propose to Governments of other interested producing and consuming countries an international petroleum agreement which inter alia would establish a permanent international petroleum Council composed of representatives of all signatory countries. To this end the two Governments hereby pledge t&amp;emselves to formulate plans for an international conference to consider negotiation of such a multilateral petroleum agreement. They also pledge themselve to consult other interested Governments with view to ts&amp;ing what ever action is necessary to prepare for the proposed conference. ARTICLE III. There are however numerous problems of joint immediate interest we wish to put forward with respect to petroleum resources in which rights are held or may be acquired by their nationals which must be discussed and resolved on a co-operative interim basis if the general petroleum supply situation ? is not to deteriorate. With this end in view the two Governments hereby agree to establish a Joint petiroleum Commission to be composed of ten members five members to be appointed immediately by each Government. This Commission in furtherance and in accordance with the principles stated in Article I hereof shall consider problems of mutual interest to both Governments and their nationals and with a view to the equitable disposition of such problems shall be charged with the following duties and responsibiliti es (1) To prepare long term estimates of world demand for petroleum having due regard for the ? reserves of consuming countries and expanding consumption requirements• (2) To suggest the manner in which over long term this estimated demand may best be satisfied by production and equitable distribution amongst the various producing countries in accordance with the criteria enumerated in paragraph 3 of preamble. (3) To recommend to both Governments broad policies for adoption by operating companies with a view to eifectuating pro grammes suggested under the provisions of paragraph lTo.2 above. £ 4 )//To analyse such short term problems of joint interest as may arise in connection with production ? processing s.3 • transportation and distribution of petroleum on a world wide basis wherever the nationals of either country have an ? authentic interest and to recommend to both Governments such T aciion as may appear appropriate. (5) To make regular reports to the two Governments concerning its ? activities . (6) To make from time to time such additional reports and recommendations to the respective Governments as may be appropriate to carry out the purpose of this memorandum of understanding# The commission shall establish such organisation as is necessary to carry out its functions under this memorandum of landerstanding. The expenses of the Commission shall be shared equally by the two Governments. ARTICLE IV. To effectuate this memorandum of under standing the two Governments hereby grant reciprocal assurances. (1) That they will adhere to principles set forth in Article I paragraphs 1 to 6 inclusive. (2) That they will endeavour to obtain collaboration of Governments of other producing and consuming countries in implementation of principles set forth in Article I and will consult as appropriate with such Governments in connection with activities undertaken under Article I. (3) That upon approval of recommendations of the Commission they will endeavour in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures to give effect to such approved recommendations and wherever necesaaxy and advisable ensure that activities of their nationals will conform thereto. (4) That each Government will undertake to kdep itself adequately informed of current and prospective activities of its nationals with regard to development processing transport and distribution of petroleum. (5) That each Government will make available to Commission such information regarding activities of its nationals as is necessary to realisation of purposes of this memorandum of understand! ng.

Such a settlement would have to preserve the terri torial rights of the Aden Protectorate chiefs, the Sultan of Muscat, the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, the Shaikh of ^atar, and the concession rights of Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited and at the sgme time be acceptable to the Saudi Arabian Government. The second question only arises should the answer to the first be in the affirmative. It is, what would be the best method of arriving at a solution of the complex problems which have to be dealt with before a satisfactory frontier settlement could be achieved. 8. It is in my opinion correct to assume that if the United States do endeavour to bring pressure to bear to acquire additional oil concession rights on the Arab side of the Persian Gulf they will do so in those areas where the terri- torhl sovereignty is in doubt, for any proposals on their part to obtain a footing in areas within undisputed international boundaries and for which we have already approved concessions could be and should be immediately rejected. It is also true that from the westerly base of the iatar peninsula to the tri-junction of the frontiers of the ^.den Protectorate, Saudi le Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., /. , . itical Resident in the Persian Gulf, /^raoia Bushire.Arabia, and the Xeiaen the actual geographical boundaries have not been determined and it is here that American pressure should do most expected. Therefore I consider that it is desirable uo endeavour in the near future to reach an agreement with the Saudi Arabian Government on this portion of their frontier. I am not altogether in accord with Sir Olaf Caroe^ statement that the Kuwait Neutral zone 1 , Jebel Naksh, and the him,e,. land oi tne iruciai Coast and Muscat are political vacua. oar from it. Our difficulty has been in the past ano. will os in the future not a Hack. of j^olitical interests in Miese areas out a super—abundance of claimants desirous of including them within the territories over which they exercise control, however nebulous that control may be. Having agreed that it is necessary to reopen this very complex and controversial subject an answer must be found if possible to the second question referred to in paragraph 2 of this letter. 4. Kuwait Keutral bone 'Then dealing with this subject I must claim indulgence should I make mistakes in fact for I am writing without access to records and relying solely on memory. In 1943 the Shaikh of Kuwait declined to negotiate with any oil company in respect of his rights in the Neutral zone’ and gave as his reason that . so it was undesirable to do^while the war was in progress as any agreement which might be entered into could not possibly be implemented until peace time conditions once again prevailed. In my opinion his real reason for refusing to negotiate was that he still hoped to be able to assert at some future date his claim to exclusive rights in the area in question. In common with many other people he considers that on the demise of Ibn 3aud Saudi Arabia will become a scene of strife between numerous aspirants to the throne of the great king and that by some political means such as assisting the ultimately /successfulUe %/■ J4%) ^4 3, successful candidate he may he able to persuade the then Saudi Arabian Government to relinquish their rights in the 1 neutral zone* in his favour. Therefore I think that it would require political support in the widest sense to influence the Shaikh to agree to grant a concession for the ’neutral zone’ at the present time. It will be recalled that the Arabian American Oil Company already hold a very comprehensive concession from Ibn Saud for his interests in this area. (For the exact details of the agreement between the Arabian American Oil Company and Ibn Saud a reference may be made to the printed correspondence forming an enclosure to your printed letter Ho.2o4-S dated the 17th s a Harch 1944 -- Jedda despatch ho.96 dated the 23th Hovember 1943). I believe that the Arabian American Oil Company have already come to an agreement with the Eastern Gulf Company who have a half share in the Kuwait Oil Company with regard to the ^oint exploration of the ’neutral zone’. This being so it would of course be very satisfactory for the two companies concerned ? the Arabian American Oil Company and the Kuwait Oil Company, if the latter acquired the ’neutral zone* concession, but I believe that we have already given an undertaking to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited that should the question of the ’neutral zone’ become a subject for negotiations they will ue kept informed and be given an opportunity to negotiate. 11 this is indeed so it will be necessary ior Messrs, r •. oroloun Concessions Limited to withdraw their right to negotiate before ills Majesty’s Government could autnorise povilical support being given to the Kuwait Oil Company to obtain the concession. Whether they would do so willingly I a.n not in a position to say. At the same time we are responsible the Shaikh’s interests are safeguarded and tha^ being so smould we be justified in eliminating competition jj securing tue withdrawal of Messrs. Petroleum ooncessions LlnioOun /I#&lt;?) z. I would advise that we make no move whatsoever with regaro. to the Kuwait ’neutral zone’ for the time being for I think it unlikely, in view of the failure of the Arabian American Oil Company, after drilling 10,400 feet, to find oil at Abrak-al-Kabrit immediately south of the ’neutral zone’, that the American interests will make any determined effort to secure the Shaikh of Kuwait’s interest. Should they do so however I consider we should leave the field open to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited and the Kuwait Oil Company, discourage all foreign competitors, and encourage the Shaikh to give up his dreams of the future and to come to a settlement with either of them. Even in 1938 when our policy of appeasement was at its height and the Foreign Office wished to acquire Khor-el-Qdeid ^ with a view to making a present of it to Ibn Saud - for some- what negative political benefits; His Majesty’s Government never had the slightest doubt that Jebel Naksh belonged to the Shaikh of Qatar. The area has been included in Messrs. Petro leum Concessions Limited’s agreement for the jatar peninsula? and we have on more than one occasion clearly stated to the Saudi Arabian Government that we considered it as part of the Shaikh of Qatar’s territory. The Government of India themselves took a very firm line over the Khor-ei-Odeid question, an area which in certain circles was not considered as important as Jebel Naksh, and it would be impossible for them to make any suggestion of the nature of that now put forward without indicating their willingness to acknowledge that Ibn Saud’s claim to sovereign rights in the area was at least as good as that ox' the Shaikh of ^atar.That Ion Saud might be inclined from a sense of gratitude for assistance rendered to him during this war and financial assistance to oe rendered to him in the future to relinquish elwii:i oG nnor-el-Gdeid is possible, and it is equally possible tnao he might be prepared to relinquish his vague claim to Jebel Naksh. vThen dealing with Ibn Saud it is best to take a strong line for strength is what he understands and has used throughout his life with very considerable effect, and it should be made perfectly clear to the Saudi Arabian Government that we will never agree to acknowledge their claim to Jebel Haksh. I believe that sufficient pressure, possibly financial, can now be brought to bear upon Ibn Saud to obtain a settlement of the south-eastern frontier without our being forced to make any territorial concession anywhere. 6 * The Trucial Coast and Muscat The statement that the whole area from khor-el-Qdeid to Ghofar, east, south-east, and south of what will be acknowledged Saudi territory is covered by concessions already granted to ( Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited by the Sultan of Muscat and the Trucial Shaikhs is not altogether correct for the Shaikh of Fujairah has not been included in any concession agreement, and for the matter of that is not in treaty relation with His Majesty's Government. This sheikhdom could at one time have been considered to be linked to His Majesty's Govern ment through agreements with the Jawasim shaikhs but for many years now it has in fact been independent of the Jawasim. At the present time it is doubtful if either the Sultan of Muscat or the Shaikhs of Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah, or Kalba could rightfully assert a claim to this hilly tract ruled over by a stout-hearted rogue. Fujairah is the backdoor to the Trucial Coast and should be closed with some form of simple agreement at the earliest possible moment. Cnee Ibn Saud has swallowed the Jebl Naksh pill little difficulty will be experienced in persuading him to agree to a frontier line at a very considerable distance from the .6 . Buraimi oasis and any danger to Abu Dliabi will be avoided, a. doubt wne oner Ibn Baud has exliibited interest in Buraiini lor many years ? i-. ever, it is rather that the inhabitants Qj. the oasis nave ^rom time to time used the power of his name uo extract concessions j.. rom their overlords and have pain personal court oo him in the hope of* pecuniary reward. In the near future we shall be called upon to give our views on and possibly to delineate the frontiers of the Trucial ohai^hcloms. Xc will be a complicated and tedious business necessitating an officer on special duty with wide powers and much tact and experience. I have no comment to offer on Sir Olaf Caroe’s views with regard to the Sultanate of Muscat. 7. To summarise, it is my opinion that the south-east frontier of Saudi Arabia should be agreed upon without further delay, that in certain circumstances the Shaikh of Kuwait should be persuaded to agree to the opening of negotiations for his rights in the ‘neutral zone* and that Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited should be given an opportunity to compete with the Kuwait Oil Company but it should be made clear to the Shaikh of Kuwait that we would not permit an^r other concern to take part in the negotiations and would expect him to reach agreement with either of the two companies named within a reasonable period of time; that we should in no way relax the stand we have made with regard to Jebel Naksh or Khor-el- Qdeid; that agreement should be reached with the Shaikh of Fujairah; and that I agree with the views expressed regarding the Sultanate of Muscat.COUFIDEMTJAT.

S. i have now had more time in which to consider the issues involved and I find that 1 was in error in agreeing that the whole area from Khor-el-odeid to Dhofar was covered by conces sions already granted to Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited. 1 did make the one exception of the sheikhdom of Fujairah but I should also have noted that the shaikhdom of Ummal Quwain, the independence of which we have for many years acknowledged, has no form of oil agreement with Messrs.

There is also the question of the status of the shaikh-'' dom of nimriyah which was for many years considered to be under the suzereignty of the Shaikh of Sharjah but which has for some considerable period been independent of his control, in this connection please see the correspondence ending with Bushire demi-official letter No. 1709/14/237 dated the 31st August 1937 . /037 - &lt;y^ P V' ihe Hon*ble Sir,Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.B*, Political resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire•Telegram From To 3(A) Political Agent, Bahrain.

Will you please refer.to your D.O. letter No. C/685 dated the 28th April It44 and connected correspondence? 2. As regards the Kuwait ueutral Zone the dhaikh assured rm definitely that he had not the slightest intention of giving way. His policy obviously is to obtain. In this i think his policy is very sound, and I would not surf est anything different to hi; either in his interests or ours. 3. As regards rebel Naksh and Khor-e1-Odeid, I cannot agree that the present moment is an opportune one for raising these questions with Ibn Baud. The Foreign Office have never been more pusillanimous In their attitude towards hire, and despite trie fact that we are paying him three million pounds a year to co what we want, they appear to be complete Iv mesmerised by him, and would infallibly come out as protag inists on his behalf and against Qatar. here again by far our best line is to let sleeping dogs lie and hope that when Ibn baud has disappeared, and our reasons for courting his favours have diminished, we shall be able to settle these questions to our satisfaction. 4. As regards Umm al Qawain, uamriyah anu Fujairah, I agree that we might raise the question again of plugging the Umm al Qawain gap, though I doubt that these states are really large enon- ;r h to make it worth while bothering about, but I think that Hamriyah and Fujairah may safely be left for the time being. We certainly do not want any more of these Shaikhlets as it is difficult enough to keep track of them as it is. » Major T.

Washington, 8th August, 1944. Introductory Article. 1 . The Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland whose nationals hold, to a substantial extent jointly, rights to explore and develop petroleum resources in other countries, recognise: — That ample supplies of petroleum, available in international trade to meet increasing marked demands, are essential for both the security and economic well-being of nations; That for the foreseeable future the petroleum resources of the world are adequate to assure the availability of such supplies; _ That such supplies should he derived from the various producing areas of the world with due consideration of such factors as available reserves, sound engineering practices, relevant economic factors, and the interests of producing and consuming countries, and with a view to the full satisfaction of expanding demand; 4. That such supplies should be available in accordance with the principles of the Atlantic Charter and in order to seive the needs of collective security; 5. That the general adoption of these principles can best be promoted by international agreement among all countries interested in the petroleum trade whether as producers or consumers. 3. Article I. The two Governments agree that the development of petroleum resources for international trade should be expanded in an orderly manner on a world wide basis with due consideration of the factors set forth in paragraph 3 of the Introductory Article and within the framework of applicable laws or concession contracts. To this end, and as a preliminary measure to the calling of the international conference referred to in Article II below, the two Governments will so direct their efforts, with respect to petroleum resources in w'hich rights are held or may be acquired by the nationals oj either country: — 1. That, subject always to considerations of military security and to the provisions of such arrangements for the preservation of peace and prevention of aggression as may be in force, adequate supplies of petroleum shall be available in international trade to the nationals of all peaceable countries at fair prices and on a non- discriminatory basis; 2. That the development of petroleum resources and the benefits received therefrom by the producing countries shall be such as to encourage the sound economic advancement of those countries; \ a vi both ject as c That, w ' rig* opp&lt; ; That rigb or i iat, s of 1 res 1 lac pei The two hereof are c countries in Therefor principles e ticable thej and consul inter alia, composed ( To this late plans such a m\ to consult ever actioi There to the tw( are held i and resol supply sit With ■ an Intern four men Commissi stated in both Gov disposith responsil l.Tc T(S, «1JS NT 01^ wfeose Md feelof ■tional We 'or both (lie pplies; is produig i factors as .nt economic :e we the fe tie needs nterested in ners. •on nodi- paragraph 3 licaoie ms lelH S.

That, with respect to the acquisition of exploration and development rights m areas not now under concession, the principle of equal K opportunity shall be respected by both Governments; 5. That the Government of each country and the nationals thereof shall respect all valid concession contracts and lawfully acquired rights, and shall make no effort unilaterally to interfere directly or indirectly with such contracts or rights; 6. That, subject always to the considerations mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, the exploration for and development of petroleum resources, the construction and operation of refineries and other facilities, and the distribution of petroleum shall not be ham pered by restrictions imposed by either Government or its nationals, inconsistent with the purposes of this Agreement. Article II. The two Governments recognise that the principles declared in Article I hereof are of general applicability and merit adherence on the part of all countries interested in the international petroleum trade of the world. Therefore, with a view to the wider adoption and effectuation of the principles embodied in this Agreement they agree that as soon as prac ticable they will propose to the Governments of other interested producing and consuming countries an International Petroleum Agreement which, inter alia, would establish a permanent International Petroleum Council composed of representatives of all signatory countries. To this end the two Governments hereby pledge themselves to formu late plans for an international conference to consider the negotiation of such a multilateral Petroleum Agreement. They also pledge themselves to consult with other interested Governments with a view to taking what ever action is necessary to prepare for the proposed conference. Article III. There are, however, numerous problems of joint immediate interest to the two Governments, with respect to petroleum resources in which rights are held or may be acquired by their nationals, which must be discussed and resolved on a co-operative interim basis if the general petroleum supply situation is not to deteriorate. With this end in. view the two Governments hereby agree to establish an International Petroleum Commission to be composed of eight members, four members to be appointed immediately by each Government. This Commission, in furtherance of and in accordance with the principles stated in Article I hereof, shall consider problems of mutual interest to both Governments and their nationals, and, with a view to the equitable disposition of such problems, shall be charged with the following duties and responsibilities: ^— having due regard for the interests of consuming countries and expanding consumption requirements; 2. To suggest the manner in which, over the long term, this estimated demand may best be satisfied by production equitably distributed4 4. among the various producing countries in accordance with the criteria enumerated in paragraph 3 of the Introductory Article; To recommend to both Governments broad policies for adoption by operating companies with a view to effectuating programmes suggested under the provisions of paragraph 2 of this Article; To analyse such short-term problems of joint interest as may arise in connection with production, processing, transportation and distribution of petroleum on a world-wide basis, wherever the nationals of either country have a significant interest, and to recommend to both Governments such action as may appear appropriate; 5. To make regular reports to the two Governments concerning its activities; 6. To make, from time to time, such additional reports and recommen dations to the two Governments as may be appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Agreement. The Commission shall establish such organisation as is necessary to carry out its functions under this Agreement. The expenses of the Commission shall be shared equally by the two Governments. Article IV. To effectuate this Agreement the two Governments hereby grant reciprocal assurances: — 1. That they will adhere to the principles set forth in Article I, para graphs 1 to 6 inclusive; 2. That they will endeavour to obtain the collaboration of the Govern ments of other producing and consuming countries in the imple mentation of the principles set forth in Article I, and will consult, as appropriate, with such Governments in connexion with activities undertaken under Article III; 3. That upon approval of the recommendations of the Commission they will endeavour, in accordance with their respective constitutional procedures, to give effect to such approved recommendations; 4. That each Government will undertake to keep itself adequately informed of the current and prospective activities of its nationals with respect to the development, processing, transportation and distribution of petroleum; 5. That each Government will make available to the Commission such information regarding the activities of its nationals as is necessary to the realisation of the purposes of this Agreement. Article V. The two Governments agree that in this Agreement: — 1. The words “ country ” or “ territories ” (a) in relation to the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, include, in addition to the United Kingdom, all British colonies, overseas territories, protectorates, protected States and all mandated territories administered by that Government; and (b) in relation to the Government of the United States of America, include, in addition to the United States, all territory under the jurisdiction of the United States; This Agi after each d the Agreenu after notice it is supersei Article II.

In keeping with the earlier discussions on the subject of foreign exchange, the following conclusions were reached. It was agreed by both Delegations that the terms of the Agreement provide for due consideration by the Commission of the foreign exchange position of each country. The United Kingdom Delegation stated that during the post-war transi tional period referred to in the draft Agreement for the International Monetary Fund, the United Kingdom might be obliged to take into account the exchange which it would lose or gain by the purchase or sale of petroleum in deciding the sources from which the petroleum it required means 2.

For the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland : — BEAVERBROOK, Lord Privy Seal.6 j should be drawn; that this situation would continue until sterling became freely convertible and all restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions have been removed. The United States Delegation took note of this statement. They pointed out, however, that if the United Kingdom Government were to take unilateral action in this sense, the effect would be inconsistent with certain of the purposes of the Agreement. It was agreed, therefore, that before any such action was taken the matter should be placed before the International Petroleum Commission which, with due regard to the principles of the Agreement, should seek a solution acceptable to the two Governments; failing agreement on such a solution the Commission should consider the desirability of recommending to the two Governments a suspension of the Agreement in whole or in part. It was agreed that should the Commission be unable to make any recommendation acceptable to the two Governments, the Government presenting the problem to the Commission w r ould exercise its right to give notice to terminate the Agreement in accordance with the provisions of Article VI. In order that such termination could take place within a reasonable length of time, it was agreed that term of notice in the Agree ment should be shortened from six months to three months. 2. The two Delegations then agreed to submit the Agreement to their respective Governments with the recommendation that it should be entered into forthwith. 12498 Wt. 9/44 F.O.P. 28109 ^P- 34°2. The President of the United States, shortly after the signature of the Agreement, decided to submit the text (but not the agreed statement) to the Senate for ratification as a Treaty, This procedure involves (a) reference to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, (b) a report back to the Senate by the Committee with appropriate recommendations and (c) a debate and vote on the Treaty by the Senate under the two-thirds majority Pule* In November, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to delay until the meeting of the new Congress consideration of all major Treaties pending, and it appeared that the Oil Agreement would, therefore, - come before the Ccramittee next month* 3* Meanwhile, however, Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Committee, issued a statement to the Press on December 2nd expressing the opinion that the Agreement would never be ratified by the Committee and that in his viev/ the Agreement was not necessary for the general welfare and was unfair to the American Oil Industry* he Secretary to the Government of India* External Affairs Department. t-x- ■Sb'C'l'* - E&amp;O. 8667/14 BY FAST AIR MAIL.

There have 'since been the following further developments.4* In explanation of Press reports that the State Department were preparing a revised Agreement, for submission to the United Kingdom Government, H.M. Ambassador, Washington, states that the Oil Policy Committee of the Petroleum Industry War Council (a body representative only of the United States industry) have prepared a revision of the Agreement which was overwhelmingly approved by the Council and has now been formally submitted to t United States authorities. A large factor in the industry’s opposition to the Agreement appears to be the feeling that the latter is an attempt on the part of the United States Administration to obtain control of the domestic industry* H.M. Ambassador states that the United States authorities will now examine the revised document prepared by the United States Oil industry and will probably endeavour to strike a conipromise between the present Agreement and this revision* While it is impossible to forecast precisely the future procedui he thinks that the President may withdraw the existing Agreement irom the Senate Committee and that, if and when a compromise document ^approved by the United States authorities is prepared, the President may take the decision to handle the matter hence forth by executive action. The position may become clearer in next two or three weeks. q* ^ C0 Py is enclosed of a telegram fran Washington, No.65?0 c 3 th December, giving the text of the letter from the Chairman of Oil Policy Committee to the Petroleum Industry War Council, and of the revised Agreement as approved by that Council and submitted to the United States authorities.

Following is text of (a) covering letter of December 5th from chairman of Oil Policy Committee to Petroleum Industry V/ar Council. (You will recollect that Oil Policy Comnittee is' special committee of Petroleum Industry War Council formed to consider this and kindred matters on behalf of the P.I.W.C. ) (b) agreement revised in accordance with proposals of P.I.W.C. and endorsed by that body as well as by the American petroleum institute itself. 2) (A) To Petroleum Industry War Council, In response to the instructions received from the Petroleum Industry War Council, the National Oil Policy Committee has attempted to draft modifications of the Anglo-American oil agreement to meet the objections that have been raised. The Committee endeavoured to carry on its deliberations within the framework established by the Council and by the Petroleum Administrator's letter of October 24th 1944 to W.R. Boyd jr. chairman of Petroleum Industry War Council reading 'I understand that the Petroleum Industry War Council and certain of its committees desire to register objection to the recently negotiated Ang 1o-American agreement If the Council or any of its committees do so desire to record with me such views on the subject I request that at the same time as they make known their objeciaons they likewise make known in specific language exactly how, in their view, the existing document might be revised so as to remove the points of objection cited, this in the interest of the creative and helpful approach as opposed to a purely destructive one' pursuant to the request contained in the above letter the Petroleum Industry V/ar Council at its meeting of October 25 th, 1944 adopted the following resolution 'Dr. Wilson moved that the National Oil Policy Committee be instructed to continue its study of Anglo-American oil agreement and make an effort to suggest to the Council at its next meeting revisions in specific language that existing objections to the document would be removed, that in doing so the Committee give full consideration to the (grp. omitted) cited in the resolution presented as a minority report of the Committee as well as all other criticisms and objection which may come to the attention of the Committee during the course of the study'. It is important to keep in mind that the -ommittee s work was on an agreement which had been signed and submitted to the benate for ratification and that the Petroleum Industry War’Council was requested to comment upon this agreement and to 'make knowi in specific language exactly how in their view the existing document might be revised. ' The Council was not requested to prepare an entirely new document, consequently the National Oil Policy Committee has /labouredlaboured to draft modifications of this agreement to meet the numerous objections to it. It must also be recognised that the suggested agree ment covers many and varied problems and that compromises were required. Many of the changes represent the unanimous opinion of the Conmittee but in some instances they are the weight of the Committee’s opinion. In reviewing the agreement the Coranittee had before it not only the objections raised in the resolution presented to the Council at its October meeting a copy of which is attached, but many other objections and criticisms which have been received from members of the Committee from members of the Petroleum Industry War Council and from the Industry, Careful consideration was given to all the points raised and the changes suggested were those thought necessary by the Committee to meet these objections. While the final results do not represent the preferred views of any individual, the Committee submits the enclosed suggested revision of the oil agreement with the recommendation that it is substituted for the original agreement. It must be recognised that as additional experience is gained, further changes and modifications may prove desirable. In submitting this revised agreement it is assumed that the submission of this report does not foreclose or impede expression of views by individual members of the Committee or by others and that the recommendations are not binding as future commitments on members of the Committee or of the Petroleum Industry v’yar Council nor will it operate to prevent any member of the National Oil Policy Coimdttee or the Petroleum Industry War Council -i om ma _mg such individual or joint reconmendations as they mipbt desire by order of National Oil Policy Comnuttee, A.Jacobson, chairman. 3; (B) Preamble of tJ h n.rr er r ent Bhited States of umerica and the G-overnment TisrW J ^ e “ of Jreat Britain and Northern Ireland.

Matter was discussed at some length in my letter to Peel, No •2431-N/44 of 21st March 1944 0 Priori conclusions in his letter No.394-S of April 20th appear to be based on the following premises — * % . * \ ;/ £'/%/ *) va; that His Majesty*s Government maintain Qatar claim to Jebel Nakhsh and Abu Dhabi*s claim to Khor-al-0daid$ (b) that Ibn Saud will not abate his claim to the frontiers drawn by him on 3rd April, 1935 or may even press for further concession; (c) that it follows that negotiations would be fruitless and he seems to think — easier after Ibn Saud*s death. While we agree that we must stand out against further concession we doubt suggestion that Ibn Saud*s successor would be easier to deal with. British prestige stands high at this moment and Ibn Saud owes us much. 3. Assuming that operations of oil companies on both sides are likely to extend there appear to be three courses open:- I■: - FOREIGN JKG (I) to attempt to secure agreement on political frontiers; (ID to secure working agreement between oil companies to lay down limits of concession zones; (III) to do nothing and permit oil companies to proceed until their operations on one side or other raise political question of frontiers. Decision must to large extent follow programmes of oil companies regarding which we have inadequate information. Course (III) would be logical corollary to Prior*s view but would be difficult to take unless companies agreed to refrain from prospect ing or other operations in disputed zones. As between courses (I) and (II) we ourselves would prefer to open egotiations on political plane rather than to attempt to secure working agreement over heads of Rulers concerned. In either case possibility of laying down fresh neutral zones might be quietly exploited.Exto 2025/1945 . w, 5653 / 13/76 (OtPHER) ll l OUTffAZD TEL2GRMI SPECIAL (OIL FOLIGT) FROM imEIGIT OFFICE TO ILlLIilMlTON No. 4294 ' D. 1 1.55 a.m. 50th April, 1945 28th April, 1945o Repeated to Cairo M.E.

A map snowing tne oimeias ana concession areas in the Middle Eastern Countries is also annexed.) A SURVEY OF THE OIL RESOURCES OF THE MIDDLE EAST Introduction. There is good reason for believing that the Middle Eastern countries will, in the course of a comparatively short space of time, contribute a very much larger proportion of the world’s oil supplies than they do at present. In 1939 their production amounted to nearly 16,000,000 tons, representing no more than 6 per cent, of the world total. Although much prospecting and other work yet [63—76]remains to be done, enough has already been accomplished to demonstrate the great richness of the oil reserves of certain of these countries. The extent to which their oilfields could be developed will, however, depend upon a number of factors, namely: (i) the final lines that the Anglo-American oil agreement will take, (ii) the oil policy of the U.S.S.R. and whether or not she becomes a party to the above-mentioned agreement, (iii) whether or not early steps are taken to define and demarcate the frontiers of these countries, wherever this has not already been done, (iv) internal security in the countries concerned. 2. Of the above factors, the first is really beyond the scope of this survey. All that can be said under this head is that: when, as is expected, there is a serious falling off in the exportation of oil from the United States, arrangements will doubtless be made for the Middle Eastern countries to play an important part in making up the deficiency. They would be in a favourable position to do so not only because of the richness of their fields, but also because their internal requirements are likely (except in the case of Egypt) to keep far below their output level, thus leaving large quantities of oil available for export. Of the remaining factors, the one that seems most in need of attention is the question of undefined and undemarcated frontiers. 3. Of all the regions dealt with in this survey, the most promising appear to be those situated on each side of the Persian Gulf. Persia, the largest oil- producing country in the Middle East at the present time, draws the bulk of her oil from the areas to the east and north-east of the head of the Persian Gulf. Less is known as yet of the potentialities of the western littoral of the Gulf and of the prolongation of this area to the south and south-east across eastern Arabia to the Indian Ocean in the neighbourhood of Masira island. Enough has, however, been done already for it to be said that the region from the north of Kuwait to the south of Qatar holds out much promise and that it may in time turn out to be even richer than the producing areas on the Persian side of the Gulf. The question of inter-State boundaries is most acute in Arabia, where it is likely to cause friction or even more serious trouble, and so interfere with development^ 1 ) 4. The effect of oil discoveries in the Middle East is already manifest, and very soon it will be profound. Western industrialisation has come with a sudden impact upon regions that have hitherto been untouched by the West, and it has had a noticeably stimulating effect upon those parts of the Middle East where contact had already been established. 5. In order to meet the requirements of the oil companies undertaking the development of the oil-bearing regions, numerous satellite companies have already been formed, while others are coming into being. Apart from this development, the economy of the various countries concerned is being radically altered by the scale of rentals and royalties paid by the oil companies to the rulers and Govern ments who had hitherto been, in the majority of cases, poor. In Iraq, for example, the revenue from the oil companies amounts to over a quarter of the income of the State at the present time, while in Bahrain the percentage is much higher. The Persian Government receive no less than £4,000,000 annually in royalties from the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, together with an additional sum in respect of income tax. This company employs nearly 60,000 Persians, the majority of whom were, until comparatively recently, nomadic tribesmen; many of these men have now become skilled artisans. 6. In Sa’udi Arabia, where development has only just begun, there are now over 8,000 men on the pay-roll of the Arabian American Oil Company. 7. The general standards of health, living and workmanship are being raised to a marked extent by the example set by the companies for their workmen. Furthermore, the activities of the companies have necessitated the introduction of better means of communications and the development of roads, in many cases in districts where, up to ten years ago, a motor car had never been seen. In this way the relations and outlook of the peoples of these countries are being profoundly altered. 8. It is inevitable that, as long as oil is required from the Middle Eastern fields, those regions will have a vastly increased importance in world affairs, and that, instead of being the preserve of the strategist and orientalist, they will become and remain an area of great and increasing concern to statesmen, economists, exporters and business men. P) For a detailed study of this question, see the Foreign Office memoranda entitled Ibn Saud s Claims in respect of the South-Eastern Frontiers of Sa’udi Arabia ” and “The South-Eastern Frontiers of Sa’udi Arabia.” Both memoranda bear the reference E 2203/2203/25 and are dated the 30th June, 1940.3 Eiiouj om tlif jj | titi siai if kiia; 1 —Egypt.

The geologists came to the conclusion that there would be little or no chance of discovering oil and did not recommend any test-drilling. 8 !$?&amp;*. $0 l * 0 III.-— Eritrea. 14 On the whole, Eritrea has but little attraction to offer. The only area of probable interest is that of the Dahlaq islands which lie to the east of Massawa, •i ^ Zlenda tx en erale Italiana Petroli began drilling operations on one of these islands two years or so before the outbreak of war. Some traces of oil were found, but the war caused operations to be abandoned before conclusive results could be obtained. IV .—British Somaliland. 15 . Geologists of the A.I.O.C. in 1918-1920 and of the Anglo-Saxon Petro leum Co. in 1931 made surveys of British Somaliland. In both cases it was decided that, although there were some seepages and a small anticlinal structure at Daga Shabell, some 30 miles south of Berbera, the prospects of commercial success were too remote to warrant drilling. 16 . In October, 1944 , however, the Somaliland Oil Exploration Company, an associated company of the Royal Dutch-Shell group, obtained an oil explora tion licence covering 27,000 square miles of the Protectorate (between one-third and one-half of the total area), including the Daga Shabell structure. The com pany is required to carry out a geophysical and topographical survey within two years. V.— Turkey. 17 . Indications of petroleum are fairly widespread in Turkey, there being seepages in European Turkey near the Sea of Marmara, in central and eastern Anatolia and in the southern and south-eastern parts of the country. [ 63 — 76 ] B 24 f ^e: la 1 [dl p I '* j K Jr 18. Drilling near the Sea of Marmara rendered only negative results, but the Maden Tetkik ve Arma Enstitiisii (M.T.A., the Institute of Mineral Research) has achieved a slight measure of success at Raman Dag, 10 miles south of Beshiri in the Siirt vilayet, in south-eastern Turkey. There are some geological structures there which are superficially promising, and one of the wells sunk by the M.T.A. has produced some oil. It is possible that oil may be found in other test wells in the neighbourhood, but the prospects of finding a reasonably large field cannot be said to be very encouraging. 19. The Turkish press has expressed the view that production from the Raman Dag field will be sufficient to meet home requirements, but this is open to doubt.

Owing, however, to war conditions, the company could not obtain the necessary drilling equipment, and the Palestine Government have agreed to the postponement of drilling until after the war or until materials can be obtained, whichever is the earlier. 22. Haifa is now of great importance as the Mediterranean terminal of the southern branch of the I.P.C. pipeline from Kirkuk. There is a large tank farm and there are ample loading facilities for tankers. 23. In addition, the large refinery operated by Consolidated Refineries, Ltd. (in which all the shares are held jointly by the A.I.O.C. and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., a Shell subsidiary) on the outskirts of Haifa treats crude oil from the I.P.C. field at Kirkuk; its capacity is being increased from 2,800,000 to 3,800,000 tons a year. The Shell and a number of other concerns have storage installations at Haifa. C T* / *^v5 f ® An. S . KfCV*. Corwyj/c.^ ,£o*vic VIII.— Syria. dts. 32. final /ea: anted t&lt; 33.

It holds a concession from the Syrian Government dated the 26th February, 1938, which was ratified by the French High Commissioner on the 25th March, 1940. 25. 1 he concession area covers the whole of the Syrian Republic north of the parallel running through Damascus (36 v IS'); it is approximately 63,000 square miles in extent. The concession provides for “ dead rent ” payments beginning at £15,000 (gold) per annum and rising to £80,000 (gold) per annum oyer a period of 15 years. Should oil be produced in sufficient quantities, royalties will take the place of these “ dead rent ” payments. At the expiration of the 15-year period, the company must either begin to export oil or abandon the concession. 26. Drilling operations were started in 1939 and continued until 1941, when the military situation in Syria brought the work to a standstill. Most of the drilling equipment was destroyed by the British military forces in order to deny its use to the enemy. The Syrian Government have granted the company a moratorium on drilling obligations which is to last until two years after the end of the war with Germany. 27. The results of the small amount of test-drilling carried out were inconclusive, but encouraging. 1 Tk Ira^ K T1 ’tpany (a iilajets of I acompan; 2 area to' t The taoaooo Irough D’ ^o-Saxo] y5 per c pdStat l^resentm I 36.

The British Oil Development Company, Ltd., obtained a concession from the Iraq Government in May 1932, for the areas west of the Tigris which the I.P.C. had relinquished in the previous year; this area covers some 43,500 square miles. The B.O.D. company represented a combine of certain British, French. Italian and German interests. Mosul Oilfields. Ltd., was formed in November 1932 to acquire the shares of the B.O.D. Company. 41. The Germans did some shallow drilling near Qayyara, during the last war, obtaining some heavy, viscous oil. The B.O.D. Company prospected and drilled in a number of areas, but although oil was struck at Qayyara, it was viscous and had a hight sulphur content. The terms of the concession, which included royalty at 4s. (gold) per ton, with a minimum annual payment of £200,000 (gold) (payable as “ dead rent ” until production started) and the obligation to construct and operate a pipe-line with a capacity of 1,000,000 tons a year or the provision of alternative means of transport, proved so onerous that the B.O.D. Company in 1937 disposed of its concession to the I.P.C. A new company, the Mosul Petroleum Company, was formed to operate this concession. Until the outbreak of war, the company had not succeeded in producing sufficient quantities of oil to justify the construction of a pipe-line, although oil of better quality than the Qayyara crude had been struck at Ain Zala, 42 miles north-west of Mosul. L T p to 1941 about 100 wells had been drilled, all of which, except one, were plugged as part of the denial measures undertaken by the British Military Authorities in 1941. 42/ In 1943, an agreement was signed by the Mosul Petroleum Company and the Iraq Government, under which a moratorium was granted from May 1941, to a date two years after the end of the war between Great Britain and Germany and Japan, whichever is the later, on all drilling and production obligations.

The moratorium agreement of 1943 also waived the drilling and aadisput production obligations of this company. m Kinsula. (iv) Khanaqin Oil Company, Ltd. 46. The Khanaqin Oil Co. was formed in 1925 in order to acquire from the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. (as it was then called)( 2 ) the oil-bearing area known as Naft Khaneh. The area in which this field is situated formerly belonged to Persia and formed part of the D’Arcy concession, but it was allocated to Turkey, together with a larger area north-east of Khanaqin, by the Turco-Persian Frontier Commission in 1913—14. The concessionary rights of the A.P.O.C. in these two areas were recognised first by the Turkish Government and later by the Govern ment of Iraq. 47. The capital of the Khanaqin Oil Co. is £1,000,000; all the shares so far issued are held by the A.I.O.C. 48. Production is from 3 high-pressure wells, and is at the rate of 200,000 tons per annum. The potential output is much higher. The crude oil is pumped from the field through a 25-mile pipe-line to a refinery at Alwand, 3 miles S.E. of Khanaqin. The products are marketed throughout Iraq bv the Rafidain Oil Co., another A.I.O.C. subsidiary. 49. Oil has also been found at Chiah Surkh, in the northern area that was transferred to Turkey, but the Khanaqin Oil Co., is not exploiting it at present.

In fact, a difference of opinion as to where the true frontier lies between Sa’udi Arabia and Qatar has already given rise to a dispute regarding a possible oil-producing area in the south of the Qatar JpcIllIlSlllcL. (ii) The Hijaz. 57. In 1926 the Idrisi, the then ruler of Asir, granted a concession to a Mr. Gooper covering the Farasan islands. Cooper sold this concession later to the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., a subsidiary of the Royal Dutch-Shell group which formed the Red Sea Petroleum Company to work it. Some drillim*- was done on Zifaf island, but the company encountered such difficulties with the Idrisi that it abandoned the enterprise in 1928. 58. In 1938 Petroleum Development (Western Arabia), Ltd., an associated company of the I.P.C., obtained a concession from Ibn Sa’ud covering the western part of the Hijaz to a depth of 100 kilometres from the coast, together with the Farasan and some other islands in the Red Sea. The company drilled a number of wells on Zifaf and on some of the other Farasan islands, but failed to find any oil. The concession was abandoned in 1943. 59. According to a recent press report (as yet unconfirmed), American interests are now negotiating for a concession covering the Hijaz. (iii) A sir. 60. In 1931 geologists of the A.I.O.C. examined Asir. They considered that the prospects of finding petroleum, though not entirely non-existent, were remote. Drilling would be very speculative. A L8 hn] (iv) The Neutral. Zone between Sa’udi Arabia and Iraq. 61. The treaty of Mohammerah which Iraq and Najd (now Sa’ndi Arabia) concluded in 1922 provided inter alia for the rhomboid known as at-Tawwal, which is situated between the two states, to be neutral ground. This area, which covers approximately 2,750 square miles, was defined (but not delimited) by straight lines joining the Shaib Auja and the wells of Amghar, Uqubba and Ansab. 62. Anyone wishing to obtain exploration and exploitation rights within this area has to get the said rights from the Governments of both Sa’udi Arabia and Iraq. The Arabian American Oil Co. has already, as stated above, obtained the grant of Ibn Sa’ud’s rights in that area, but it is not known whether the company has also approached the Iraq Government. 63. Any company obtaining a concession over this area would encounter difficulties because its boundaries have never been demarcated. 64. In view of recent discoveries of oil in the province of al-Hasa, it is thought that oil may also be found in the neutral zone. N.B.—For the neutral zone between Sa’udi Arabia and Kuwait, see paragraphs 70-72 below. n ft s tlieP r( iol# str a - i Co®P £ ' ?its. tif •f Arab' c Idesiroi licli the (vrtionof (v) Trans-A rabian Pipe-line. 65. The United States Government, the Arabian American Oil Company and the Gulf Exploration Company had under consideration the ambitious scheme of constructing a 1,200-mile pipe-line from Jabal Dhahran right across Arabia to the Eastern Mediterranean to either Haifa or Alexandria, with a feeder line from Kuwait and a possible branch to the Red Sea. If this project had been carried out, the Petroleum Reserves Corporation, a concern formed and controlled by the United States Government, would, by agreement with the two companies concerned, have constructed, owned and maintained the main pipe-line; the companies themselves would have constructed the gathering lines. The United States Government, however, are no longer likely to participate in this scheme, but it is nevertheless possible that the companies concerned may themselves put it into operation at a later date. ^ 66. Although the construction and maintenance of such a pipe-line would be feasible from the engineering point of view, it is clear that, unless a very large quantity of oil (minimum 6,000,000 tons per annum) could be guaranteed, the pipe-line would be unable to compete with the alternative means of transport provided by tankers. 67. From the strategic aspect, the construction of the pipe-line would have the following advantages :—* i difficul kulatio liied cour n. t acern (it iiatecom} 74.

Attempts to obtain an oil concession covering Kuwait date back as far as 1911, but none proved successful until 1934. On the 23rd December of the latter year the Shaikh of Kuwait granted a concession valid for 75 years for the whole of his territory (6,000 square miles), but excluding the neutral zone (see paragraphs 70-72 below), to the Kuwait Oil Company, Ltd. This company, which is registered in Great Britain, has a capital of £200,000; the shares are held in equal proportions by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. and the Gulf Exploration Company, a subsidiary of the Gulf Oil Corporation of Pennsylvania, U.S.A. The British Government have, by agreement with the concessionaire, a pre emption right over any oil produced during an emergency. 69. After an abortive attempt to find oil at Bahra, on the northern shore of Kuwait bay, two successful wells were drilled in 1938 at Burghan, 26 miles south of the town of Kuwait. Other productive wells were subsequently drilled, but operations were curtailed at the beginning of the war and were discontinued m 1942, when the British military authorities plugged the wells in order to deny their use to the enemy. It is now proposed to rehabilitate the wells and later to resume drilling operations. The reserves are known to be very large. Two on jetties have been constructed at Shuwaikh, 2^ miles west of Kuwait, and a refinery may be built.

Royalty is at the rate of Rs. 3/ - per ton; royalty payments will in time take the place of the rentals. This concession was originally granted to the A.I.O.C., but it was transferred to Petroleum Development (Qatar) on the 16th July, 1937. 79. This concession gave the holder the sole right to develop oil in the Qatar peninsula and throughout the Shaikh’s territory (4,000 square miles). 80. In 1935 His Majesty’s Government and the concessionnaire signed an agreement whereby the former obtained pre-emption rights over oil produced in Qatar in war time. 81. Drilling began in 1939 and continued until August, 1942, by which time 3 test wells had been completed in the Dukhan area near the west coast of the peninsula; promising shows of oil were obtained in two of these wells. Further operations were prevented by the measures taken by the British military authorities to deny oil to the enemy. 82. A scheme to resume drilling with two rigs and to produce oil at the rate of 1,000,000 tons a year is now under consideration, but it seems doubtful whether anything beyond the rehabilitation of the existing wells will be possible until after the war. 83. There are promising indications of petroleum in the southern part of the Qatar peninsula adjoining the Sa’udi Arabian border, but difficulty in the development of this region has already arisen, because of conflicting claims as to the precise frontier between the two states. This frontier has never been delimited. 92. lies iler P jfitaifl * imiaHy IceDce o] Irillwoul Ifij 0 b 93. ireranai jjments )[Rs:2,0&lt; smual pc ’ 94.

These small states, which are all British-protected, have special treaty relations with the British Government. (i) Abu Dhabi. 85. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. obtained from the Shaikh in 1936 a 2-year option over the whole of his territory (23,460 square miles). This option was later transferred to Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast), Ltd., which on the 11th January, 1939, obtained a concession valid for 75 years over the whole area. Rs. 3,00,000 were paid on signature. Annual payments are Rs. 1,00,000 until oil is discovered in commercial quantities. Royalty is to be at Rs. 3/- per ton w ith a minimum payment of Rs. 2,50,000 per annum for 2 years and Rs. 5,00,000 annually thereafter. 86. No work has yet been carried out.

The main provisions of the permit provide foi 1 geological surveys, the submission of geological reports to the Government, the right to drill shallow wells for geological data and the right to a prospecting licence. 101. In 1937-38 the company carried out an aerial survey of the Hadhra- maut and also made a ground survey. The results were not very promising, but the company is desirous of making a further examination, particularly of the Shabwa salt domes, when conditions permit this to be done. 102. On the outbreak of war the company informed the Governor of Aden that it was unable to continue surveys, as such work was not likely to further the war effort, and it therefore applied for a renewal of the licence (which was valid only for two years). The Governor accepted this plea, and has since granted further renewals of the licence. XIX.—The Yemen. 103. So far as is known, no oil concessions covering any part of the Yemen have ever been granted by the Imam Yahya. He is extremely averse to any foreign penetration into his country, and is therefore unlikely to grant any concession; he is, however, an old and sick man, and his successor may prove less obdurate. Prospects of finding oil are regarded as extremely poor (it will be recalled that a geological survey of Asir yielded disappointing results). 104. If any company succeeded in securing a concession in the Yemen, it would find it difficult to carry out prospecting or exploitation work in the eastern and north-eastern parts because of the absence of a demarcated frontier between the Yemen and Sa’udi Arabia. XX.— Persia. 105. At the present time Persia is producing far more oil than all the other Middle Eastern countries combined, and her reserves of petroleum are known to be extremely large; they may, however, be rivalled in time by the reserves in the oil-bearing regions of Kuwait, Sa’udi Arabia and Qatar bordering the western side of the Persian Gulf. So far, only the western and south-western regions of Persia have been extensively prospected and developed, and all the present production is from them. It is possible that the northern areas may also be found to contain important oilfields. upanies f south-e kian Go hrtki sore prosp m be said reasonably i 114.

The Persian Government granted the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company its present concession, which is valid until 1993, on the 29th April, 1933; this concession was subsequently approved by the Majlis and the Shah; it replaced the D’Arcy concession which the Persian Government had cancelled in 1932. 107. The A.I.O.C. was bound by the terms of the new concession to select by the end of 1938 one or more areas aggregating not more than 100,000 square miles situated to the south of a line drawn from the Perso-Iraqi frontier near Sulaimaniya to the Perso-Baluch frontier near Irafshan. The company selected its exploitation areas within the prescribed period. The main area, which is some 870 miles long and has an average width of 100 miles, extends from the Iraq frontier north of Qasr-i-Shirin to the entrance to the Persian Gulf ; it includes all the company’s existing oilfields, namely, the older fields of Masj id-i-Sulaiman and Haft Kel, the important new field at Gach Saran, the new producing areas at Agha Jari and Pazanun, and the small oilfield of Naft-i-Shah (the lasr- mentioned forms the eastern part of the structure wTdch the Khanaqin Oil Company, another A.I.O.C. subsidiary, is exploiting at Naft Khaneh in Iraq). 108. Production in 1938 amounted to 10,359,000 tons. Owing to war conditions, this level was not attained in subsequent years, but there is no reason, so far as the fields are concerned, why it should not be very greatly exceeded; in fact, plans are under consideration for substantially increasing production in the future. 109. The oil is conveyed by pipe-line from the main producing fields to the refinery at Abadan, which is one of the largest and most up to date in the world; the present capacity is over 11,000,000 tons a year. There is a large plant at Abadan for the production of aviation spirit.

A va ’Non, a %th e14 both the British and Soviet Governments protested strongly, the former because of the alleged infringement of the A.I.O.C.’s rights and the latter because of the terms of the 1921 treaty. In order to surmount the difficulty occasioned by this treaty, the Persian Government addressed a note on the 12 th December, 1921, to the Soviet Diplomatic Representative at Tehran to the effect that the Majlis desired the retrocession of Russian concessions to be without reserve or condition, and therefore asked for the treaty to be revised accordingly. On the same date the Soviet Diplomatic Representative sent a purposely vague reply. After stating that his Government had “ never sought to place any restriction upon the progress and prosperity of Persia,” he went on to say : “I would be prepared .... should friendly relations be maintained between the two nations, to promote negotiations with a view to a total or partial revision of these articles on the lines desired by the Persian Government, as far as the interests of Russia permit.” 117. As matters had reached a deadlock, the A.I.O.C. and the Standard Oil Company agreed to act together on a footing of equality, with the result that the latter acquired a 50 per cent, interest in North Persian Oils, Ltd. The two companies then sought jointly to secure the grant of a new concession, but the Persian Government refused, partly because of the difficulty with Soviet Russia and partly because a new competitor, the Sinclair Oil Corporation, had appeared on the scene (see paragraph 119 below). 118. Although North Persian Oils, Ltd. has never renounced its claims in northern Persia, it is now many years since it last attempted to press them. In 1935 the name of the company was changed to North Iranian Oils, Ltd. (b) The Sinclair Concession. 119. While the A.I.O.C. and the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey were making their joint endeavours to obtain a new concession, the Sinclair Oil Corporation opened negotiations with the Persian Government and succeeded in 1924 in securing a concession. This company failed to proceed with the matter because (i) it was unable to raise the necessary money for a loan to the Persian Government, (ii) charges of bribing certain Persian officials were brought against it, and (iii) the company’s prestige had been very adversely affected by its implication in the Teapot Dome scandal in the United States. (c) Societe Franco-Persane de Recherches. 120 . A Franco-Belgian group began negotiating for a concession in northern Persia in 1927 and formed the Syndicat des Etudes Franco-Persanes. This concern carried out some prospecting work, the results of which were sufficiently encouraging to lead to the formation, in 1930, of the Societe Franco- I ersane de Recherches. The new company sent out a party of geologists and engineers and sank a shallow well at Naft Chal, in Mazandaran, a few miles from the Caspian coast. Late in the same year, however, all operations were abandoned because of difficulties encountered with the Persian and Soviet Governments. (d) The Amiranian Concession. 121. In 1936 the Seaboard Oil Company of Delaware, U.S.A., with a view to possible operations in Persia, formed a subsidiary, the Amiranian Oil Company, m which it took up 50 per cent, of the shares, the remaining 50 per cent, being allocated to the Texas Corporation. 122 . On the 3rd January, 1937, the Persian Government granted the miranian Oil Company an oil concession valid for 60 years in north-eastern and eastern Fersia. this concession was subsequentlv approved by the Majlis. Its terms, which followed very closely those of the A.I.O.C. concession of 1933, bound the company to select within 3 years exploitation areas not exceeding 100,000 square miles in the aggregate from an exploration area covering 200,000 square miles. Although the greater part of this exploration area was in Khurasan, 4,500 square miles of it were m the adjacent province of Astarabad (now known as liurgan), and so to this extent overlapped the Khostharia concession. Yd , when tile Soviet Government heard of the grant of this concession, e ' N f°^ e ins t ea d of basing this protest, as might have been expected, on the infringement of article XIII of the 1921 treaty they objected on he grounds that the existing good neighbourly relations between the two “rfi rl fC and be t neflt u c ? n f erred o n Persia by‘the Soviet Government, had e titled them at least to be informed in advance of the granting of the conces- sion, which if granted to the nationals of certain other countries, might have been a matter of serious concern to them. ;e£ el r t*® ^01 n j because Wily ^ Ti- I 1 \lkfy 1 [126.

It soon became apparent after the arrival of M. Kavtaradze in Tehran that the real object of his visit was to negotiate for the granting of an oil concession in northern Persia. When M. Kavtaradze made his official request for this concession, the Persian Prime Minister informed him that the Govern ment had already decided to postpone until after the war the question of granting oil concessions covering any part of Persia. M. Kavtaradze and the Soviet Embassy thereupon put such pressure on the Persian Government that it was forced to resign, despite the fact that it had the backing of public opinion. The new Cabinet followed the same policy as its predecessor in regard to the oil question, and on the 2nd December, 1944, the Majlis passed a Bill tabled by one of the Deputies to prevent the Prime Minister or any other member of the Government from entering into negotiations with any foreign Government or company or from signing any concession or agreement relating to oil. 134. Foiled in his attempt to secure the concession, M. Kavtaradze left Tehran for Moscow on the 9th December. It now remains to be seen whether the Soviet Government will return to tho charge. 135. From a survey of the long and extremely complicated history of north Persian oil, certain points clearly emerge :— 1 (i) If any non-Russian firm or group applied for an oil concession in the north, it seems extremely probable that the Soviet Government would put such pressure on the Persian Government as to render it most difficult, if not impossible, for its application to be granted. (ii) Even if Soviet approval or abstention from opposition could be secured, any firm attempting to exploit the concession would, if it discovered large quantities of oil, be confronted with the difficulty of finding a satisfactory way of transporting this oil. The only natural outlet for north Persian oil is via the Caucasus, and it seems in the highest degree unlikely that the Soviet Government would agree to such oil being transported to western markets via Baku and Batum, since it would thereby be competing with products from those centres. The only alternative would be a long and very costly pipe-line over the Elburz and Zagros mountains to the Persian Gulf. (iii) The petroleum requirements of northern Persia would not, in them selves, be sufficient to justify the heavy expenditure on drilling and on the erection of a refinery that would be required; moreover, it must be borne in mind that most of the marketing for this region is already being done by the A.I.O.C. with products from its Naft-i-Shah field which are refined at Kermanshah. Furthermore, Soviet-Russian competition m this market might at any time be revived. (iv) It would thus seem that north Persian oil could be exploited only by the Soviet Government or by some Persian or other concern in which they had a large interest. ! !®ii$ing session 141 last, it ii iough r * this sin | Baku. 142. imon.

In 1927 the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (as it was then called) was unofficially offered a concession covering Afghanistan, but it declined the offer on the grounds that the Tirpul area near Herat, where there were oil indications, was in the Russian economic sphere and that the inaccessibility of the area made it commercially unattractive. The Burmah Oil Company and the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company likewise considered the possibility of taking up a concession in Afghanistan, but they also gave up the idea, because the remoteness of the area rom seaboard would have rendered development work extremely costly, while, if oil were found the cost of a pipe-line to some point on the coast of Makran or the Persian Gulf would be very high. , 1^:, Undeterred by these objections, two United States companies, the Sea- ^ Company of Delaware and the Texas Corporation, formed a joint concern called the Inland Exploration Company of America with a capital of $5,050,333 or the purpose of negotiating for and exploiting a concession in Afghanistan. A concession agreement was signed by representatives of the Afghan Govern ment and the company m Berlin on the 19th November, 1936. This agreement was modified in Kabul on the 18th January, 1938, in order to embody certain of re provisions of the Amiranian Oil Company’s concession in Persia, which were more favourable to the Government.

TTnlnl 42 ' p ^ B l kn ollfie l lds are by far the richest in the whole of the Soviet (a) Crude Oil. The bulk of the crude oil produced is refined in Baku- o the remainder, some is piped to Batum for treatment there, while the rest is taken by sea to Makhach-Kala whence it is sent partly ... „. b y Pipe-line and partly by rail to Grozny for refining. P ' (b) Finished Products. Part of the kerosene refined at Baku is conveyed to Batum by pipe-line. The rest of the kerosene and the other finished products are disposed of m the following manner : (i) Rail to Batum (ii) Kail to Grozny, Rostov and beyond, (iii) Tanker to Makhach-Kala and thence by pipe-line and rail to Grozny and beyond, (iv) Tanker to Astrakhan and thence by river tanker and barge up the Volo-a. The Baku crude oil refined at Grozny is similarly dealt with, some being piped or sent by rail to Rostov and beyond and some being piped to Makhach-Kala, whence iji is shipped to Astrakhan for onward transport by Volga tanker (there is a short pipe-line from the Volga roadstead, near the mouth of the river, to a point iust to the north of Astrakhan). (ii) Grozny. 143. The Grozny fields seemed at the outset to offer great possibilities, and refineries of very large capacity were therefore erected to treat the oil produced. Production, however, fell very far short of the estimates, and the surplus refining capacity at Grozny has since been used to deal with Baku oil. 144. Before the war Grozny production amounted to 2,700,000 tons a year or 8-5 per cent, of the total for the Soviet Union; production in 1944 is estimated at 2,800,000 tons. 145. In pre-war days there was a pipe-line from Grozny to Rostov and Trudovaya. It is not known whether this pipe-line is again in operation along its entire length (667 miles). (iii) Maikop. 146. The Maikop fields produced some 2,500,000 tons of good quality oil before the war. This oil was refined partly at Krasnodar and partly at Tuapse. The Maikop fields suffered very severely as a result of military operations in that area; in consequence, production in 1944 is estimated at only 100,000 tons. * L18 (iv) Embar-Dossor. 147. Production in these fields rose from 650,000 tons in 1938 to an estimated total of 1,000,000 tons in 1944. The crude oil is conveyed by pipe-line to the refineries at Orsk and Guriev. (v) Trans-Cas'pia. 148. The field at Neftedag to the south-east of Krasnovodsk produced 436,000 tons in 1938; production in 1944 is estimated at 1,600,000 tons. The oil is conveyed by rail to Krasnovodsk and thence by tanker across the Caspian to Baku and Makhach-Kala for treatment. 149. The Baku oilfields have now been exploited for oyer 60 years and fears of their approaching exhaustion have often been entertained. However, new wells drilled in the shallow waters of the Caspian near Baku have proved success ful and further drilling elsewhere in that region has revealed more extensive reserves than were for long supposed to exist. Nevertheless, the possibility of the exhaustion of the Baku fields within a measurable period of time and the not unnatural desire to avoid having “too many eggs in one basket” have caused the Soviet Government to make strenuous efforts to discover 4 ‘ a second Baku.” The Grozny fields have proved very disappointing, and the extensive deposits in the Emba-Dossor-Ufa regions, though promising, have not yet come fully up to expectations. In addition, there is the Soviet desire to discover and exploit oil in regions to the east of Baku, in view of the general development of Soviet industry in the east. 150. For all these reasons, the Soviet oil experts have for long had their eyes on a number of hitherto unexploited regions in the Soviet Union and also in northern Persia, where there are, as already stated, extensive indications of petroleum.

Of |these four companies, the Iraq Petroleum Co., Ltd., is the oldest and the biggest concern. -hio company is an international consortium ropresentativf of the British, American, French and Dutch interests. Out of the total capital ol’i 14,500,000 issued by the company, 5% is held by the original concessionaire, . an Arnenlan Millionaire named Gulbenkian, and the remaining 9b per cent is divided equally, between she British i( The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Ltd.), the French (Canpagnic,Francaise des 'Petroles), the Dutch (Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co., Ltd.), 'the American (StandardjOil Company of new Jersey and Seeony-Vaccun S' Oil Company), Oil Companies. This Company acquired, in March 1931, from tne Iraq Government a concession for the exploitation a ‘ n a( } -'• r! an area of about 32,000 square miles, east of the river Tigris, excluding the Basrah vilayet transferred 'territories. The original concession, acquiree m 1925, by the Turkish Petroleum Company, (•Vuill June 1928, the Iraq Petroleum Company Ltd., -as known as Turkish Petroleum Company Ltd.) was found unwor. ^b .e due o the complexities of the plot system an ^ trieroX ore » Biven in 1931 # in favour of the newconeossion. ’P' , ' h S p°npany scartod producing oil ,i»i;.j.&gt;dj.atoly^ production was not very encouraging at the start*heing only 1,043,000 tons In 1924 , • •' • ' ' .- tt.f'r;; r u ...

To arrange tne supply of this oil to European countries, the Company in 1933 constructed a pipeline, 1150 miles long, at a cost of £ 10 millions, from Kirkuk, on ; v i. ?“ the eastern eank oi. the Tigris, to the Mediterranean coast., with two terminals, one at Haifa in Palestine (613 miles) and another at Tripoli in Syria (531 milos).

The refinery is fully equipped and is at present’ producing, besides other things, aviation spirit used for aeroplanes. In Juno 1940, an important development in the world war, l'he capitulation'of Trance, adversely affected the; fortunes of the Company. The pipeline - &gt; r»' • ■ to Tripoli in French Syria, could no longer be used for the supply of oil to ?he west. The passage.' of oil was thus reduced. The production declined in J- - -•; s. . ‘ • • • 1940 to 2,495,728 tons-, about 16 per cent less than the 1939 figure. In 1943, however, there was some recovery, production figures being 27 million barrels or about 4 lakh tons. &lt; ‘ . The Iraq Petroleum Company only operates in ajn area of 32,000 square miles, hut of a total area of 1,16,#00 square miles of the whole country. The rest of the area is divided between three companies &gt;■— the Mosul 0 ill ields Ltd., the Basrah Petroleum Company Ltd., and the KhanaQin Oil Company L x. --4- Tho Mosul Oil-Fiolds Company^ under the terns of a concossion dated 28th May 1932, operates In an area of 46,000 square miles, west of the rivor Tigris* Since 1934 * ' It has been producing oil In increasing quantities. The total production in 1938 was 29000 tons. But the company has not yet succeeded In exporting oil. The Khanaqin Oil Company Ltd,, is a subsidiary company of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,created in 1925 to acquire from the latter oil bearing properties on the borders of Persia and Iraq. The territory in which the company operates previously belonged to' Persia and was transferred to Turkey, just before the last world war, broke out, by the Turko-Persian Frontier Delimitation .0 '; i o; Commission, The Anglo-Perslan Oil Company having obtained c c - • f'J ; j - an oil concession for the whole of Persia, in 1901, owns exploratory rights in this territory as well.

The government derives a huge,-sun from oil royalties- on an average - they account for about 16 per cent of the total income of the government. But even apart from royalty payments, the oil industry has conferred numerous other benefits on the country. It has provided employment and high wages to thousands of labourers, has :;r trained technical personnel, opened up roads, built neVT' towns, and estaollshoit industries. The purchasing power of the people has increased and trade has become more brisk. IJew markets have been opened and banking facilities have grown.

At the centre of the discussions are talks which took place in Washington DC between US and UK government officials looking at the global importance of oil, which focused particularly on oil in the Middle East.The talks concluded with the production of a memorandum of understanding which was published 8 August 1944 as the Agreement on Petroleum between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, otherwise known as the Anglo-American Oil Agreement (1945).Also included in the volume is correspondence between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Charles Geoffrey Prior), the Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department (Olaf Kirkpatrick Caroe), the India Office, and His Majesty’s Minister at Jeddah (Stanley Jordan) regarding two proposed pipelines. The first being the ‘trans-arabian pipeline’ which it was proposed would link the Middle East to the Mediterranean. The proposal was initially postponed owing to heavy criticism of it in the United States press but was later taken up by the Arabian American Oil Company (ARAMCO). The second proposal from the Bahrain Petroleum Company (BAPCO) and the California Arabian Standard Oil Company (CASOC, later renamed ARAMCO) was for a pipeline to take crude oil from Dhahran [Aẓ-Ẓahrān], Saudi Arabia to the BAPCO refinery at Bahrain.Also included is correspondence between the Chief Local Representative for BAPCO (Milton H Lipp, Ward P Anderson) and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave) regarding possible sites for the pipeline and the reservation of required land. Further discussion centred on the question of the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, which was in dispute, and whether His Majesty’s Government should look to tackle the matter at that time with the Saudi Arab Government or wait until the progress of the oil companies required its resolution. Jabal Naksh and Khor-al-Odaid [Khawr al ‘Udayd], which were claimed by Qatar and Abu Dhabi respectively, and whose claims were supported by His Majesty’s Government but contested by Saudi Arabia were discussed as being key areas in the frontier dispute.Another matter discussed in the volume was a visit paid by the Mission of the Petroleum Reserves Corporation to the Middle East. The Mission’s purpose was to review resources of petroleum in the Middle East and its itinerary included visits to Kuwait, Dhahran, and Bahrain. The mission was headed by Everette Lee Degoyler and also included the eminent geologists and petroleum experts Dr George Martin Lees, William Embry Wrather, and John Herhold Murrell.Other matters touched on in the volume include a request by ARAMCO to undertake a hydrographic survey of the coast line of the Kuwait Neutral Zone; the possibility of resuming oil field production in Qatar and Kuwait provided the necessary equipment could be obtained from the USA; articles published in American journals and newspapers regarding the global oil situation and oil in the Middle East; and a visit paid by Major Frank Holmes to Kuwait in 1944.Also included in the volume are a number of notes and memorandums relating to oil in the Middle East:notes produced at an oil conference in Cairo in 1944 which described oil production in Bahrain and Kuwait, they contained a number of inaccuracies and were re-written by the Political Agents for Bahrain and Kuwait with assistance from the Chief Local Representatives of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and the Kuwait Oil Company;The future of oil in its relation to the Middle East; memorandum produced by Arthur Charles Hearn, Admiralty, 11 October 1940 (ff 9-21);Note on present oil position in Persian Gulfby Commodore John Montagu Howson, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf (ff 103-104 );Memorandum on the oil concessions in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf,by the External Department, India Office, 13 Mar 1944 (ff 126-134);A survey of the oil resources in the Middle East(With map and graph), Research Department, Foreign Office, 28 Feb 1945 (ff 239-250);Iraq Oil(ff 257-267).A series of file notes which were maintained as a record of the correspondence in the volume can be found at folios 272-283.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Reserves Corporation</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>United States Federal Government</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, Secretary to the External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Jabal Naksh</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Dhahran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khor-al-Odaid</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Pipelines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0002a2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
