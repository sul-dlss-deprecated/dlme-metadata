I would therefore request you to kindly intimate if the economic conditions in Persian Gulf and Mekran Districts have also altered so as to necessitate taking up the matter in order to bring the scale of pay of officials jin Persian r 'ulf and Mekran districts to the level of the Bombay scale of pay sanctioned for the officials serving in the Bombay Preside™ . The present scale of the officials is Rs *50“ c i0'*60''3”105—5'“140. In addition to this they get special pay of Ro.60 P.M.

Po d Agent, Bahrain.Bahrein, Novr. 21st, 1932• From To The Sub Postmaster, Bahrain. The Director of ^osts end Telegraphs, Karachi. Through The Superintendent of Post Offices, Lower Sind and Persian Gulf Division, Karachi. Sir, '”ith reference to your No x. 22 dated 15th Septr. 1932 to the address of the uperintendent of ost Offices, L.' &amp; 1 . .division, 'arac i nd his No. ^.6 dated 14.9.32 in reply to my pred oessors Ho. 181 dated 15.8.32, which was submitted through the Political Agent, Bahrain, I beg to say that the cogent i.nd plausible re* sons (os mentioned by the Superintendent of ost Offices, 'erachi in his above mentioned letter; have already been furnished in my nre eceasors letter referred to above, as also in several other representations mad' to the Superintendent of Post Of ices, Karachi on the same subject from time to time. however, as no results have so far been achieved, I now beg to submit this my r-etition for an increase in the special pay for 3; arein, 2. You ere no doubt aware that in the past the snecial pay drewn by the Pub ostmast r, Bahrain was its 60/-- 2 - but it is very regreteble to now find thet this has of late been reduced to the low fii??ure of ks 15/-• This works out to a 75/ cut in special pay alone. In this connection I sight mention that in the other Gulf stations such o high percentage in the reduction of the specie! pay hns not been effected and in view of this, you will appreciate that so high a cut in the case of fahrein alone would seem most unreasonable more so as the living here is far more costlier th n at the other Gulf stations. 3. The conditions of service in the Gulf are different to those obtaining in India and as it is obvious that these import nt f.cts have been overlooked at the time the reductions in the special pay were reeommende at hrain end passed without even consulting the olitical ^gent at Bahrain. I give below for your inform tion a few of the hardships we it Bahrain have to face. (a) The imhealthiness of the elinate. (b) The necessity of nuantaining double establishments. (c) The very high cost of living compared to India &amp; other Gulf stations (d) T t' is the most distent station from India. I am afr-dd thet on paper the above instances would not seem to be v ry convincing but if one were actually to spend a few weeks in these parts he would surely not require any further conviction. r.nd for all these hardships what compensation does one get for service in Bahrain which is really ’foreign*’ service? A meagre its 15/- as special pay. Surely no one would willingly come so many hundreds of miles away from his home to undergo all these hardships in the ports, aid it is on this account that T am compelled to put up my case for a reconsideration of the question of the special T ^a r to dr nr? in.4 -3- • The s^eciel ray drawn by the Tub j ostrnaster r t ’'naeat, wadnr, esni, Turbot, Janjgur and Ormrra prior to the cut were its 50/~, Rs 60 - 60/- 50/- 60/- and 50/- respectivcly but now stand at Rs 25/- 40/- 40/- 40/- 40/- and 50/- including compensatory allowances. From the above it ill be seen how unfavourably Bahrain compares with the other stations in spite of the fact that Bahrain is much more expensive to live. 5. .It might not be out of rlace to mention here hunshi of Bahrain axtro arawrf special pay at R$ 20/- n.m. though this is also considered too low for such a costly station but whet seems most unreasonable is to find that the Sub hostmaster actually ks 5/- less than A his subordinate, a fact which seems to have escaped ev rybody T s notice. 6 . In re ly to your letter To. TX. 2 dated 23.6.32, addressed to the Superintendent of 'ost Offices, Karachi, in which you have mentioned that 'nay of the Lower Livision clei in the olit cal dent, is Es 150/- and he gets a gulf allowance of Rs 25/- i.e., l/6th of the average nay. 'he average of a time scale clerk in our department is Rs 100/- and he gets Rs 20/- including water allowance which is l/Sth* I beg to say that the reply already given by the late sub postmaster Bahrain was just to the point. Moreover I m ke it more clear and beg to submit as follows )a) The lower division clerical staff in the oliticai deportment get the nlf pay and start from k* 10o/- on the contrary ostal staff in Gulf get Indian and ray and start from its 50/- i.e., they .ret double the nay compered w to what we get as starting nay (even then they get more special pay and house rent allowances etc.) (b) 'liile we look to the clerical staff of the CommisionerCommisioner in ind ?. nd that of the Kar chi ^ost offices, v/e find that the nostol staff is comneretivciy well paid. But here the thing is quite different. (cj should be ren mbered that during the tirce v.hen Gulf was unaer tne r'ombay circle we were drawing the ^ombay . .0 pay but since the r ulf has come under the Sind and Baluchistan circle, we have been given Karachi ''.P.0, pay i.e., its 10/- less than what we drew before. (c) The pay of the cleri al staff of the iolit.cal department in the 'hiIf has very often been revised but as we were put in the K rachi scale of nay we were instead of having the increment in pay given the increment in the special pay only. It is now an obvious fact that the comparison with the allowances drawn b r the clerical staff of the oliticel department in the uif is awfully groundless. 7. - s regards post 1 work. I beg to say that owing to its trade etc Bahrain is a very busy and important station. The work owing to the exp? nding operation of the Bahrain petroleum Co. and the introduction of the ; ir -ail service h? s greatly been increased end is being increased day by day. The work can be estimated from the stamp sole whose monthly average is about Rs 1500/-. B. It is understood that the old hands of the Gulf have since been drawing the special pay at previous ri to and the, present reduction is only applicable to those officials who have been newly appointed to the Gulf service. If this is the case, I , havin already served in the Gulf for about IS to 14 years s,since the time of the war) : nd being senio&gt;(r(es regards Gulf services) to those who are drawing the ore.special pay, surely deserve the same special nay (viz. a 60/-) which T drew in the past when I way in-5- in B- lirain in 19S0. Altongh T remained on leave for 13 months and about o year or more in the Lower Sind division, my claims to the previous r ulf service should not be over looked for considering the sneoial pay, 9, In vie?/ of the facts set forth above, T most resuectfully solicit the favour of your kindly taking up the matter nd recommencing mo for the said special pay at r s 60/- per month as nreviously drawn by ' , e.

To The Director of Posts and Tel egra phs, KAR ACHI ♦ *- Sir, I have the honour to refer to a letter dated the 21st November from the j&gt;ub postmaster 5 Bahrain regarding the local allowances of-this branch. It would be out of place for me to intervene in affairs which do not concern me, but since the affatrs of the post cffice at Bahrain are closely bound up with the agency an expression of my views will not be altogether out of place It is essential that an able and intelligent man should hold this isolated and responsible post. The last incumbent was neither able nor intelli 'ent and -reat inconvenience was caused to this Agency and the public there by, and also, I believe, the Postal Department itself. If Bahrain is to receive smaller local allowances than trifling ports such as Gwadur-, Pasni, Turbat and Panjgur,how can we hope that able men will be willing to come here? The need for an able man was never greater than at present, when the air mail has added immensely to the work and the connection with the hasa mails will still farther increase it. The expense of living at Bahrain is both great and owing to the activities of the Bahrain Petroleum Company increasing and on this score alone a higher local allowance than the r.ekran ports would be justifiable. I trust you will be good enough to see that the mafcfe matter is placed on a more equitable footing for at present^ the post Paster not only compares very unfavourably with the Kesidency lower division cadre but also his colleagues doingdoing less important work in cheaper places* I have the honour to he, Sir, Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrain.Political Agency, Bahrain,txie 13th May 1933 i The Sub Foot Master, Bahrain.

He was earning Rs 40/ p.ra. in private service in Pasni before coming to Bahrain but he accepted the appoint ment in the P*0. in the hope that his prospects would be much better in Govt, service.

January 23rd, 1934 My dear Prior, I wonder if you could put a word in the ear of the Post Master General (I do not know him personally as Sams has left) about (a) the special pay of the Sub Post Master here and (b) the dreadful state of the Sub Postmasters quarters. 2. The Sub Post Master used to get a special pay of Rs.60, but you will remember that it was reduced and now stands at Rs.25 a month. The responsibility of his work has increased considerably owing to the Air Mail, the postal arrangements with Hasa and the development of the oil field. It is most desirable to keep the personnel content. 3. The Sub Post Master’s quarters were in disrepair when you were here - they are now in a perfectly disgraceful state, great patches of gutch have fallen away, paintwork untouched and so on. I resent having such a building in the Agency Compound and it brings us and our Postal Department into disrepute. I am sure that if a responsible official of the Posts and Telegraphs Department saw it he would not permit such a state of things to continue for a moment. Writing letters to Karachi, official or demi-official, produces no result. 4. if you can help in these matters, I should be so grateful Yours sincerely,Indian Posts and Telegraphs Department.

From tne 1st week of Jan uary 1934, however, the Pest oound air rails have been ar riving on Fridays instead of Thursdays. Owing to this change in the programme of the Westward aeroplane, the Post Office has no clay left for a holiday throughout the week, Saturdays,Sundays,! ondays and Tuesdays are mail days owing to the arrival and departure of up and down mail steamers. The air mails for East and West bound services are closed on Wednesdays and hursdays, and the air mails from European countries and Inaia are received on Thursdays and Fridays. I shall be grateful if you will kindly either appoint one day to be observed by us as a Post Office holiday (whether it may be a mail day or not) or grant an ^overtime allowance for me and my staff for the work performed by us on Sundays. It will not be out of place to mention here that owing to these same reasons the post office had to be kept open on Christmas, the Mew Year, and the Idd day. i shall be much obliged if you will consider the above days when granting overtime allowance.

V ‘Al % My dear Colonel, Tills is a delated reply to your letter regarding the Sub -Postmaster at Bahrain and his allowances. Unfortunately Ryan died before I could see him and his successor, Eewoor, v/as on tour arid has only recently come up to Simla. 1 had a long talk with him end the results are surprising. In the first place there is no question what ever of discrimination against Zafar Husain in particular or Bahrain in general. The reason for trie dirirunltion in the Bahrain allowances as compared with Ormara, Pasni, and Gwadur is due to the Residency ( indirectly ) an cl to no one else. It appears that when the question of local allowances for the Gulf was tarsn up, they addressed the Residency and enquired what local allowances we gave our staff there, and on hearing that people of approxi mately the same scale as the Postmaster (the Gulf Lower Divldon' drew only Rs.25 local allowance, they decided that this sum 'would be all that could be justified for their own staff. The reason that Srmara, Pasni and Gwadur received a high rate of allowance was apparently the result of a reference to the A. G.G.Baluchistan which elicited the fact that their allowances were on a higher scale. This was of course most unfortunate and most unfair, and I will return to this point later.- 2 - I drew Bewoor’s attention to the fact that Bahrain was a snecially onerous and responsible post and he said that all that they could do was, if the work in a place increased, to give the Postmaster more staff and this was what they had done. He now had an extra clerk whereas Ormara, Pasni etc. probably had none. If the work increased still more they would give him another clerk, but they could not consider any allowance for this as it was contrary to their principles. The Postmaster was in the 50-150 scale of pay and so long as he remained in it that was all he could be paid, apart from local allowances which would be fixed in consultation with the local Government. I pointed out to Bewoor that the Agency were very deeply interested in the Postmaster supplied by his Department,to an extent which he could not realise from ordinary Indian practice. I told him that the lunatic they supplied us with before Zafar Husain retunied(and who attempted to convert me to the Qadiani sect,)had been an unmitigated nuisance, but that the Post Office had taken a very long time to remove him. I said that in cienl- these circumstances, 'when ve got a Postmaster who was effigy well versed in the local languages,which was most important and persona grata with the local inhabitants and the Agency, we did our utmost to retain him and that I believed that a contented Postmaster was in the best interests both of his Department and ourselves, and that if he received a-3- a local allowance considerably less than his colleagues in far more salubrious resorts, he could only be dis contented. Bevvoor said that they had a very large cadre and that they made no attempt to even out the unpleasant nesses of one post as compared with the attractions of another, and that if Zafar Husain did not like to stay at Bahrain, there were plenty of others who could be posted there and who would stay two or three years and would then be replaced by others. I pointed out that this might suit Indian practice hut was a very unwise arrangement for the Gulf, as it took a man a long time to settle in,fthat he received many communications, both in Arabic and in Persian, and ought to know both lan guages if he was to pull his weight. He admitted that there ms some force in this argument. Bewoor said that Zafar Husain belonged (I think) to the Sind Circle and must be bound by its conditions tUr,.! tnat it was not possible to create a special scale i or the Postmaster at Bahrain alone, and that ultimately ne would have to return to Sind when he reached the top of his scale, if he desired any promotion to a selection grade. He then referred again to the question of allow ances and said that y in putting up these questions to the rinonce Department^they were always guided by what local Governments naid to their officers and that they would have great difficulty in trying to get anything different sanctioned* I pointed out that had they used the yard stick of one Administration to decide the question of.A ' Y.. allowances In the Gulf and Mekran, the result would have been even, bit that they hatf* used those of one local Government for the Gulf and another for Mekran, which was fur* grossly unfair. I told him that.clerks in the Gulf received a specially high rate of pay for being in the Gulf and that it was a pure fluke that a portion of their pay load been rated as Gulf allowance and that it might quite easily all have been merged in their scale of pay. I added that their Postmaster who was a responsible officer / handling large sums of money, was now receiving no more than the lowest paid clerk in the Bali rain Agency at the hottora of the Lower-Division time-scale, a man who fU probably had not a fifth of the service that 4 Postmaster had. I told Bewoor that by hook or by crook he had got to arrange that Bahrain had a contented Postmaster who was not worse oft than colleagues in more salubrious places around the corner, and he has promised to take up the matter with the Residency and see what can be done. You will seethat tne whole question turns evidently on the greater local allowance given to what must be Balu chistan officials in Pasni or Ormara and the unfortunate chance that although the Gulf cadre are probably much more highly paid, only a very small portion of their pay is described as a local allowance. The real point is of course that the Bahrain Postmaster is on the Karachi^ ^ scale of pay and is only given Rs.25 a month (the price t servant in Bahrain) for leaving his country and going some2,000 miles to a pestilential climate. He should of course receive at least 50 per cent over his Kar-aeM pay,and in the case of our cadre this fact has been recognised and a higher rate of pay allowed for. I enclose a duplicate copy 'in case you wish to send it to the Residency who would now be referred to by 3ewoor. I think it would be a good plan if thay first of alx got into touch»witb Baluchistan and dis covered who their peoole are in Mekran who receive local allowances and their rates of pay as comoared with their Mekran allowances. No doubt they are people who normally serve in Baluchistanfwho have to be heavily bribed to keep them even in the comparatively healthy climate of Mekran. Lt.Col.

Also the inauguration of the Bi-weekly iiir kail service ana the extension of Daily mail service between iiofuf, q^-tif and Bahrain of late have immensely multiplied the duties of the Bub-Postmaster.

I recommend that (when the incumbents are from India) the special pay of the Sub-Postmaster should be restored to Hs.GO/- a month and that the special pay of his Assistant should be raised to fe»3G/- on the grounds given in the following paragraphs. 3# The responsibility and onerous nature of the work (a) The coming of the air mail to the Arab Coast and its extension recently to two aeroplanes each way weekly, (b) the establishment of an exchange of postal matter with 3a’udi Arabia, at first weekly and now daily, and Sir, has been greatly increased in the past two or three years by*® C H ^ (c) the opening up of the Oil Field of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited* 4. Local conditions necessitate an acquaintance with Arabic and Persian, and call for a man who can make himself p erson a grata both to the mixed local populace and also to the British and American Community. It is not easy to give satisfaction in such circumstances arid it is desirable that every effort should be made to fill these appointmenta by men suited to them and to keep them content. / 5. There is also a political aspect of the matter. It is important to avoid giving sny handle for complaint against British institutions* as our position in the Persian Gulf is open to continual attack and we cannot afford to allow any part of cur defences to be weakened or lost. 6 . Apart from these grave considerations there are others which carry weight*- (a) the climate which is well known to be pestilential, (b) the increase in the cost of living due to the establishment of an oil field, and (c) the social and domestic difficulties which are inseparable from a post so far from India, fox* example, the lack of schooling for children. 7. For these reasons, political and administrative, I venture to emphasize the pressing need that the Postal Authorities should be in a position to choose men with the special qualifications for service in Bahrain and to keep them content there. I trust, therefore, that you will feel able to support my recommendation that the special pay of the Sub-postmaster and assistant should be fixed (when recruited.., m© recruited from India) respectively at &amp;.60A arxd Hs# 30/- a month# I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut,Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain* ■— i'Ho.1788-14/3.

I am,sir, working as an ordinary postman in the Bahrein post-office since x last five years and have neven^enjoyed ray privilege leave also. I applied for leave in June 1937, through the post-roaster of this post-office and it is about seven months that I have not been relieved. The post-master in the first instance stated that he is not the authority to sanction the leave but when he h&amp;3 received such sanction from the Sind officers to relieve me immediately after engaging some other man on Rs. 24-0-0, he is deliberately avoiding to do so. This sanction has been received on December 25, 1937. Very recently I received a telegram from my place and I requested him to leave me now but with no affect. The fact is, sir, that my mother is sick since last few months with no one to take care of her in such a time. This would work more on her health and the consequences may be still worst if I do not reach in time. There will be so many people .to accept this job of an ordinary postman on Bs. 24—0—0 and it^ssyond imagination why the post master persits in not leaving me. No other postal authority is over here whom I can approach in this connection and this has necessitated to request you to help me and I am sure, sir, that I shall have my way out.

I need not go into much detail here, but briefly the facts are that after months (and years) of agitation we managed to get Karachi to send the Assistant Superintendent to see things for himself at Bahrain at the end of January last. He acknow- * ■ • /(/&gt; nh ledged to me that a considerable increase of staff was essential and that a move to some other building was necessary. Since then nothing whatsoever has happened and the whole thing is a public scandal, xhe unlucky Postmaster does his best and works enor mous hours daily in a most inadequate building, and quite frankly I anticipate he will break down very soon unless he does get some help* 3. I feel that unless Karachi does something effective in the very near future I shall have to take the law into my own hands. We in Bahrain spend a good deal of effort in attempting to ensure reasonable conditions of employment for Indians here, and yet at my own door-step^ I see a man employed by a Govern ment department having to work at a pressure and under conditions which would cause a violent outcry if they were imposed by any business firm in India. Apart from this I do not suppose that even the Posts and Telegraphs would really like to see Bahrain office break down completely owing to the exhaustion of the mea gre staff provided here. Now that the hot weather is on us this is a very possible outcome unless they do something pretty quick ly* The Hobble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Care of Postmaster, KARACHI. Yours sincerely,To H.B. Ms Foliticcl Agent, Sir, I beg to submit K M §? ! w! r th copy of my application dated 21-10-37 on -which, it appears, no action has been taken. Ihe application was made to Capt. Hikinbothan'fc late &gt; —IMjLs Political Agent, Bahrain at iJsu** time he was about to leave for ✓N Bushire. Probably, he had no time to deal with the same. I humbly and respectfully, beg you to forward the same now with your recommendation to Honble the Political Resident Bushire, who may kindly be requested to do something for me, in view of my 20 years service in the Gulf. The deptt. has done nothing at all for me although I have been serving the Govt.faithfully and honestly in the Gulf since the time of the Great Tar. Looking forward to your kind assistance in this matter, I beg to remain, S ir &gt; Your most obedient servant, Post Master Bahrain. Bahrain dated ^rnmamm m To H.B. Ms Political Agent, Bahrain* Sir, With reference to my personal interview on the last Friday, in connection with my hard work and low' salary, I beg to submit the following few lines for your favourable consideration and sympathetica! disposal. I come from a respectable family of Syed, whose members are loyal and faithful to the British Government, and some of my relatives served in the great v r ar and received decorations for their good services. I also joined in the war, and served the Bushire forces for 2years. On the closing of this force I was specially selected by the Post Master General, Bombay for services in Civil post offices of the Gulf, where I have the oppertunity of serving several British Consuls and Political Agents, who always found me willing worker and they have good openion of me and my work » Fither fortunately or unfortunately I was posted to Bahrain in 1923, and since then I think I have been taking all the pains to discharge my duties to the entire satisfaction of different Political Agents, who lui/powg' happened to be here, and the general public. Due to the activities of different oil companies in Bahrain and opening of air services, the magnitude of my office work has increased without bounds with compared to what it was in 1923. The prosperity of the Island has increased and the cost of living proportionately has risen also, but the pay and the allowance which. I get at present is not sufficient to xjek keep up my social position, while I have to attend to my 2 establishments, one in India and one in Bahrain with my daily increasing family responsibiity with my advancing age. In view/ of the above facts I humbly approach you with a request that you will be so good as to w/rite to my Director of Post and Telegraph and say some thing about me and my work so that it may have desired effect for consideration of my promotion for higher grade.It may not be out of place to mention here thst I am a receipant of Jubilee medal, in recognisation of my good work I have been doing at this station, and I hope this will not fail to enlist your sympathy and help for my poor case,v/hich deserve your consideration.

The points for consideration in this case are given in paras 4 and 5 of letter No.663-14/!, dated the 20th March / t 1937 from the Political Agent, Bahrain, to the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the present position in respect of each of these is indicated below (i) Miancment of the status of the offic e It has been decided not to raise the status of the office at present as it is not justified according to the departmental standards. It is also not considered essential in the interests of administrative efficiency. (ii) Increase in the staff ;- Two additional clerks .have been sanctioned for the office mi niwumj.

(v) Improvements in the conditions of service of the staff ;- House rent allowance at Rs.20/- p.m. has been sanctioned for the clerks of the post office who are not locally recruited. The Sub Postmaster gets rent free quarters. i/hen a decision is arrived at regarding item (iii) above a further coinnunication will be sent.vn D.O.

When I was in Karachi in August I also visited the Posts and Telegraphs Directorate and after referring to the promise made to Sir Trenchard I was told that two extra clerks were being sent to the Bahrain Post Office by November* Here we are in the middle of December and still nothing has been done. Mot a word has been heard from the Posts and Telegraphs Department about the lease of the building from the Bahrain Government for a proper Post Office, and I might point out that the Bahrain Government are losing rent monthly on this building since they have reserved it for the Post Office. This cannot go on indefinitely and I should expect them to say very soon that they cannot wait any longer* 3. In India whenever we want a new Post Office to b e opened either in British India or in an Indian State we (as the Administrative Department) always have to guarantee the possible deficit (recovering from the Indian State if necessary)* Here in Bahrain the Post Office is making a very handsome profit, and, to put it bluntly, is not giving adeoua.te service in return* T cannot get any actual profit and loss statement lor the I ost Office, but X understand that they have a turn over of over six lakhs of rupees a year, that in the last twelve/ Captain A* C* Galloway, I*A*, Secretary to the Hon’ble the Political Besident in the Persian Gulf, Dushire *-2- twelve months they sold something like Rs. 80,000 worth of stamps and issued nearly Rs, 4R lakhs worth of money orders. There are also hig savings bank deposits and sales of cash certificates. On the expenditure side there is an item called ’’Bills Paid (including salary of staff)” amounting to Rs. 6758/-; there is another item called ’’unclassified payments” amounting to Rs. 1300/- odd, and if we add about 25 per cent overhead charges I should imagine the resultant sum of Rs. 10,000 would probably cover the cost of running this Post Office here. Is there then any possible excuse for failure to provide proper service to the public of Bahrain, i.e. an adequate staff in an adequate and centrally located building? 4. It seems to me that we shall never get any further until very strong pressure is brought to bear by the External Affairs Department Secretariat. I hope Sir Trenchard will agree to represent this case very strongly to the Foreign Secretary with a view to obtaining an early decision. I might mention here that the Post Office occupies a building which we ourselves could do with very well for an office for the P.W.D. Supervisor and to relieve some of the con gestion in my own office; and also there will be a very great advantage if I can have the Postmaster’s house, which is in my compound, for a resident clerk.

The actual date from which the building is occupied should be reported to this office as well as the audit office concerned and the payment of rent for the existing post office building should be discontinued from that date. 2. The extra expenditure involved as a result of this sanction during the current year should be met from the revised allotment already placed at your disposal under the head 'Contingencies’ in Abstract J.II. 3. In this connection I am to add that the departneatal building used as the sub-postmaster ’s quarters at Bahrain may be let, out to the Bahrain Government at the full assessed rent i.e. the rent calculated on the basis of 8 % of the capital cost as laid down in this office letter No. N-469/ogi, dated the 12th January 1958-Ho. 385-14/3.

N. 685/38 dated the 11th February 1939 from the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the Bahrain Post Office• / 2. Paragraph 3 of that letter appears to suggest the letting of the present Sub-Postmaster’s quarters to the Bahrain Government. The Bahrain Government have no wish to rent this building, and in any case it would be in the last degree impolitic to offer a lease at 8 per cent of the capital cost in respect of this dilapidated building,(which is built on land gifted by the Shaikh of Bahrain) when the Bahrain Government are leasing to the Postal Department a large and centrally-located building on extremely favourable terms. 3. It will not be possible to leise the Sub- Postmaster’s quarters to a private individual since (a) this building stands inside the Agency compound wall and the invasion of the compound Agency/by a private tenant cannot be permitted; and (b) I should expect His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain to withdraw the free grant of land/- 2 - /?; r land if any such proposal were made. 4. There remains therefore the proposal which I have already made, that this house be taken over for use as a resident clerks quarters* By this means the public interest will be served and all possible ' complications eli linated. I would not suggest renting the building from the Posts and Telegraphs Department, since this would involve unending trouble in regard both to very necessary special repairs and also annual repairs. It seems obvious that the wisest course is to take over the building at its book value (or at a value to be assessed by the Assistant Hlngineer, Independent Persian Gulf Sub-Division). Since the osts and Telegraphs Department have received exceptionally favourable terms in regard to the rental of the present Post Office inside the Agency compound for a great number of years it seems unreasonable that objection should be raised to this proposal. 5. So far as this Agency files show the capital cost of the building in 1903 was Rs* 2,728/-. Sd/- H. Weightasan Political Agent, Bahrain.

Wo.783-9 /a. lay 31, 1939. Dear Weightman, Herewith the plan of Post Office showing the alterations which it was agreed that Bahrain Government should carry out. This work has been completed and the whole building will be vacated tomorrow. Yours sincerely, H. Weightman, Esquire, I.C.S., H. B. M T s Political Agent, Bahrain.I visited the new Post Office on the 3rd June with the Adviser. We met there the Postmaster and inspected the building. 2. The ground floor is ready except for the provision of two ceiling fans and four lights in the central room and a ceiling fan and light in the side room on the east. A little painting of the wood-work is also necessary. Directly this work has been done, and I understand it is not likely to take more than two or three days, the Post Office should move into the new building. 3. In the Postmaster’s living quarters upstairs a certain amount of work is still to be done. A partition wall in the big central room is essential in order to separate living and sleeping accommodation, and there should also be a division between the latrine and the portion of the north-east room which is to be used for bathing. The wood-work should be painted and lights should be put in as ordered verbally by the Adviser. This work will take a little longer and it may be a week or two before the Postmaster can enter into occupa tion of his living quarters. 4. The Postmaster asked for a stairway on to the roof so that he can sleep on the roof during the hot weather. I quite agree that one should be constructed but the Posts and Telegraphs Office did not ask for this as part of the altera tions and additions to be made by the Bahrain Government before the building is taken over. The Postmaster will have to apply to his own Department for sanction and for funds for this particular piece of work since the Bahrain Government cannot be expected to do it for nothing. 4th June 1939.

In May 1938 the Senior Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs recorded a note in which he stated that two additional clerks had been sanctioned for the Post Office at Bahrain. In June or July 1938 Sir Trenchard Fowle was in Karachi and saw the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Sind and Baluchistan Circle, who told him that he hoped to be able to send the two extra clerks very shortly. In August 1938 I myself visited the Posts and Telegraphs Directorate and was told that the two extra clerks would be sent to Bahrain by November 1938. In January 1939 the External Affairs Department informed us that the Posts and Telegraphs Department were arranging to send \ the two additional clerks immediately. In March 1939 one clerk actually arrived. In May 1939 I telegraphed to the Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Karachi, asking when the second /• he Honourable Major C.Q. Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.i -2- second one might be expected* In June 1939 the Director replied that necessary steps were being taken to send the second clerk to Bahrain early* I have now sent another telegram to Karachi but f to be frank, I do not expect that any notice will be taken of it* 3* This matter has been a public scandal for years and 1 see no prospect of putting an end to It unless the External Affairs Department Secretariat will bring effective pressure to bear on the Posts and Telegraphs Department In Simla, Bahrain is a very paying Post Office and therefore does not receive the attention in India that it would if it were running at a deficit* Yours sincerely. mEn Clair Director of Posts &amp; Telegraphs, Karachi.

The I ost Office staff is now big enough* but I cannot say that it is really up to its work. The fact of the matter is that the old postmaster has been in Bahrain far too long and has been seriously over-worked for years. The result is that he is worn out. I consider that his Department owe him a comfortable job in pleasant surroundings for the rest of his service, and that they owe us a young and capable post master who can really knock the Post Office into shape. 3* According to figures supplied the Bahrain Post Office’s revenue for the year 1938-39 was Is. 78*500 odd, mostly from sale of stamps and money order commissions. Local payments in the same period were Ba* 8350 odd.

I gathered In the course of conversation when you were here that you intended to write to Delhi about the inadequacy of the service given by the Posts and Tele graphs Department in Bahrain in comparison with the immense profits that they have made here for many years past. If so I should be grateful if you could take up the question of the postmaster which is raised in paragraph 2 of my demi-official letter Ho. 1892 dated the 29th October 1939. \ X 1 2 . 2. We definitely want some one younger and more alive. And at the same time I do think that the Posts and Tele graphs Department owe something to the poor old man, 3afar Hussein, who lias run this place for years and years with an inadequate staff, in an inadequate building, and living in quarters which I have recently had to condemn as unfit for human habitation. The old man has had another frightful blow lately in that his son aged 21 died last month. I feel very strongly that he ought to be given a pleasant job in India for the rest of his service, seeing that his Department is responsible for the mental and physical exhaustion from which he now suffers.

Since the Senior Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs, ITew Delhi, states very categorically that no increase in the rate of pay could be made (see p.u.o), finaneial it would seem only equitable that s9me/_reiief su^uld be given the Bahrain postal staffs the ©ri 0 in^i rate ox special pay (Rs. 60/-) if restored to the S.P.m.
