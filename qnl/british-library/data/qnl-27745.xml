At the time of settling this case the heirs of the murdered Shaikh and his tribe did not agree to accept blood money but forgave the murderer because they considered him too poor. This man belonged to the tribe of Arama and aws imprisoned at lluscat* He was recently released and returned to*Sur. On arrival ar sur be met a slave of the murdered Shaikh and shots were exchanged between them in which the slave was killed, hearing reports of shots the Mukhannas and the Arammas took to arms and firing at random began in which a small boy of the latter tribe and acitd was killed ^nother/wounded in the thigh.

Later news received by the Local Government state 0 there was trouble between the Fawaris and the Arama tribe over drinking water which is brought from 3 miles outside the twon. It is stated that Eawarie caught a donkey carrying water for the latter. This caused firing on either side and a slave girl of- the former tribe was killed.

The Hon f bl# Tha Political Resllent In the Persian Gulf BUSHIRS (on recess) Karachi XXXX.; otn May 24 I have the honour to allress you on tne subject of the disturbances at and near the town of Sur i which have occurred lately anl the measures proposal to leal with them. 3. It will be convenient here to 6**® &amp; short summary of recent events which have lei up to the present position. Sur is a port lying roughly a hunlrel miles to the i£ast of Muscat an! owes its importance largely to its being the nearest Ihow-haroour to Inila In Arabia. Dhows ply regularly from Sur to Bombay A Karachi, Socotra, Alan, Zanzibar anl the African coast anl also up the Persian Gulf anl over to the Mekran coast. There is quite a consilerable trale with Inlla anl a small colony of Inlian tralers has been resilent there for many years. A very large proportion of the inhabitants belong to the Ai junabeh tribe which is iivilel into four sections vis the Arameh, Mukanneh, Parwari anl Ghialin anl all except the last namol have been involve! in the iisturbanoee.In parenthielB, I may ramark tnat Sur liaa always been notorious for the turbulence of Its inhabitants anl before the yacht Nur-ul-Bahr was soil His Highness the Sultan usel frequently to flnl It advisable to visit Sur ani assert his authority. It seems the last time he went was in 1916 when he arrang ed the settlement of many inter-tribal murder cases, imprisoned twenty six greater and lesser Sheikhs anl fined the tribes Bsl4000, this strong action keeping the peace for about two years. In 1919 the Muscat Customs were reorganised and the people of Sur seeing thet in future the dues would be more strictly enforced refused to allow a custom house to be built. In 1930, therefore. Captain HeCollua the then W&amp;sir went to Sur in H.If.S. Brltomart and succeeded in persuading the people to accept the new ^ * arrangements. Things went smoothly for a short while and then smuggling began again and has continued ever since; the custom house was not built, difficulties being in variably placed in the way and the Wall became as power less and inept as ever. Meanwhile a stormy petrel of the Arameh section one Walad Halals who had been banished from Sur in 1918 by flis High ness for murdering a Farwari returned with the grudging permission of the Council of Ministers and was in 1931 murdered by some of the relatives of his earlier victim. This reopened the old vendetta and incidentally several new ones. Spasmodic murdering went on and in 1933 tn&lt;* Council of Ministers sent Sheikh R&amp;schld the Minister for Religious Affaire to endeavour to put an end to the feuda. He returned having been openly flouted and having nothing and in July Sheikh Zobeir the Minister of Justice accompanied by Captain Alban and 150 levies and 3 machine guns proceeded to Sur and occupied the Fort. Zobelr reported that he had settled all feuds anl caused blooi- -money to be paid over immediately in his presence; he alsoraeoverel 6400 DollarB ouBtomn lues from the merchants arri fine! the trlbee 4000 Dollars. A elte was stleotel for a new custom house an! the party returnea to Muscat tn triumph Unfortunately there was one case in which olool money was not acceptel. Thle was for the murier of a Sheikh of the llukanneh anl the Mukannen aftreel to parlon the muriorer an Arameh. Zobelr brought him to Muscat anl he was Imprlson- el there anl lately releasel. He returnea to Sur ani on entering the outskirts met an armel slave whoa he reoog- nleel as one of the murlerel Shelkhfc men. Deoiling that the slave ha! been letaliel to Kill him ho fire! anl the enl of the fight was that the slave was klllel. The rival tribes hearing the shots lamellately soiioi their rlfiee anl starts! firing Inilscrlmlnately Into one another the result of which was an Arameh boy was kills! anl another wounlel. The Parwarl then took a hanl anl eelsel a water lonkey belonging to the Araaeh; a struggle ensuel In which an Arameh girl was klllel. At the opening of Ramsan the three sections were all unler arms ani firing was reports! to be going on Intermittently. The Wall was however able to use the Ramzan fast as a weapon to arrange a forty five lay armistice which Is still In force. 3. B#for« I l«ft Muscat I had long Interviews with Hie Highness, with Sayed Nadir President of the Connell of Klnleters anl with the remaining three members of the Couno All are agreed that the Sur tribesmen deserve a sharp lesson but all are not agreed as to how It was to be given* His Highness was In favour of wait Ing till the autumn and making a big show of It with the presence of one of H.H* ships* He suggested that he and I and one of the Ministers should proceed on the man-of-war while the Commandant Muscat Infantry with as many men as he could rales and another Minister should go In dhows If necessary)* towed bt the Muscat motor cruiser or If Impracticable go by land.

In orler to prevent further bloolahal meanwhile H.H. has instruct#! the Sheikh of the Al Jaalan (who I suspeot has bean bribe! for the purpose) to arrange an armistice till tha autumn anl I haver no loubt tha Sheikh will be able to affect this. I hope it will be possible to secure the services of one of H.M.'s ships for thlft expedition. X lo not suppose for one moment that any offensive tactics will be necessary as tha mare presence of a man-of-war will have the lestfcel sobering effect in conjunction with the arrival of a force of tha Muscat Infantry.

The Council of Ministers have not in spite of ray urging themj given me any inkling yet of their ideas or onions. I can only hope that they will have done so before the next mail. I understand they have written to H.H in India to see if they can get anything out of him hut fchx this last week they have been very active over the death ! of bayed Yusuf Zawavi in Taif.

At that time 2 had not seen aur and zay information was based on office records and vague reports from the tovn itselfs einoe then 2 have had an opportunity through the kindness of commander Garstin of the •Lawrence* of visiting 3ur and seeing for zqyseif how matters stood. 2* dsfors X set out 2 knew triers were tribal disturbances going on and that there was difficulty over the building of the new Custom house but I was not aware of the very uncompromising attitude taken up by Mohamed bin Masir bin Abdullah of Beni Bi Ali the grandson of the late Amir of Jaalan who is the head of that section of tribesmen occupying Keija (or £aet aur) and the country behind it. I therefore was not prepared to take up tne question of suseraint^ but merely wished to ascertain whether the intersection feuds of the Janebeh tribe were am bad as(3oj late 2* &amp;• 2 Jaad heard. 5« Aoeompanied by Captain Seoles Comnandant Mi scat infantry, lekvnder sffendi Hanna tha Director General of Customs, Khan Bahadur Hasib bin Mohamed and the Aaenoy dragoman Z left Miecat on H* I*IU0* 'Lawrence” September 6th afternoon, reached HXiryat that evening (ae described in my/f?S£-C ot ) left Kfcrynt on the evening of the 7th and arrived at sur about 7.30 a. a* on the 8th* The local Director of Cuetozae Sulaiman bin Hohaxned came on board at once and it was learnt from him that there was likely to be fighting in dur that very day* Sheikh lohamed bin Ha^ir the grandson of the late Amir of Jaelan and sheikh Mansur bin tfaeir of Mnsirah were both at Heija and had been for days past endeavouring to settle the blood feuds of the J&amp;nebeh* All parties of the Janebeh had now been forced to agree to the sheikn*e terms except one Khamis bin Mibarak a leading man of the Arameh section and the two Sheikhs had given him till 3 hours Arabic time that morning (i.e about 9*30 a*m*) to agree or nave hie house and property blown down* Sulaiman understood that a gun was already in position and that Ahamls following was roughly 60 armed men who were prepared to resist* A boat belonging to two relatives of jOiomie had also been seized in the inner harbour by the sheikhs who were using the possession of this ae a further lever. 4* in order to avoid bloodshed l sent the dragoman ashore with Khan Bahadur H&amp;eib with orders to bring lonamed bin Nasir and u&amp;neur on board at once* In the meanwhile the two relatives of Khnmi s and Khomi* himself arrived on board and were told to wait till after the arrival of the Sheikhs* presently the dragoman returned with kohamed bin Basir and another man who turned out to be a cousin of Mansurs - the later Sheikh being afraid to venture on board a Man-0-war.Page 3« X incited ijonaraed bln Baeir to explain the 5 local situation and he beoame rery Terbofi and exalted. He eaid he was authorieed by the Mi seat Government to settle all disputes in 3ur and had suooeeded in doing so with the exception of Xhamis who was an unzit^ creature and was out to ruin the whole settlement- when asked to produce his authorisation he said he had it on shore and that if I would some off in the afternoon he would show it me* He denied that he had ever used force or intended to use force to Xhaais and promised there would be no shooting, in the middle of this conversation the wall was announced and in walked a small boy about 11 years old who said ne was acting wall as his father had gone on leave to Sib near Mi scat. It was obviously hopeless to attempt to get the Government representative’s view out of him and he looked a pitiful little object in the middle of all this intri04e. He was therefore dismissed with a few kind words. Ho homed bin Kasir was then told that Khamis 1 story would be heard ..next and if he cared to wait I would give him another interview later but he excused himself as the day was getting hot and asked me to visit him in &lt; the evening at Helja - I agreed to this and then called in Khaals. 6. Ithamis was in a terribly overwrought condition and it was only after about ten minutes weeping and sobbing that I could get a word out of him. His story was that two of his rslatives had bssn killed and his honour demanded blood money or the nurderers; tnat he could never lift up his head again if ne was foroed to submit to ths Sheikhs orders that the Mi scat Government had promised him justice (he produced documents in support of this and also a copy of Sheikh aihair’s settlement last year) and that h* was about to be killed with his faithful followsrs. H#* r Pag® 4* H« said the remainder of the Ar&amp;meh tribe had been bribed to accept the Sheikh 1 e ruling and that the Sheikh himeelf had been bribed by tne oppoelng section the pakameh and that altogether he vas at hie last gasp when the •Lawrence* arrived. I quirted him as well as I could and offered to take him to Mieoat in the ■Lawrence* which offer he accepted after some hesitation. I then sent him ashore. At 4:30 p.m. accompanied by Captain Socles, the Director General of Customs and the dragoman I went into in the inner harbour in the •Lawrence's* motor boat* on * parsing the new Joalan battery at Heija 3 guns wers fired as a salute and Mohamed bin paeir and ganeur with a following of about 200 armed tribesmen met on the beach. **e were conducted to the Sheikh's house and after the customary coffee, fruit and halwa I continued the interview with tfobamed bin Kasir. He produced his written authorisation to settle disputes and I found he had considerably exceeded its provisions as it distinctly laid down that no force was to be used and in any settlement was to be made by agreement* 1 pointed this out to him and he once again denied intending using any force and stated that Ahamis was a very bad character. He strongly objected to my taking Khamle to liuecat as it would be an indignity to him and promised not to harm Xhainis in any way nor to force a settlement on him against his will. He also said ishamis was free to go to &amp;scat in a small boat at any time if he wished to but protested against his going in the »lAwrence». on receiving these assurances nd as &amp;ohamed bln ^asir appeared to be getting rather heated about it I agreed to leave Khamis in cur. 1 then enquired how it was 1 had received news that the sheikh did not permit the new Custom hoi.ee at Cur to be built. Mohamed bin Kasir became eeggdtge and /V •aid nothing had ever been settled about it, finallyr'&amp;c* 5 . finall/ den^yln^ tnc.t he had error agreed to ite being built and t&gt;w\t ho nerar «ould agree. Re went on to say that tne right of ti? Hignne^e to collect ouetoas in sur and Edija had never been recognised by hie forbears Rlmeelf and hie tribe. 1 pointed out thot the gultan'e rights as regards customs were recognised in the Treaty of 1891 and the Sheikh retorted that he knew nothing of that and that he was not subject to the Hi scat Governments orders as regarue Customs, and he looked to the ^ritls/^Government to maintain his rights, he this attitude rather took me by surprise 1 was net prepared to argue the point nor did the occasion soem suitable so 1 dropped the subject. 9. l then referred to a complaint I had had from the Hindu merchants regarding the closing of the inland route from Gur. The Sheikh e id the rcr,d had been closed for political reasons and in order to punish the Hijriyin who lived on it. He hoped the matter v/ould be settled soon and would do hie beet to reopen trade along that route. 10. 1 then made my adieux,proceeded to the motor boat and v.ent up the Xhor te the b?ck of Sur proper - I landed behind the town and walked, aeroee to the sea shore a distance of about a mile. It was getting dusk and evidently Y~ the warding oeotions were just mounting the evening guards. Tne streets were deserted except for occasional parties of ten or a dozen armed ra^n each of whom accompanied us a short distance and then g ve way to a new party as soon one appeared in sight. The Ghiyalin auarters was more peaoeful out apparently every one had to be indoors by dmsk. 1 visited the Hindus who were well noused in strong buildings and they told me they had to pay blackmail to the various tribes in order to avoid being looted otherwise they had no complaints of the way they were treated. 11. tfhile talking to them I asked whether it would be worth while the British India steamers calling atP&amp;fc* 6 &gt; &amp; * calling at intervalo and after 30200 disoussion I oama to the conclusion that during the date season there would be OrmcL eufficient lnduceja :nt for the mall to Karachi to oall/a fortnight: also that the n-il f on India might oral once a month the **hole ye .r round and have a reasonable ch&amp;noe of covering the extra expense involved. I wit warned by the Director-General of Customs that there would be considerable opposition to this at first on the part of -he Arab merchants *ho were c.ls© largely dhow ovmers or who had shares in the dhows - I think though that this would melt away when the trading community bfgin to realise the advantage of a regular steamer service. 12. By this tine it was getting late and I rejoined the •Lawrence 11 - rhomis wre on board and was told I could not take him to l^uscat. He accepted the decision quite calmly and w^s plowed to hear I had arranged with tne Sheikh that no force 'oulrt be used against him - The •Lawrence* left later on in the evening and arrived at 3&amp;aaoat the next morning. 13. The Director-General of Customs informs rae that the customs receipts from sur are very poor - a mere fraction of what they ought to be and that the Amirs of Jaalan claim free import into the town of Heija on the grounds of right and also ( evidently alternatively ) of Hio ^ighness having granted this privileges last year - The Director-General says that His irighnens did grant asohamed bin Hasir exemption from Customs for his own dhow but that was &lt;ill* 14. flinee the above was written I have received inform tion that Sheikh Ali bin Abdulla uncle of Itonamed bin Hnsir with 4GO nen has captured a late caravan valued at dollars 20,000/- belonging to the ByJ ir y* n ( with whom the Beni bu All are at feud) -rhich was boing brought into fair by the Beni Rasib a tribe living betweon the Byjiryin country and our - The caravan has been taken to Hsija andPag« 7* end th ® will b# 8bipp«d away without the Guyton* being able to oolleot the 5 % export duty. 7aie ie typieal of the methods of the Beni SB 2M Ali and of their present attitude. ^ 5 # Tne above shows the state that Sir ie in :J the sheikhs of the Jaalan tribes openly flouting the •Jftiacat Government and olaizaing what 'imounte to complete independence ; claiming further the right to deal with neighbouring tribes by force and the right to settle intertribal disputes of other tribes by force: claiming in fr-ct the right to nils in 3ur and to pay no oustome or other taxes • I understand these claims have been advanced at various times and with varying degrees of ardour for the last three years but they have not up till now reached such an acute stage • Last winter Sheikh aohomed bin Kasir stayed for some time in ifesoat as ne &gt; guest of His Highness who gave him many interviews but I have no official knowledge of what paased between them. t6. On ay return to IfUsoat from 3ur J informed the council of Ministers of what 1 had seen and heard and asked them whether they proposed to take any action - They desired time to discuss the matter and promised to let me know their ideas shortly. Sine# then, although reminding them frequently they have not furnished me wiU any expression of opinion on the subject tut two days ago the minister of Pinanee informed me that the Council has written to Hie Highness enquiring what has to be don&lt; jn other worde the Council of ministers has no proposals to make. 17 , i presums I am oorreot in assuming that the Governnont of India would not countenance the breaking away from Uusoat of the Sheikhs of Jaalan and also that it would be possible when it is deoidsd to take action to secure the assistance of one of His Jtejesty's ships.!0 Pag* 8* It fieems to mo taat a sharp Xssson is needod to ro^ostablioi f tho rjiscat Government/authority in Sur and onsuro tho oollection of customs and Zakat. But it would be useless to administer that lesson unless arrangements are made to maintain permanently the authority of the Central Government To do this it will be neoeesary to plaoe a garrison of kuecat troops at sur and adequately administer and maintain them and this the Government are hardly in a position to do at the moment* The question of maintenance and the upkeep of proper eonuainication between Jftisoat and sur ie bound up with the question of the acquisition of a suitable vessel by 4&amp;i8cat Stats and ths problem of ways and means of securing this desirable end have been occupying my attention ever since njy arrival here* finally I may remark that Sur ie most vulnerable from about the end of parch till August as it ie then that all the Sur owned dhows to the number of i about 80 are in harbour* 18* in conclusion I beg to request that I may be favoured with your views on the whole subject* I have the honour to be, Sir, Political Agent A H*B*K'e Consul, MUSCAT.

As reported verbally on Monday the 24-8-25 as soon as I delivered the letter, Saiyid Nadir &lt;in the C o uncil Hall, created a scene|£ He shouted in a great fury in Arabic which translated into Arabic is as follows; ‘&lt;1 am responsible.

It is therefore quite in order for H.B.M. ! s Consul to make suggestions 'l-o the local Govt with a view to improve the local condition and to restore peace. Why the Council President should receive the advice in such a furious mood, it is impossible to under stand. The advice has been given in the interests of the local Govt. The Sur affairs being in such a tangle , is it not essential to send thelfc a person of experience to act f nix as Wali/* Saiyid Muhammad was absent.

Rebelling against the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the Amirs of Ja'alan [Emirs of Ja'lan] Bani Bu Ali claimed the right to rule over Sur and to pay no customs or any other taxes. They are stated in the correspondence as ‘openly flouting the Muscat Government and claiming what amounts to complete independence, claiming further the right to deal with neighbouring tribes by force and the right to settle intertribal disputes of other tribes by force.’ This led to further inter-tribal disturbance and difficulty over the building of the new custom house. The Political Agency at Muscat, the Political Residency at Bushire, and the Muscat Government discussed the actions to be taken in response to the issue.The file includes correspondence from the Amirs of Ja'alan reporting on their endeavours to settle the fights of the Janabah tribe. The file also includes petitions from the Sur Hindu traders (ff 40-53), complaining about the closing of the inland route from Sur, and about ill-treatment from the Shaikh who took over Sur, and how he enforced various taxes on their properties.The Political Agent raised concern about the amount of complaints which were received from Sur on a daily basis, and the necessity of getting the Wali of Sur to submit a full report of the situation there. The file also contains correspondence between the Political Agent and the Council of Ministers regarding the possible candidate to appoint as the new Wali of Sur.The majority of the file is dated 1924-1925.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000294#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
