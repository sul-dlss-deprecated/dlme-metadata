The reports concern the activities of Captain William Owen, and his threat to seize the dependencies of the Government of Oman unless the Imam outlaws slavery in all of his territories. It notes that the Resident has advised the Imam to remind the Captain that the matter has been referred to England (in other words, the British Government) in the event he issues more threats.The item has two enclosures:1 - Translation of a letter from Nasser been Sulieman been Kassim to the Imam of Muscat dated Fatha Island on 12 March 1825.The enclosure lists the ports that Captain Owen has demanded to be surrendered into his control. It also reports that he has installed eight British agents at Bombassa [Mombasa], along with the author's suspicions that the Captain is acting under secret orders from the British Government. It states that if Captain Owen's activities are not stopped soon the people of Bombassa will end up in control of the entirety of the Imam's territory in the region.2 - Translation of a letter from Seif (Syef) been Hamed to the Imam of Muscat dated Lamoo Island on 2 March 1825.The enclosure regards the improper behaviour of Captain Owen towards the Imam's authorities at Lamoo, and his hoisting of the British flag at Zunguebar [Zanzibar]. It notes that the Captain has left for Mauritius; it is not known whether he will return.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054665.0x000080#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
