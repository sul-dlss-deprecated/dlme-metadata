In connection with the suspension of opera tions in Qatar the question of the disposal of stores and oil well equipment will arise. These stores will come under the following categories:- (a) For local storage in Qatar (b) For transfer to Bahrain for use in Bahrain. (c) For transfer to Bahrain for storage during the suspension period. (d) For transfer to Bahrain for sale in Bahrain. (e) For transit through Bahrain to other Company locations. * Reference (e), the Company has had direct orders originating from the Army to send oil and water supply material and equip ment to Basrah. (f) For transit through Bahrain on purchase by Army, Navy and R.A.F. 1 2. In connection with such movements of stores Bahrain Customs procedure must be considered and it will be realised that as a result of H.M. f s G-ovemment decision to suspend operations in Qatar the Company may be involved in a considerable amount in Customs duesis* -2 - Q/CH.1/3125 (Contd.) which may now he considered inequitable charges in view of the special circumstances outside the Company’s control - unless special exemption is arranged for all or some of the above-mentioned categories. 3. In the above circumstances the Company feels that it will be not unreasonable to put forward the suggestion that the Bahrain Government (and possibly other Governments concerned) might be induced to agree to some form of preferential treatment or exemption in respect of such Customs dues. 4. All stores in Qatar have already paid Bahrain transit dues of lf^ or 2$ which are abnormally high for this class of dues. 5. Our suggestions which appear to us as reason able are as follows :- Category (b) - Transfers to Bahrain for use in Bahrain: In this case Customs charges in our view should be the difference between the usual Bahrain charges and transit dues. Category (c) - Transfers to Bahrain for storage during the suspension period' : In this case we feel that no Bahrain customs should be charged. Category (d) - Transfers to Bahrain for sale in Bahrain : Customs charges should be Bahrain charges less transit dues already paid (see para 6). Arrangements could be made for the purchasers to pay the customs. Any special procedure regarding 'scrap” would also apply. Category (e) - Transits through Bahrain to other Company locations: In this case as the material has already paid transit dues there should be no further Bahrain Customs charges. Stores consigned to the I.P.C. and its various • • • • • •3 (£} • • • • • • Q/CH.1/3125 (Contd.) ^ 3 - subsidiaries or associated companies will automatically, in most cases, be exempt from Customs on entry into the new country, e.g., Iraq, Syria, Iran. Category (f) - Transits through Bahrain on purchase by Army7 Navy and k.A.F. Stores under this category should either be exempt as in (e) or, alternatively, material bought by the Services should be exempt from Bahrain Customs and presumably customs at the consignee^ end. Such stores could be consigned to the Services concerned from Q,atar. 6. If any of the above concessions are agreed to it would be necessary for the Bahrain Government to accept the Company’s declaration that the stores concerned had already paid Bahrain transit dues. To attempt to produce documents in evidence would be impossible and result in endless delays. Similarly it would be necessary for the Customs to accept the Company’s valuation figures and sale prices as representing fair valuation for Customs purposes. It would not be possible to produce the exact amount paid in transit dues. It would seem that any supplementary payment such as would be involved in category (d) would have to be assessed on percentage basis of the valuation at the time of re-import. 7. Another aspect of this matter is the fact that on reopening operations a second batch of equipment will again be passing through Bahrain and it is felt that it would not be inequitable if transit dues were waived by Bahrain Government or some special arrangement conceded. 8. Failing any concessions, it might be possible to arrange transhipment from dhows and barges to steamers outside Bahrain territorial waters. 9. Before taking any further steps we should be grateful for your views. So far we have seen no refer ence to the charges, customs, freight, insurance, etc., which the Company will incur in the shifting of stores- ' lb&amp; - 4 - Q/CH.1/3125 (Contd.) from Qatar. The Company is acting under the orders of H.B.M.*s Government and the charges will presumably come under consideration sooner or later. If any deci sion has already been reached the Company would like to know as the form of record of transactions may be effected. Yours faithfully, For &amp; on behalf of PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITEDNo.C/1149 * Political Agency, Bahrain, the 1st August 1942 To The Adviser to the Government, Bahrain* Memorandum * , I enclose a copy of a letter No*Q/CH.l/3126 dated 20th July 1942 which I have received from Mr* Packer* 2* The Bahrain Government will presumably not desire to make capital out of the misfortunes which the War has brought upon a British Oil Company operating in neighbouring territory, and I shall be grateful if sympathetic considera tion is given to the suggestions made in para 5 of Mr .Packer’s letter. 3* In regard to the suggestions made in para 6 of the letter, I presume that the Bahrain Government will not object to accepting the Company’s valuations unless, in any parti cular case, the Company’s valuation seems unreasonable. 4. The point raised in para 7 of the letter need not, I suggest, be pursued further at the moment. 5. I shall be grateful for an early reply to this Political Agent, BahrainV i&gt;Tsl^ Confidential. &lt;? h~° A vi £■' aj D.O. No. C/1445-3. Bahrain, Aug. 9, 1942. / I ara sorry to have been so slow in reply- ing to your letter No. C/1149 dated 1st August 'h«i • 1942, enclosing a letter from Mr. Packer asking for facilities and exemptions from customs duties on material which is being removed from Qatar as a result of the closing down of the Company’s operations in that territory. 2. The Bahrain Government has in the past treated the Iraq Petroleum Company generously and has gained little from its action. This company opj^^tes from Bahrain not for the benefit of Bahrain but because this place is a useful centre. Its government provides amenities which do not exist elsewhere. I think it would be reasonable for the company’s imports to be dealt with in the same way as imports of any other R.E. importer but any material to be used for the defence of Bahrain to be admitted free of customs charges. The Bahrain Government is however prepared to make the following concessions. 3. Goods referred to in category (b) which are transferred from Qatar to Bahrain will be liable only to payment of the difference between normal customs charges on imported goods and the transit dues which have already been paid on these goods any of the material is used for the defencei 1 , ' 7 t!) - 2 - defence of Bahrain in which case it will be free. It is not stated for v/hose use these goods will be brought to Bahrain but presumably they will be used by the comx)any in Bahrain. The fact whether or not transit dues are abnormally high is not under discussion, the rates were known beforehand. j \ Category (c). I suggest that oil machinery should be free but other material such as stores should be liable to normal customs charges, if none have been paid, or, the difference between full and transit charges. Categorjr (d). These goods should be liable for the difference between full and transit charges. The customs charges should be paid by the importer as is usual. It is not the responsibility of the Bahrain Government to recover charges from the eventual purchasers; if however the goods are sold in Qatar the purchaser who imports them into Bahrain • would be responsible for paying customs on them. Category (e). The Iraq Petroleum Company has concessions in Iran, Iraq and Syria and pre sumably its imports into those countries are free according to terms of concessions. The company does not hold a concession in Bahrain so a comparison between conditions here and those countries is not to the point. This material which is for transit through Bahrain would normally be subject to 2% ad val (or lj% for overside delivery) provided that it is re-exported to Saudi-Arabian ports only according to agreement between Saudi-Arabia and Bahrain. The© Company wishes to re-export to Iraq. The Bahrain Government is prepared to extend this concession as favourable treatment to Petroleum Concessions Limited in the case of the contemplated exports under this category from Qatar to Iraq etc. Category (f). The Bahrain Government is prepared to waive the customs dues on those goods which have been purchased by His Majesty’s Forces provided that we are duly supplied by the authorities with a list of the goods purchased. 4. Regarding the valuation of the goods, I suggest that the company should submit its basis of valuation. The company presumably knows the value of its plant etc. and by what percentage it has been written down annually; this would seem to be a reason able basis for valuation. I agree that it might be difficult andwould take time if previous documents were required. 5. The question of customs liabilities on future imports to Qatar through Bahrain when the v/ar ends and the company resumes its work cannot be decided at present. 6. The representative of Californ a Arabian- Standard Oil Company has also written a letter re lating to similar points connected with material which may have to be shipped through Bahrain for sale to military authorities elsewhere. I think both cases should be dealt with in the same way and the nationality of the companies should not affect any arrangements which are made. Yours sincerely, E. B. Wakefied, Esquire, I.C.S., H. B.

BAHRAIN CUSTOMS DUTY ON MATERIAL FOR UNITED NATIONS WAR EFFORT Dear Mr. Belgrave: We have recently received a letter from Gray Mackenzie and Company, Ltd. asking for details of values of the materials which we have released to United States Military Missions, the American Ferry Command (Pan-American Airways), and the American Consulate in Basra for use in the War Effort of the United Nations. It appears that Gray Mackenzie’s letter is based upon a message received from Mr. C. C. daGrenier under date of June 27, 1942 requesting information as to the Bill of Entry of the items. There is also attached your memorandum #803/20-3 of May 5, 1942 stating that re-export duty is not to be charged again if duty has already been paid. We are searching our files now for the necessary informa tion, but I am certain that we shall find that many of the large items such as the portable camps for Pan-Air, and the trucks and the electric generating equipment for the Military Mission in Karachi, were imported directly into Ras Tanura so that no duty was paid for transhipment through Bahrain. It occurs to me that there might be some possibility of the Bahrain Government exempting this particular material from duty or tax irespective of its previous entry through Bahrain. You will understand that we were not, and are not, anxious to sell this material. We are releasing it only to fill a very urgent war need. vVe are more than glad to cut our supplies to a minimum and to release everything we possibly can do without if we can be of assistance to the United Nations War Effort. We are transferring this material at prices well below cost and much below anticipated replacement costs. Obviously, we have no choice but to pay the duty if it is considered chargeable, but since we are not in the position to absorb the costs of th duty we shall be obliged to pass the charges on to the purchasers. Under these circumstances, the transhipment duty will become in effect a tax imposed upon the United Nations by the Bahrain Government. I trust that you will have no objection to my calling these facts to your attention. I shall be grateful for your comments. Yours very truly, CALIFORNIA ARABIAN STANDARD OIL COMPANY By (Signed) C.E.

No. n*5-3 of 1361 Office of the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain Dated, Ramadhan 19, 1361 September 30, 1942. H. B. M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Memorandum:- Messrs. California Arabian Standard Oil Company as well as Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Limited are selling material to Military and other organisations and Messrs. California Arabian Standard Oil Coy has asked the Bahrain Government to make some concessions in customs duty on sales of this description. The Bahrain representative of Messrs. California Arabian Standard Oil Coy discussed the matter with me unofficially and I told him that I should like to know details of these sales of oil company material. I have now received the enclosed statement from the Manager, Messrs. California Arabian Standard Oil Coy. It appears from the summary that only two lots of goods were sold direct to Naval and Military authorities, the remainder were consigned to Pan American Airways-Africa Ltd., Basra, the U.S.A. Consulate, Basra^and Messrs. Foley Bros. Inc., Basra. The Bahrain Government is willing to waive customs duty on material from Messrs. Petroleum Concessions Ltd., and Messrs. California Arabian Standard Oil Coy which is purchased by Allied Naval Military and Air Forces because such transactions can be regarded as directly contributing to the War Sffort but furniture for the U.S.A. Consulate at Basra or purchases by commercial firms cannot be included in this concession.- 2 - 4 I have heard that Messrs. Foley Bros. Inc., are purchasing agents for the American Army but I have no definite information on this matter. Can you enlighten me on the subject?

Foley Bros., Inc., are purchasing agents for the American Army. If the California Arabian Standard Oil Company state that material purchased by that or any other firm in Iraq was purchased on behalf of the United States Array they would no doubt be able to support such a statement by a certificate from the United States Minister at Baghdad which would presumably be accepted by you. Political Agent, Bahrain• • • CODES: i' BENTLEY'S SECOND PHRASE 5 ) l] PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QATAR) LIMITED 1* We acknowledge herewith receipt of your No.c/1345 dated the 5th September 1942, and forward our comments on the Adviser 1 s letter No. DO.C/1445-3 dated the 9th August 2. We note that you observe in your letter that the con cessions granted by the Bahrain Government as regards Customs dues 'appear generous'. The only important con cessions, however, apply to the British G-overnment Forces who are exempted from Customs dues. The Bahrain G-overnment are proposing to charge the Company the difference between transit dues and full Customs where goods are re-entering Bahrain for local use. This, we agree, is equitable. ^7 I Goods in transit again, however, are to be charged at the • | full 2$ transit dues. We cannot agree that this is generous treatment or even equitable. This duplication of transit dues seems difficult to justify from any angle. The transit rate of 2$, to say the least, is abnormally • high, and the transactions are, in most cases, purely a formality. We note that the Adviser remarks that the size of the transit rates does not affect the principle involved, but we submit that the duplication up to 4% on the same goods constitutes such a heavy transit charge that criticism must be expected. The principle which the Bahrain Government appear to have adopted is that wherever the British Government is involved, Customs are waived, presumably on the grounds that the war DIRECTORS: L.RR 6ARM.Hi ^I-C.U.C.

Dear Sir BAHRAIN CUSTOMS DUES ON TRANSFERS OF PSTROLSUM DBVELOFMSNT (QATAR) LIMITSD~s70RES• • • Q/CH.1/3207 (oontd.) effort will be facilitated thereby. It does not seem to be taking into account that the transfer of Company stores from Qatar has been brought about by British Government orders, designed also to facilitate production in better situated fields and deny supplies to the enemy. 3. With reference to the Adviser’s para 2, we fully acknowledge that the Adviser to the Bahrain Government has always afforded us all reasonable facilities in connection with our Qatar operations, and our debt to him in this matter. These facilities, however, as far as we recollect, have never resulted in any financial loss to the Bahrain Government, and the reference to lack of reciprocation is not understood. We are not in a position to make any return, for instance, for the relaxation of procedure allowed by the Customs Department. This relaxation is based on common sense grounds, and also relieves the Customs Department from unnecessary routine. In general, however, we have made a point of carrying local purchase to the absolute maximum. For the twelve months ending July 1942, the Company spent Rs.l^ lacs in the bazaars; Rs.17000 was paid to various Government Departments during the same period; Rs.23000 was spent among the local gardeners on fresh provisions; wages of local staff reached Rs.60000; in rents alone Rs.9000 is paid to the Government; in Customs transit dues on Qatar equipment Rs.50000 has already been paid; through Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. who handle our stores, very considerable sums are involved in labour and dhow hire. Enough has been said to show that the Company has contributed to a reasonable extent towards the general prosperity of Bahrain, and it always has been and will always be our policy to do so. Nothing in this para graph, however, is intended in any way to belittle the obligations we are under to the Adviser personally, for his many and consistent courtesies. 4. In the question of Customs dues now under discussion, we are not asking for generous but only equitable treatment in view of the war factor which is directly responsible for the unanticipated movements of stores and equipment which has already paid Customs dues of one kind or another. We feel that it is neither generous nor equitable for the Bahrain Government to ask for duplicate Customs charges. This contention seems to have been recognized by the Adviser as regards categories (b), (c) and (d) in that the transit dues already paid are deducted from the normal3 Q/CH. 1/3207 (contd.) Bahrain rates. Curiously enough when transit dues come under consideration, the principle that duplication is in equitable, seems to have been abandoned, and the reason is not clear. In para 3, in dealing with category (e), the Adviser makes the point that comparison between the transit rates in Iraq etc. and Bahrain is beside the point in that the Iraq Petroleum Company hold Concessions in these countries (but not in Bahrain) and their Concessions exempt them from Customs. It is difficult to follow this argument. We are comparing the Iraq transit rate of i per mille to all and sundry with the Bahrain rate to us and others of 2%. 5. We gather from the latter half of the abovementioned paragraph dealing with category (e) that it is the Bahrain Government’s contention that the Company is being afforded favourable treatment in that the transit rate from Bahrain to Saudi Arabia is being made applicable to Company’s re exports from Qatar to Iraq which are transhipped at Bahrain anchorages, i.e., the inequitable procedure of which we complain, namely, duplication of transit dues totalling 4%, is to be regarded as favourable treatment. Is it to be assumed that other exporters using Bahrain anchorages for transhipments will be charged an even higher rate ? 6. A new category has arisen consisting of batches of oil equipment to be removed under the orders of the British Forces either to locations suitable for immediate destruc tion as necessary or to other oil fields where it can be taken into use in pursuance of the Government’s plans to keep up the flow of oil supplies. It seems obvious that the Company should not be involved in Customs dues as a result of such movements, and it could be made clear with advantage that, as far as this Company is concerned, Bahrain transit dues are not payable. The simplest way would appear to be for military consignors and consignees to be nominated. 7. Reference the Adviser’s para 4, it is noted that the Adviser is prepared to accept the Company’s valuations for Customs purposes. This will facilitate our transactions considerably, and the assistance is very much appreciated.Q/CH.1/3207 (conoid.) 8. We have no comments at present on the Adviser’s paras 5 and 6. 9. For your information, the Company now proposes to conclude all sales to non-Company purchasers at Zekrit. The Company, therefore, will not he involved in Bahrain Customs as regards this class of transactions. V/e believe that the majority, if not all non-Company purchasers, will use Cray Mackenzie’s organization, and their staff based on Zekrit will function as consignors.

The Adviser appears to take the view that the duplicate charge is not only fully justified but the Company is receiving favourable treatment by being allowed to pay this second time at 2% and not at some higher rate ^ 3. Another aspect of the matter is that the Company f s operations were suspended under instructions from His Majesty’s G-overnment, and the removal of material was con sequent upon this suspension.

You will observe that there are three categories: (a) Companies engaged in war effort. (b) Eor storage by Companies engaged in geological exploration or whose operations are temporarily suspended. (c) For use by Companies engaged in^geological exploration or whose operations are temporarily suspended. Reference (a): Equipment moved under this category definitely facilitated the maintenance of oil supplies from Kirkuk to the Mediterranean. 4. Reference (b): This is oil equipment for storage at Basrah or Qaiyarah (Mosul Petroleum Co.), Iraq. As the Adviser has already admitted the principle that oil equipment for storage in Bahrain is not dutiable, presumablv this batch will also be exempt. v c c )Q/CH. 1/3465 5. Reference (c): This equipment and materials etc. is in use mostly by the Basrah Petroleum Co e and it can not be said that its use had any direct bearing on war effort. 6. To summarise, we feel that we have grounds for exemption from transit dues in respect of (a) and (b) (Rs.68102-5-9 and Rs.77861-5-0 = Rs.145963-10-9) as these either facilitated the war effort or consisted of oil equipment for storage during the war, but if the Bahrain Government maintain that duplication of transit dues is to be adhered to in principle, then the articles under category (c) are dutiable. 7. In addition to the enclosed summary, there will be further minor consignments which we will also classify under the abovementioned categories and once the Customs rulings are given there will be no difficulty in settling accounts with the Director of Customs direct.

I have had a certain amount of correspondence v/jth Packer about this question. At my request he has prepared a summary of material shipped from Qatar via Bahrain to Associated Companies under the following three heads Cl) Shipped to Companies engaged in the war effort (2) Shipped for storage to Companies not engaged in the war effort. (3) Shipped for use to Companies not engaged in the war erfort. The value of material classified under these heads is as follows Head No. (1) ...

I understand that the Bahrain Government are not prepared at present to accept such a general principle but would be willing to forego transit dues on oil equipment whose export from Oatar for storage elsewhere has become necessary owing to the war. 4. Will you please let me know that my understanding of the position is correct so that I can inform Packer. You will doubtless inform your Customs Department at the same time of what you decide.

Dear Sir, With your letter No. Q/CH.1/3465 dated the 1st June 1943 you enclosed a summary of oil material shipped from Qatar via Bahrain to Associated Companies, classifying that material into three categories (1) Shipped to Companies engaged in the war effort (2) Shipped for storage to Companies not engaged in the war 'effort (3) Shipped for use to Companies not engaged in the war effort. You asked me to ascertain from the Bahrain Government what principles would be adopted by them in assessing this material to Customs duties. 2. The Bahrain Government do not wish to charge transit , dues in respect of material shipped for use in the war \ # 17 effort; material coming under category (1) will therefore be exempt from transit dues. 3. The Bahrain Government are also willing to forego transit dues on oil equipment whose export from Qatar for ^ cs y c \'’ storage elsewhere has become necessary owing to the war; material coming under category (2) will therefore be exempt from transit dues now and whenever in the future it is re imported into Qatar via Bahrain. 4. Material corning under category (3) will be chargeable to transit dues in the ordinary way. Yours truly, Political Agent, Bahrain. Copy to 1. Adviser to the Bahrain Government and 2.
