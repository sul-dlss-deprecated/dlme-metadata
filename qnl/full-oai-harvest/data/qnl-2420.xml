The Chief Local Representative (Ward P Anderson) writes that BAPCO cannot spare any drillers, while the CASOC representative (Charles E Davis) writes that one or two drillers may be spared, though they require a period of rest first (ff 2-8);correspondence dated April and May 1944, relating to a British BAPCO employee requesting transfer to another sphere of oil operations, and deliberation amongst British Government officials over the request, in light of a shortage of experienced engineers. An India Office official writes that the employee should offer his services to a British Company or undertake military service, or that BAPCO might retain the employee until the end of the war (ff 9-16).The date given on f 6 is incorrect, and should (as indicated on f 7) read 6 November 1942, not 6 October 1942.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Petroleum Company, Chief Local Representative</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Petroleum Division</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Recruitment</topic></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000088#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000088#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
