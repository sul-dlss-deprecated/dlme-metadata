The body, from the shoulder to the feet,  is covered with a single piece of light colored, fine, plain weave linen.  A thin strip of linen with dyed dark brown edging extends from the bottom of the wig to the heel and covers the seam where the outer wrapping crosses in the back. Alternating light and dyed dark brown strips of doubled linen make up the wig/headdress that form a horseshoe shape on the back of the head and run vertically down either side of the head to the chest. A recessed area and unfinished edge in the head indicates that there was once a facial ornament (cartonnage, metal, wood) that is now missing.  Fine cording is visible crisscrossing the bottom of the feet. The mummy contains skeletal remains of two shrews.", "medium": "Animal remains (Crocidura flavescens, C. nana, C. olivieri, or C. religiosa), linen", "dimensions": "4 3/4 x 3 1/2 x 19 5/8 in.
