The following enclosures are included with Kemball's letter:1. Letter no.78 of 1853 (folios 286-88) from Kemball to Lieutenant-Colonel Justin Sheil, Her Majesty's Minister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary at the Court of Persia, dated 1 March 1853. The letter enclosures a further letter, no.23 of 1853 (folios 289-92) from Commodore George Robinson, Commanding Officer Persian Gulf Squadron to Kemball, dated 26 February 1853. Robinson's letter is a report of his cruise to the Persian coast to exact fines from the chiefs of Bandar-e Lengeh, Magoo and Kelat, for their involvement in the slave trade. Kemball reports that Robinson's tour was as successful as could be expected, and passed without recourse to stronger measures having to be taken;2. A translated statement (folio 293) of Moullah Ahmed, regarding the alleged importation of slaves in to Kelat in 1852, made in the presence of Commodore Robinson on 4 February 1853. In the statement Moullah Ahmed says that no slaves were landed at Kelat, as a result of the ship reported to be carrying slaves being shipwrecked before it reached the port;3. Letter no.77 of 1853 (folios 294-294A) from Kemball to Robinson, dated 28 February 1853. The letter relates to the protestations of the chief of Bandar-e Lengeh over the payment of his fine. Kemball writes that the chief cannot be made exempt from paying the fine.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051555.0x00004e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
