Sir, I have the honour to la3r before you the following facts and considerations ro^ardin^ a plot of land situar- ted close to the present western boundary of the Agency grounds, A The e^nct situation of the plot and its relation to the site -which has recentl5 r been acquired for the new Post Office Imildin^ is sho^m in the attached plan A. 2 # All the ground to the west ol the Agency was I believe at one tine occupied by huts or buildings but the efforts of various Political Agents were exerted towards having this land —— as like 13^ at some Tjine in the luture to be required by »}overnnent — kept free of of encuiribrajices of a permanent nature. 3. About 3 years a^o the site under reference which had been the property of Sheikh Huharuiad Pasha of Darin was resuned by Sheikh Is a, and shortly afterwards io . t '- s acquired b3 r the present owner Iubara&gt;: bin Ahrr d \rho be^an to erect stone buildings on it# 'he vrork was j .. i j dieted by the Agency, and possession was obtained ol his title deods \?hich are still with us# .Ais -/J ^ion oak: n during his absence was subsequentlj 7 ' approved by ila.jcr Pride aire# 'l^ae earner has subsequently appealed on v a rious occasions to succeeding Political Arrents but has been pacii ied vritli snail c n .sh i:rosents# He has finally appealedappaaled t,o ma for a delinite set.t.lanont, '•■nl has presented tliat ho will bo quite content to part with tho &gt;ro;)orty at ths yrioo he y ^id lor it j would r^co^nond that it be actpiired i/nile i^ is still o:''erod at a reasonable price. Its aconi3i ..ion v /ould be of imediate snr^rice as it . c.ii.l i onable tis to rotmd off the new Post Office site into which it cuts inconveniently restricting its area and rendoriri'S xua sh^.pe awkvmrd, B. Tne question however may better be re crdod ; rom a inore extended point ol 'ievf. ■i?]inre is every probability that nore ground will feg required by fiovernnent in the not remote : uture. Apart from various possible nontin ^eneies there is the Question of providing rovomr.ent accomodation i or vis cle-ical staff of the Agency. At present clerks have to find quarters for themselves outside, rut uuitable accomodation is practically non-existent, and sn.ca -s there is is becoming r^re and nore expensive and dilii- cult of acquisition. I expect to have to aid-ess you separately on this subject belore loni. 6. There is also the possibility of spr^i beint? required at none time lor a Telegraphic station. rne only I'md contisrioua with the A :ency whic^a could be acquired at any reasonable cost is t-ho l-nd lyirv? beyond the present western boundary ol .he A - ney pounds, of which the Post 01 fice site and ubfc ^'s plot lorm a part. This ground haa the additional '3 -it ol beinPf the natural extension of the At ncy site and ox beins? situated on the sea r rent, a point ol ruch i port- rmce in anj^ case, a ^id a sine qua non, I taie it, lor a site for a Telegraph station. It is the only piece of sea iront in '.he neigh bourhood ol the Agency remaining unoccupied by building of a pen-nnnt/ ch -vacter. 7. I show in plan ?. t)\e approximate di - .nsions f the atround I reler to. I have not jnd ^d it ise o arouse0 lb' arouse a-.ton.tlon by surveying it accurately, or by ina- ■i . i ^ing mquiries a) out it or its occupants. 1 'iie ground snoT/n is occupied only by date stick tuts with possibly one or two insifjnificant stone hovels 'Vhe only property of the least pretentions is it is probable hen fever that the other settloW have paid sonettinof for the ri&lt;?ht to occupy the .jround wit ■ • ot rits, md ,heir dispossession ould entail the piynent of cone compensation. At the sine tine there is no question +,}iat the landed property will steadily increase in velue, and therefore ii rtoverxnent conceives that it is likely to require nore r^ound, uietier imeilately or in the course 03 ye rs, it would, I think be well advised to ',ake steps to acquire the %fhole site irithout lelay, I tske ior ?r mted that Sheikh Isa .vould show hiraself as complacent ns'on similar occasions in the yah '' 2'' ui ;At be possible to obtain merely a lien on ■:jie 'round with the rl-.fvt to evict the present or future oecupents at an.* - -i'^e that suited us on payment of sone cogensa'-lon to bo ji ed how, 'ut I toubt if this .-ould be ound v^rj*- saMsf?&lt;3tory in practice, 0, Vflxatever view ovemnent n?y take -.he larger questions I would strongly raco-inend the ir^ne iiate acrilslvjion 0'' tub Talk's prop j sent si*' * in; .ion is uns^itiiaf Rotary, n jid if* .i* 'Ri* ... ib ^.llov/'^d n 11*00 Ji-nd to btiiiLcif jiis srmnplG vflll probably be follo rad by othersj and it is on the cards t}iat sone bi r?er personage nay make a bid ior the whole site, if our interest in it appears slacken.

Political A: Bahrairu*5- /J^ j British Hesidancy and C BushirOjthe /fouM N Pleaea saa your latter No.507 dated 20/22 July re garding certain desirable plots of land. I agree that it will be a good thing to try and get sanction for the purchase of the whole iite without delay, 'but there in are two points in your letter which I fear would/all proba bility delay a decision and night elicit a negative reply. Thus (l) You give no estimate of the probable total cost (in cluding the Rs. 280/') of the whole plot so that Government would not know what they might be letting thernialvas in for. (11) You suggest as an alternative^ lien'With right to evict on payment of compensation, on a scale t o be fixed now. But you suggest no scale. Now the price of Mubarak bin Ahmad 1 s plot is so trivial that in any case if Crovernment did not respond we could find the money for it without troubling them further. Could you not evolve a fairly approximate estimate for the w hole area based on the price per square yard or Zara pre valent for land in vicinity (or on the scale of Mubarak's price) and put the matter up afresh asking for expenditure up to a specific Captain D.L.R.Lorimar. I.A., Pol it ical Agent, BAHREIN.\1 specific sum for the acquisition of the whole? I think it will have more chance of going through in that^ form. If Government do not agreo we can still 'buy Mubarak^ plotj in fact if it became urgent you might do that at any time, but if you told him you had asked for authority and were awaiting reply he would probably possess his soul in patience for a short time longer.(ft) of pny considerable height we ^l^ht inuerj era with the 1 roe access of t.he sea air to it# Vliether he would think of pro testing I don't know, I do not think there would be '^ny particular •iana in taking up tliis question openly and thrashing it all out on t ie T'ound that ./^ ^re tJiinl:ini of Inildim? clerks 1 quarters^A f 0 16th Sep 1 Your derai-official letter of 29th August, regarding the acquisition of certain plots of land. I think the best thing on the whole would be to pro ceed as you suggest in your concluding paragraph. The only point that suggests itself to me is as to whether or not Sheikh Esa or Musaad might put Mobarak off selling his property to us, and whether or not it would be better to this first. You must do as you think best in this regard. iptain D.L.ii.Lorimer, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrein.To if Bahreir, ^Ttih March 191?, i^) J^Lv /o-tf ^-e: for Olerka' Qnar-Ujra, In continuation of w B.C. date-l 16tn karoh 1912.
