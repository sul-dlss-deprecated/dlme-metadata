The Ottoman Turks rose into power about the middle of the 15th century. They seized Constantinople in 1453 and in a few years overran South-east ern Europe, Syria and Egypt, and created powerful fleets which, on the one side, obtained full command over the Indian seas, and on the other threatened to subjugate the whole Mediterranean basin. But the wave of her conquests in the West was turned back by the victories of the combined fleets of Spain, Venice and other Italian states ; while in the east a power, having its birth in the small kingdom in the extreme west of Europe, fresh from her victories in her crusades against the Moors that had established themselves in the Iberian Pen- ninsula, turned their enterprise against the Mussalman dominion in the Eastern seas and turned the flank of Islam in its grapple with Christendom. Actuated by the spirit of the crusaders, the Portuguese pursued the Moors (as they called all Mahomedans) and all who traded with them, with barbaric and relentless ferocity, and established like the Phoenicians of old factories at every impor tant port in the Eastern seas, To secure their command over the Indian seas, the Portuguese knew that they should obtain a hold on the Persian .Gulf. They accordingly attacked and captured Ormuz, Maskat, Bahrein and other important places and established their factories at every important town in the Persian Gulf. The Ottoman Sultans had exercised a nominal gwm-political and religious control over Arabia. Whatever power they enjoyed on the eastern coast of Arabia they lost on the establishment of the Portuguese power in the Gulf. With the decline of the Portuguese Empire, the Persians and the Sultans of Maskat made ineffective efforts to establish their supremacy on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, only to let loose the marauding spirit of the Bedouin Arabs in the shape of piratical enterprises. The British Government then stepped in to restore order and peace in the Gulf. But with the rise of the Wahabi power in Arabia at the commencement of the 19th century, a new element of disorder was introduced. While the British were checking these disorders in the sea, the Ottoman Government, as the protector of Islam against the aggres sion of Wahabism, despatched expeditions from Egypt to destroy the new-bom aggressive power. It was crushed only to revive soon with greater vitality. The Wahabi Amirs had learnt, however, to be wise by experience and with the object of pursuing their designs of aggrandizement undisturbed, they chose to acknowledge the Sultan as their suzerain, although the vassalage was merely nominal. But it soon furnished the Porte with an excuse to meddle in Arabian affairs, when its chieftains foolishly engaged themselves in internecine wars, and to gradually extend its power in the peninsula, which at the same time served as a counterpoise against the decline of its power in the west. The conquest of Hasa and Katif districts was the result of this move. The Turks sought to extend tneir power still to the south by right of the privilege of the Sultan, as the religious head of the Sunni Mussalman Church or what may be called Holy Ottoman Empire, or as the suzerain of the Nejd principality, although the Nejd Amirs never welcomed this expansion of the Turkish power. The Turkish dominion is admittedly established in the Hasa and Katif districts. The Turks, however, have not established an effective hold over the tribes in their newly-acquired districts, so as to be able to preserve order and peace among them. On the contrary the introduction of the Turkish element has only given a fresh impetus to disorders in the interior and disturbances on the sea. The Katif coast has in fact turned into a piratical stronghold in place of what was formerly called the Pirate Coast, a little to the south of it, which has now been converted, under the British control, into one of the most peaceful districts in the Arabian peninsula. The Turkish Government has never taken any efficient measures to suppress piracies and enforce order and peace on this New Pirate Coast. This precis deals accordingly with the extension of the Turkish dominion on the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf in the nineteenth century, the [C967FD]10 2 causes that led to it, its results, the objects of the Turkish ambition on that coast, and the measures taken by the British Goyernment to check the Turkish aggressive policy. An account of piracies on the New JBirate Coast finds naturally a large place in these notes. The Turkish claims to Bahrein and Katar are treated in more detail in the Bahrein Frecia (1854j-1904f) and Katar Precis (1873-1904). Important declarations of rights or policy and assurances are, it may be noted, italicized. 25th November 1904. J. A. S ALDAN A.1M CHAPTEE FIRST- Early History of Hasa and Kalif. 1. The history of Hasa and Katif has a peculiarity of its own, which Peculiar features of- distinguishes it from that of Nejd or Hejaj. Its ports—Grane, Hasa, Katif, Ojair, with those of the Bahrein, island attracted from the most ancient times the commerce of the world. The earliest settlers in the districts so far known to us were the Arabs of the Kahtanic tribe. In the early ages also tribes hailing from Chaldea found a welcome home on these coasts. It is well known that after the destruction of Babylon by the Persians, a large body of Chaldeans sailed away from their home and founded a colony at Gerrha, which is supposed by some scholars to be surviving in the village Gerryah, near Katif, and by others Jerahimear Koweit. The Persians also settled on this coast, as merchants, especially in the towns. The Indian traders were found in Katif in very early ages ; as they are found in large numbers now-a-days. There has thus grown up a population on the coast with commercial instincts largely developed, in marked contrast with the Nejdt ans, as much superior to the latter in intelligence, as they are inferior to them in military qualities and physical powers. Reference, by Arab .writer B . t 2 : Arabian ^ographer -i refer frequently to tne coast or Katit. Yacut tor instance mentions the following places : Bl-Rhatt. —Supposed by Rawlinson* to he the Atta of Ptolmey, the coast • vide his cotes, page 225 of Vol. xn opposite to Bahrein. But it is possible it of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic refers to Koweit. There was a large trade boeiety. between Ei-Khatt and India during the early ages of Islam, in so-much that the spears used throughout Arabia, being formed of Indian bamboos landed at that place, were known as Rarnah-el- Rhattyeh. Bl-EaHf. —The principal port of the Katif coast. Al-Arret. —The ancient Arad —another name of the island of Moharrak, one of sister islands of Bahrein. Hajar. —Another name of the island of Bahrein and the coast opposite to it. Darin. —The present Darin, a town north of Hasa. 3. Ibn Hawkal gives the names of the cities of Bahrein as, Hajar, El- Katif, El-XJqueir (Ojair), Bisheh and El-Kharj, while he describes Awdl as the name of the island, belonging to Abu-Said and Saliman bin El-Hassan, the famous Carmathian leaders, who levied an enormous tribute from the ships which traded there. 4. The first known Arab colonists of Hasa and Kafif from the land side lirst known Arab Colonists, ^ ^ PalgraTe have been the Beni-Khalid and Bern Hajir, both Kahtanic tribes, between whom and Islaemitic tribes there were always feuds. To these elements were added the family of Fezarah, banished from Nejd, and the clans of Kelb, Beli, Tenuk and of Kodaa, who had little sympathy with the tribes of Nejd. v Mahomedanism was never welcomed by the Arab tribes, and what they received und'er force was a thin veneer of Islamism. In the beginning of the 10th century of our era the tribes of Hasa joined the famous El-Karmut, the founder of the Carmathian sect, and took a leading part in those devastating wars which sealed the downfall of Mohamedanism throughout the two-thirds of Arabia. The result was, as described by Palgrave, [C967FD] Athat tin's district remained permanently estranged from Islam, a heap of moral and religious ruins, of Carmathian and esoteric doctrines, where naturalism, to use a modern phrase for a very old thing, and. materialism were mixed up and confused with Shiyai transmigrations and incarnations, with the now' reviving relics of Sahaeisrn and with the fatichism common among the lower and un educated classes all over the globe, though it may vary in form and name. 5. When Niebuhr visited the Persian Gulf, he found the whole district dominated by the Beni Khalid, who have since declined in power and are supposed now to be incorporated between Rus-al-Ghar and Koweit with the AlAjman (Persian Gulf Pilot). 6. The earliest mention of the Katif and Hasa coasts in our records is _ . , contained in Maior Colebrook's report •Page r 2 ^ n cf 6 ]BcmhIj 6 Pontioai Be- about the Persian Gulf littoral dated 10th partment, Volume 51 Of 1821. September* 1820. We shall extract his account of this coist as also of the neighbouring Islands including Bahrein, as the tribes inhabiting them had once intimate connections with one another, which it would be well to note, and a description of the state of things in 1820 is well worth comparing with the existing state. Katif. —Katif is situated within a deep KJioor or bay, the approach to which is rendered difficult by the shallow water extending along the coasts ta the westward and southward of Bahrein, The channel of entrance to Katif is by the north side of the Bay, and commanded by the insulated Fort of Vnmaum erected by Rama bin Jauber. Near the h^ad of the Bay is the Island of Taroot inhabited by fishermen and cultivators of the date. The town of Katif is defended by a fort composed of the common Arab watch towers con nected by walls, with a long face to the sea. A citadel, (the original fort) defends the north angle, and contains a spring of fresh water. There are about 20 old guns of different calibres in Katif and 8 in Taro t. Damaum Island is snrrounded by unconnected watch towers similar to those at Ul-Kumra, near Rasulkeima. The population of Katif has been estimated at 25,000, but the chief part of them are connected with the Buhreinese, an un- wariike race of Sheas, who have been for some generations in subjection to their more martial neighbours. They pay a tax called J eh and, the price of exemption from military service. The armed population of Katif and Taroot, have been reckoned at 10,000, according to detailed estimation at 9.000. They are of the Beni Khaled tribe of whom 2,000 (the Beni Asseyn) are horsemen 1^500. (They) were subsidized by Abdullah bin Saud, and employed in his wars. They are all on occasions mounted (excepting 1,500 the Awazien) and retire annually to Zibaya, Mecca and residing at Katif in the date season, viz., from May to December or January. Fresh water at Katif is abundant and the source of great fertility, Bahrein, —The prinolpd of these Islands, called also Awnl, is the residence of the elder Sheikh Solyman bin Achmed. In the smaller Island of Arad^ resides Abdullah bin Achraed, who is charged with the defence of their possessions. These Islands are separated by a channel 3 miles broad, which is a complete bed of shoals, at half tide requiring a pilot for a boat drawing two feet water. The seaport towns (A Manawa Mahurrug are opposite to each • The latter the most populou.. Manawa in Bahrein, Mahumig in Arad.» i hey are tortified with towers, walls and ditches, and contain each from forty to fifty old guns. Manawa is open to the sea.

There are remaining at U1 Buddee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men. 6-A. The last five places are situated within the Katar peninsula, but may be noticed here on account of their intimate connection with the history of Hasa and Katif and the Turkish movements. The town of Katif appears from Brucks' Memoir of Persian Gulf (page 571, Bombay Selection No. 24), to have belonged in the early part of the 19th century to the Chief of Benis Khalid. The sphere of this chief's influence seems to have extended even as far north as Has Moosalami where the Beni Khalid Sheikhs acknowledged his authority.CHAPTER SECOND. Conquest of Hasa Ij the Wahabis and Turkish expeditions into Nejd and Hasa, and their results 1800—1865- 7.

It was Abdul Aziz that first invaded the country. He took Katif by storm and made a great slaughter of the inhabitants, occupied Bahrein and the adjacent islands of the Persian Gulf. This took place in the year 1800. 8. The conquests of the Wahabis in Hejaj in 1804, and their subsequent Turkish Expeditions of 1811-19. outrages brought down the Turkish Gov- ernment on them. It was from Egypt that the expedition was led against Nejd, with the result that the political power of the Wahabis was crushed for a time. The Wahabis rose again into power, but only to court another Turkish expedition into Nejd, and ultimately to compel their Amir to acknowledge the Sultan of Turkey as his Suzerain. As it is on these conquests of Nejd and the reduction of it to vassalage, that the Porte mainly based its claim to interfere in Nejd affairs in 1871, to carve out a portion of rabia on the Persian Gulf as its territory, and to claim even sovereignty* to the Island of Bahrein, we might narrate a few details of the two earlier Turkish expeditions. 9. The task of punishing the Wahabis was committed by the Turkish a.d. 1.8h, Government to the able Viceroy of Egypt, Mahomed Ali Pasha, who in the year 1811 despatched an army under his son Tousoun Pasha. Mecca was recovered from the Wahabis without any resistance. 'The Amir Saud, however, collected a force of 15,000 men under the command of his son Abdullah and on the army of Tousoun Pasha advancing further inland, it was attacked in the mountain defiles by the Wahabis and defeated. At this juncture Saud endeavoured to conciliate the Persian Government, and sent an Envoy for the purpose to Shiraz. He also made overtures for an alliance with the British Government, which were rejected. 10. Under Tousoun Pasha the Egyptian forces bad made no impression, having advanced only as far as Tayif, ' Garden of Mecca,' and 4,000 out of 8,000 regular troops had perished. But Mahomed Ali attached much importance to a successful issue of the operations against the Wahabis, considering that his influence at the Porte would thereby^be much strengthen ed; so on hearing of his son's failure, he determined to proceed in person to Arabia. Proceeding by sea to Jeddah, he landed at that place on the 28th a.d . 1813. -^ ll c? us t 1813. and pushing on to Mecca , ,. at once seized the Shereef Ghalib, whom ne distrusted, and sent him a prisoner to Cairo. 11. Tousoun Pasha again advanced and attacked Tarabah, but failed and his force retreated with some loss to Tayif. Mahomed Ali then prepared to renew the compaign. Such was the position of affairs when news was receiyed of the death of the Amir Saud^bin Abdul Aziz, which occurred at El-Der eyyah on the' 17th of April 1814, he having attained the age of sixtv- eight years. D J 12. Abdullah, the eldest son of Saud, had been elected to the succession a.d. 1814. during his father's lifetime, and, on the , death of thelatter, took his place as Chief Abdullah bm-Saud. o{ the Wahabis without opposition. * For an account of Nejd, see Nejd Precis.5 13. In January 1815 Mahomed Ali inflicted a defeat on the 'Wahabi army which was 20,000 strong, and a.d. 1815. shortly after returned with his own troops to Jeddah. Tousoun Pasha continued the campaign, and operating from Medina, entered the town of El-Rass, the capital of the district of El-Kaseem; the ' army of the Amir Ahdullah-hin-Saud being then at Aneyzah, little further east. At this juncture Mahomed lAli, who had again advanced to Medina, received the news of the landing of Napolean from Elba, and immediately returned to Egypt. Tousoun, however, was reinforced in El-Kaseem, and having opened negotiations with the Wahabi Amir, the latter sent his uncle, Abdullah-bin-Abdul Aziz, to the Egyptian camp to conclude a peace which was effected, the terms being on the basis of the Amir's submission to the Sultan of Turkey, and engagement to give hostages, and even to present himself in person at Constantinople if required by the Sultan to do so. Abdullah further agreed to surrender Der'eyyah to whomsoever the Sultan should appoint to be Governor, and to make restitution of the valuables plundered from Medina by the Wahabis under Saud. The submission of the Amir on this occasion was the more unaccountable that the Egyptian army was at the time in a critical position, and by operating on its communications and intercepting supplies, the Wahabis might have destroyed it. The Amir so far fulfilled the terms of the treaty as to despatch deputies and hostages to Egypt, but he nevertheless proceeded to punish those of the Arab tribes who had joined the Turks, and to prepare for the defence of El-Der'eyyah. # • 14s. The Viceroy, on learning the terms of the peace concluded by his son, refused to ratify them, demanding that Abdullah should personally appear before him in Egypt to answer for his conduct. He also dismissed the Wahabi Envoys and sent further reinforcements to Arabia. About the same time Tousoun Pasha, hearing of the occurrence of a revolution in Egypt, hastened to return there, leaving garrisons in Medina and other towns. 15. On receipt of the Viceroy's demands, the Wahabi Amir despatched a reply couched in submissive terms, urging that the spoil t iken from Medina by his father was not in his possession, and saying that Mahommed Ali might send a representative to govern Nejd, or impose tribute which would be cheerfully paid ; but he begged to be excused from proceeding to Constantinople. The Amir also wrote at the same time to Tousoun Pasha asking him to intercede in his favor with the Viceroy. The latter refused and returned the presents which accompanied the Amir's letter, and announced, his intention of sending his son Ibrahim Pasha with an army to destroy El-Der'eyyah and bring the Amir a prisoner to Constantinople. Abdullah thereupon despairing of a peaceful issue prepared to fight. 16. Arrangements having been completed for renewal of the campaign against the Wahabis, Ibrahim Pasha, a.d. 1816. wag on account of his ability to conduct the operations, set out from Egypt in September 1816 at the head of a considerable force and proceeded to the scene of action. Ihe first encounter seems to have taken place at El-MaViyah, where Abdullah-bin-Saud attacked the Egyptian army and suffered May, a.d , 1817. • a s jg na j defeat. On this occasion Ibrahim Pasha put to death all prisoners taken. The Pasha then advanced with 4,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry, besides contingents of the friendly Arab tribes Benu- Khalid, El-Muteyr, El-Oteybah, El-Harb and ELSuhool against Ei-Rass, which was held by a Wahabi garrison. Before this town Ibrahim Pasha suffered a serious check, and after besieging it for three and half months, having lost • Note .—The Wahabi forces were collected and marshalled by clans and distrk'ts Those from each district, formed a corps under the personal leadership of the local Amir or Chief. Each soldier broxight his own arms and furnished his own rations, and the soldiers made their own gunpowder. Foot soldiers and camel riders received no pay. The cavalry received forage and allowances. A strict discipline was maintained. [C967rD] B J3,000 men, he was obliged to agree to an armistie and abandon the siege. The Egyptian General, however, masking El-Rass, continued to advance eastward on Aneyzah, and the Amir retired south to Bureydah. After six days' bom bardment the fort of 'Aneyzah surrendered, and the entire district of El-Kaseem then submitted to the Egyptian Commander. Abdullah retired on Shakrah, a town in the district of El-Washam, where he halted two months for reinforce ments. During tliis time the Pasha succeeded in detaching from the Wahabt cause many of the Arab Bedoos who at heart disliked the strictness and severity of that sect and government. Amongst those who, actuated by an ient enmity against the Wahabi, had from the outset joined the Egyptian side, was the powerful Shaikh of the Muteyr, Feysal-el-Dawish, who trusted in a promise made to him by Ibrahim to place him in Der'eyyah as Governor of Ne;jd r a promise which the Pasha had no intention of fulfilling. 17. Having received at Bureydah a reinforcement of 800 men and two guns, as well as supplies of provisions and ammunition, Ibrahim Pasha was able to continue his advance on Shakrah at the head of 4,500 Turkish, Albanian, December, a.d. 1817. and Moorish troops in addition to Arab contingents. About 10,000 camels ac companied the force, and the infantry soldiers were usually mounted two on a camel. The Amir Abdullah meantime retired on his capital wasting the country before the enemy, and sending the surplus cattle and flocks to El-Hasa. This was in the latter part of December 1817. In the following month the Turkish army appeared before Shakrah, which was regularly approached under the direction of a Erench Engineer, M. Vaissi^re,.and capitulated on the 2nd of a.d . i 818 . January 1818. The lives of the garrison were spared, but they were deprived of their arms, and had to engage not to serve again under'the Wahabi Amir. Some time after when El-Der'eyyah had fallen, Ibrahim Pasha caused the fortifications of Shakrah to be demolished, and when seen by Captain Sadleir the place was in ruins. 18. Abdullah-bin-Saud had now retreated to El-Der'eyyah, and before following him up to the capital, Ibrahim Pasha judged it advisable to turn aside from the direct route to take the town of Dhorama. At that place he encountered a spirited resistance, several of his men being killed. In revenge for this the male inhabitants were put to the sword, the town pillaged and destroyed, and the women given up to the brutality of the Turkish soldiery. Only the Governor and his guard who had shut themselves in a citadel were suffered to escape with their lives. 19. Detained by rains, it wis March before Ibrahim Pasha advanced on El-Der'eyyah, which town he invested in April with a force of 5,5 0 horse and foot, and twelve^ pieces of artillery, including two mortars and two howitzers. Shortly after, reinforcements and convoys of supplies reached the Turkish camp from Medina and Basrah. The siege ooerations were for some time conducted without any success to the Turkish arms, and in the latter part of the month of May an explosion having occurred by which the Pasha lost all his spare am munition, iiis position became extremely critical. hideed the indomitable cour.ge and good example of Ibrahim personally alone saved the army from disaster. The troops suffered much from dysentery and ophthalmia, and the Wahabis thought to overwhelm the besiegers by a sortie in force. The attack was, however, repulsed, and the opportunity lost to* the besieged; for soon after the engagement caravans with fresh supplies of ammunition and provisions reached the Egyptian camp, ard later reinforcements ot infantry and cavalrv joined. News was also received of the approach of Khakel Pasha from Egypt with three thousand fresh troops. Early in September the Amir sent a flag of truce to request an audience of the Pasha. This was accorded, and the Wahabi Chief was kindly received, but was informed that the first and indis pensable condition of peace was the attendence of Abdullah in person at Cairo. Ihe Amir asked twenty four hours for reflection, which delay was granted, and at the expiration of the time he returned to the Pasha's camp and intimated his willingness to fulfil the condition imposed, provided Ibrahim would gunrantee that his life would be spared. Ibrahim lasha replied that he had no authority himself to bind the Saltan and the Viceroy on that point, but that he thoughtbot i were too generous to put him to death. Abdullah then pleaded for his family and prayed that El-Der'eyyah and his adherents should be spared. These terms were conceded and a peace concluded. The ill-starred Amir at once set out on his journey under a strong escort, and on reaching Cairo was courteously received by Mahomed Ali Pasha, who forwarded him on to Constantinople with a strong: appeal for his parr'on. The Government of the Porte was, however, implacable ; 'Abdullah-bin-Su'ood was paraded ignominiously through the streets of the capital for three days, after which he, with his companions in captivity, were publicly beheaded. -0. The Amir Abdullah whilst inheriting the courage, is reputed to have lacked the ability and generosity of his father Saud, and it is probable that under the latter the Wahabis would have made a more successful resistance to the Turkish arms. 21. After the surrender of Abdullah, Ibrahim Pasha, by order of bis father, commenced his return march, and the Viceroy insisted on the destruc tion of El-Der'eyyah which vas accordingly burnt. Pour of the Amir's brothers, Pahad, Sa'ad, Hasan, and Khalid, were carried as prisoners to Cairo. 22. The operations of the Egyptian army extended to El-Hasa and El- Katif on the Persian Gulf, and it was intended to place the Government of El-Hasa in the hands of the Beni-Khalid who, as hereditary enemies of the Wahabis, had joined the invaders. 23. During the progress of Ibrahim's operations in Kejd the adherents of the Wahabis at Ras-el-Khaimah, and that part of the Oman Coast had engaged in fresh piracies, and in order to put a stop to their depredations, the Government of India resolved on sendins: another expedition to chastise them. The Sultan of Maskat was invited to co-operate in the undertaking which he readily consented to do. 24. On the news of the capture of El Der'eyyah reaching India, the A ^ l819 Government conceived the idea of secur ing the co-operation of the Egyptian. Tasha aUo, against the pirates of Has el-Khaimah, and Captain Sadleir, of Her Majesty's 47th Poot, was deputed to proceed to the camp of Ibrahim Pasha to convey to him the congratulation of the Government of India on his success and proposed combined action and mutual co-operation. It was in April 1819, long after Ibrahim Pasha had returned to Medina, when Captain Sadlier started from Bombay on this remarkable mission. He had instructions to call at Maskat to confer with the Sultan on the subject of the negotiation with which he was entrusted, and it appears that Seyyid Sa'eed took a clearer and more practical view of the question than the Government. His Highness considered it very improbable that Ibrahim Pasha would have power to discuss so important a question of policy, but assuming he had, His Highness strongly deprecated, the association of Turkish troops in the proposed expedi tion against the Jowasim pirates, urging, for one thing, that the cruelties committed by those troops in Nejd would lender it repulsive to himself and his people to act in alliance with them against Arabs; further His Highness held with reason tliat the plan of inviting the Turks to 'Oman would be fraught with danger to the independence of the Maskat State. 26. Prom Maskat, Captain Sadlier continued his adventurous journey, and reaching El-Hasa found that the Egyptian General had returned to Medina, and that the whole of the Turkish forces were being withdrawn from the neighhourhrod (if the Persian Gulf sea-board. He joined a Turkish detachment under orders to march westward from EUHasa, and travelled in their company. Passing El-Der'eyyeh, he found that town in ruins, and saw iiOt a single inhabi ant. Shakrah also had been razed to the ground 26. The Envoy eventually venched the camp of Ibrahim Pasha near Medina, and. on unfolding the purpose of his journey, it turned out that, as suggested by the Sultan of Maskat, the General had no authority to enter on the negotiation, and could only refer to proposals to his father, the Viceroy of Egypt. The latter ultimately intimated that neither he nor the Porte desired or needt d foreign aid in dealing with the Wahabis of Nejd.8 27. In the year 1822 it was reported from Nejd that Mahommed Ali Pasha had posted a detachment of cavalry A.D. 1822. Aneyza, and had ordered the walls of El-der'eyyah to be rebuilt. During the same year news came of the massacre of a Turkish garrison at Hiadh Resurrection of Wahabis, 1824-30. ^ ^ 28. In the winter of 1823-24i Turki-bin-Adullah-bin Mahommed-bin 1823-34. Sa'ood, commonly known as Turki- Turki-bin-Abdullah. bin Sand, headed a successful risinsr of the Arabs and possessed himself of El-Eiadh, where there was an Egyptian detachment under Abdullah-bin-Nasir El'Ayathee. Having sent off these men to Medina, Turki consolidated his power in Nejd, and was recognized as Amir by most of the Central Arabian tribes. 29. For some years Turki-bin-Abdullah was engaged in hostilities A D 1829 against the Beni-Khalid of El-Hasa, the persistent opponents of the Wahabis, and eventually in 1829 inflicted on them a decisive defeat, when El-Hasa was occupied by the Wahabis and the Beni-Khalid Shaikhs were expelled. During all these proceedings Turki had continued to pay a tribute to a.d. 1830. Mahoramed Ali Pasha, who accorded countenance to his action. 30. In the year 1831 the Sultan of Maskat made overtures to the a.d. 1831. Wahabi Amir with a view to receiv ing the Government of the islands of Bahrein as the tributary of the Amir. The latter however preferred to receive the tribute for Bahrein from the Uttubi Sheikhs. At this period the whole line of coast as far as Eas-el-Hadd was dominated by the 'Wahabi, and rendered tribute. Turki-bin-Abdullah made friendly overtures to the Government of Bombay, which were politely acknowledged and led to no further result. 31. In the year 1834 the Chief of Bahrein threw off allegiance to the a.d. 1834. Wahabi, and even ventured to blockade i El-Katif and Ojair. 32. In 1834 the career of Turki-bin-Abdullah was cut short by his murder by a relative named Mashari, who was in turn put to death by Eeysal the son of the Amir Turki, and Eeysal became the recognized Chief of the Wahabis. 33. In the year 1835 we find record of the Governor of Mecca, Ahmed A.D. 1835. Pasha, attempting to assert his authority ^ v. i. c t'» i • . g iv i n g a lease of the customs of El- ^ .'L™™? 0 ''''- promptlj p.. . „ p 34 It was stated that on his return from Nejd, Ibrahim Pasha, took with Second Turkish expedition, 1838-40 severa ^ Abdullah-hin-Saud's o j * , ,, brothers, amongst them Khalid-hin- frrV-tf n 1 amed M&lt;,shari is said to have for a time claimed j ^ lef ® u P' ant ' to llave seized and put to death the Turks Khalid lZ er t r ' r re k f indly treated and S^nte l allowances in B^ypt Pmdng Peysal-bin-Turki refractory, Mahomed Ali Pasha resolved oa installing Khahd-bin-Saud as tributary ruler of Neid, and sent him with n force under command of Isma'il Bey who had orders to assist him to rnXgwd his authority As Khalid bad numerous adherents amongst tlie Arabs Pevsal had to retire to El-Hasa, aud Khalid with his Effvntian nnirilifirioo + ' i ■''i 0 ,Vf D r'?t* h , - »•«-»• s«bSx amvalof Khorsbeed Pasha with further reinforcements, Peysal was so hard- pressed that he surrendered himself and was sent a prisoner to Cairo. 5. Khorsheed Pasha then cast aside Khalid who had been , + i the b..d. of tU. Egvptian Co„ m ni, a ,„d b'ting aSbSri S'9 authority of tlie Egyptian Government over all Nejd, prepared to enforce the submission of the Bahrein Islands also. At this point the British Government interfered, and the remonstrances which were addressed to Mahommed Ali Pasha induced him to relinquish his designs on Bahrein. The British Govern ment had now adopted a decisive attitude, A. D. 1839. resolved to oppose the further pro gress of the Egyptian power as regarded Bahrein and Oman. It was even intimated that any attempts in that direction would be met by force. S q . Soon after the Egyptian forces commenced to evacuate Nejd, and Khalid was left as Vali or Governor on the part of the Turkish Government. In 1841 he was suspected of designs A ' 18 * against Oman, and a distinct warning was conveyed to him from the Government of India to desist. 87. In 18i2 Abdullah-bin-Thaneyyan-Ibrahim-bin-Thaneyyan-bin-Saud 4 headed a rising against Khalid, who, with the few remaining Egyptian troops, was ejected from Kiadh. 38. In 1843 Eeysal-bin-Turki having escaped from confinement appeared in Nejd and succeeded in recovering his position as Amir. One of the first steps he took was to prepare to send a force under Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak to reduce Oman to obedience When the Chiefs of Oman appealed to the British to save them from subjection to the Wahabi Chief, they were informed that the previous policy of opposition to the progress of the Wahabis in their direc tion had reference to extension of the Egyptian power, and, as that was no longer apprehended, no interference was contemplated on their behalf. Eeysal having at the same time made friendly overtures to the British Government, they were responded to in the same spirit. Nevertheless, when Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak the General and Agent of the Amir Eeysal, threatened Maskat in the year 1845, he was met by a British naval demonstration on the Batina Coast. On this oc casion the Regent of Maskat engaged to pay a yearly tribute of 5,000 dollars, and on that condition peace was concluded. The fort of Bereymee continued' in the occupation of the Wahabi Agent, a position from which he could dominate the pirate coast and command the passes to Eastern 'Oman. On one occasion in 1848 the Chief of the Beni-Yas succeeded in ejecting the Wahabi garrison from Bereymee, but they soon recovered it. 39. The province of El-Hasa was forced to submit to Feysal's authority, having been reduced by Abdullah, the Amir's eldest son, reputed a brave and skillful commander. In the west Jebel Shammer had through the energy and ability of its Chief Abdullah-bin-Rashid been permanently detached from the Wahabi possessions. Eeysal himself had his residence at Riadh, which town had been selected as capital by Turki-bin-Abdullah, The Amir at this period of his life was infirm and obese, and suffered also from ophthalmia, which eventually deprived him of sight. 40. When the Chief of Bahrein, Mahomed bin-Khalifah, received the aid of the Wahabi Amir, he bad agreed to pay a yearly tribute of 4000 dollars. In the year 1851 a quarrel arose a.d.1851. between the Amir and the Bahrein Chief, in consequence of which the fornner appeared in person in El-Katr, and hav- ing detached the tribes of that district from the Uttubi cause, threatened to occupy Bahrein Islands. This was prevented by the appearance on the scene of British vessels of war, and an arrangement was come to by which the town of El-Bidaa was restored to the Bahrein Chief. 41. In order to arrest the threatened invasions of the Arab tribes on the course the Resident in 1855 found it Feysal 's nominal dependence on necessary to point out to Eeysal that the Turkey, 1855. British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, But Eeysal replied :— ' With regari to what you observe that engagements have existed between the Chiefs of the coast of Oman and the Resident for a period of 3U years, this is well known to me^ [C967ED]10 1 their oMect be'no- to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which I quite approve on the part of Residents both those who have g &gt;ne before, and those who come after for there is an under standing between us and the British Government of 100 years duration for the security d traders and travellers passing on the s^as. The coasts of Oman, however, and the territories thereof appertain to the Peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority. Further the people of the district* in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes or more powerful than, and have the command over the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained from preying upon and slaughtering them but that 1 maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds th-m Lack from the people of the coast. These last are well assured o£ his protection; otherwise, wero they abandoned to their fate they could not subsist. Moreover, when owing to their negligence, disairreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed have arisen between some of the Chiefs of the coasts aforesaid there was none who could check them and restore order and good will among them, except the Lieutenant in charge of Oman, whose office is among the things pleasing to God and his Prophet, as also to the Sultan of the faithful—may God strengthen the faith by his means Being a depen dant of the exalted Turkish Government, I hold the confirmation of the Sultan to my continuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mahomed Ah Pasha, having projected his schemes against Basrah and Mohammfrah and the territory pertaining thereto entertaining designs upon Indi^, deputed his envoy to me, proposing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his owu sons, to induce me to forward his views with respect to the ccast of Oman and elsewhere within the Peninsula of Arabia, and to offer no hind rance or opposition—for of others, besides the Arabs, he took no account owing to his exalted dignity— I replied,' you know that I am a dependant of the Sultan of the faithful frotn whom if you possess orders to that effect let me be informed of them ; otherwise the thing is impossible/ Thereon war broke out between me and him, which lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte, and they (the Suluan's Govern-nent) greatly rejoiced and were rauoh pleased with me and my influence and consideration with them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their State ' 42. In writing in this strain Eeysal's object apparently was twofold ; first to put forward a general claim to lordship over the whole of Arabia; and second, to try whether the affectation of being only the Viceregent of a Euro pean Power might serve to divert the British Government from interference between himself and the maritime Arabs whom he asserted to be his feudatories. 43. A letter of this period from the Resident is of some interest as showing the designs upon Arabia then entertained by either the Ottoman Porte or, as is more probable, Abbas Pasha, the half-crazy debauchee who succeeded Mahomed Ali in Egypt. Colonel Hennell speaks of the probable acquisition of Bahrein by the Wahabis as being tantamount to its acquisition by the Porte, and justifies this assertion by the following considerations :—the Amir pays a regular tribute to the Turkish Government; there are accredited envoys Irom Abbas Pasha in the Amir's camp; the Wahabi Agent at Koweit (a Turkish port) passes himself off as an envoy from the Pasha of Egypt; there are Turkish emissaries along the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf ; and Turkish Steamers are in course of equipment for service in the Gulf. 44. Mahomed-bin-Abdullah had, in 1843, been expelled from Bahrein, the government of which he had seized the previous year, and for several iTWnT^oin iTotif a n iq^q years the ex-Chief had resided at Damaum TrouDlesm Katit, a.d 1859. , , . , . under Wahabi protection ; until in the year 1859 Eeysal determined to support him in recovering the government of the islands, and made preparations to give him active assistance. A demonstr ation was thereupon made by the British squadron which had the effect of frustrating the scheme to the intense annoyance of the Wahabi Amir. On the British Resident demanding the expulsion of Mahoramed-bin-Abdullah from Damaum, Feysal replied in terms of bitter reproach, inveighing, against the policy of the British Government in denying his right of suzerainty over Bahrein and the Uttubis. The Amir was able to complain with truth that ' the actual Chief of Bahrein, Mahomed-bin-Khalifali, had provoked his resentment, and rendered himself justly liable to reprisals by inciting the tribes of El-Katar to acts of aggression against Wahabi subjects. In 1861 the a.d. 1861. Bahrein Chief went so far as to cruise with six armed boats againt Damaum, a proceeding which was disapproved and censured by the British Government. Pressure was brought on Mahommed-bin-Khalifah to force him to withdraw/ 11 his vessels to his own waters, aud he was bound by treaty, in 1861, to refrain from such acts of aggression in future. By the action of the British squadron towards Damaum the same year, the refugee Sheikh Mahommed-bin-Abdullah was forced to quit that place. 45. These strong measures elicited a remonstrance from the Turkish Gov- Turkish Protest against British pro- ernor General of Baghdad. He wanted to ceedings, 1802. know by what .right we had bombarded Damau, a place which, as lying within the territory of ' Peysal Beg, the Kaunmakam of Nejd,' was ' part of th.e hereditary dominions of the Sultan.' To which Her Brit;innic Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto e ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Feysal as well as with all the Chiefs and Principalities situated on the shores of the, Persian Gulf*; that our pacific policy in the Gulf was well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we ' had never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority and jurisdiction moreover which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.' In report ing this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constanti nople the Consul-General wrote as follows :— ' Althoush it may not be denied that, since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in ISSO-^O, Amir Feysal has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his iributfl heing regarded probably as an o9ering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Poite has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority over that country. Were it otherwise, w^re a Turkish administration established capable o£ controlling the province, restraining the Wahabis and their deppndants from the piratical practices for which they were once so notorious, and finally of preventing or giving satisfaction for any breach of international law, such a state of thinsrs might be as conducive to good order, as it would be certainly less burdensome to the British Government than the maritime surveillance, which, in the interests of commerce, the British Government is now compelled to maintain in the Persian Gulf. But in point, of fact, the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tribu tary ; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country ; and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi Coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty's Indian Government in that quarter.' 46. In August of 1865 a combined force of Wahabis and Jenebah tribe British war against Amir Fe^sai, attacked and plundered the Oman port of a. d. 1865. Soor, during which affair certain British subject were sufferers. A remonstrance was accordingly addressed to the Wahabi Amir, which failing to elicit satisfaction, a demonstration was made by h. M. s. Highflyer off Katif and Demau. At the latter place the opera tions were unsuccessful and unfavourable, but the forts of Soor were destroyed and the Jenebah tribe punished Before further measures could be taken, the old Amir Peysal-bin-Turki died. Por some years before his death he had been incapacitated for work by blindness and feebleness, and the power had. been virtually exercised by his son 'Abdullah, who now succeeded as Amir. 47. Abdullah-bin-Peysal lost no time in sending an agent named Mahom- a d 1865 ed-bin-Abdullah-bin-Manah on a mis sion to Bushire charged with friendly over tures to the British representative, and to convey the assurances of the new Amir to the British Government that he would pay due regard to British in terests in future. The Amir engaged to abstain from attacking Arab States in friendly alliance with the British. Government, and to content himself with receipt of the customary tribute from the Maskat State. These assurances having been accepted by the British Government, no further action in reference to past offences was taken. 48.-A. One of the grounds, on which the Porte based its claim to sovereignty Obsolete title of award Of Arabia by o y e . r the Arabian Peninsula was ex- an Abbaside Caliph to the Porte. plained m a memorandum drawn by the Moore's Precis. Rev. Mr. Badger, of the conversation Secret E., August 1883, jSfos. 221-225. which that gentleman had in Paris with M. de Remusat, the French Minister for Foreign Affairs and Server Pasha, then12 Ottoman Ambassador to France, and forwarded to the Foreign Office in 1872 by Sir B. Frere, then on his way to Zanzibar as special envoy. In this memorandum,'after observing that from wbat bad passed be inferred that the Porte bad ' signified to Fra-Dce its claim to the entire seaboard of Arabia, extending from Suez to the bead of the Persian Gulf, and therefore including Oman or the principality of Maskat.' Dr. Badger continued : — ' The claim of Turkey to the Provinces of Yemen and Nejd, and to the intervening maritime provinces, including Oman, is founded on the fiction that a lineal descendent of the Ambasside Khalifahs of Baghdad invested Salim II, after his conquest of E^ypt and his suc cesses on the sjiores o£ the Red Sea, with the sovereig-nty over the whole of Arabia. It is indisputable, however, that during the existence of the dynasty nearly the whole of Arabia had revolted from its authorities and set up native principalities and chiefdoms, which have maintained their independence until the recent attempts made by the Turks to subjugate them in Yemen and Nejd. All that they can fairly lay claim to is the seaboard of Arabia from Suez to Mokha which they have held with occasional intermission since their first conquests in the Red Sea in the 16th century. As regards Oman, the native annals of the province incontestably prove that it became indep D ndent of the Baghdad Khalifate in the loth century and has never since been subject to foreign rule except for a short time to the Persians. The same is tmeof the Arab chiefd'»ms »n the Pei sian Gulf, whose history is intimately connected with that of Oman ; moreover, it. is indisputable that neither the Turks nor the Egyptians have ever exercised any jurisdiction over the territories referred to, and that the Turks themselves, in 1847, virtually admitted the independence of the Imams and other Arab chief- doms in the Persian Gulf, is proved in the folioving extract from a Vizerial letter addressed to the Pasha of Baghdad on the subject of the slave trade as given in Aitchison's Treaties, Volume VII, page 192 ;— ' Votre Excellence sait qu'il a dan ces environs la des Gouvernements, efc des Imams iodependants et, cela etant, des chatiments dont il s^agit^ ne peuvent pas etre appliques a leurs batiments.^ But preposterous as their claims may be, there is every probability that the Turks will lose no time in endeavouring to enforce them. The result of partial success would be to introduce a fresh element of complication and strife into the Eastern Sea without any correspondina' advantage either to the Turks themselves or to the threatened maritime Native States and chiefdoms, or to the British GovernmenV 4:8«B. It would seem that the Sublime Porte had at this time in view the Holy ottoman Empire. idea . of sewing in the whole of the Arabian peninsula its religio political empire, what may be called the Eoly Ottoman Empire, in analogy of the Holy Boman • see Bryce's Holy Eoman Empire.

International arrangements took place among many of these states of the Holy Roman Empire or between many of them and states outside the Empire, without the cognizance of, or in opposition to, the Imperial Power or the Boman Pontiff, a process which might as well and is in fact repeated in our days in the Holy Ottoman Empire.13 CHAPTER THIRD. * Turkisli Expedition into Nejd and Hasa, 1871-72. 49. We have seen that Abdullah succeeded ^eysal as Amir of Nejd. Abdullah bin Feysal's chnracter was never such Origin of the Expedition. . . , . ' i /v i- &lt;• ji ti as to win him much aiTection irom the warlike nomad tribes, who constitute the figbtinsr power of Nejd. In tarlv manhood, when heir apparent and practically regent for his blind father, he shewed some energy and ability as a leader of raids, but whnt popularity he then enjoyed was far exceeded by that of his brother Saud, the beau-ideal of an Arab prince—handsome, reckless, frank and open-handed. On their father Eeysal's death in 1865, the inevitable contest be?an between the brothers for the Amirship. It lasted until 1870, when Abdullah, finally defeated, sought the aid of the hated, and, as the Wahabis of Nejd hold, in fidel Turks. Tne result was that a r iurkish expedition under Midhut Pasha, Valiof Baghdad, proceed ing from Basrah by sea, occupied, with Abdullah's aid, the Hasa District of the Nejdean Principality. First report of intended Expedition. 49-A.. Some rumour of an intended expedition reached the Indian Govern- o . t ,0^, x. C oi CCt: /^ Ko^\ ment in the beginning of 1871, and Secret L, 1871, Nos, 581-655 (5»o 581). ^ Tr , , i i i ,1 , Colonel Herbert was asked by telegraph on the 17th February whether it was tnri that the Ottoman Government were preparing a force at Baghdad with the view of occupyins: positions on the Arabian Coast. He replied that there was apparently no foundation for the rumour, and that no troops were available for such a purpose; he would report immediately if any such design was ascertained. Coionel Herbert at the same time telegraphed to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, enquiring whether, as rumoured in Baghdad, the Porte contemplated sending four ships of war to the Persian Gulf, and whether there was any intention of occupying positions therein. He received a reply that the Porte denied all intention of occupying positions in the Guif, but two of the vessels composing the Yemen expedition were to be stationed between the Bed Sea and the Persian Gu^. Design of Expedition revived. • 60. On the 27th March Colonel Herbert intimated by telegraph that' ibid. (No. 582). under orders from Constantinople, an expedition wis about to be sent by land and sea from Baghdad towards Nejd with the view of supporting Abdullah. He was asked in reply how the Turkish expedition by sea was to go, and at what part of the Arab Coast it was proposed that it should land. His answer was that it would go in one corvette and three unarmed steamers and in such other vessels as could be obtained, and that it would disembark at Katif or l)amaum. Position of parties in Nejd. 61. In consequence of this news, the Resident in the Persian Gulf was Hid. (No.585.) 1 ^s^cted on the 2Sth March to telegraph the latest particulars about Wahabi affairs and to describe the situation of the contending parties. It was ascer tained from him that the Wahabi Amir, Saud (brother of Abdullah), stil held the district of Hasa, with the sea coast, and that he was about to move for another battle with his brother. Abdullah was a fugitive. A letter from Colonel Pelly, dated 11th March, contained substantially the same intelligence. • The contents of this chapter are main y indebted to Major Henderson's Frecis of the Nejd Expedition. [C967rD] D14 Expedition temporarily postponed: Enquiries made from Porte re garding it. 52. On the 31st March 1871, Colonel Herbert was requested to ascertain from the Pasha whether any communica- Ihid. (Nos. 587 and 589.) tion ^ ^ een m ^ e to our Minister at Constantinople on the subject of the eKpedition. He replied that the Pasha did not know. The expedition had, he said, been temporarily postponed. All the information regarding the expedition was telegraphed home to ie ecrc ary o State on the 31st March, and he was told: ' Warlike operations in any part of Gnlf to be deprecated as breach of maritime peace, r destructive to our trade, and likely to give rise to Ibid, (No. 688.) complications. Her Majesty's Government should move Minister at Constantinople to communicate with Porte, state our objections, and endeavour to stop operations by sea.' Earlier instructions given to Colonel Felly. 53. The Bombay Government, on the 11th April, telegraphed that Colonel Pelly had reported that the belief in the ibid. (No. 59i.) expedition was general in Bushire :— 'I am,' said Colonel Pelly, indirectly asked whether Arabs would be forbidden aiding Wahabis against Turks. I respectfully request instructions, and, unless specially ordered, should not interfere, as maritime truce does n* t relate to Turks. If Government wish me to watch proceedings, an efficient steamer would be necessary. 'Ihere is at present no Govern ment vessel in Persian Gulf. I suggest that Government of India request Political Agent, Baghdad, to keep me informed of expedition movement.' 54. The Bombay Government was told:— ' In event of expedition sailing, Pelly should not interfere with proceedings of Turkish authorities without specific orders from Govern- (No. 592.) ment of India, to whom he should immediately report. If Arabs take part in quarrel, he should limit his action strictly to maintaining maritime truce. No vessel need be sent specially to Persian Gulf. 'Porte' understood to have sailed yesterday.' 55. Colonel Pelly enquired on the 22nd April:— Am I crrrect in understanding that Government of India desire me to use all influence Ibid (No 599) towards preventing trucial Chiefs aiding Wahabis against Turks, or in any way moving by sea?

Colonel Herbert telegraphed, on the 17th April, that preparations for w rq.v the expedition were being resumed and that it would leave Baghdad in a few days. Three steam vessels had been ordered to convey six regiments and 12 guns. One thousand Ar ib horses to go by land. The first portion of the force left Baghdad on the 23rd April, and another detachment two days after. Complications in Gulf. 57. The Bombay Government, on the 3rd May, forwarded the following' n. cur from Colonel Pelly :— Ibtd. (No. 611.) ^ &lt;c Imam Saud and Bahrein Chief write'that Turkish Arab Chief of Koweit is preparing to aid expedition. Imam requests Koweit may be restrained, or Imam be permitted to act by sea. Bahrein Chief relies on trucial engagement and advice and protection. My respectful opinion is, that Turkish expedition is on every account inexpedient, and should, if possible, be averted. If persisted in, Indian Government are not committed to interfere under trucial engagement as between Wahabis, Koweits. and Turks. 1 think we could not assent to a naval attack by Turks or Koweit on trucial Chiefs loval to their engagements with us. I t Para -raph 55 respectfully solicit early instructions on this tele- 0 gram and that of 22nd April.'t15 Tlie Bombay Government obserred:— ' It is probable Turkish Governor may count on our known policy preventing all naval operations by littoral powers in Gulf, but Turkey no party to truce. To prevent Wahabi from acting- by sea against Turk or Koweit if allied with Turkey is practically an active interference in favour of Turkey. Neither Wahabi nor Koweit parties to truce/' 58. On the 9th May the following enquiry from Colonel Pelly was received iud (No 626) through the Bombay Government :— 'Can Turks and Koweit make trucial Chiefs harbour a basis of operations against 'Wahabis in friendly relation with Chief ? * * * I presume British subjects employed on Turkish vessels could not be concerned in molestation of trucial Chief.' Colonel Felly's object in asking this last question is explained in his letter No. 505—130, dated 20th. May. He was under the imf ression that the debarka tion could only be effected by force and by aid of the fleet's artillery. A debarkation of this character would, in his opinion, constitute a maritime operation, and woulcT—- ' afford ground for misrepresentation and even misunderstanding of our known policy of preventing all naval operations by the littoral powers of the Persian Gulf.'

A general view of the British policy of the Gulf, how that policy was •ji'j ry tj q likely to be affected by the Turkish ifocZ K.-W., pages 7-8. • 7 J . . i , j.1 • i.- expedition, was discussed at this time m the Foreign Department. The following is extracted from the Foreign Secre tary Mr. Aitch ison's note, dated 3rd May 1871:— ' It should never be forgotten that, in all its main features, our position in the Persian Gulf is one which we bave taken up on grounds of policy. Its foundation in Treaty is of the most meagre and narrow kind. In reality it is a position which we have arbitrarily assumed as an act of State or conquest, the justification of it lying, in the circumstances of the time at which we entered on it; and, secondly, the length of time during which we have asserted the position we have assumed. His Excellency in Council may, perhaps, rot be aware how exceedingly narrow is the scope of the Treaty emjagements with the Aratf tribes for the maintenance of the peace at pea. The Chief of Bahrtin is bound by his special agreement to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description so long as he is protected by the British Government from similar aggressions by the Chiefs and tribes of the Gulf. But the Chiefs who have subscribed the perpetual peace have bound themselves only to absisRn from aggressions on the subjects of the subscribing parties, and orfr riyht or duty to interfere in virtue of the Treaty is limited to cases in which one of the parties to the maritime peace commits an outrage on another. In all c-ther cases our interference with warlike (Tperations, whether by parties to the Treaty of peace, or by Chiefs who are nut parties to that Treaty, is based on no letter fonndaticn than our own determination to do so, and the fact that we have done so for a long series of years. If we have no Treaty right, and are under no Treaty obligation to prevent such an expedition as the present on the part of Turkey or Persia, neither have we any such right, or are we under any such obligation, to prevent any of the subscribers to the maritime peace from attacking the Turks or the Persians by sea, or fitting out a similar expedition against any party who has not signed the Treaty. It may be said that the Turkish expedition is so far peculiar, that it is proceeding against Turkish subjects to re-establish authority in their own country. The recent telegrams make this by no means certain, but even if it be the case, it hardly affects the question. We cannot make our policy at sea depmd on Arab politics ash' re; we cannot attempt to make our interference to prevent an expedition by sea depend on the justice or injustice of the claims which the expedition is intended to assert. To do so would involve us in the intricate domestic relations of the Arab tribes, which we neither know nor are capable of understanding. Hitherto our policy has been to prevent all expeditions by sea and to impose the restriction on all alike, both great and small The possibility of our maintaining our position seems to me to depend on onr maintaining it in its integrity If we admit exceptions, I do not see where we can stop in our retreat till we reach the narrow ground covered by our Treaties. We shall never make the exceptions intelligible to those who are not admitted to the benefit of them - If the Turks send their troops by sta, the Wahabis and the Arab Chiefs who support Saud have clearly a ri^ht to attack them by sea. If the Arabs are defeated, we cannot prevent the Turks from exercis ing over them all the rights of successful war, and establishing their supremacy over the Arab country. There is then an end to our policy in the Gulf ; or if the Arab Chiefs, remaining quiet now, wish hereafter to tit out some naval force, how are we to prevent them when we16 have permittpd the Turks to do so, or how are we to make the prohibition intelligible^ ? Or if Persia, desirous to have a fleet in the Gulf to establish her claims to supremacy, should throw herself on some foreign power and procure vessels of war, on what grounds are we to remons trate ? She could only do so on grounds equally applicable to the prevention of this expedition, and by declining to interfere with this expedition, we almost debar ourselves from urging those grounds against Persia, or at all events greatly weaken the force of the argument and the value of the remonstrance. This expedition is like the little rent in the emliankment, insigni ficant in itself and easily repaired at first, but if not repaird, certain to end in the destruction of the whole work.' 60. Various despatches, ending with No. 28 of tke 2(Hli May 1870, had been addressed to the Secretary of State regarding the policy of the British Government in the Gulf. Thus the precise relations in which the British Gov ernment stood in regard to such powers as Turkey and Persia, as well as to the less powers, not having been precisely determined, it was difficult for the Gov ernment of India to adopt a tangible and intelligible policy. 61. Colonel Felly's telegram regarding Koweit {vide paragraph 57) illus trated the difficulties of the position. Koweit is a port on* the extreme north west of the Persian Gulf; and Mr. Aitchison observed :— ' The inhabitants acknowleged the sovereignty of the Porte, and 'se the Turkish flag, though their allegiance to the Sultan is merely rominal. The ruling family are a branch of the Uttoobee tribe with the patronymic f Al Subah/ The Bahrein family, it will be remem bered, are also a branch of the Uttoobees. Colonel Pelly was quite right in stating* that, the » Vide paragraph 57. Indian Government are not committed to inter-, fere under trucial engagpments as between Wahabis, Koweits, and Turks/ But neither are we, except in regard to Bahrein, committed to interfere under trucial engagements as between Turks, Koweits, and the trucial Chiefs. We are committed under the Treaty only to interference as between the trucial Chiefs them selves. The Treaty with Bahrein has wider scope. The Chief of Bahrein agrees to abstain from all maritime aggressions of every description, so long as he receives the'support of the British Government against similar aggressions from the Chiefs and tribes of the Gulf; he agrees to inake known to the Resident, as arbitrator, all aggressions and depredations which may be designed by sea against him ; 4 and the British Resident engages that he will forthwith take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation for every injury proved to have been inflicted, or in course of infliction, by sea upon Bahrein, or upon its deppndencies in this Gulf/ We are' therefore, bound to interfere on behalf of Bahrein should any attack by sea be made or desio-n- ed ; in regard to the other Chiefs, except incase of attack by one subscribing Chief upon another, our interference is matter of policy and not of obli^atioa.' Explicit assurances of the Porte. # 62. On the 25th April, Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that, if the » Hid (No. 601.) expedition to Nejd was successful, it . . . . ^ ^ 1 would eventually be directed to the ac quisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the Arab Coast. He requested instructions Being asked his authority for the statement, he replied that the report now generally believed at Baghdad, and accorded with Turkish pretensions as reported m his letter of 16th March 1&amp;70. That letter gave cover to a protest by Mnihut Pasha on behalf of his Government against the proceedings which Colonel Pelly had, with the sanction of the British Government, taken a short time before at Bahrein. The Pasha stated that—- ' Bahrein and its dependencies are countries of the Ottoman dominions, ar.d the Gov- Government a PP erta1 ^ to the Kaim-Makamiek of Nejd, subject to the Ottoman The protest was sent to the Secretary of State under cover of a Secret des patch No. 28 of 20th May 1870, from the Government of India with the iGmarKs • 'We have already infovraed Your Grace that any disposition to admit the pretensions of Persia to supremacy over Bahrein weald probably lead to the revival of similar obsolete efcims 0,1 the now actually been brought 6 Cla ' mS and as Your Grace will perceive from Colonel Herbert's lette^of efh arch 11 wh^W ab0Ut ' 0 B f altTb s T sof , t , his 1 de?p t R h, ,^ s E ' e,leno y tttVe™ Baghdad has formally claimed Bahrein and its dependencies as countries of the O mons^ Th.s cla.m rests on no better foundation than that of Persia.

On 28th April, Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows ' Ambassador telegraphs repeatedly at my request the following :—I have positive assur- No. 608. ances from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing supermacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes o£ Southern Arabia and that no special attack is contemplated against them ' 64. Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25th, regarding the rumoured ibid No co5 intentions of the expedition, was reported on 28th, to the Secretary of State, who was asked whether an assurance could not be obtained from the Turkish Gov ernment that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty's Government have received assurance from Constantinople that Turkish Government have no such designs as those mentioned.' To clear up the discrepancy between the imformation received from Her Majesty's Government, and that received from the Political Agent at Baghdad, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was immediately communicated with by telegraph both direct and through Colonel Herbert. 65. The result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the Ibid No. 686. : ' The Ottoman PorU explicitly denies all intention of extending supremacy over Bahrein Muscat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack against them. The sole object of the expedition is declared to he the restoration in Nejd of the iranquillitu which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers Sheikh Abdoollah and Sheikh Saood. I received assurances that no maritime operations are intended in the Gulf, the vessel employed being only intended as transport io convey troop* io a point from which they can reach Nejd'' 66. A detailed account of the interview on the 26th April at which the Grand Vizier communicated these assurances regarding the intentions of the Secret h., 1871, No.-. 114-120. was forwarded by India Office despatch No 29, dated 12th May 1871. It appears that the following memorandum by Sir H. Elliot was communicated through Mr. Pisani to the Grand Yizier :— The accounts from Bagdad are to the effect that, for a considerable time past, Midhut Pasha had l^een endeavouring to attract the attention of the Porte, to the movement going on m Nejd and the adjacent provinces. His Excellency wishes to obtain for the Ottoman Gov- eminent a more real supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, and the independent tribes of So^ith Arabia; has induced him to persuade the Porte to undertake a cottly and impossible enterprise indeed, under the ostensible pretext of supporting Abdoollah, whom he has representetf as Abdoollab, after succeeding his father as absolute l^aimakan or functionary of the Ottoman Govern- Ruler of Nejd, may have been recognized by the ment, of which he has hitherto maintained his rorte as its Governor, but it is 8 delusion to speak Of perfect independence. The anxietv of Midhut him as Kaimakan.' t &gt; i, ±. t .i. • . i ^ , xm - jwiuu Paslia to obtain the command of Bahrein and Katit, ^ and to establish the supremacy of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia*, has the appearance of not being untinctured with a growing jealousy of British influence in the Persian Gulf. It is too late to hope that what I cannot but look upon as an ill-advised expedition will be stopped ; bnt as any disturbance of the existing relations of the different Governments on the borders of the Persian Gulf will certainly not be seen with indifference by Her Majesty's Government, Mr. Pisani will tell the Grand Vizier that I should be glad to o-ive Lord Granville such explanations as shall re-assure them with regard to the object of it When the report of an intended expedition in the Persian Gulf and Central Arabia reached me some months ago, I was authorized to assure Her Majesty's Government that it had no founda tion. It now appears that, although, at that time the Porte had no intention of sending one the Governor-General of Bagdad had resolved upon it, and the motive was assigned to it of the necessity of supporting the authority of a purely nominal Kaimakan, who had never before re cognized that of the Porte, must necessarily be received with caution '. 67. Mr. Pisani replied:— ^ 'I have communicated word for word to Ali Pasha Your Excellences instruction of this ? ! i? te re ^ ve J 10 Nejd, &amp;c. After I concluded, His Highness seemed excited and annoved and told me that all independent States are perfectly at liberty to deal with their internal affairs as circumstances may require. Nejd, he went on to say, being an integral part of the Sultan's dominions, the Porte cannot he debarred from the exercise of its authority over it. He con tended that Abdoollah is not an absolute ruler, as supposed, but a functionary holding his ap- [C967rD]18 pointment of Kaimakan in virtue of an imperial firman, and therefore entitled to be supported by the Government against those who attack him. Your Excellency, mid Ali Paakt, may give the most positive assurances to Her Majesty's Government that the Vorte entertains no intention whatever of ohtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes of South Arabia, and does not contemplate any attach upon them or harbour any design to subdue them. He asserts that the true and sole object of the present enterprise is to pacify the two brothers, io prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity ' 11, Midhut Paska confirms assurances of Porte. 68. On receipt of the above assurances from the Porte, Colonel Herbert e . r i dm xt *0-. ^ / tit was directed on the 17th May to take an secret i., 1871, nos. 581-685 (no. 644-). , . .. i i. i * j? i early opportunity, without seeking a formal interview with Midhut Pasha, of expressing casually to him the satisfaction of the British Government at the communication from the Porte. This he did and informed Government that the Pasha explicitly confirmed the assurances of the Porte. 12- Instructions to Colonel Pelly. 69. The receipt of the above assurances from the Porte enabled Govern- md no. 645. rDent to ' ive tlle muc ^ required instruc tions to Colonel Pelly. He was directed, in a letter dated 17th May to the Bombay Government, 'to communicate the substance of Sir H. Elliot's message to the Chief of Bahrein and those of the trucial Chiefs who had made enquiries regarding the object of the Turkish expedition. With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly it was said: rr he should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to give instructions regarding- contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect. The Turkish expedition, however, in no way affects the Treaty rights and obligations either of the British Government or of the Chiefs who have subscribed the maritime peace. Colonel Pelly may so inform the Chiefs who have consulted him, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the Treaties.' Eeport to Secretary of State with views of Government. 70. On the 23rd May Government forwarded to the Secretary of State all the papers received up to date regarding events in Nejd and the expedition, and after a resume of the # correspondence that had taken place, observed .- • f 'Although the assurances so explicitly given by the Turkish Government may for the present allay any immediate apprehensions, we think it not improbable that the expedition to Nejd may, trom the force of circumstances, assume more serious proportions than the Porte at present contemplate. ' We beg to draw the attention of Your Graee to the latest letters on the snbieet received from the Political Agent at Bagdad. These papers show the difficulties which the Turks are likely to encounter, and the complications that may arise from the prosecution of their enterpnse. It is, therefore highly desirable, both in the interest of the Porte and the peace of the Persian Gulf, that the expedition should be stopped, and if that is, as we fear, no lon-er feasible that the Government ot the Porte should be advised to limit its proportions as much C the British policy, as described in paragraph 59 of this Precis, was placed before the Secretary of State, with a request that the Government of India might be favored with the views of Her Maiestv's Gov ernment on the subject. J Colonel Pelly directed to proceed to Bahrien. 72. Colonel Pelly on the 25th Hay reported that the commercial classes secret i, nos. 806-849 (no. 819). disturbed and anxious, and that • i u i.T i. -i , tlie P ear l season would be lost. He en- quired whether tribes who are parties to the maritime truce were to be allowed19 to undertake operations by sea on the interest of either party. On the 30th May the following reply was sent him :— ' Go to Bahrein in Hugh Rose, Magpie and Bullfinch to accompany. Assure Pahrien « y... , Chief in words of Turkish assurance* as stated in kt&lt;ze paragrapa b5. mv separate tele-ram. Inform him that as long as he observes condititioa. of Articles 2 and 3 of Treaty, our obligations will be futilled. Inform persons interested in pearl fishery that their interests will be protected. Inform all Chiefs, trucial and others, that the Tarkish Government contemplates no attack on them, and has no intention to obtain supremacy orer any independent State.' Secretary of State's instructions with regard to preventing trucial Chiefs from aiding either party. 73. With reference to Colonel Felly's enquiry regarding trucial Chiefs, in 77.vv ft?? the preceding paragraph, the Secretary - o- - . 0 £ g|. a |. e was hy the Viceroy on the 30th May:— 'If Pelly asks whether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs, either for or against Turks, am i to authorize him to do so ? I advise this course, and that you should inform Turkish Government accordingly. This will not include Koweit Chief, who has already sailed.' „., „ 74. A reply was received hy telegram on Ihxd No. 841. . 1 (»n • i the following day:— ' Persian Gulf Trucial Chiefs may he interdicted from maritime operations, lut no others.' The Bombay Government were directed on the 5th June to inform Colonel Pelly accordingly, and to instruct him to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. Pasha promises non-interference with littoral Arabs. 74. On the 26th May Colonel Ibid No. 810. . i _ ^ Herbert was told :— e&lt; Ask Midhut Pasha whether any orders have been issued regarding interference of the Chiefs or tribes on the shores of the Gulf ? Have the Turks invited, any of the littoral Arabs to accompany or assist them, or take part in their operations by sea ? md No. 813. He replied :— % ' Pasha states Sheikh and tribe from Koweit voluntarily accompany expedition, part in merchant vessels part by land. No communication with other littoral tribes.' Porte promises non-interference with Trucial Chiefs, but claims to accept their services when offered. 75. The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 74) to prevent o . .

Elliot wrote, on the 8th June:— ' Ali Pasha expressed his thanks for the communication, and having, in uniquivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operations^ said that if had no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs included in the maritime truce. At the same time, however, the Porte, having no cognizance of the truce could not he expecied to be held hound hy it K Q.nd would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who might tender them. ' 75-A. At the instance of the India Office, Sir R. Elliot was directed hy the ibid^o 67 Foreign Office to furnish the Turkish Government with a copy of the British engagements with the Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf for the maintenance20 of the maritime peace. He was further requested to inform the Porte that the British Govemment intended to hold these Chiefs to their engagements. Sir H. Elliot replied on the 19th July that he had already explained to the Porte the nature of the arrangements with the Chiefs upon the coast of the Persian Gulf with regard to the maritime truce, and had made it understood that Her Majesty's Government would watch over their observance. The engasrements with the Chiefs contained in the State papers and e Her islet's Treaties ' had, said the Ambassador, been communicated to the Porte, the Collection of Aitchison not being in the archives of the Embassy. Observations of Midhut Pasha on the instructions given to Colonel Pelly. 76. The instructions given to Colonel Pelly {vide paragraph 74) were com municated in writing to Midhut Pasha. Colonel Herbert telegraphed :— u Yours o£ thirtieth received, and purport communicated in writing to Pasha on 31st. His Excelleney replies observing that in instructions to Pelly mention is made of Treaty existing in name of British Government. He reiterates verbal communication that the object of expedition is expulsion of Saood from Kateef and Hasa, and restoration of tranquil lity there ; that Bahrein is not within Turkish contemplation. Expresses equal desire for protection of vessels and pearl fisheries in those waters, and states this is arranged as a duty of expedition. Expresses thanks that Pelly is instructed to assist in preserving order and tranquillity. Regarding independent tribes states, if not within Nejd, that is Abdoollah's jurisdiction, present project has and can have no connection with them ; but that if any tribe, supposed to be independent, be in Nejd, and aiding Saood and opposing the Govern ment, although present design as above stated, it will become duty of troops to punish such tribes. Declares non-existence and impossibility of existence of such independent tribe in country of Nejd. I write by post.' Expedition prohibited by Pasha from approaching Bahrein. 77. In reply to a query whether Turkish vessels would disembark only at Katif or Damaum, as contemplated in the previous March (vide paragraph 50), Colonel Herbet replied— ' Pasha states the destination of the expedition being Katif, he has given orders to disembark the troops there, or, if necessary, at a locality close to it, which they erroneously called Ojair, name not known, and the orders having been so given, the Commandant cannot act contrary to the instructions received. His Excellency does not deem necessary to issue orders prohibiting disembarkation at other ports except Bahrein, which the expedition is pro hibited from approaching.' Colonel Herbert, in a letter dated 24ith May, writes:— ' He [i. e., Midhut Paslja) assured me his orders to the officer commanding the expedition were that he should on no account turn his eyes on Bahrein, and if invited to receive hospi tality there, that he should decline such invitation/' Enquiries from Persia regarding expedition. 78. Mr. Alison on the 14th May telegraphed to Earl Granville ' King is desirous of obtaining some assurance respecting Turkish expedition as affecting Bahrein/ - ' In reply to this the India Office requested that the Shah might be made aware of the Grand Vizier's declarations regarding the absence of all intentions on the part of the Porte to obtain a supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, &amp;c. Non interference in political questions enjoined on Colonel Herbert. 79. In a telegram of the 2nd June. Colonel Herbet informed Govern- ment :— c , ' ^ the last nnmber of the local Government jouroal eight towns of Oman, inclndin- Shargah, Debay, and Ahuthabi, all traoial, are enumerated in list of houses and gardens of country of Nejd. .Request instructions. Government replied ' In all your communications with Pasha confine yourself to reminding His Excellenov of the engagement given by Government not to undertake any operations*' by sea beyond21 such as are necassary for disembarking troops and the stores for expedition, and that we hope disembarkation may not occur at places other than where it has already com menced. This is most desirable for securing maritime peace. Any question connected with political position of States and tribes can only be discussed between Her Majesty's Government and Ministers of the Porte. It appears to Viceroy that it is understood between the British and Turkish Governments that the position which the British Govern ment has long held in the Gulf is not in any way to be affected by expedition against Nejd.' Narrative of events in Nejd up to date of landing of the Expedition. 80. The position of affairs in Nejd when the Turkish expedition was first proposed has already been briefly noticed in paragraph 51. Colonel Herbert's despatches of the 24ith and 29th March to the Ambassador at Constantinople contain a more detailed account of the Secret h., 1871, Nos. 114 -120 (No. 117). state of parties at the time. In the former letter he writes— ' It is said that the mass of the people have joined Saood, and that he is master of the country ; while Abdoollah is reported to be a refugee somewhere to the north of the Jibil Shamar [the exact locality is not stated] with his uncle Abdoollah-ibn-Toorki, his son Toorki, and a handful of followers. ' It does not appear that any further battle has taken place. ' After the successes of Saood, as reported in my letter above mentioned,* the garrisons of * This allusion is to a previous letter of Colonel two forts of El-Hasa and of that of Kateef Herbert's dated 20th February 1871, No. 6, to the gave up to him these places with all the treasure Ambassador at the Porte. contained in them. ' Abdoollah, after his flight from Eiadh, was heard of as encamped at a place called Tieb- ism, about 150 miles south-west from Sook-oos-Sheookh on the Euphrates, with a force of about the same numerical strength as that of his brother, composed of Arabs of the tribes of the Shammar, Anezah, and El Kahtan ; but this gathering appears to have had no adhesion, and to^ have melted away, the Arabs all going over to Saood, and consequently Abdoollah was obliged again to fly. ' It is reported that Bunder-ibn-Rashid, Sheik, of the Jibil Shammar, has made his sub mission to Saood, sending him, in charge of his brother, an offering of 20 mares, and that he has been summoned to attend in person. ' Sheikh Feysul left two brothers, Abdoollah-ibn-Toorki, above mentioned, and Juloo- ibn-Toorki. s&lt; The former, as reported, is with Abdoollah, the latter is in Riadh ; but he has sent his son Saood to join the new Chief, and holds Eiadh in his name. ' Abdool Rehman, the fourth son of Feysul, is reported to have joined his brother Saood at El-Hasa, as also Mahboob, the former Minister of Feysul, and all the principal persons of the place. ' It is said that, on Abdoollah applying for aid to the Shereef of Mecca, the latter wrote to Bander-ibn-Rashid and to Sheikh Zamil, Chief of Anezah in Kaseem, to join and support him; but both excused themselves. 14 Sheikh Zamil, having in former years suffered much from the oppression of Peysul and his sons, Abdoollah and Mahomed, particularly in the prolonged siege of his native city and the slaughter of many of the inhabitants about eight years ago, is unlikely to permit to pass the opportunity of supporting the cause of a Chief from whom he may reasonably hope for more generous treatment. Saood is stated further to have nominated a friend of his own, Hassan-ibn-Abd-ool Mohsen, whose family has suffered terribly at the bands of Abdoollah, as Sheikh of his native city of Bareida in Kaseem in the room of Mahomed-us-Sudeeri, an adherent of Abdoollah who has retired to Sudeer. ' It now appears that the letters from Midhut Pasha to Abdoollah, which I previously mentioned as having been sent by the Muteserif of Bussorah, contained offers of assistance and a promise to send troops to his support if Abdoollah would despatch a confidential person to act as their guide. ' These letters, contrary to my expectation, reached their destination, in accordance with them, Abdoollah despatched one of his followers, named Abd-ool-Aziz Babtein, with presents consisting of horses and other things. [C967FD] ' F22 ' This messenger was, however, plundered about two days distance rom o air, w ic place he reached on foot, and he arrived at Baghdad empty -handed on e morni go e 22 nd initant/' 81. In his letter of the 26th April Colonel Herbert said— ' From Nejd I have obtained no reports which I can submit as authentic, but those that have reached me state that Abdoollah has again visited Riadh, and^ that, with the assistance of his uncle, Abdoollaiuibn-Toorki, he has collected together about 9,0U0 men. « It is also rumoured that Saood has with him some 70,000 or 80,000 men, and that he is marching to encounter his brother's small force. ' Should his gathering number even one-half of that stated, he will be in a position to offer a formidable resistance to the Ottoman troops, who will not number above 8,000 or 10,000 men, while the nature of the country will offer him very great advantages. Enmonrs from Nejd had reached Baghdad in the beginning of May that of the 9,000 men collected by Abdullah, the whole had deserted him on hearing that the Ottoman troop were coming into the country at his request. The feeling of the country was almost entirely with Saud. Narrative of the Expeditionary force up to date of landing in Nejd. 82. According to Colonel Herbert's despatch of the 24th March, Midhut Pasha appeared at first to hesitate in ihid, No. 118. supporting the sinking cause of Abdullah, at the same time that he was inclined to support him as the Euler or the ' Kaimukam ' recognised by the Porte. Three days later Colonel Herbert, in consequence of a rumour that he had heard, sought an interview with the Pasha, who, he ' informed me that for a long time past be had been endeavouring to attract the attention of the Porte to the movement going on in Nejd and the adjacent provinces, and had at last obtained instructions to despatch a force to aid Abdoollah, the ' Kaimukam ^ nominated by the Porte. ' That this force would consist of three or four regiments, with one large gun and four or five mountain train guns ; and that he had called upon the Arab tribes, the Montetik Anezah, Shammar, and others, to supply contingents. ' That the troops would be transported from Bussorah to the coast in the corvette Broussa, the guns of which would be available, and the two unarmed steamers Nineveh and Assur.' 83. Midhut Pasha apparently made light of this undertaking, and was evidently not aware of the brave and warlike character of the people against whom his expedition was being despatched, as he spoke of them as nomads, and anticipated that the steam-vessels would be released in a month's time. Nor was he deterred by the expense which the Political Agent hinted would be heavy, while the treasury at Baghdad was in a very low condition. The Political Agent had, however, subsequently heard that the Pasha had received instructions to spare no expense. The Political Agent further remarked that it might be inexpedient to denude the country of troops of which there were never more than are absolute ly necessary, but this the Pasha answered by saying that he expected reinforce ments from Syria; and as previously conjectured by the Political Agent, the Yemen troops were to take a part in the enterprise. It had, moreover, come to the knowledge of the Political Agent that troops were being brought from Constantinople, and that a vessel was about to proceed to Jeddah for troops. This report had reached the Political Agent. ' in a manner which forbade his seeking its confirmation from His Excellency.' 84. A remarkable report had reached Midhut Pasha from Abdullah, which His Excellency believed, to the effect that Saud was supported by the British Government which had sent seven vessels of war to his aid, with the view of obtaining ascendancy in Central Arabia. Concerning this the Political Agent remarked— 'There can be no doubt that there is a great wish on His Excellency's part, and probably on the part of the Ottoman Government, to obtain command of Bahrein and Kateef, and to23 establish the supremacy of the Porte over the whole of Central and Southern Arabia; and this desire, together with a growing jealousy of British influence in the Persian Gulf, appears to be the motive of the present action.' 85 The latest news in this letter, although not at the time confirmed, was, that it was proposed to employ the present occasion to carry out the above ohiect by taking permanent occupation of Nejd, a new division of the array being formed for this purpose, and by sending thither a Lieutenant -Governor. 86 Lookino- to the apparent popularity of Saud, the Political Agent, in another letter of the 11th April, expressed his doubts as to the wisdom in terference between the two brothers, with the view of restoring Abdullah; and regard being had to the nature of the country in which troops would have to operate in favour of the latter, he also doubted their chance of success. 87 And even allowing that the expedition did succeed, its effect, the Political Agent observed, would be either to replace an unpopular Ruler in Riadh, and thus prepare the way for his overthrow by his more popular brother, or facilitate the acquisition of the country by the Ottoman Government, a measure which they desire. In either case, the Political Agent anticipated discontent among the people which would be followed by complications. 88 The Political Agent further pointed out that, owing to a want of funds and scarcity of food, the latter due to a second year of drought, the province was not in a position to undertake a costly expedition such as the one proposed would prove. 89 As regards the rumour about Saud receiving aid from the Indian Government, the Political Agent said it was to be regretted that the idea had taken root at Baghdad. Midhut Pasha had never he said mentioned the matter to him. although he had reason to believe that His Excellency had endeavoured indirectly to ascertain his views, l^ut he had taken care to limit himself to saying that he had no information, and expressing his conviction that Government would not permit itself to be led to interfere in the affairs ot Cen tral Arabia. 90. In a letter of the 26th April, Secret, August 1871, Nos. 41—71 (No. 51). Colonel Herbert Wrote :— ' I have the honour to report that the first detachment of troops for the Nejd expedition, said to be one regiment of infantry, and numbering between 400 and 500 men, left this m the River Steamer Moosul on Thursday, the 20th instant. 'A portion of the artillery (without guns) and cavalry marched by land the next day; and on the 23rd idem a second detachment of infantry, considerably more numerous than the first, left in the Steamer Diyalah and her barge. «A further detachment of troops is to go from Amarah shortly, and others will be despatched hence when the steam-boats return for their conveyance. ' The whole of the artillery and cavalry are to march by land; and the guns, ammunition and stores are to be sent in country boats. ic A thousand horsemen are to be supplied by the Montifik Arabs,^ and contingents of horse and matchlockmen are to be formed at Zobair and Koweit from the tribes in those neigh bourhoods.' 91. The same letter represented forcibly the difficulties and dangers in store for the expedition :— « On landing at Kateef, or Damaum, the troops will find themselves in the enemies^ country, and, it must be anticipated, will find great difficulty in procuring carriage or supplies of any kind, 'From these ports their march to El-Hasa will occupy respectively four and three long days, and will be under a burning sun and scorching hot wind across sandy desert where water for a large number does not exist. « The few wells that are to be found at intervals, and are known only to the Arabs of the place, afford but a scanty supply of brackish water sufficient for the wants of a very limited number. ' It will be necessary, therefore, that water be carried, and thus will demand so large a supply of camels as to be seemingly almost impossible. « Beni-Khalid tribe who occupy this country, and of whom was Saood's mother, are probably entirely with him j as are said to be the other inhabitants of this region.24 ' The difficulties of this march will unquestionably be very great; but should they be surmounted, all the necessaries of life will be found at El-Hasa, and there the troops may establish themselves. . ' Thence, however, to Riadh the route is much more formidable. c ' The whole distance occupies seven or eight days' marching from morning till night, and of these four days and nights of constant wearisome exertion, with but small space of time available for rest and refreshment, must be devoted to crossing the Dahna or Red Desert, a tract so difficult in consequence of the extremely light nature of the sand^ in which no firm foothold can be obtained even by camels, and in which no trace of passers is left; the entire absence of water, and the intense heat and glare is to be dreaded, and, so far as possible, avoided even by wandering Arabs. ' But across this all who go from El-Hasa to Riadh must pass, and water, fuel, and every necessary must be carried, while it is absolutely necessary to take one particular line known only to persons constantly occupied in passing to and fro, an d any departure from which is destruction. ' This march will probably prove a worse enemy to encounter than the hordes of Arabs who may be expected to hang about the line (except only in the Dahna), and continually harass the troops without exposing themselves to the danger of an attack in force. ' There will also probably be great di(iiculty in procuring trustworthy guides, and if they be led by those bent on their destruction, their fate can be scarcely doubtful. u The sufferings of the members of this expedition can scarcely, under any circumstan ces, be otherwise than very great, and it is a painful question how many may ever return. ' And while these troops are being thus sent to almost inevitable destruction, it seems that the Ottoman authorities, reckoning on success with somewhat overweenino' confidence are forming plans for their future operations, and, as I communicated to Your Excellency yester day by telegram, are said to propose, after the capture of Nejd, to direct the expedition against Bahrein, Muscat, and the Arab coast in its whole length. ' 92. The attention of the Secretary of State was drawn to the above letter of Colonel Herbert, and he was asked by the Government of India to make a representation to the Porte of the folly and danger of the expedition. This request of the Government of India was communicated to the Porei^n Office in England, and it was added— If any further steps can be taken to convince the Turkish Government of what the Viceroy describes is f the folly and danger of the expedition/ the Duke of Argyll trustB fW they may be taken with as little delay as possible. ' ^ 1 The Foreign Office replied that it was not then considered necessary to do so. Subsequently, however, Sir H. Elliot was desired to carrv out the wishp^ of the Indian Government in this respect. 93. On the 10th May Colonel Herbert wrote :— Since writing on the 26th ultimo, I have paid a hurried visit to Bussorah for th^ purpose of seeing the preparations for the expedition, and found preparino- to start wifh fhl troops the Steam Corvett Broussa, 2S gxms ; the hitherto unarmed steam ship Nino which four guns have been placed ; and old wooden guard ship the Khojah Bev 18 Trrhmn tttocj ll ir Ki nl-f- o 4- 'R n ci c&lt;/-wo V* v* 1 ... 1 i -i ' ^' troops the Steam Corvett Broussa, 23 guns ; the hitherto unarmed steam ship mnone m which four guns have been placed ; and old wooden guard ship the Khojah Bey 18 Juns which was originally built at Bussorah and has long been deemed unseaworthy : and thred trss ssixss '»' s *■ * ' 1 '- «''• 94.

We would at the same time suggest that a suitable opportunity should oetaken by Her Majesty's Government to inform the public of the assurances given by ^ _ ^P® ror ^ Russia and his Ministers that they have no intention to extend the frontier of Russia to the south. « With regard to the Eecond point,, we are of opinion that a strong representation should be made to the Porte as to the complete inaccuracy of the statements made by Aah Pasha^ This Government is the only branch of Britith Administration whicn has direct relations or communication with the inhabitants of the Southern Coast of the Persian bulf, and we are anxious explicitly to state that no attempt whatever has been made by us to avail ourselves of any supposed weakness of the Porte, or to endeavour to countenance the Arabs in any course of action hostile to Turkey. No proceedings on our part can be interpreted so as to show the smallest desire to interfere in the internal affairs of those countries and it seems to us that the expressions made use of by the Turkish Minister indicate that he has been com- pletely misinformed as to the actions and policy of the Government ot India. Porte informed Indian Government disclaim countenancing Arabs. 98. On receipt of the above quoted despatcli from the Government of India, the Ambassador at Constantinople was desired by the Secretary of State to do his best to remove any impression tbat might prevail at the Porte of there being a disposition on the part of the Indian Government to encourage the disaffection of the Arabs in the Persian Gulf. Sir JEL Elliot replied : ' Aali Pasha's exprefsions, reported by Mr. Pisani, and commented upon by the Governor General in his despatch to the Duke of Argyll, exhibited an irritation originating in a suspi cion that Her Majesty's Government were disposed to question the right of the Porte to act as it thought proper in the quarrel between Abdoollah and Saood for the administration of Nejd, which he regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. In the subsequent conversations which I had with His Highness I had made him undprstand that, although we might have our own opinion of the wisdom and policy of the course that was being follawed with regard to the two brothers, be need not fear any ditii^ culties on the side of Her Majesty's Government so long as the action of the Ottoman autho rities was exerted strictly within the Sultan's dominions, but that Her Majesty's Government would not see with indifference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. « The assurances received from the Grand Vizier upon that point were satisfactory, and I believe I had entirely removed from his mind all suspicion, if it ever existed, of there being a wish v on the part of the Government of India to provoke discontent against the Government of the Sultan. ' Server Efferdi, to whom I communicated yesterday the substance of Your Lordship's despatch, showed himself perfectly satisfied ; but I took the opportunity of again warning him that the further avoidance of misunderstanding would depend greatly on the care shown by the leaders of the Expedition in not overstepping the legitimate limits of the Sultan's recognized dominions.' Turkish designs on Katar. Hoisting of Turkish flag at Bidaa. 99. Colonel Pelly on the 18th July telegraphed a report that while the no*, xt -.w, ' .... Katar Chief excused himself, his son ecret, ugus » 08 - • ( 0 ' ^ Jasim had promised aid and hoisted the Turkish flag on his own house. Major Smitb was about to go to Katar to as certain facts. On the same day Colonel Pelly telegraphed again that Captain Lodder bad visited Bidaa on the east coast of the Katar peninsula and found the Tur^ kish flag flying. A Turkish steamer had come in with a boat of the Koweit Chiefs which it had sent to the Bidaa Chief with a command to hoist the flag. On receipt of Captain Lodder's report Colonel Pelly apparently telegraphed to Colonel Herbert asking whether the Pasha knew of 4 or had authorized this ibid. No 179. proceeding for he (Colonel Pelly) on the following day reported a statement of Colonel Herbert's, who said— u Pasha states that being without news, he cannot say if flags have been sent to Gwuttur. Firmans, being orders emanating from SultaiJi, have not been sent thither.'27 The allusion to firmans was not intelligible at the time, but from Colonel Herbert's letter of the 19th July, containing a more detailed account of his interview with the Pasha, it appears that the bearer of the flag to the Bidaa Chief was supposed by Colonel Pelly to have had the authority of a firman from the Sultan. The Pasha's denial then came to this that no orders bearing the Sultan's signature had been sent demanding the fealty of the Katar Chief. It was not clear whether the steamer that had arrived off Bidaa was a Turkish man-of-war or merchant vessel, and Colonel Pelly was directed by the Government of India to obtain full information on the point. On the 30th July Colonel Pelly intimated-^ i{ Herbert having addressed Bagdad Pasha concerning Turkish flag at Gwuttur, latter replied his assurance had related to Bahrein, which would not be interfered with until settle ment of question between British and Ottoman Governments ; but that Gwuttur was not excepted like Bahrein/' 100. As already mentioned in paragraph 79 Colonel Herbert had been Y directed to make no communication on ibid. No. 231. political matters to the Pasha. He was again reminded of these instructions and told— « except under direct instructions from Government of India, make no communication to Pasha on questions involving political or inter- Ibtd. No. 276. national principles, or Treaty rights and duties. Report constantly by telegraph and ask for orders/' Colonel Pelly was also directed through the Bombay Government to ' make no direct communications to Colonel Herbert' on matters involving political or international principles, or Treaty rights and duties. Such matters should be referred to Government of India by whom communication will be made with the Porte through the pro per channel/' 101. Later, on the 30th July, the following, was received from Colonel Pelly Mappie aYrived, Major Smith found Turkish flag in JassimV* house. Arab flag in Bin Thanni's at Biddeh. Gwutfcur Chief explained • The Katar Chief. letter Turkish flag was hoisted by desire of Turkish Commander, who sent it through Koweit Chief. Does not appear Turkish steamer entered port. Chief verbally referred English to Turkish Saltan regarding hoisting flag.' 102. The Bombay Government on the 7th August signalled— ' In despatches just receive^. Major Smith reported to Resident that he was informed that a Turkish Government steamer and Chief of Koweit in his own boat proceeded to Gwuttur bearing communication from the Pasha Commanding Ottoman forces in Nejd/' 103. The Assistant Political Resident wrote on the 20th July regarding the Katar Chief— 'Mahomed bin Tani, although heretofore well enough inclined^ is old and infirm, and is influenced by his son Jassim with whom the pirate Nasir bin Moobarek is closely allied : both these men, it is known, hate the policy hitherto maintaned in the Gulf. They have long set their minds on pirating Bahrein, hence the reception with pleasure of a flag that rightly or wrongly they suppose may yet afford them the desired opportunity/' 104. In a letter to the Assistant Political Resident, the Katar Chief significantly wrote— ' We are people residing on the mainland and their (Turk's), forces are moving by land, and I have been required to accept this flag. I therefore did so/' The Katar Chief gave as a reason for flying the Turkish flag that he had not been protected by the English. This allusion was to the piracy of one of his boats by another tribe, for which he complained that he got no redress. Cololnel Pelly said that the matter had been enquired into. 105. The bearing of these events at Bidaa will be best illustrated by the [ following extract f ^om the Foreign Secret ary's n ote of thelgth July 1871:— j « Some notice of Biddeh or El-Biddeh will be found at the places I have marked in No./ XXIV, of the new series of Bombay Selections. It will be seen that, as early at any rate asj 1827, and as late as 1851, it is described as a dependency of Bahrein. Whetber it is so still if have no information, but at all events nothing is known here to the contrary. Esau bin Tarif, wbof settled with a section of the Uttobee tribe there, was a descendant of one of the original28 Uttobee conquerors of Bahrein. It will be remembered that the present Bahrein family Bidd h Came '^ rom ^• owe i t &gt; lience perhaps the attempt to establish Turkish supremacy over . . ' ^iddeh, it will be seen, is on the eastern side of the Gwuttur Promontory, a place to ■which the requirements of the Nejd Expedition can in no way require the Turkish vessels to ? 0, Tl1 ® occu P at i on o£ it seems to be quite contrary to the spirit of the assurances given both by the Porte and the Pasha. It is no doubt the first step towards the establishment of supremacy over the tribes to the east, whose towns, His Excpllency will remember, have been • Vidt paragraph entered in the local Turkish Gazette* as being houses and gardens of the country of Nejd. The Turks are too cunning to make any violent and sudden assertion ot their supremacy over these regions. There is first the insinuation of the a that the assurances given refer to independent tribes, of whom there can be none in fVide paragraph Nejd ; f then the entry in official papers of I - n .i m , • , „ , „ certain places as dependencies of Neid : then the ting of the Turkish flag, and so forth. My own impression is, that the Turks are much f fu rf i ^ir su Premacy along the coast then to reinstate Abdoollah. The establishment of the Turkish ascendancy may be a good thing, or it may be bad, but at all j events it involves a departure on our part from our past policy in the Gulf.' «+ ^2, furt ^ er Gorrespondence passed on the subject of the proceedings Bidaa, Goyernment apparently preferring, in the face of the explicit assurances of the Porte, to look upon the hoisting of the flag as the act of an unauthorized and irresponsible person.

It would be to us a matter of deep regret that so faithful an ally as Turkey, one for the very existence of whose power England has made such sacrifices, should be the first to take a step calculated to alter a state of things, the maintenance of which we consider important to the interests of our Indian Empire, and from which, both in a political and a commercial point of view, the Porte herself has gained, and would continue to gain, so much profit without any expense on her part, 'We would, therefore, earnestly impress on Her Majesty's Government the necessity of taking immediate measures to ascertain definitely what is the policy of the Porte with regard to the Persian Gulf, and whether it is their intention to constitute it for the future one of their naval stations. If any such intentions have been formed by the Government of His Majesty the Sultan, it is, in our opinion, necessary that the objections which we have stated at considerable length in our previous despatches should be fully laid before them, and that no effort should be spared to induce them to abstain from a line of policy the adoption of which we could not contemplate with indifEerence, and which, we believe, would be injurious to the beet interests of Turkey herself.' 110.

Serious incon venience and danger have arisen, Vicerey considers this breach understanding ; begs instruc tions may issue prohibiting vessels under his orders from slaving. Cossack reported crone to Cape. Uovernment without service single vessel war.' 119. His Excellency, the late Viceroy, Lord Mayo noted on this : ' Look into papers with Military Department, and see whether there is anvthin&lt;r to show that the vessels for which we pay £70,000 a year were intended to be employed in Ibid No. 836. 120. Colonel Pelly was asked if he could communicate with the Bullfinch. He replied on 3rd June :— I telegraphed to Bullfinch and Magpie via Anguam, Gwadur, and Maskat. Bullfinch replied from Bassadore was leaving for Bahrein, *31 121. On the 8th June Colonel Pelly signalled that the Bullfinch had arrived at Bahrein on the 3rd, and that he purposed proceeding in company with tie Bagh Rose to Jiatif. 122. The Magpie was reported to be at Jask on the 6th June and oh the point of leaving for the Gulf. The Lynx arrived at Angaum on the 16th J uly. 128. From this time there appears to have been no difficulty regarding the vessel required for the Gulf. Before leaving Bahrein for Bushire Colonel Pelly, on the 16th December, requested the Senior Naval Officer to have one vessel uninterruptedly present in Bahrein Harbour in order to watch events and afford moral support to the Chief. The instructions of Government with regard to the course to be pursued in the matter of the murder of the Turkish ipessenger were communicated to the Senior Naval Officer, who was also asked to let a vessel of war show itself off El Bidaa where the Turks were then about to land troops. Communication was to be kept up with the tracial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast. Case of the ' Snipe ' 124 Colonel Pelly on the 1st July telegraphed that the Snipi, said by *•«. August uft.irw i47*doi. him to be a British ship had arrived in (No. 159.) Bushire roads^ having on board some 20 Turkish troop. The Commander of the Bullfinch, then at Bushire, presumed she would not be allowed to proceed. The Hon ble J. F. Stephen gave the following opinion on the case. He said :— ' The case strikes me thus : The Snipe is carrying contraband of war for the Turks* This exposes her to seizure by the Arabs, but I do not see how it authorizes a British cruiser to interfere. British cruisers never interfered with the British ships which chose to run the nortbern blockade into Charleston. ' No doubt the maritime truce puts us in a singular position in the Gulf ; but surely Persia is not a party to it, nor does it extend so far north as Bushire. &lt;f As at present advised, I think Pelly should be told to permit the Snipe to proceed warning her Commander that he will not be protected if the Arabs attack him/' 125. Government, accordingly, on the 2nd July, directed the Commander of the Bullfinch to allow the Snipe to proceed, but to warn the Master that he was liable to hostile seizure. On the same date the Ambassador at Constanti nople was informed of what had occurred, and it was added:— ' It would be desirable that the Turkish Government should abstain from employing British vessels in such, a manner in the Gulf. Can a friendly remonstrance be made to that effect f' 126. Sir H. Elliot on the 5th replied ' Orders have been sent to Midhufc Pasha to abstain as much as possible from employing British vessels for transport of Turkish troops destined for Nejd Expedition/^ In a despatch of the same date to Lord Granville, Sir H. Elliot wrote : ' I communicated the substance of it ' [i.e., the telegra'm from India) to Server Effendi and pointed out that the employment of vessels bearing the British flag in carrying troops engaged in an expedition of this nature would give rise to erroneous interpretabion 3 by the native tribes upon the coast, and that I should be glad if he could meet the wishes of Lord Mayo in the matter. ' His Excellency said that, without taking a positive engagement that British vessels should not be employed at all, if there should be a necessity for it, he would desire that they should not be engaged for the conveyance of troops, if it could be avoided' 127. From a telegram of the 3rd July, however, it appeared that the Snipe was not a British vessel. Colonel Herbert signalled ;— « Ottoman Government has engaged Ship Snipe bearing British flag, said to be property of Hajee Jaber, Persian Governor of Mohamrah, for conveyance of correspondence and com missariat supplies to Kateef, under contract to reach on 4th instant, having put into Bushire she is reported as detained by Anglo-India authorities. Midhut Pasha requests she may be set at liberty. Please reply immediately.' 128. Noting on the telegram the Foreign Secretary observed :— This telegram very much alters the aspect of the case. It appears she is not a British vessel, but belongs to one of the local Persian Governors, and unauthorizedly sails under theS2 Britisli flag. She is, therefore, liable to be forfeited to Her Majesty under Sfction 103 of 17 and 18 Vic., Cap. 1(U. Colonel Herbert should, I think, be called upon to report specifically aa to the nationality of the vessel ; and if she turns out to be Persian, Mr. Alison should be moved to remonstrate and obtain orders forbidding the Governor of Mohamrah, or the owner, from I flying the British flag. If she persists in flying it, she should be confiscated.' The Hon'ble J. E. Stephen remarked :— ' The Section referred to is very difficult to construe, inasmuch as its terms would appear to authorize the seizure by an English cruiser of a French ship which hoisted the English Sag, I do not think that this can be the meaning of the Act. It must, 1 think, be supposed that the Act was meant to agree with the rules of international law, and by those rules nothing will justify the seizure of a foreign vessel, except some act (such as running blockade, carrying contraband of war, or the like) which is an offence against international law. The mere assumption by a ship of one nation of the flag or national character of a different nation is not, so far as I know, an international offence which would by itself warrant seizure, and the municipal law of England would not extend, unless the very clearest intention to extend it was apparent from its terms, to foreign ships. Of course Parliament could pass a law that every French ship which hoisted an English fiag should be seized and forfeited ; but to do so would be an act of war, and it cannot be supposed that it is the intention of the Merchant Shipping Act to authorize such an act. I think, therefore^ that the section must be read thus ' If any person uses the British flag and assumes the British national character on board any ship subject to the law of ling land^ owned in whole, or in part, by any persons not entitled by law to own British ships for the purpose of making such ship appear to be a British ship, shall be forfeited to Her Majesty. ' The following considerations favor this view :—Section 18 provides that ' no ship shall be depmed a British ship 3 unless she belongs wholly to natural born British subjects or denizens. In a wider sense, a ship owned by persons owing a temporary allegiance to the Queen as residents in England, either in whole or in part, would be a British ship, and, as such would be liable to hostile capture. There is, therefore, a class of ships to which the section would apply, ws., British ships in the more general sense of the words, as opposed to British ships as defined by Section 18. ' In Fhillimore's International Law, Volume IV, page 601, an account is given of ' those sections of the M erchant Shipping Act which bear in any degree upon questions of Maritime International law,' 'Section 103 is not mentioned but Sections 527 and 528, which authorize the arrest of foreign ship under certain circumstances, are referred to. Those sections are in part as follows ' Whenever any injury has, in any part of the world, been caused to any property by any foreign ship, if at any time thereafter such ship is found in any port or river of the United Kingdom ; or within three miles of the coast thereof, the ship may be detained. When foreign ships are referred to, care is taken to name them expressly, and to confine the power of dealing with them to the case of their being within the Queen's 'jurisdic tion/ ' Again, the section in question (103) exempts the ships referred to from seizure if they hoist the British flag ' for the purpose of escaping capture by an enemy or by a foreio-n ship of war in the exercise of some belligerent right.' 0 ' A ship would hardly wish to hoist the British flag (except as a stratagem, which I do not think is the case intended) unless it was in some sense a British ship—a &amp; British ship that is, as against foreigners, though not within the meaning of the Merchant Shipping Act Finally, Part II of the Act applies, by Section 17, to f the whole of Her Majesty's domi nions/ Neither Bushire nor the shore of the Persian Gulf, nor the High Seas are part of Her Majesty's dominions. 1 think, therefore, that, even if the Section applied to the Snipe she ought not to be seized out of Her Majesty's dominions/ , ' 129. Colonel Herbert ascertained that the Snipe was a registered British vessel belonging to Messrs. David, Sassoon &amp; Co. of Bombay. That firm on being asked for information with regard to the vessel, replied We have to state that the Snipe was purchased in London by our firm there on account of Hajee Zainel Abadeen, a naturalized British subject, in accordance with his instructions Our firm registered the steamer in our name, and valued for the cost in bills in our favour with instructions, when the bills are paid, to transfer the Snipe to his name. Hajee Zainel Abadeen paid us the cost of the steamer by instalments up to November 1870, and on the Si2nd of the same month we made the bill of sale in his name, immediately after which the Snipe sailed from Bombay, and returned only last month. We, therefore, had no opportunity till now to get the register made out in his name, which, however, has now been done/' 130. The Commander of the vessel deposed - ' The steamer is now registered in the name of Ruben David Sassoon of London • Power of Attorney is held by the firm in Bombay. In October or November last she was33 transferred by bill of sale to Hajee Zenail Abadeen, British subject of Bombay. Declaration of ownership was lodged by me at the time in the Master Attendants Office, Bombay. I was going to sea at once, and I was informed by the Master Attendant that, as there was a pro bability of the ship being sold to srfme Persians, all that would be necessary, after the money was paid, would be for the register to be handed in, when it would be cancelled. u In the meantime the negoeiations with the Persians fell through, and I am now authoriz ed by the owner, Hajee Zenail Abadeen, to take out a new register. During the whole of my absence I have looked upon him as my owner. I have remitted as much as Rs. 20,000 or Rs. 25,000 to him when coaling at Aden, and for stores at Kurrachee I drew upon him/' secret, December i87i, Nos. 1-153. (No. 156). 131. The Bombay Government, in a • Page 234. Resolution dated 27th July, observed* : ' It would appear that the owner of the S. S. Snipe is a British subject. There have been negociations for the sale to Persian subjects, and apparently in anticipation of these negociations being perfected, it was proposed to register the vessel in the names of the proposed transferees, which Captain Pryce refused to permit, as the sale was not complete and the persons named were foreigners. r In a letter of the 29th December 1871 Colonel Pelly incidentally men tioned that he had been informed that the Turkish authorities had purchased the Snipe. 132. Murder of a so-called Turkish Messenger at Eahrein. On the 12th September Colonel Pelly forwarded certain papers regarding Secret, December 1871, Nos. 154-165. ® e i zure an{ i death of an Arab of the Beni Haj jir tribe at a fishing village called Agena on the south-west end of the Bahrein Island, He had already informed Government of the occurrence by a telegram dated 1st September « The several accounts of the matter,' said Colonel Pelly in his letter, ' are not alto gether consistent one with another. But I gather generally'that Nassir-bin-Mobarek, tha escaped pirate of 1869, sought service with, or the patronage of, the Turkish Commander at Lahsa ; that he was more or less received into favour by the Commander ; that eventually Nassir-bm-Mobarek, wishing to communicate with Gwuttur, selected a messenger from that tribe to which he (Nassir) himself belonged on his mother's side, viz., the Beni Haiiir • that this messenger was accordingly charged with letters by Nassir and proceeded to Ojair ; that at Ojair the messenger embarked on board a Kowait boat, in company with a fleet of Bahrein boats which were returning home ; that wanting water, or for other purpose, the Kowait boat, together with the Bahrein fleet, put into Ageria on the Bahrein coast; that, while there anchored, it came to the knowledge of one or more of the relatives of the late Chief of Bahrein Ali-bin-Khuleefa, that the messenger was the very man who had killed or aided in killino- the* late Chief m the piratical attack of 1869; that in accordance with Arab laws of vengeance^and as the present Chief asserts, without in the first instance referring to him) the 'relatives of the late Chief seized and killed the messenger ; that the clothes of the messenger were then searched and found to contain letters addressed as follows t In command of Turkish Troops. &lt;f From Fereck Pashat to Jassim-bia-Maho- t Son Of Katar Chief. med bin J Sanee. ' From Nassir-bin-Mobarek to ditto ditto. $ This leiter was as follows:— ' Fr0m tIle SOn ^ to dltto.§ 'The Turkish Governmect are mindful of Qwufc- From Mahamed-bin-Feysnl to ditto ditto, tur, Bahrein and other places in view to putting down ^ -o a i j i ht i i i ■ tt their enemies so that their friend® may rejoice. l?rom Abaci Malek-bm-Hershan to ditto Please God you will soon receive news that may ditto, gladden you. , 'From the son of Nassir-bin-Mobarek to Abdoollah-bin-bhanem Asschatee; « And finally, that these letters were then brought to the present Chief of Bahrein, who caused those from Nassir-bin-Mobarek, &amp;c., to be opened, but caused the letter from the Turkish Commander to be returned with all precautions to the Master of the Kowait craft, and with instructions that the Master should carry it to its destined nort and deliver it to its addressee. ' The Chief of Bahrein subsequently enclosed the letters taken from the messenger's corpse for my perusal, in original. I returned these letters to the Chief with a note, of which a copy is appended. w [C967FD] J34 On the 15th October Colonel Herbert m * N °' 155 ' telegraphed:— * e Pasha* privately asks my opinion. A messenger from Turkish General alt Lahsa • Proceediags (Secret), December 1871. Nos. 154- with letters from ^ Gwuttut visited Bahrein. 165. Sheikh heard of, seized, and killed him. British officers hearing this demanded letters and forwarded them to Gwuttur. Pasha cordially acknowledges obligation. He wishes to obtain fitting reparation from Sheikh, but considers to apply officially to British Government would be yielding a point as 1;o political position of island. Under existing circumstances, and promises recently given, he cannot use force against Sheikh as an Ottoman dependent, consequently contemplates sending a Commission to demand reparation. I request orders/ 3 Colonel Herbert was informed on the ITth idem of Colonel Pelly's version \ iiid No. 157. oE the story and directed, if possible, jftid No. m. to avoid discussion with the Pasha until farther enquiry could be made; only if pressed, was he to tell the other version. On the 24th October Colonel Herbert informed Governmentf ' Midhut Pasha expects to leave Thursday, and it is probable he will make the death of the messenger a pretext for interference at Bahrein if he receive from me no satisfactory com munication before he goes.' Colonel Pelly was directed to proceed to Bahrein or send his Assistant there, and the following reply was sent to Colonel Herbert by telegraph of the 30th ' Viceroy qannot suppose that Pasha, knowing views of British Government regarding Bahrein, and explicit denial of Ottoman Government of all intention to extend supremacy, over Bahrein, and repiernbering assurances given by Pasha himself, carl entertain any intention of interfering with that island. Viceroy would consider such to be a violation of instructions belifeVed to have been given to Pasha from Constantinople, and of the promises given by his Government, and would not look on interference with indifference. ' Use your discretion as to expressing above views to Pasha. Inform him of Felly's ver sion of story The Pasha had, however, left Baghdad for Basrah en roilte to Nejd when the telegram reached, and Colonel Herbert considered that it would be incon venient to make the communication through a third party. He subsequently, however, requested the Agent at Basrah to wait upon the Pasha on arrival and communicate the substance of the above message. 134. The Bombay Government, on the 5th November, telegraphed :— ' Pelly telegraphs for instructions whether action isliniited to watehmg events. In my opinion, if, after all our representations at Constantinople and assurances at Bahrein, we con tent ourselves with watching events, bur position in Gulf will be in future Untenable. If force sufficient, I would not hesitate to instruct Pelly to prevent any Turkish Occupation, arid am confident that if this were known, not a blow would be struck. But some of the Turkish corvettes are of moderh construction and heavy armament, and I do not know what Lynx and Magpie carry. In this case I should direct Pelly to visit Midhut Pasha on arrival, learn his intentions^, and, stating circumstances which excuse Bahrein Chief, offer good offices; if refused, hand him formal protest with memorandum for transmission to Loiidbn and in Constantinople to the effect that Turkish Commander from commencement of operations employed and took into confidence Nassir-bin-Mobarek, who instigated and laid revolution in which Chiefs father was assassinated. The present Chief having been placed on throne by our intervention, and Nassir Cobip^lled to fly, it was inconsistent with friendly relations with this country to employ and protect a men who had flcl from punishment at our hand; that Nassir having employed the man who murdered Chief's father to carry letters to tribes with whom we have treated, messenger had no claim to protection as an Envoy from private person, and has justly met punishment of crime. If Bahrein Chief had acted hostilely or without considering Turkish dignity, it resulted from employment of Mobarek ; and if Turkish Commander proceeded to act hostilely, Colonel Pelly was instructed to protest, and denounce his conduct as inconsistent with friendly relations of two Governments. Exact protest may be safely left to ^elly, but it should be formal, full, and prpcise. Instructions awaited. 1 think squadron should be rein forced Bullfinch here, Nimble Aden.' Colonel Pelly was directed to make precisely the same representations to the Pasha as that contained in the telegram of th.e ^Oth October to Coloiiel Herbert, and the Secretary of State was informed on the 8th by telegraph of the whole proceedings up to date, and requested:— ' Pray move Ottoman Porte instantly to send by telegram most absolute orders fn Midhut Pasha and his officers to abstain from any active or armed interference in Bahrein,35 ■wliich would be in direct breach of their promises. Telegraph to me immediately precifie in structions what course is to be taken if Turks proceed to use force at Bahrein, This is very important.'' 134A. On the following day tlie Bombay Government was directed ' Instruct Pelly to go to Bahrein with as many of the gun-boats as he can eollectj ascertain at once whether any menace or threat has been held out to Chief by Midhut Pasha or any of Turkish officers. Let him avoid discussing the murder of the m^sspnger, which he must insist On being settled diplomatically. If Pasha proposes to interfere in Bahrein, let Pelly warn him that Bahrein is an independent Stata, having peculiar treaty relations with us, that the Ottaman Government have explicitly denied all intention to acquire suppi e- macy over Bahreim and state the facts in regard to the messenger, but avoid discussion about him, and formally require Pasha before entering an active operations to refer Pelly^s protest to Constantinople for precise orders. Order Nimble, Magpie, and Bull-finch to Bahrein. Lynx is there. Let Pelly report immediately what force Turks have at Bahreiu/' 135. The Secretary of State replied on the 20th November :— Turkish proceedings in Gulf. Telegrams of 9th and 10th received. Foreign Office have communicated with Turkish Government. Answer from Elliot is as follows November 14th. I have reminded the Porte of the assurance given by Ali Pasha that no intention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, or of subduing the independent tribes of Southern Arabia. Server Pasha has repeated these assurances, but says that Chief of Bahrein, having caused a messenger of the Turkish General to be waylaid and murdered on the main land, reparation will have to be 'Obtained from him. Telegram ends. British Government consider the Porte entitled to some reparation for murder of messenger. Better that this should be obtained by our means than by Turkish force. If necessary, send Pelly to settle matters on the spot/' He was informed in reply on the 23rd:— ** Ottoman Porte appear in error, messeng-er not murdered on mainland, but on island of Bahrein, and said not to have borne any credentials by which he could be distinguished as messensrer of Turkish General/' 136. The Secretary of State on the 27th November directed that Colonel Pelly should be sent to Bahrein to ascertain whether any and what reparation was due to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Pelly, who was already at Bahrein, was informed on the 30th Novemoer of the orders of the Secretary of State, and he was desired to have drawn up and signed by the Bahrein Chief a lull state ment of the fact regarding the murder of the messengef; he was also ordered:— f&lt; Inform Turkish officers that the murder case is one that can only be satisfactorily settled by diplomacy and, if necessary, by arbitration, and cannot effect in any way the political status of Bahrein. Order of November 8th to be adhered to.' 137. The Turkish Commodore with a corvette and gun-boat arrived at Bahrein on the 22nd November, and it appeared to have been the intention of the Pasha at that time to go himself to Bahrein and raise the question of the murder. The Government instructions of the 30th were anticipated by Colonel Pelly, who on the 29th November signalled:— ' Turkish Commodore having opened question of messenger with Bahrein Chief. Chief has addressed letter to Midhut Pasha for submission to Porte, giving true version of messeng er's death. Expressing sincere regret at the accident which happened ; equal regret at conduct of the Turkish Lahsa authorities in having omitted to intimate to him transference of Lahsa rule to Turks, and in having selected as their messenger an unaccredited person at blood i eud with Bahrein, and personally connected with Nassir-bin-Mobarek, who had notoriously been lactively concerned in murder of late Chief of Bahrein. Chief further regrets that this official messenger should have been permitted to carry a letter, intimating to Gwuttur to capture Bahrein. No further news of Pasha's movements inland.' Government requested Colonel Pelly to submit a copy of the Bahrein Chief's letter, and the Secretary of State was infoi'med of what had been done. 138. Colonel Pelly's letters marginally noted contained a more detailed No, 1258.372, dated 23r (i November 1871. account of the murder of the messenger, No 1277-375, dated 26th November i87i. 'but added nothing of importance to the information on which action was taken by Government. Colonel Pelly wrote:— I think it is gravely to be regretted that a Turkish authority writing from the Wahabi territory should have selected a person of Nassir-bin-Mobarek's antecedents to arrange for th©36 transmission of the letter ; and I further think that, in putting into a Bahrein port, the mes senger challenged the ehance of a retaliation which all Arab tribes habitually practice. ' It is in my opinion to be further borne in mind that it does not appear that any intimation had ever been made to the Chief of Bahrein of the occupation of Lahsa and Ojair by Turkish authority. ' From all that I have heard and seen of the Bahrein Chief} I am persuaded that, to the best of his knowledge and ability, he is most anxious not only to observe a strict neutrality in reference to the Turkish Wahabee contest, but is striving by every means^ to avoid any mis understanding which might tend to enable others to fix a quarrel on him/ 138A. The letter from the Chief to Midhut Pasha was as follows &lt;l A few days ago the Turkish Commodore anchored in the harbour of Bahrein, and I deputed my brother, Sheikh Ahmed, to proceed on board and welcome him. ' During the visit the Commodore, it appears, referred to the death of a man of the Beni Hajjir tribe, which occurred on this island some months ago, and stated it was the intention of Your Excellency to visit Bahrein in view to enquiring into this matter, as the man was a messenger sent by the Turkish authorities at Lahsa. Although myself at the time extremely vexed at the circnmstances which led to, and were connectpd witli, the death of the Beni Hajjir tribesman, I refrained from troubling Your Excellency, or the Exalted Government at Constantinople, on the subject, &lt;( After the remarks of the Commodore, however, to the effect that the messenger was a Turkish Government servant, it seems on all accounts proper that 1 should address Your Ex cellency. ' The facts of the case there were as follows ' About two years ago Nassir-bin-Mobarek, with a following of the Beni Hajjir tribe and others, embarked from the Katif and Ojair coast, landed at Bahrein, pirated the island, murdered my late father, Ali-bin-Khuleefsi, the then Chief of Bahrein. t( About three months ago a man arrived from Ojair at a village on southern end of Bahrein and was recognized by some of the Bahreinees as a tribesman of the Beni Hajjir, related to Nassir-bin-Mobare.k, and who had been concerned in the proceedings which resulted in the murder of my late father. These Biihreinees thereupon followed the custom whioh everywhere obtains among the Bedouins when at blood fued, and killed the man. '3rd. —The tribesman's corpse was subsequently searched, and some letters or other docu ments were found on it, and were brought to me with a report of the cause and circumstances of the man's death. Among these documents were two at least, which I beg to particularize, owe which there was reason to suppose came from a Turkish subject; and, secondly, one which intimated to its addressee that ' the news is such as you would wish, and the Exalted Government are trying for Bahrein Gwuttur, and other places to the detriment of the enemy and to the rejoicing of friends. You will shortly receive news which will gladden you'. As regards the letter from Turkish subject, I preserved it unopened, showed its envelope to ^ he British officers then at Bahrein, and with their approval transmitted it unopened by the same boat in which it arrived to its addressee. 'As regards the socond letter (namely that threatening my island with capture by the Turkish Government), I perused it with equal astonishment and alarm, ' Such briefly bemg the circumstances of the case, and being now given to understand that the Beni Hajjir tribesman was a messenger of the Turkish authorities at Lhasa, I beg to express my sincere regret that a servant of the Exalted Government should have been killed within my territory, and also to add an expression of my regret. '7.^.—That no intimation should have been made to me by the Turkish authorities at Lhasa of that district having pissed under the direct rule of the Sublime Porte. '2nd. —That when selecting a messenger who might have to visit Bahrein, the authori ties at Lhasa should have selected a man of a tribe known to be at blood feud with the Bah reinees, and a family connection of Nassir-bin-Mobarek, notorious for having caused the un timely death of the late Chiel; of Bahrein. u Srd. —That the mesisenger should have carried no credential or passport whereby he might have been recognized as a servant of Your Excellency's Government. ' Ul.—That a messenger now declared to have been despatched by the Commander-in- Chief of the Turkish forces at Lhasa, distant only two or three days' march from the island of Bahrein, should have been found to be the bearer of a letter addressed to Gwuttur, intimating the desire of the Government of the Sublime Porte to capture my territory. 'I beg the favour of Your Excellency's causing, at Your Excellency's convenience, the above explanation and remarks to be communicated to the Government of His Imperial Majes ty the Sultan.'37 139. With regard to the above letter, Colonel Pelly wrote ' The English version of the letter of the Chief of Bahrein is now enclosecl, and I reject- fully solicit a careful perusal of it, for it appears to me that while this document exculpates the Chief of Bahrein from any intentional insult or annoyance to Turkish authority, it leaves on the local Turkish authorities at Lhasa the responsibility of having selected as their official messenger a tribesman concerned, directly or indirectly, in the murder of the late Chief of Bahrein, and of having permitted this messenger to proceed to Bahrein unaccredited, and carrying on his person a letter, evidencing the wish of the Turkish Government to capture Bahrein; the time and circumstances of transmission seem to add to the weight of the above responsibilities.' 140. In a letter dated 17th January, the Government of India expressed their entire approval of the proceedings of Colonel Pelly in the matter, and commended the prudence and sagacity displayed by him throughout the diffi cult business. 141. On the 5th January Colonel Pelly telegraphed to Bombay Govern ment. Bahrein Chief has sent me reply of Baghdad Pasha to his letter. Chief anxious to rely on my advice in the matter. Please instruct me at early convenience if I am to counsel Chief.' 1132. On the following day he signalled :— ' My telegram of yesterday. Pasha's letter to Chief demands ten thous and silver dirhems blood-money, and seizure and confinement of murderer. If demands not carried into effect, Pasha able by power of Imperial Majesty to give real and actual effect thereto. It does not appear that Pasha communicated Chief's letter to Porte as requested. Shall I suggest to Chief to make rejoinder that he would submit Pasha's letter to our Government with request that, in communication with Porte, amicable settlement might be arrived at, and that he would bind himself to accept settlement. I think that if reparation be demanded from Chief for death of messenger, Chief in turn would have claims for indemnity for mnrderer of his father piracy of his territory, and plunder of British and other subject on residing island. Early instructions solicited as Hugh Rose ready to proceed to Bahrein. Telegram ends. ' In view of the request for early instructions I have,' intimated the Governor of Bombay, &lt; replied that Pelly should advise Chief to reply as suggested, and if compelled notwithstanding to pay money under protest and appeal to Government, Pelly directed to gain time in order that orders of Govern ment of India may be received if above instructions disapproved.' 143 The Government of India replied to the Bombay Government;— ' Inform Pelly confidentially. If thought advisable. Chief should pay demand; he should do so in deposit to Pelly, pending further instructions. Any symptoms of intention to show force to Bahrein to be reported immediately for orders. Vessel of war should remain near island.' 144. The intelligence was communicated to Secretary of State on the 12th with the following request:— ' Move Sublime Porte to refer matter to our arbitration. If indemnity be demanded, strict orders should be issued from Constantinople to Pasha to make no attempt to support demand by force or show of it pending arbitration. The demand if persisted in after explana tion which Bahrein Chief gave Pasha may possibly open up whole question of messenger's antecedents and liability for his previous acts in Bahrein. It is essential the matter be settled diplomatically and force be forbidden. ' I will advise Bahrein not to pay the demand pending arbitration, or to deposit it only with Resident in Gulf.' 145. Colonel Pelly, with regard to the instructions of Government, tele graphed on the 16th Your teligram fourteenth. I think the proposed deposit might be misinterpreted, but solicit instructions. I would deferentially suggest that intimation of proposed reference to Porte should be given to Pasha through Colonel Herbert, and that Ambassador to Constan tinople be requested to move Porte to restrain Pasha from carrying threat into execution pending arbitration. Pasha's reply to Chief reads to me rather that of a disappointed aggressor threaten ing future retaliation than that of authority empowered to take immediate action. Government consented to this course and informed the Secretary of State accordingly, and it was added ' It is not a point of any importance. Essential thing is to forlid show or use of force and to tettle question diplomatically, I hope this will be urged.'8B 146. Tbe following instructions were sent to Colonel Herbert: « Do not discuss question with Pasha. Should he refer to it, say you have been mformpd matter has been referred to Constantinople, and in your opinion it would be best tor i^asha to await orders thence. ' Report by telegraph anything you may ascertain regarding Pasha's instructions.' 147. Under cover of his letter No. f|, dated 13th January 1872, Colonel Pelly enclosed the translated purport of Midhut Pasha s reply to the Bahrein Chief. It was as follows :— Dated Bamzan _1288 rec j eTe( j Bushire on 4th January 1872. 4th December I87I. Translated purport of a letter from Hta Eioblieicoy Midhttt Pasha , Governor-General of Erat and Nejd, and Com- mander -in -CWef of the 6th DiTision of the Army, to Sheik EaAtr-BiK-ALi, Chief of Bahtem. ' I received, while at Lahsa, your letter dated Ramzan, written at a time when the most respected Arif Bey, Chief of the Coasts under the jurisdiction of the Government of Busreh and that of the Peninsula of Arabia, visited Bahrein with several of the vessels of the Sultan's Government, explaining the circumstances attending the murder of the messenger, and have noted what you have therein set forth. ' The importance of this subject demands a clear explanation, and^ renders it necessary that I should send you an explicit reply to your statements and the details connected therewith. ' This murdered messenger, who was of the tribe of the Beni Hajjir and a dependent of the Turkish Government, had been engaged by the Commander-in-Chief in Nejd, Nafid Pasha, and was especially deputed to convey official letters to the Kayem Mukam of Gwuttur, Jassem-bin-Sani. He was proceeding in a boat, but from stress of weather approached the island of Bahrein, where he was seized, his letters taken from him and himself killed. &lt;1 ' In your letter after acknowledging the fact of the occurrence of the murder, you men tion the reasons for the perpetration of this act to be— « Firstly, that two years ago, Nassir-bin-Mobarek attacked Bahrein and killed your father, and that he had with him the Beni Hajjir tribe. Secondly, you allege that the messenger aforesaid, on his arrival at Bahrein, three months previous, declared he was one of the Beni Hajjir who accompanied Nassir-bin-Vlobarek to Bahrein, and was one of those who killed vour father, and that the people on the south end of the island on ascertaining this killed him in accordance with the custom of the Bedouins. ' Taking it for granted that when Nassir-bin-Mobarek went to Bahrein he accompanied those people who ventured to commit the acts in which the Beni Hajjir were implicated, and taking it for granted also that the murdered messenger was also among the tribe, it is im possible for one to conceive that the messenger proceeding on service should assert that he was at such a time with the tribe who committed the hostile acts, and was one of the murderers, or confess to what may cause retaliatory measures against himself, This is sufficient to show the falsity of the statement. ' Apart from the above consideration we must bear in mind that this messenger was entrusted with documents from one governmental authority to another, and allowing that Bahrein was not a part of the Turkish dominions, and that the people of that island were not under Turkish jurisdiction or dependents of that Government, and that this man was really a murderer : so long as he was a dependent of the Government and the bearer of important documents it would have been in the first place necessary to permit him to convey his letters to their destination, and afterwards to communicate with the Turkish Government authorities in regard to the accused, and punishment demanded, when, in accordance with the requirements of justice, the accused, if convicted, would have received due punishment. But if without any just cause this person is murdered in the manner stated, and afterwards it is explained that he was with the tribe who came to Bahrein and committed outrages, plunder, and murder, such a proceeding is in the highest degree absurd, contrary to justice, and a deviation from the right course. * t( For example, if one or more of the people of Bahrein who frequent the coasts of Busreh, Kowait, Katif, Ojair, and Gwuttur be murdered by the Arabs of those parts, and explanation be required, it were to be said that the person or persons murdered were of a tribe who at a certain time visited and plundered such a place, and were related to those who murdered our messenger, and such like excuses made, I would like to know whether such pleas would be accepted. » ' If both parties concerned are dependents of one and the same Government, the party who ventures to commit such an act will be considered as a murderer, and would be required to undergo punishment, or, even supposing one of the parties to be a foreigner, would not this39 course be applicable to bim ? Certainly it would be so. The above sufficiently answers the first and second excuses put forward in your letter. ' The arguments adduced by me in this matter would be recognized in every place, and are in accordance with all custom and rule, and in every Court in the world. ' But as regards the third subject mooted in your letter, to the effect that the murdered messenger was the bearer of a letter from the Firman Firma for Jassim-bin-Sani, and that you sent the letter intact with the seal unbroken to its destination, you say also than in opening a second letter you found that certain persons hat! written it to another person in Gwuttur, mentioning certain matters connected with Bahrein, which you observed with regret. This letter, although written by certain persons to an individual in Gwuttur, did not contain matters of the nature represented by you. But if it had contained any such, may God help us, it would have created mischief to the State. ' This question had no concern with the messenger, nor yet with the person to whom the messenger was sent, but had reference only to the persons who indited the letter. Not withstanding this were the subject-matter contained in the letter as seen by you and quoted by you to this effect, viz.-- ' That the enemy would be suppressed, and that friends would rejoice/^ it contained nothing injurious, but only what was beneficial to all mankind, ' If any fault can be found, it is in the fact of your having opened a letter of this descrip tion from one party to another, at a time when you were a person in authority. Your presump tion in acting in this manner would be objected to by every Government and stigmatized by every creed. ' As regards your statement that the messenger who bore these letters was not known and carried no passport, the idea of such a question as that of messengers proceeding from Lahsa to Gwuttur being known or unknown, competent or otherwise, for the first time emanates from Bahrein. It is well known that persons employed on the coast and passing to and fro do not carry passports, and that the custom of carrying passports has never been in vogue in these parts. What you have now put forward in argument is sometimes considered fitting to adduce as an excuse, under such circumstances, in great cities which you have not seen, but may have heard of, ' The excuse, however, had no effect, because it is not the practice to carry passports in these parts. It would appear you have written from hearsay without consiJering at all whether the excuse would be of any service to you or have any weight whatever. ' Notwithstanding this it was known from the address of the official letter which the messenger was carrying, and from the seal on the document whence the messenger had come, and whither he was proceeding, and on what business he was deputed. These circumstances naturally showed what the man^s business was. Your statements are consequently foolish, and call for no remark. ' What causes me more surprise than all else in your statement, that you were not aware of the arrival of the Imperial troops at Lahsa and Katif, while arrival of these troops took place more than six months ago and the people of Bahrein, consequent on the protection and security caused by the presence of the troops, frequented the coasts without interference and carried on trade. The steamers and other vessels also passed to and fro in the vicinity of Bahrein. I am unable to understand how these patent circumstances have escaped your ob servation, while I have heard so much of your good sence and intelligence. ' In conclusion, the man despatched for the delivery of important letters from one Turkish Government authority to another is well known to us of having left; also how he was made to deviate from his course, the way in which he was taken to the island of Bahrein, and by whose bands he was killed. Same portions of the actual facts remained incomplete, but these were ascertained during the mission of Arif Bey, and the evidence is now complete. ' On this account it is necessary that the murderers should be called on to pay the blood- money of the murdered in accordance with the custom of law, viz., 10,000 legal dirhems of pure silver, which amount should be made over to the Kayem Mukam in Gwuttur, Jassim-bin-Sani for payment to the heirs o£ the murdered. ' In any case it is required that the murderer should be seized and confined. If it were possible for me (to get this done), it would have been done, in order that in future such oc currences as these may not be repeated. ' My object is to be informed who the murderers are, and in what manner they have been confined. If these things which I have said are not carried into^effect, and as you have written that the murder was committed by the people of the south, I, by the power of His Imperial Majesty, am able really and actually to give effect to what I have said. ' I now await a decisive reply from you.'40 148. On leaving Bahrein for Busbire, Colonel Pelly gave the following instructions, dated 16tli December,* to ® n ® 1 rt 0S ' r I e t0 Bombay Government letter, No. Captain Grant, Assistant Resident, who 378, dated 20dh January 1872. i hj. 'u 'L.' J 'D u • • xi was left benma at Bahrein, in case the question of the murder of the messenger should be revived. After informing him of the instructions of the Government of India, he added— 'I now entertain every hope that the Turkish authorities will not interfere with Bahrein ' Should interference, however, have place [and as providing for this remote possibility], you will in such event remind the Senior Turkish Officer present, verbally in the first instance, and, if necessary, by letter, of the assurance given by the Forte to our Government. &lt;c If the interference should still continue, address to the Senior Turkish Officer the language of His Excellency the Viceroy contained in the telegram of the Political Secretary, dated 9th November last. ' Should the interference relate to the death of the messenger in particular, say you are instructed to intimate that this is a matter for diplomacy and, if necessary, for arbitration, and cannot in any way affect the political status of Bahrein. Your letter should go by direction, beginning thus : The British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, acting in obedience to commands received from His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India instructs me to &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. 'In the event of interference communicate with me by steamer if there be more than one steamer at Bahrein, otherwise by special boat. * * * * ' It is possible that His Excellency Midhut Pasha may write to the Chief of Behrien concerning the messenger and other matters, in such event, please verbally suggest to the Chief the advisability oE sending a copy of the Pasha's letter to me, and of his postponing reply until he hears from me/'' 149. Colonel Pelly in a letter dated 27th January, to the Bombay .Govern ment,! forwarded a draft of the reply , Bo f£ ay Government No - 1009 ' which he had recommended the Chief of 1 ctu Jbebruaiy io/^* i • j i i j i Bahrein to address to the Pasha, and which the Chief approved and despatched immediately. The draft after ac knowledging receipt of the Pasha's letter concluded— ' I have submitted a copy of yonr letter to the British Government, with the request that, in communication with the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan at Con stantinople, an amicable settlement will be arrived at, and that I will bind myself to accept such settlement of the claims pending between Nejd and Bahrein,' , 149-A. The Porte did not wish to refer the matter to British arbitration, but ^ . - .n.n ... ftl R . wished that Midhut Pasha should settle becret, May lo/E, Nos. 61-84. ,, the dispute directly with the Chief by means of Agents. The Government of India thereupon decided that no opposi tion should be offered to a direct settlement of the question between the Agenta of Turkey and Bahrein, as long as no force or violence or constraint, as by presence of a Turkish vessel at Bahrein, was used. Instructions were also issued to secure the presence of a British vessel of war at Bahrein during the progress Secret, jane 1872, Nos. 170-173. ^gotiations. Ultimately the whole matter was apparently dropped by Turkey. Demand on Bahrein Chief for surrender of two boats. 150. While correspondence regarding the murder of the Turkish messenger was still being carried on, the Turks found a new pretext for fixing a quarrel on the Chief of Bahrein regarding two boats which the Pasha pretended to have been irregularly obtained by the Bahrein Chief from Katif ; ' These craft/' wrotej Colonel Pelly, ' were, I believe, brought over to Bahrein by Saood fVi'de Bombay Government Ko. 637, dated 31st • bin Feysul before the commencement of the Turk- January 1872. ish Expedition, and were presented by Saood to a certain person or persons in Bahrein.' Colonel Pelly forwarded translated purport of the letter from Midhut vide Bombay Government No. 637, dated 3i8t Pasha, demanding surrender of these January 1872. boats&gt; It was as follows 'I have just received a petition frono Mahomed bin Hossein of Gwuttur to effect that Saood bin Feysul, when fighting (for supremacy) with his brother Abdoollah, seized forcibly [C967FD] La bis boats. These boats are now in possession of the people of Bahrein, and petitioner begs the restoration of these boats to him. ' I be? to inform you that these acts of plunder are contrary to law and to the customs of the hi»h Government. You know that the wish of the • Government is to protect ^ sub ' iects and^to preserve them from intrigue and oppresion, specially as Saood has seized all boats bv force, and whatever he has thus taken forcibly is in possession of the, people of Bahrein wUo have become protectors of what this oppressor has plundered. Under these circumstanees, such proceedings are contrary to the rules of civilzation and opposed to the customs of the Exalted Government. «I find it necessary to request you to ascertain who possesses the boats of the petitioner, and restore them to their original owner. This matter being one of justice, you should help in arranging it satisfactorily as early as possible. 151. The Bahrein Chief replied u 1 have had great pleasure in receiving your welcome letter dated ^ 1 l87^ and 1 have nnderstood its purport and your wishes specially in regard to enquiries being made res pecting the two boats which orginally belonged to Mahomed bin Hossem of Gwuttur, and which were forcibly taken possession of by Saood bin Feysul and given to the people of Bahrein while Saood was in authority. ' I have made enquiries, and find that Saood bin Feysul^when in authority was indebted to two persons of Bahrein, and in payment gave them these two boats. This is the true state of the case, whieh I trust you will accept, as I am sure of its correctness.' 152 The Chief received* a reply to his letter from the Turkish Bey at • Vide eDctoBnre of Bombay Government N.. Katif Who, afto acknowledging the 1010, dated i9t]i February 187a. Chief S letter, Wrote— ' This reply is not accepted, as it cannot be admitted by law or custom. In reality I did not expect to receive from a person like the Chief of Bahrein,who, notwithstanding his need of being placed under the flag of Turkey, such an absurd and uncomformable reply. The Effendi (i.e., Midhut Pasha) before leaving instructed me how I should act. My request is that you will inform me of your final intenti-m as to whether you will give what is required of you in full, or that you will not conform with His Excellency's wishes/ 153. Meantime certain reports reached Colonel Pelly, which strengthened his suspicions of the crft having been irregularly obtained by Saood. At Colonel Felly's recommendation, therefore, the Chief sent the following reply to the Pasha under flying seal through the Katif Bey « I beg to enclose, for Your Excellency's information, a copy of a letter I have received from AH Beg, Kaimukam of Katif, purporting to be a reply to my letter to the address of Your Excellency, dated 8th Shawal 1288. ' I regret to observe the menacing tone of the Kaimukam's letter. ' As regards the two craft in question, and which were brought to Bahrein before the arrival of'the Turkish authorities at Katif, I have already communicated to Your Excellency what I believed to have been the facts of the case. « As however I am most desirous that no possible suspicions should rest on me of in any manner conniving at or sanctioning any irregularity at sea, and as it has been asserted that His Highness Saood bin Feysul obtained the two craft in a manner which has been called m question, 1 am requesting the persons to whom Sand bin Feyaul presented the craft to place them at mv disposal in order that I may make them over in the presence of the British officers at Bharein to whomsoever Your Excellency may depute to receive them. On the 9tb February Colonel Pelly signalled : Assistant Resident reports Bahrein Chief accepted my counsel and rejoined to Pasha accordingly. All quiet.' Reasons for non-interference of British Government in operations by land. 154 Erom the commencement of the Turkish expedition both Colonel Herbert and Colonel Pelly had repeatedly Secret, May 1872, Nos. 52-88. expressed an opinion that the ultimate Dbject of the expedition was the acquisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the [C967PI)1 M42 4 Arabian Coast. Writing on the 26th April, the Ambassador at Constantinople observed :— ' Midhut Pasha has the reputation of an able and energetic administrator, but if he is actuated by the desire attributed to him by Colonel Herbert of extending the authority of the Porte, I can detect nothing here to make me suppose that any such project would be encour aged by the Grand Vizier, although His Highness sbows himself excessively sensitive to any remark which he considers to imply a doubt of the rights of the Sultan over Nejd districts/' The repeated and positive assurances of the Porte denying the existence of any intention such as that imputed to them have already been alluded to in paragraphs 62-67, and subsequent assurances to the same effect were not want ing. 155. The Bombay Government, however, in a letter dated 18th Julv 1871 No. 1214, observed :— J ' It does not appear to His Excellency the Governor in Council that the assurances of the Turkish Government are as featisfactory as they seem to be regarded by the Government of India. On the contrary, they seem to be founded on a claim which may be productive of much complication hereafter, and which His Excellency in Council regrets to see admitted. ' Tfie Porte proposes that its only object is to restore the authority of its Kaimuicam the Buler of Nejd. His Excellency in Council fears it will be found that this covers a claim to the allegiance of all the littoral tribes. —The Amir of Riadh has received tribute from Maskat has never ceased to claim authority over Bahrein, the Gwuttur coast, and also Aboothabee If Sheikh Abdoollah is restored with the support of a Turkish force, His Excellency in Council* does not doubt but that the Amir's claims will be renewed, and, if renewed and suceessfullv resisted, there appears nothing to prevent Turkish interference with the littoral tribes. His Excellency in Council confesses to apprehensions of great embarrassment for the future 'which probably might have been avoided if a more decided tone had been adopted and Turkish intervention prevented/' 156. When the instructions given to Colonel Pelly paraeranh 721 were communicated to Midhut Pasha by Colonel Herbert, that officer wrote on me i m J lino • 'His Excellency notestW Colonel Pellvi. instructed to protect tKe pearl fisheries from all kinds of interference and aggress,on, which, he states is also necessary on hi, part and has bten assigned as a duty of the expeditionary troops ; and he notes as a JVi! i fnlness that Colonel Felly is directed bv HeJ Ma^'s Indian Go^JntWer h^f and assist m preserving order and tranquillity m that sea. a»mseir ' I would here remark that the preservation of the tranquillity of the Gulf nnrl +• of the interests of the pearl-fisheries have not hitherto he™ mattL in wMoh tht Government has assumed to itself any active interventiou.

The Bombay Government thought that the above letter of Colonel Herbert strongly corroborated their previous view as to the possible results of the Turkish Expedition and the real designs of the Baghdad Governor- General :— ' Midhut Paslia,' wrote the Bombay Government, ' has long been known as one of the most able men in Turkey, bent upon extending the authority of the Porte wherever and when ever an opportunity presents itself. The expedition, it is alleged is to re-establish the authority of ihe Lieutenant of the Porte throughout the territory of Nejd. But what are the boundaries of Nejd ? ' It has bpen pointed out in the letter of this Government above quoted, that the Ameer of Riadh has always claimed a suzerainty over Muscat and Bahrein, and it now appears that the official paper at Baghdad distinctly includes Bahrein and the country of Oman to the east within Nejd territory. It is impossible to foresee to what complications these pretensions may lead.' 168. The views of the Government of India on these points will be ascertained by a reference to the following note of His Excellency the Viceroy, dated the 29th July 1871. ' I really do not know what the Bombay Government want us to do. Do they wish us to define or rather, as Colonel Herbert expresses it instruct them as to our views in regard to the whole country of Oman, boundaries, allegiance, jurisdiction, etc. ? *' I always thouo-ht that it was one of the well known maxims of diplomacy that a gov ernment who desired peace should not initiate the discussion of complicated and difficult subjects, and should not reply to anticipated questions until they were put. ' I see no necessity whatever for expressing any opinion as to the boundaries of Nejd, Maskat, any portion of Oman, or the littoral of the Persian Gulf, though we are perhaps in a position to offer a sounder opioion on these subjects than any other government, administra tion, or power. '* The Bombay Government relies upon the ambitious character of Midhut Pasha, and what they call ' his well-known designs/ ' For my part 1 prefer to take as a base of action the positive assurances of tht Minister* of the Pcrtdj rather than the character of the (rorernor-General of Baghdad, however well-known, or the opinions published in the Baghdad newspaper, no matter how directly that journal may be tuppoxed to he inspired to by the advisers of the Pasha. ' The Government of India are quite aware of the possible complications that may arise out of the unwise action of the Turkish Government in this matter. 'We have expressed our views to the Secretary of State in the strongest language, and at the very fir^t decalred our opinion that every possible amount of diplomatic pressure and per- suation should be exercised to induce the Sultan to abandon this dangerous undertaking. 'We have received assurances more satisfactory than I had at first expected. ' As 1 said before, I do not know what the Bombay Government want us to do ; but all I can say is, that if their advice is to be interpreted into this—that we should take the present opportunity of attempting to define relations and boundaries as between the .differrent Chiefg and States in these districts, I consider it to be a most unwise proposal. ' The Secretary has well pointed out that we have nothing to do with these matters. 4&lt; Our obligations with regard to the Gulf itself, and the preservation of maritime peace, are sufficiently onerous and difficult without entering into further enterprises. ' I agree in the opinion that no provisions for a joint protectorate of the fisheries, come from what quarter they may, can be admitted; but perhaps it will be sufficient to say to Colonel Herbert that as this duty of the protection of the fisheries and the preservation of the maritime peace has devolved for many years upon us alone, and that as the Ministers of the Porte have already assured us that no interference or change with regard to our position in the Persian Gulf is desired or meditated by the Sultan, it therefore follows that nothing that has happened with regard to the Turkish Expedition to Nejd can be taken to authorize any interference on their pirt with those duties which are well recognised and which we shall continue unassisted to perform.' Further narrative of the Expedition and Affairs of Nejd. 159. The accounts received from time to time regarding the doings of the Expedition, and events in Central Arabia, are contradictory and unreliable to a degree that makes it almost impossible to give any clear and connected account of what has occurred. Writing too late as the 22nd November,44 Colonel Pelly requests tliat tbe information given by him with regard to events that had happened so far back as three months previous to the date of his letter must be accepted with caution. 160. Colonel Herbert's letter of the 2l8t June contains an account of the operations of the Expedition after landing in Arabia. He writes ' The Turkish account of the proceedings of the expeditionary force is, that it reached Ras-Tanureh on the 13th Mais, agreeing to 25th May, and, landing on the following morning marched towards Katif. ' That the people occupying the country through which it passed at first showed a disposi tion to hostility, but the object of the Expedition being explained to them, they were satisfied and expressed gratification at the prospect o£ being relieved by the presence of Turkish troops from the oppression under which they have been suffering. 'That on the troops drawing near to Katif Syed Mahomed Saeed Effendi, son of the Nukeeb of Bussorah, and who had accompanied the troops, was, at the repeated written request of Abd-ul-Aziz, commanding the fort on behalf of Saood, sent to him to negotiate. ' That Abd-ul-Aziz stated to him his regret to be obliged to oppose the Imperial troops, but pleaded the many favours he had received from, and the confidence reposed in him by, Saood as his excuse for resistance, and declared his determination not to surrender the place until compelled by superior force, 'That he had levelled tbe mosques and other buildings round the fort with a view to defence, and that he opened fire on the troops who surrounded the place on three sides, while the Turkish Steamer Jssur and the boats from Koweit attacked it by sea, and that it fell after a bombardment of three hours. ' That after taking possession of this place with the guns, ammunition, and stores it con tained, the troops marched to Damam, capturing en route a position called Anuk, which sur rendered after a show of resistance, and in which were found three guns, besides arms and ammunition and public stores, all of which were placed in charge of an officer and guard. 'That Abd-ul-Aziz, son of Saood, who was in Damaum,fled on the approach of the troops, and the place was surrendered by Ibn-el-Tehnooneh, Mahomed bin Feysul, who had been con fined in it, being set at liberty. ' That Damaum was found to be well fortified with three'strong lines of defence and to contain eleven guns,—nine iron and two brass,—and a large quantity of ammunition and stores, of all of which possession was taken, proper measures being adopted for their safe keep ing. A guard of two companies of infantry were placed in the fort, and the force returned to Kateef, accompained by Mahomed bin Feysul, and taking with it Ibn-el-Tehnooneh and the others who were captured at the fall of the place. 'It is now said that the force will proceed to El Hasa, and I am glad to be able to report that His Excellency Midhut Pasha has tdld me that there is no present intention of their making any attempt to proceed beyond that town. ' 161. The above account agrees very well with that published in the Jeundee Secret, August 1S71, Nob- 147-301. ^ translation of Kos. 151-158 ibid. which was forwarded by Sir H. Elliot. Major Smith, the Assistant Political Eesi- dent in the Gulf, wrote that Katif surrendered on the 3rd June, and that Damaum was taken on the 5th. Colonel Pelly in telegrams of the 25th 26fch and 27th of June reported the Turks to be still at Katif, preparing for a move to El Hassa or Lahsa, a fertile district, inland of which Hofoof is a principal fort and chief town. The Arab sea contingent of the Expedition about 300 craft,* had returned to their homes. The Turkish force was esti- * Furnished by the Chief of Koweit. mated by Colonel Pelly to be 3,000 strong with a contingent of 1,500 Arabs and nine guns. In the meantime an engagement appears to have taken place between Abdullah and Saood. The latter despatched a force inland from Lahsa which he then occupied against his brother. Abdullah was defeated and Saood was himself about to follow in pursuit. 162. In his letter of the 15th June Colonel Pelly reported receipt of two letters dated 16th May and 8th June, from Saood, the principal subject matter of which related to permission to operate by sea: ' The request,' says Colonel Pelly, ' was vaguely put, but I ascertained that the real object was to obtain from me a general permission or at least a promise that we would not interfere45 and then that my letter would be circulated to the Aboothabee and other trucial Chiefs as saactioning their putting to sea in favour of the Wahabees much in the same manner as the Koweit tribe Ijave done in favor of the Turks.' Colonel Pelly declined to reply at the time to these queries. 163. On arrival at Katif the Turkish Commander addressed a procla mation to ' all residing in Lahsa, Katif, and the provincea of Nejd/' informing them that Nejd and its dependencies form part of the Turkish possessions similarly to Irak, Yemen, Egypt, &amp;o. The ploclamation next went on to say that Saood having overthrown the authority of Abdullah, the Kaimu- kam appointed by the iSultan under the Baghdad Government, a force had been despatched to assist Abdullah and bring the people under his rule. Saud was promised pardon if he came in and apologized for his conduct: otherwise he and the tribes that supported him would be .destroyed. The tribes that remained at Lahsa and Katif were promised favor and protection. Midhut Pasha had expected Abdullah to join the expeditionary force at It turned out subsequently that the insecurity of Katlf, but the latter Was either UnWlll' the roads prevented his joiniug the Turks. i^g or unable to do this.* The Pasha told Colonel Herbert that he hoped to attain the object he had in view by negotiation and without the employment of force, and with this view he sent with the Expedition Munsoor Beg, formerly Sheikh of the Montefik, and several other influential Arabs to act as parlementaires. 164. Early in July the Turkish troops marched from Katif and reached Hasa. According to a report by one of Colonel Pelly's Moonshees, Fereck Pasha, the Turkish Commander, was 15 days getting to Hasa, owing to the heat and the illness of his men. The march of the Turks was not opposed, and the forts were all given up without resistance of any kind. Saood, who was reported to be in Eiadh with a large force, seemed anxious to avoid any collision with the Ottoman troops, and only desirous of drawing them away from this base of operations on the coast. Secret December 1871. W 1.163 (So. 24). Colonel Herbert wrote 011 the 19 th J ul y. ' Whenever they [i.e., the Turks) may have established themselves in El Hasa, they will, if he (Saood) be really as strong as is said, be almost entirely at his meroy, as he will possess the power of surrounding them and cutting off their communication with the coast. ' A report, which seems to be reliable, has reached me that the Expedition lost as many as four hundred men at Katif from cholera and want of food. '* Provisions were scarce and had been damaged in transit. The men are said to have been livicg on rice and water, and it seems they were in a pitiable condition when they marched Irom Katif. 4 It is further rumoured that Saood had utterly defeated Abdoollah, and that he has offered to pay tribute to Turkeyj at the same time expressing his determination to resist invasion of the country. ' This seems to be generally believed to be true/' oe 165. On the 1st August Colonel Her- ll%d No. 25. i . i 0 bert wrote:— ff It is stated that the force is much reduced in numbers by deaths from sickness and want of food, and is much dispirited. ' Sheikh Faleh, son of Nasir Pasha, Sheikh of the Montefik, with the contingent of Arab horsemen which had ascompanied the Expedition to El Hasa, reached Koweit on his return on the 26th instant. ' It is reported that, from the time of joining the expedition, he had only received seven days' commissariat supplies for his men and animals, and on his applying for help to the General in command, Nafiz Pasha, the latter stated his inability to aid him, and recommended his return with his contingent ; that they marched accordingly, but without supplies of any kind ; and that they lost very many horses on the way to Koweit from want of food and water. ' Munsoor Beg, Ex-Sheikh of the Montefik, Suliman Zaheir, Ex-Sheikh of Zobair, and Syed Mahomed Saeed, brother of Syed Abdool-Rehman, Nakeeb of Bussorah, are said to be on their way back, and therefore Nafiz Pasha, with his reduced body of troopsj is left without support at El Hasa. [C967ED] H40 fl Saood is still reporte to he in possession of Kiadli and Nejd Proper. The whereabouts of Abdoollah is not distinctly known, but he is said to bet not far irona the capital, probably at Kharij, to the south, and it is said that the inhabitants of the country are endeavouring- to bring about a reconciliation between the brothers with the view to their combining to get rid of the Ottoman troops. ' It is to be apprehended that the position of these last is very precarious.' 166. Colonel Felly's Moonshee, writing in July, reported Abdullah to be two days' march from Eiadh:—' te Saood/' he said, &lt;£ has no money anfl has expenses. Abdoollah bin Feysul is now located at a place called Akhremeh, two days^ journey from Riadh, and has followers from the Nejd countryj and is also in want of money. He was originally anxious to be friends with his brother Saood ; but when letters from the parts of Bahrein informed him that the Turkish army intended to establish him as Imam, he would not consent, and is waiting to see what turn affairs will take, but was unable to get across to the Turks on account of the insecurity of the roads.' He added: 'Fereck Pasha is now at Lahsa, and is unable to move further on account of the sickness, heat, and hot winds. a It is said that if the people of Nejd join together, no one will be able to subdue them. But now they are separated, some following Saood and some Abdoollah, and that to a certainly their enemies will subdue them. u At heart the people of Nejd do not like the sons of Feysul on account of their oppres sion and unjust taxes, and on this account they are now ruined. ' Ibrahim Beg has a following of 800 Turks in Katif, and has ordered-the streets to be swept and watered. He has ordered bazaars to be established out of the fort. About 70 prostitutes from Baghdad were brought to Katif in the Sniye, and 80 wine sellers, and their business is flourishing. ' People say if the Najdees be certain of these proceedings, they may join together and fight the Turks, as the Wahabees do not consent to such acts. ' Some of the merchants of Katif have communicated these proceedings to the neonle of Nejd, and they will know that the Turks' are of another creed. They are now assured that the intention of the Turks is to place Abdoollah bin Feysal as their Imam, and that their religion will rule as before.' 167. The position of affairs in the beginning of August is thus described by Colonel Pelly in his letter of the 14:th of that month :— ^-—The Turkish force is in occupation of the fertile district and ports of Lahsa: and the question is being discussed between the Commander of the forces and the Turkish authorities as to whether the Expedition should for the present remain at Lahsa, or whether constituting Lahsa an intermediate base of operations, the Expedition should advance into Nejd. ' 2nd.—The Com mander of the forces would seem to be in favour of halting where he is at all events, until the weather cools and rain falls. The Turkish authorities, on the other hand, would seem to be urging an advance, and contemplating an invasion of Nejd by a com bmed moyement of the forces now in occupation of portions of the Arabian Littorals of the Persian Gulf and Red Sea. Should this alleged combined operation be successfully carried into elfect it might have important results, and would seem to indicate an intention permanentlv to occupy Peninsular Arabia as a Turkish province. ^ ' 3rd.--•The Expedition appears to intend strengthening its sea base by the erection of forts at Ojair and m the neighbourhood of Katif, while the line of communication between those ports and Lahsa is to be secured by fortified posts at every caravan stage. ' ^.—ArVangemeDts appear to have been made for the occupation of Gwattur But this region continues as yet in a distracted state, pressed on by the Turks, and harassed bv the Bedouins, who appear, at the instigation of Saood bin Feysul, to be marauding or amjressinff all along the southern flank of the Turkish line of communication. '5^.—The respective positions of the contending brothers, Abdoollah and Saood bin J?eysuV do not seem to be certainly known. Neither seem to be in great force while the tribes and the inhabitants of the Capital Riadh appear to be awaiting either the imprisonment or death of one of the aspirants.' 168. On the 28th August, Colonel Pelly reported two fights between Ab- dullah and Sand. The latter was said to have been killed and Saud wounded The Turkish Commander was becoming uneasy about his communication with the coast and was calling for reinforcements, two or three hundred men had47 been pushed on to Hasa from Katif and Ojair. Colonel Felly's estimate of the strength of the Turkish force was as follows : — In tlie Fort at Katif, of whom perhaps 150 sick At Ojair ... ... Keinforcement en route to Lahsa ... 500 150 225 Head-quarters in and around the forts of Lahsa, of whom 1,000 sick 2,500 Total strength 3,400 Deduct sick ... 1,150 Effective ... 2,500 This he thought was perhaps over the mark. The Arab Contingent was about 2,000 men. Katar was being overrun by the Bedouins, who were also plundering between Ojair and Hasa. The Chief of Bahrein had ordered the Bedouins who were on the island to leave the place, and most of them had crossed over to Katar. Pereck Pasha had been raising recruits in Hasa and had got about 900 men at 6 dollars a month. It was said that Pereck Pasha had invited Saud to come to Hasa but the latter refused to trust himself there. 169. In September Colonel Pelly announced a report that Abdullah was not killed, but had reached the Turkish camps at Hasa. He certainly did reach the Turkish camp eventually, but when and how he got there is quite uncertain. News of his sudden death, not in action this time, was current in Katar in the end of September. Saud was determined to fight, and was preparing to march from Riadh on Hasa. The Turks had received reinforcements at Katif. No movements appear to have taken place during October, but on the 22nd November Colonel Pelly reported;— ' So far as I can gather (and requesting always that all information based on native report may be received with caution), the position of affairs is somewhat as follows ' Ist—It appears that Saood having approached Labsa precipitated an action ; and after some partial success was defeated by the Tukrish force at Lahsa. 2nd. —That Saood then retired on Gwattur followed by a considerable number of JHedouins, who have now intimated to Mahomed bin Tanee and other Gwuttur Chiefs that they must elect between supplying the wants of Bedouins or having their towns or territory pillaged. On receipt of this news I gave our Indian subjects in Gwattur the usual warning. k 3 r d tl —That Saud has sent Envoys to the Bahrein Chief in view to his receving asylum in the event of necessity. The Bahrein Chief communicated with me on this subject, and my advice to him has been that Saud should refrain from approaching the island in order to prevent any semblance of a breach of absolute neutrality on the part of Bahrein. Copies of the Chief's letter and of my reply are appended. '4th. —It appears that the Pasha of Baghdad left the river about the 9th or 10th instant, proceeded to Koweit, passed a day there, and then came on with three steamers and a consider able body of troops to Katif, where he arrived about the 13th or 14ith instant; that he is now at Katif with his troops encamped on the plain, as Katif, like Bahrein, is plagued at this season by virulent fever, which is said to have caused much loss to the Turkish force, after it had ceased to suffer from cholera. ' 5th. —It is stated to be the intention of the Pasha to proceed almost immediately inland to Lahsa, but whether with the object of consolidating the Government at that point, or of forwarding the expedition towards Riadh, does not appear. Rumour, however, alleges that the Turkish authorities have issued a document, notifying the intention of the Turkish Govern ment to assume direct control over Katif and Lahsa to the exclusion of the Wahabee dynasty. It is, I think, to be borne in mind that the Turkish Expedition has not as yet entered the districts of Nejd, strictly so called.'' 170. On the same day Colonel Pelly wrote that a messenger sent to observe matters at Katif had ascertained, said Colonel Pelly— «that the Pasha of Baghdad embarked last night at Katif for Ojair, taking on board with him an escort of some three hundred men; and that it is the intention of the Pasba to proceed48 from Ojair to Lahsa. This report is confirmed by the appearance of the Pasha's steamer pass ing towards Ojair this morning. That the Turkish Commodore is ordered by the Pasha to hold one of his vessels in readiness off Katif, to send a second back to Busreh for supplies, and to proceed himself in a third to Bahrein in view to meeting me and for other business. ' That the report of the flight of His Highness Abdullah together with his son, Toorkee, from Lahsa towards Riadh is reliable. It further appears that His Highness' brother, Mahomed, had left Lahsa a few days previously; and that Abdullah left a letter for the Turkish Commander stating that the Turkish force having been professedly organized for his (Abdulah's) restoration to power, had been utilized to supplant both himself and his dynasty ; and that he would, therfore, no longer trust Turkish aid or promises.' 170A. On the 23rd November Colonel Felly wrote ' Yesterday evening the Turkish Commodore anchored with a corvette and a gun vessel in the Bahrein harbour. He hoisted the Turkish flag at his men and fired a salute of 21 guns. On being asked with the usual etiquette by our Senior Naval Officer as to whom the salute was intended for, he replied that he was saluting the forts on shore, and that as he had no Arab, flag on board he had hoisted the Turkish flag. He added that he had done the same at Muscat. ' To-day the Commodore and i exchanged visits, and he was by no means reticent concern ing the expedition to Nejd» He said that the Pasha of Baghdad had proceeded to Lahsa for the purpose of enquiring into some complaints of alleged corruption, of settling the Government at Lahsa, and of arranging for the advance of the expedition to the Wahabi capital. It was unlikely that the Pasha would himself accompany the Expedition to Eiadh, but Fereck Pasha the Commander-in-Chief, would in all probablity move the Lahsa force there during the present winter. The Commodore estimated the Lahsa force at from 9 to 10,000 men indepen dently of irregulars. He said that the recent defeat of Saud had been decisive; that Abdulah and his brother had escaped; and that the Turkish Government would now probably depute a person of rank from Constantionple as Governor-General of the Wahabee territory. He admitted that the Expedition had been costly, and that permanently holding the country could never pay, but he deemed the principal object of the Porte to be to rid themselves of Wahabi annoyances to^ pilgrims passing across x ^rabia to and from Mecca ; to accomplish this, he said, concerned the Sultan in his capacity of head of the Mussulman religion. 'The Commodore alleged that the road between the coast line and Lahsa is now so safe that single postmen pass along it. He added that it was the intention of the Pasha to erect a new town m the neighbourhood of Katif. He had himself accompanied the Pasha in an excursion J for the selection of a site, and the Pasha had chosen a position about four miles distant from the present fort of Katif, where sweet water is plentiful, and the surroundinff country open.' 5 172. Eeferring to Koweit the Commodore informed Colonel Felly that the Chief had been regularly installed there on the recent visit of the Fasha, and that Koweit was declaredly under Turkish protection. 173. In a letter of the 4th December Colonel Pelly wrote: « Midhut Pasha arrived at Lahsa about eight days ago, and is said to have expressed ^fa^stfc^OQ^With the Commander of the Turkish Forces on account of the escape of Abdullah bin Feysul. ^ ,f Meantime all reports concur in alleging that Abdullah has reached his capital Riadh whence, as it is said, he has addressed a letter to the Turkish authorities complaining that, whereas they entered his country with his consent, and for the concerted object of reinstating him m power, they had practically placed him under restraint and purposed supplanting his dynasty by direct Turkish Rule; that he had now escaped; but was still willino-to pay tribute and arrange matters, provided the Porte should acknowledge him as Imam^ of the Wahabi territories; but that, failing this, he would endeavour to hold his own, and that JVejd was a country not easy either to take or to hold.' 173A. A notification was issued by Midhut Pasha that the al Saud had ceased to reign and that Nafiz Fasha was Nejd. * 174 : £?lonel Herbert in a letter of the 3rd January 1872 reported the return of Midhut Pasha to Baghdad on the 28th December. The Pasha broueht back a great number of invalid soldiers from El Hassa and Katif. Colonel Herbert wrote:— 'The state of the garrisons at El Hassa and Ka^if is reported to be verv bad sickness pievaUs among the troops |o a great extent, and their numbers are said to be so mneh reduced that Nafiz Pasha is compelled to aot purely on the defensive, and can hardly repulse the fre- principalQiiefs ^ ^ who, it seems, contmue to harass them even in the absence of the49 ' Abdullah is reported to be in Riadh and Saud to continue in tlie neighbourhood of Gwattur, while a correspondence is said to be goingf on between them, though as yet it is not known that they have come to any terms. 'Meantime Midhut Pasha shows no intention of withdrawing from his aggressive, costly, and hopeless policy in j^ejd. While at Bussorah on his way back to Baghdad he purchased from the Persian Governor of-Mahomerah a steam vessel to run between Bussorah and Katif, and on the 1st instant a detachment of about 300 soldiers left this to supply the place of some of the sick men whom he brought up. ' This country is thus being denuded of troops to a considerable extent, and it is highly probable that these will be needed here in the spring. ' The Arabs are said to be much disaffected^ particularly the Sharnmar, who are excited by the mode of execution at Moosul of their late Sheikh, Abdul Kurreem. Rain is now falling abundantly throughout the country and will fill the wells in the desert; and a rising is con sidered by no means impossible.'' 175. Colonel Felly's last news, dated 13th January, was that the Turkish Commodore had proceeded to El Bidaa taking with him the steamer Assur and a battalion of regular troops. These he landed at El Bidaa against the will of the Chiefs. Colonel Pelly wrote :— ci This practical experience of what is meant by Turkish friendship may, perhaps, account for the Gwattur Chief having addressed a very polite letter to me.' The following report of the landing at El Bidaa is given by the Assistant Political Eesident in his news gleanings 'The two Turkish ships at El Biddeh saluted and invited the Chief, Mahomed bin Sanee, on board; he excused himself, but afterwards, at the request of Abdullah bin Subah, Chief of Koweit, he went on board, accompanied by his son. ' The Turkish Commander presented dresses of honour both to the Chief and his son, and said to the former, you asked for help, and we have been ordered to come here and help you, and will land the troops. ' The Chief replied, I did ask for help, but it was when I was at feud with Saud ; now we are friends, you had better go back again; this is no place for you ; there is no food for you or your thousand men. The officer said my orders are to land, and land I must, you had better write to my Government to say you don't want us, and I will then go when ordered. The force landed and took possession of a fort called c El Maselim ' and a few houses near it. The people of El Biddeh are very angry at this occupation of the place. The larger Turkish ship had left, but the smaller was still at Biddeh.^ 176. Regarding the brothers Abdullah and Saud, Colonel Pelly wrote :— ' Abdullah bin Feysul continues to live at Riadh, while his brother Saud hangs on the desert skirts of Gwattur. The brothers are, I believe, in correspondence, but whether their prejudices and respective pretensions will admit of their practically coalescing remains to be seen, ' The Turkish forces are distributed as before reported. But they are probably further diminished by sickness, and by return of time-expired men. Katif seems to be so un healthy that one of the Turkish Commanders informed me it was in contemplation to abandon the present site of the town as a military station.' 177. On the 26th January Colonel Herbert telegraphed that 120 artillery men had left Baghdad on the previous day for Katif and several hundred invalids had arrived thence. * Vide Bombay Goverament, No. 1007, dated 19»h T ^ 0ne ^ Mly in a letter dated 27th February 1872. J anuary wrote* ' The reports I have received from many points extending from Busreh to the pirate coast bear a common resemblance, but are all of them more or less unreliable. 'I gather, generally, however, that the Turkish force at Lahsa has been reduced below its original strength; but that reinforcements are being sent to Katif in Snipe, which steamer the Turkish authorities have recently purchased. 4f M.—That Abdoollah bin Feysul is still at Riadh in communination with his brother Saood, who with a body of Bedouins is moving about on the inland skirts of Gwuttur. ' 3rd. —That Saood in turn is in communication with the Turkish Commander at Lahsa in view to a meeting at a place called ' Cheranabthe Principals seem to mistrust each other. '4^—That Turkish troops have been withdrawn from El Biddeh in Gwuttur leaving there only a detachment for the protection of stores, &amp;c. It is also, generally believed that the Arabs of Gwuttur are dissatisfied with Turkish proceedings.' [C967rD] o50 Attitude of Bahrein Chief. Evidence of Turkish designs against Bahrein. 179. As already shown in paragraph 57, the Chief of Bahrein at the com mencement of the Expedition expressed his reliance on trucial engagement, and requested advice and protection from the British Government. On receipt of the assurances* from the Turkish Government [vide paragraph 72] that no in tention was entertained of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, the Chief was in formed accordingly by Colonel Peliy on the 26th May, and told that the Turkish Expedition in no way affected the treaty rights and obligation of the British Government or trucial Chiefs. In subsequent letters the Chief was directed to observe strict neutrality, and that as long as he observed Articles II and III of the Treaty with the British Government, that Government would fulfil its obligations. The Chief in reply expressed himself determined not to act against these agreements in any way. 180. In accordance with the advice and instructions received by Lim the Chief had throughout carefully abstained from committing himself with either of the belligerent parties, and had always shown himself ready to accept and act on the advice of Colonel Pelly, more especially in the matter of the murder of the Turkish messenger (paragraph 149) and the demand made on him by Midhut Pasha for the surrender of two boats (paragraph 153). When it was thought that Midhut Pasha was about to visit Bahrein, the Chief asked for instructions from Colonel Pelly as to his behaviour on the occasion. Colonel iPelly recommended him to be courteous to all guests of consequence, who visited his territories, but absolutely to abstain from mixing himself up in any quarrels that might be going on beyond his own frontiers. 181. In October 1871 a misunderstanding arose between the Chief and his brothers, which might have been incovenient at that juncture, had not an amicable settlement been arrived at. According to the Chief's account, he had hitherto assigned to his two brothers a third of the revenues of Bahrein, but, urging that this was not sufficient for them, they demanded one-half, which the Chief eventually consented to give so that there might be no open ing for his enemies to intervene. 182. Abdul Aziz, a son of Saud, appears to have visited Bahrein in August, and to have been received with great ceremony by the Chief. There is nothing to show what was his object in visiting the island, nor is any further mention made of him in the subsequent reports. 183. Notwithstanding the explicit assurances of the Ottoman Porte as regards Behrein indications had not been wanting of a desire on the part of the Baghdad local authorities to obtain some pretext for interfering in the affairs of the island. The tone of the Pasha's letters on the subject of the murder of the messenger and the demand for surrender of the two Katif boats (para graphs 147 and 150) needs no comment. 184. In a letter of the 29th December 1871,* Colonel Pelly reported the • Enclosure to Bombay Government No. 378, Substance of a Conversation between an dated 20th January 1872 Arab of ^ acquaintance ^ Pasha, when the latter was at Katif. The Arab was a wealthy pearl merchant whose information had always proved accurate, and Colonel Pelly had' no moral doubt that his conversation with the Pasha was brought direct from the Pasha s lips. According to the Arab's account, after conversation on other subjects, the Pasha asked him if he had ever heard of the Sultan of Eoom [Turkey], and said that he would very soon hear of him. *' The Pasha asked me,' proceeded the Arab, ' whether it were true that the Bahreinees had petitioned to be taken under British protection. I replied it was quite true, and that all classes had long been and still were most anxious for the protection of the British flai? But that it had not been accorded to them. 'The Pasha then asked me if I thought I could procure the signatures of 50 or 60 sub stantial Bahrein merchants and others to a petition begging for Turkish rule. I said perhaps such a thing might be doue, but I was doubtful. ' The Pasha asked how long it would take me to try and collect the names. I said three or four days. He said very well, then I will delay my departure from Kateef for three days. 1 told him that »uceess in the matter would seem to be very doubtful. But that I would report to him at the end of three days.51 ' On the occasion o£ my second interview, however, the Pasha remarked that he must return at once to Bagdad, that the matter of the petition, therefore, had better be dropped, but that I might obtain something from my own relatives in regard to Turkish rule, and accordingly the Chief of Koweit, who was in ths Pasha's suite, gave me a letter for one of my relatives opening communication and offering him advantages at Kateef.' The same Arab |tated that he had been offered a Turish flag by the Commodore of the Ottoman fleet. 185. One of the papers found on the body of the messenger murdered at Bahrein was a letter from a son of Nasir bin Mobarik, the escaped pirate, in which the former says :— 'The Turks are mindful of Gwuttur, Bahrein, and other places in view to putting down their enemies so that their friends may rejoice.' 186. This letter is alluded to by the Bahrein Chief in his letter to the Pasha (paragraph 138 A), 186 A. Writing in November Colonel Pelly reported:— 'The general tone and tendency of the Turkish proceedings for some months past leave little doubt in my mind as to the intentions or at least wishes of His Excellency Midhut Pasha towards Bahrein' • 187. Referring to the departure of the Pasha from the Gulf, Colonel Pelly on the 21st December telegraphed ' The Government policy and holding our ships persistently before Bahrein in my opinion brought the Pasba and Turkish Squadron to abandon their intended interference, and our success is publicly felt in these regions to be a timely and necessary check to Turkish preten sions which were before misunderstood to our prejudice.' Assurances of Turkey. 188. In February 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded papers received „ i C *« xt C o Q o fr'O 111 Constantinople. Server Pasha Secret, May 1872, Nos. 62-88. , . , • x i i xi. x tt desired M. Pisani to state that Her Majesty's Government might rest assured that the policy followed previously by the Porte towards the independent tribes along the Persian Gulf had under gone no alteration whatever, and His Excellency asserted again on the part of the Porte that no intention was ever entertained, nor any design harboured, to subdue those tribes or obtain any supremacy over them. The sole object of the Nejd expedition he stated to have been, and still to be, to restore order and tranquility there, and establish a regular and cohesive administration more in conformity with the requirements of the country. Policy of Government. 189. In April 1872 the Bombay Government again wrote to say that they « 10*70 xr attached no importance to the assurances Proceedings, Secret, May 1872, No. 77. * xi, m i • i, , . , . of the lurkish Government as reported in the papers received from Constantinople, as there was no information as to what tribes in the Persian Gulf would be considered by them to be independent, or what they considered to be the limits of the kingdom of Nejd. The Government of Bombay thought that some specific declaration as to what the claims were should be at once obtained. The Government of India replied that the assuran ces repeatedly given by the Turkish Government, to the effect that they had no intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the other indepen dent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, were accepted as satisfactory, and that it was not considered expedient or likely to lead to any good result to ask for a specific declaration of the claims of the Turkish Government, 190. The policy of Her Majesty's Government was laid down in the following despatch, dated 9th May 1872, addressed to the British Ambassador at Constantinople— u I have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the Government of India respecting the proceetlings of the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf, more especially with reference to the increase which the Porte has recently made in the number of vessels employed in those waters. Her Majesty's Government&gt; however, consider that as long at Turkey is engaged in- upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ash it to curtail the means which it considers necessary for doing so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and e»peot that no attempt will he made to extend that authority&gt; which would raise questions between52 the Indian Government and the Porte, the mainlenanee of the existing state of things in the Gulf and on its lor den being considered a matter of great importance to the general traw quillity of those quarters-, and that the presence of large Turkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause the British Govern ment to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. 101. This despatch was duly communicated to Servev Pasha in June 1872 and he repeated the assurance, already so often giren, of the absence of all in tention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations. Abu-Thabi Chief. 192. Colonel Ross telegraphed as follows in July : — 'Frequent rumours reach Bahrein of intended move of a Turkish detachment from Nejd to Oman coast. It is said their design is to gain footing at Beyrance through con nivance of Chief of Abuthabi. I cannot rely on information as yet received, but have ins tructed Assistant Resident to use May Frere to ascertain facts. Knowing letters to have passed between ChieS of Abuthabi and Turkish authorities^ I think it possible he may have made overtures. Possibly Colonel Herbert could ascertain if any extension of Turkish influence eastward contemplated.' 193. In September 1872 the Abuthabi Chief declared his adherence to Turks. He had previously been inclined FoUtic&amp;i a ., SoTember 1872, No 8 .4-6. towards the Turks, but on hearing of their proceedings in Katif, Katar, and Hasa he kept aloof and determined to make peace first with the Chief of Debai and then proceed to Maskat to renew friendly relations with Syud Turki. When at Maskat he reported to Colonel Boss (then Political Agent) that he had received a letter from some Turkish authority, couched in vague terms, which he had understood to be an invitation to recognize the Turkish Government as the paramount authority. 194 On the 20th September 1872* Turki himself informed Colonel Pelly .. r -.0*0 v e« K o« Q of the submission of the Abuthabi Chief 0 xtica anuary , os. . the renewal of friendship, and that by gones would be bygones. Turkish Policy. 195. It thus appears that numerous assurances were given by the Turks that they intended no attack on Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and that, by the order of the Secretary of State, the Persian Gulf trucial Chiefs were interdicted from maritime operations, while Colonel Pelly was instructed to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 196. Satisfactory as these assurances were, it was soon found that the Turkish Government were bent upon to gain a footing in Bahrein by indirect means, by encouraging the enemies of the Chief of Bahrein in their intrigues against the island, and to extend their dominion in the Katar Peninsula. They employed Nasir-bin-Mobarik, the leading member of the rival branch of the Bahrein Sheikh's family, for this purpose. The Turks also gained over to their side, Jasim, son of Mahomed-bin-Thani, Chief of Bidaa, and employed him as a useful weapon in their anti-British policy in regard to Bahrein and the Katar and pirate coasts. They tried to incite the tribes on the Katif and Katar coasts facing Bahrein to maintain a hostile attitude against Bahrein and even to make piratical attacks against the island, while they took few effective measures to suppress piracies of these tribes in the Katif waters. Close of the Turkish Expedition. 196-A. After unsuccessful efforts to induce Abdullah to return to the Turkish camp, Bauf Pasha, who had succeeded as Governor-General of Turkish Arabia, opened communications with Saud in spring of 1872, but failed to persuade him to place himself in the power of the Turks. He, however, sent his brother Abdul Bahman accompanied by Pahad-ibn-Suaitan to Hasa to negotiate. Abdul Bahman was induced to accompany Haji Ahmed Khan, who had been sent by the Pasha, to treat, to Baghdad, where he was retained under surveil lance until August 1&amp;74. Eahad-ibn«Suaitan, who had remained in Hasa, was accused by Mahomed Fasha, who had succeeded Nafiz Pasha as Mutassarif, of intriguing, and sent in irons to Baghdad.53 196-B. Abdullah-ibn-Feyzal held possession of Riadli for a short time, bui was again ejected by Saud, who retained possession until his death in Decem ber 1874 ; Abdullah during that period residing near Koweit. 196-C. In Hasa Mahomed Pasha was succeeded by Faiz Tashn^ and in 1873 Redif Pasha, now Governor-General, was ordered to withdraw the regular troops from Hasa, and to incur no further expenditure. CHAPTEE FOURTH. Internal affairs of Hasa and Katif, 1872—1904. 197. The administration of the new Turkish Province of Hasa including ™ tv a t a •• 4., 4.- „ Katif was conducted by a Mutassarif Method of admiuistration. • . i i i tt- i- i appointed by the Vali of Basrah, and a Kaimakam (or J)eputy Governor) appointed for the Katif District under the control of the Mutassarif. A local commandant was appointed for military purposes. 198. We* shall give below the names of the several Mutassarifs appointed so far as our records show, and note important details of their administration. Bezech (or Bazih) al Arayar.—GhM of BeniKhalid was in March 1874 Political a., April 1874, Nos, 164-165. appointed by the Vali of JBasrah Mutassarif Hasa and Ahmed Pasha was appointed Bezech al Arayar, 1874-75. to be ^ command of the troo ^ The Turkish troops were, it appears, reduced only to two companies, which the Politi cal Resident thought was by no means an effective force. 199. Nasir, the Mutefik Sh^kh himself, arrived at Hasa with Bezech and Political a.. May 1874, Nos. 262-263. Ahmed Pasha and proclaimed Bezech as Mutassarif before a large assembly. A protest was, after the assembly had broken up, presented by some of the chief men of Hasa to Nasir Pasha, against the appointment of Bezech, as being unfit for the Government. These memorialists were imprisoned for'their trouble and despatched to Baghdad. One Khezir Effendi was appointed Kaimakam of Katif. 200. During this visit of Nasir Pasha to Hasa, there were anchored at Ras Tanarah the following Turkish vessels :— (1) Athaurl . , . (2) Maos j n v er boats. (3) Lebanon. (4) Sinope. They were disembarking wheat and barley for Hasa and Katif and taking on board troops for Basrah. 201. One of the reasons which induced the Turkish Government to re- Administration Report, Persian Gulf Residency, mOVC these troops Was, in the Opinion of for 1874 ' 75 the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, the unhealthiness of Hasa districts and the fact that the expense of keeping a large garrison of regular troops was found to be a serious drain on the treasuary. So a corps of irregular troops (or rather armed police) as placed under Bezech's orders. It was hoped that with this force at his disposal and tbe assistance of friendly Arab tribes, the new Governor would be able to preserve order and tranquillity. 202. This arrangement lasted for some months, and beyond frequent corn- Revolt of tribes in favour of Abdul plaints of the tyrannical exactions of Bahman.

A' i'asha (paragraph 173 -A), Mahomed Pasha (paragraph 196-A and Fait Fasha (paragraph 196-C). ^ [C967FD] N54 of them ready to espouse his cause, lie resolved with the rash impetuosity of youth to organise an expedition for the deliverance of Hasa from the Turkish yoke. What his ulterior projects were never became JoiowQ, hut it is probable that, if success had attended his arms, he would have joined his brother Sand. Quitting his temporary home in Bahrein, where he stayed but a few weeks, ha went to Ojair and was there joined by many of his allies, while others flocked to his banner as he advanced. In Hasa he met with an enthusiastic reception, and the whole province declared in his favour. S«eing resistance hopeless, Bezech shut himself up in the fort at Hofhuf, where he stood a long siege and managed to defy all efforts to dislodge him. Prompt measures were^ mean while taken by the Turks to quell the revolt and vindicate their authority. A force of three regiments of infantry, each about 800 strong, with four guns and a few irregulars, were despatched in two vessels of war, and a transport to the sea-port of Katif under the command of Nasir Pasha. The work of retribu tion was quick, decisive, and terrible. Lance, sword, and matchlock were of little avail against Turkish guns and discipline. The play of the enemy's ar tillery soon worked confusion among the motley masses of the Arabs. Abdul Rahman was the first to flee and his example was quickly followed by his army which dispersed in all directions. This was all the resistance that the Turks met with, no further attempt being made by Abdul Rahman to rally his scat tered forces or harass his foes. Then followed the sack of Hasa and the slaugh ter and outrage of many of the inhabitants, females even being submitted to the last degradation. This lasted for some days and then quarter was granted. Hasa laid waste, half its people fled, and the revolt extinguished, the Turkish forces began their homeward march towards Katif, whence they embarked and landed in Baghdad by February. ^ 202A. On the restoration of order, Nasir Pasha withdrew with the Turkish forces to Basrah, and shortly afterwards Formation of new province. • x i ^ c m. i he was appointed Governor of a new Turk ish province formed on the littoral, consisting of Basrah and its dependencies including Nejd. The establishment of this province, and more especially the appointment of Nasir Pasha, caused grave apprehension amongst the Trucial Chiefs of the coast, who addressed the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject. 203. Previous to leaving Hasa Nasir Pasha had removed Bezech from his Paiz Pasha, 1875-76. post and made his own son Fwz Fasha, Said Bey 1st time, 1876.77. Governor of Hasa, of whose administration we know nothing. He was succeeded by Said Bey on 1876. Said Bey was one of the latest Governors Hasa had, but must be distinguished from another capable Governor Said Pasha, his successor. 204. Said Fasha —was nominated Governor of Hasa in 1881. He earned Said Pasha, 1st time (1877-79.) the inhabitants and a tiaif admiaifltration Repoite for 1878-79 and reputation as a good administrator. He 79 * 80 ' directed an expedition against Tabeyl, a fort belonging to the Ameyr tribe, who had been implicated in plundering and in piracies about Katif. The fort was sacked and eventually the Ameyr sub mitted to Said Pasha and gave hostages for future good behaviour. The Beni Hajir however defied his authority and a respectable merchant of Hasa was waylaid and murdered by Z aid-bin-Mahomed. 205. Said Pasha made place for Said Bey, who took charge for the second said Bey, 2nd time (1879-81) time in December 1879. He left Basrah Political A.. Ja„.a y mo. Nos. 266.268. for Hasa by the after requesting Mr. Robertson to be recommended to Colonel Ross. He maintaiaed bis reputation as a capable administrator. 206. Said Bey, Mutassarif of Hasa, was relieved in 1881 by Eaji Abdul Haji Abdul Ghanni Pasha (1881-82.) Ghanni Fasha, who was sent irom Con- Admimstratiou Keport, 1880-si. stantinople, and who was described as a fanatic of weak intellect. In autumn a body of the Ajman Bedouins attacked Hasa, hoping to surprise the garrison. The commandant, however, got warning, and repulsed the attack, killing sixty of the Arabs, and taking prisoners two of the Chiefs, Ibn-Muneykhir and Rakan. The Mutassarif was accused of misconduct in the matter, and suspended and confined by the commandant and other officials. A commission was sent to investigate the matter, on whose55 report Abdul Ghanni Pasha was reinstated ; but he had soon to make room for a successor. 207. Said Pasha was re-appointed Governor of Hasa in 1882. He pursued Said pasha, 2nd time (1882-85.) co n ciliatory policy towards the people. But even at its best the Turkish administration bore very oppressively on the people. 208.

The whole district is in a state of alarm and excitement, and it is believed petitions have been made to the Turkish Governor of El-Ha^a to rectify this. The Governor of Katif having ordered an officer with some troops and some pieces of artillery to proceed to th.s tillage and punish the people for their turbulence, the officer inarched out of Katif with his command and then required a written order from the Governor as to what extent he was to inflict punishment. The Governor, however, did not think fit to give the written order, so the troops did not proceed to execute the verbal direction The principal people of the village then went to Ahmed-bin-Ma'adi, overseer of Kafif and besought him to obtain time of them so that they might write a petition to the Govern™ of El-Hasa, stating their poverty and inability to pay the large tax levied on them AhmoH bin-Ma adi managed to get the necessary respite. * 209.

Boss, Political Resident tn the Persian Gulf, No, 23, dated 26th Rahi-al-Awal 1299— 15th February 1S82, After compliments, —With reference to my letter No. 17 of 10th Babi-al-Awal 1299=30th January 1882, regarding fugitives from Katif^ I hear from their elders that the balance of revenue on account of date plantation now demanded from them by the Turks, is nearly Rs. 1,70,000 ; this money is required from all the inhabitants of the villages of Katif and is due on account of date plantations belonging to Turkish Government situated in the villao-es within the limits of Katif. The circumstances are as follow :—The Kaim Makam of Katif oroers the headman of the village to look after and water the Government trees, and the latter orders another to do this work gratis, and gratis work brings on ruin to the trees year after year; from ten trees there has remained one, and the trees are registered in the books according to their former produce, viz., ten years ago. When the time for estimating the produce arrives, the estimator comes and estimates ; if the produce be 1,000 killas dates, he estimates at 2,500 ; at the time of giving them (the fugitives) the Government produce, if the killa be worth a Bipee in bazaar, they charge them 3 krans year after year, and the balance has been accumulating from the time they took Katif till now. As regards private date trees, as the owners bribe the estimators, matters are made easy for them, and no balance remains to be paid by them on account of tax. I hear the Mutessariff of El-Hasa, Said Pasha, has written them a letter in reply to their complaint against the Kaim Makam ; it reached them a couple of days a^o, and I hear it is a ngul one. A part of it says that the Kaim Makam acted according to his (Mutes- sanffs; order in recovering the balance due to Government, and their departure to Bahrein would not profit them ; it would cause the ruin of Government property : if thpy had been suffering from injustice, their complaints would have been listened to by the Government and so tortn. ^ SOme i 0f . the aforesaid ^^tives are in hesitation ; some wish to go to Busrah fTw ?

Maliomed-bin-Abdul 'Wahab, who had transferred his residence from Bidaa to Ghareyah, proceeded on a visit to Hasa, whence he returned in May, via Ojair, accompanied by a body of about 50 Turkish gendarmes, of whom 20 were said to be for the protection of Ghareyah and the rest for the relief of the garrison of Bidaa. It was reported that the Mutassaritf of Hasa had pro claimed Ghareyah to be Turkish territory. Subsequently the commander of the Turkish gun-boat Zohaff landed at Ghareyah, and made notes of the leading inhabitants, etc. 214. Sheikh Jasim greatly resented the position assumed by Mahomed- bin-Abdul Wahab, with the aid and support of the Turks, of Governor of Ghareyah, and threatened to withdraw from Bidaa with his adherents and to commence hostilities against Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab. 215. In July it was reported tbat Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab had visited Sheikh Jasim at Eidaa, and that terms of reconciliation were arranged between them with the cognisance of the Turkish commander. The Turkish corvette Zohaff fired a salute of il guns in honour of the occassion, but the terms agreed on were kept secret. 216. Several robberies took place on boats of Bahrein in the waters of Katif, the Turkish officials showing their usual apathy and indifference. Re ports'of these incidents were forwarded, as usual, to the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. 217. Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had continued to keep up an active correspondence with the Turkish officials of Hasa and Turkish Arahia, visited Bahrein in winter. He was there met by the Jehrain from Ghareyah, about 250 in number, and it was arranged that these people should settle at Darin^ in the Katif District, where Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab would join them later and become their leader. He obtained permission of the Governor of Hasa for this settlement. Probably, indeed, it had been pre-concerted for some time. By this migration Ghareyah had become nearly depopulated, whilst Darin appeared on'the fair way to becoming a village of some importance. 218. Saleh Pasha was succeeded by Eifat Pasha (1887-89). fasha in 1877. 219. In January 1889 Eifat Beg, Mutassarif of Hasa was dismissed from service. There had been for some time External a ., February 1889, Nos. 384 335- . m uch unpleasantness between him and the military commandant, partly owing to some disagreement in connection with the estate of the deceased Ahmed-bin Mahomed; which the civil authori ties wished to take possession of, while the military opposed this intention. It- was even rumoured that the Mutassarif was assaulted and ill-treated by the Commandant, but this rumour was apparently unfounded. 220. The successor of Eifat Beg was AJcif Fasha. He dismissed the Akif Pasha. (1889-91). Kaimakam of Katif, and proceeded to External a ., September 1889, Nos. 250-251. investigate into the recent robberies and piracies.

He also proposed to establish custom houses at Darin and Katar. This project was at first abandoned, as it was apprehended that in carrying it out, they would only drive the Bedouins from the country to the interior or to Bahrein. 221. Akif Pasha advocated the organization of a dromedory mounted police (Aasressive policy). to replace the existing mounted police, External A., January 1891, Nos. 93-94. W ith which force it Was found impos sible to cope with the recalcitrant Bedouins and the work of escorting caravans from Hasa to Ojair. The scheme was to establish several mili tary posts in the town along the coast for the preservation of order. The Turkish Government sanctioned the establishment of seventeen posts. [C967FD] • Q58 It was also decided at the recommendation of Akif Pasha to rebuild Zebarah and Prfai-noi a at rr ♦ loos w Odeid (See the Precis). Garrisons External A. August 1888, Noi. 411-446. , . j i. t&gt; m r. i 'were also stationed at Has Tanarah and Bidaa in 1889, which numbered 400 men, their ostensible object being to carry- out the wishes of Her Majesty's Government for the effective suppression of piracy on the west coast of the Persian Gulf. 222. Said Tasha succeeded Akif Pasha as Mutassarif of Hasa and arrived at Hasa in May 1891. His policy was to embrace the conciliation of the Bedouins, the restora tion of their subsidies forfeited by his predecessor, and the removal of grievances previously allowed to pass unchecked. Arrangements were made in 1891 whereby the caravan route between Hasa and Ojair bad become safe, and tra vellers free from molestation by Bedouins. 223. In March 1892 it was reported that the Kaim Makam of K.atif, had AdmiuistratioQ Report for 1892-93. recei ved instructions to appoint officials at Katif, Ojair and Katar, to levy port- dues. This report proved to be correct as regards Katif at least, for in Decem ber the Chief of Bahrein represented that port-dues were being levied there on Baherin boats. Enquiry, however showed that this tax was levied on all boats entering Katif harbour and not on those of Bahrein alone. The Ben! Hajir pirates carried on their depredations at Katif itself and close to it, of which an account appears elsewhere. 22di. About the middle of October 1892 the Vali of Basrah accompanied by two of Turkish gun-boats and a regiment of infantry, arrived at Katif, en route for Hasa. The troops were disembarked and sent in boats to Gjair to march with His Excellency to Hasha. 225. The Vali, soon after his arrival, was stated to have arrested the Kaim Makam for some unknown reason, and he was afterwards taken as a prisoner to Hasa. His successor appears to have inaugurated a more effective policy, for proclamations were issued by him at Katif, aoubtless by the autho rity of the Vali, declaring Bahrein and Oman to be within Turkish'j urisdiction, and Turkish flags were offered to the nacodas of Bahrein boats, who, however, refused to accept them. Under these circumstances there was at first suspi cion that the troops with the Wali might be used against Bahrein. The Porte however, disclaimed any intention of so employing them. 226. In May 1892 it was reported that a caravan proceeding from Hasa to Ojair under an escort of twenty-five Turkish soldiers was attacked on the 14th idem by some three hundred Bedouins of the Monasir, Beni Hajir, and Morrah tribe, who were reported to have killed fifteen and wounded ten persons • car ried off booty estimated at Rs. 60,000 in cash, and Es. 50,000 in goods and plundered some forty pilgrims with the caravan. 227. They were said to have sent the booty to Katar, their place of refuse with Jasim-bin-Thani, for sale there. Various robberries in the neighbourhood of Hasa were attributed to the Beni Hajir and Morrah, and the townspeople were said to travel in bands of a score or so of armed men under the escort of a Bedouin whose presence insured their safety from the tribesmen. 22S. The first action of the Vali on arrival at Hasa appears to have been to take security from the principal people of the town and neighbourhood as he had done at Katif, to have no dealing with tlie Beni Hajir, Morra, and Mona sir, who thereupon retreated into the desert. 229. A number of the Arabs of Hasa were appointed to convey caravans between it and Ojair, thus leaving the Wali free to employ the whole of his force against the Bedouins. The troops appear to have made one or two raids against the tribe, and carried off a number of cattle and camels, but no serious encounter took place. 230, In February 1893 the Wali marclred from Ha™ taking with him the regiment of infantry which accompanied him from Basrah, and three hundredcavalry who had marched vid Koweit, The two gun-boats T^ere ordered to meet him at Bidaa. 231. In consequence of the reports in June 1893 of alar^e tribal gathering of the Beni-Hajar, Morrah, and Manasir, to attack the Beni-Khalid^ it was found necessary of provide a guard of Turkish troops to escort the Basa caravan for Ojair. The projected raid collapsed, the tribesmen returning with little booty. 232. In Pebruary 1894 the Bedouins of the Dowasir tribe raided a caravan on the road between Hasa and Katif, and carried off some goods; on learning however, that the caravan was escorted by a man of their tribe, the robbers made restitution. 233. Cholera broke out at Katif and lasted for over a month in July and August 1893. At the commencement of the outbreak, the death rate was 10 to 15 daily ; it subsequently rose to 50 or 60 daily. 234. The Wali of Basrali visited Katif on his way back to his head-quar ters from Bidaa in May J 893. , 235. The people of the place having petitioned against the Kaim-Makam and complained against his malpractices, he was removed from his post in July 1893. The new Governor, Eaouf Effendi, did not, however, assume charge of the duties of his post till January 1894. 236. In January 1894 the Turkish gun-boat Mujdeh-Eesan arrived at Katif with 90 military reliefs ; 30 of these were landed at Katif for Ojair, and the remainder were conveyed to Katar. i 237. In April 1894 Said Pasha, the Mutasarrif of Hasa resigned, and Ibrahim Pasha, formerly of Hodeida, was ibratim Pasha (1894-96.) appointed in his place. A struggle was Gulf admmistiation Keport for is - . niaintained almost throughout the year between the people and the authorities, in regard to the enhanced assessment of the date produce for export, caused by the fall in silver value, the injustice of the mofle of assessment, and the exactions of the customs master. Two or three deputations proceeded to Basrah to appeal to the Wali in the matter, but though a commission was appointed to arrange the matter, the grievances remained unredressed. 238. An appeal to the Supreme Government proving also unavailing, the merchants and others began to seek refuge at Bahrein and in January 1895, the number of these refugees amounted to about 130, and a further exodus was reported in February. A demand for arrears of the duty for the two previous years, added to the general discontent, which was still further aggra vated by the high-handed exaction by the Turkish soldiery, of krans at the exchange rates of 5^ for the dollar. 239. Pinally, in March 1895, the Governor of Hasa, while still refusing the concessions asked for, having, upon the instructions from Basrah, pro mised a better arrangement for the ensuing year, and having also dismissed the tax collector, who had made himself obnoxious to the people of Katif, those who had taken refuge at Bahrein were induced to return. 240. The Governor of Hasa with the object of gaining credit with his .• ^ Goverment, undertook an expedition for Gulf Administration Beport for 1895«96. &lt;&gt; x t t i • w the purpose of establishing a more effec tive and profitable Turkish control over the Ajman, Morrah and other tribes, who had hitherto paid only a nominal tax. The Ajman while admitting his demands pleaded their inability to pay without recovery of their property pil laged by the Moteyr and seized by Mahomed Ibn Bashid. The Governor accordingly attacked the Moteyr with the help of Ajman and other tribes, cap turing some of their animals. He was then summoned to Basrah, and after his return was active in encouraging the hostile attitude taken by Sheikh Jasim bin Mahomed Thani in support of the A1 bin Ali resistence to the Bahrein Chief which is noticed in the Katar Precis.60 241. The Beni Hajir pursued their habitual course of robbery. In July 1896 a band of this tribe made a descent Gulf AdministratxonEeport for 1896-97. upOU the flocks of ^ Naim tribe in Katar carried off no less than 3,000 sheep, as was reported, besides a number of camels. The same rubbers having committed further depredations, Mahomed Ibn Bashid, the powerful ruler of Nejd, sent to Sheikh Jasim la November to demand restitution of the property plundered his subjects. This demand was promptly complied with, and a threat from Sheikh Jasim of a general attack upon the Beni Hajir, failing their restoration of the plunder, had the desired effect. 242. Ibrahim Pasha was succeeded by Said Pasha, who thus became Gov- e o x, &gt;f4-T-* 4.• ernor of Hasa for the foruth time. Said Pasha, 4tli tim (1896-1900). 243.

The following report of Mr. Gaskin, dated 11th January 1901, will be read with interest as throwing light on Turkish methods of administration and policy :— ' I have the honour to report that Said Pasha has been dismissed from his post of Mute- Secret E., March 1901, Nos. 74-75. sarri£ of Hasa aild he ^rived here on the 1st Jan uary 1901, too late to proceed by the Royal Mail Steamer which left Bahrein on the same day for Basrah. I paid His Excellency a friendly visit on the 6th January 1901, and throughout my visit he was very communicative and disposed to be very friendly, and that was due, I think, to- his being a native of Baghdad and not of a Turkish origin. From his conversation I gathered that he has held the post of Mutesarrif of Hasa on three occasions and has served his Govern ment in a similar capicity in every province in Turkish Arabia. He attributes his dismissal to the intrigues carried on against him by the Commandant of the Turkish forces in Hasa, whom he describes as being an ignorant Turk with no sympathy for the local people, and con sequently he could not get on with him. The commandant, it appears, had reported to the Turkish Commander-in-Chief at Baghdad to the effect that in consequence of Said Pasha taking no measures to put a stop to the importation of arms into the territory under his charge, all the tribesmen have become possessed of arms equal to those with which the Turkish garrison is armed, and the Imperial forces will meet with formidable opposition in the event of their having to take the field against any truculent Chiefs. This report was forwarded on to Constantinople and was the principal means of bringing about Said Pasha's downfall. His Excellency returned my visit on the 8th January. He referred to the past friendship and support extended to Turkey by Her Majesty's Government and much deprecated the growing estrangement of the two Powers, I mentioned to him the report of the alleged con cession for pearl-diving in the Persian Gulf given by Turkey to Germany. He was much surprised at the report and declared that about 9 years ago some foreigners applied to the Porte for a similar concession and it was refused. He expressed an opinion that such a conces- sion was worthless, as Turkey had no exclusive ri^ht to any particular pearl banks and the Arabs are sure to oppose any operations carried out with scientific appliances. With reference to the Turkish garrisons in Hasa and Katar, Said Pasha informed me that he considered the employment ot' soldiers of the regular army in a country where so manv physical difficulties exist is a mistake, and he has suggested to his Government that the garri sons should be reduced and a larger number of Arab camelry from among the local tribes be engaged to replace them. He thinks that the substitution of a portion of the regular troops by camelry will effect a large saving and at the same time they will have a mobile force which will enable them to keep the Arabs in better check.^ 246. The District of Hasa was as usual, in a marked state of disorder in Gaif Administration Report for 1902-03. 1902-03. The caravan route between Ojair and Hasa was unsafe for the greater part of the year and three large caravans were attacked and plundered by Arabs. One of the three caravans, which left Hasa for Ojair on the 29th April 1902. was escorted by 120 cavalry, 80 mounted irregulars and 30 infantrv and61 was attacked by a part of the Morra, Safran and Beni Hajir Arabs. It was said that nearly all the escort was killed and the few who escaped were held as hostages for the safety of the Arab tribesmen who were in Turkish custody at Hasa. 247. The new Governor's administration was much what was expected Secret e, August 1903, No. 274. ?' r0m Ms ^famous reputation. The follow ing instance of his oppression reported by Colonel Wratislaw (10th March 1903) was typical of his ways:—- The following recent instance of almost incredible disregard for appearances in satisfying his rapacious instincts has raised _ the greatest indigoation amongs,t the Arab population, not only in the Hasa Sandjak, but in Bascah, and even as far as Bagdad. One of the prin cipal merchants of Katif is Mansur Pasha, the local representative of the Civil List. He is very rich, and Thalib Pasha soon saw in him a suitable subject for blackmail. Mansur, however, declined to accede to the Mutesarrif's^ exortion ; and fied to Basrah, and thgnce to Baghdad. Soon after, at the end of January Thalib Pasha made a descent on Mansur-'s house, and imprisoned his brother, Abdul'Hussam, carrying off property, including pearls, in which Mansur trades, to a very considerable amount. Mr. Gaskin, the British Agent in Bahrein, reports that on the 7th February three dhows loaded with loot arrived there in charge of Mahomed Attik, the Mutesarnf s confidential man, and I learn that these vessels subsequently came into the Shat-el-Arab and discharged their cargo at Seblieh, the Nakib's river-side residence about 15 miles from Basrah. To excuse his conduct, Thalib has forwarded to the Wali a bundle of ' seditious news papers' which, he asserted, had been found in Mansur's house, and also reported that a consi derable number of rifles had been seized at the same time. This latter statement is very likely correct, for all Arabs, particularly those who have valu ables, possess arms, and the circumstance has not the importance which might attach to it in other parts of Turkey. With regard to the newspapers, a strange light is thrown on the accusation by Mr. Gaskin's report, that on the 9th January Mahomed-bin Attik called on him and stated that Thakib Pasha was anxious to see some copies of Arabic newspapers from Egypt, Constantinople^ London, and Paris, and made special mention of the Khalifa which is published in London and asked for some copies. He was told that the British Agency did not receive any, but the inference obviously is that he was sent to collect such newspapers for subsequent discovery at Mansur^s house, Meanwhile, Mansur Pasha at Baghdad had interested the Mushir, who is also acting Wali, in his behalf. The Mushir communicated with the Wali and with Constantinople, and the Wali has telegraphed to the Minister of the of Interior requesting that a Special Commis sioner be sent to inquire, but has received no answer. He is much depressed at the idea of having to hold an inquiry himself, as this will, he considers, mean that he is to whitewash Thalib, and so disgrace himself. He told me he would rather resign; he believes the news papers were placed in the house by Thalib's orders, and expreses his astonishment that the British do not interfere on behalf of Mansur, as the latter traded with British Indian pearl merchants, to whom many of the pearls seized by the Mutesarraif belonged. This is, I believe, the case, but 1 have as yet received no complaints from British subjects. Mansur Pasha is a Shiah, which will tell in Thalib's favour at Constantinople but is likely to embitter local feeling at Katif, where the Shiahs are numerous and influential/^ [C967FD] E62 CHAPTER FIFTH. Survey of tlie Katif Coast) 1873-74. 248. In January 1873 the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, asked tor in- str actions with regard to the proposed survey Political a ., March 1873, Noi. 377 387. o £ ^ j^ ee f channels by the Officer Commanding H. M's Schooner Constance, Colonel Herbart, Political Resi dent, Baghdad, was therefore asked to ascertain from the Pasha whether there w r ereany objections to the proposed survey. The reply was that our Ambassa dor at Constantinople telegraphed to the effect that the Porte authorized the survey. The Pasha wished, however, that a Turkish corvette should accompany H M's Schooner. Colonel Boss did not think this necessary, but the Govern- ment directed (letter 24th March 1873) that the survey might proceed with or without a Turkish Corvette, and that if a Corvette wished to accompany the survey boat, no objection should be taken. 249. While the survey boat was proceeding to make the survey Colonel Koss instructed its Commander to comuni- Poiiticai a ., May 1873, noi. i95-20o. ca te to the Turkish local authorities at Katif the nature of his operations before landing to survey, and if any objection should be raised, to inform them that the operations were being un dertaken with the cognizance of the Porte. The Government of India approv ed of these instructions (Letter No. 986-P., dated 16th May 1873). 250. A complaint was then made by the Porte that the Survey Officers had landed on the Neid coast. When enqui- Political A., August 1873, Nos. 104-112, ^ ^ 0oloDel ftogs reported •that neither the surveying yessel nor any of her boats had come within 5 miles of the Nejd coast, that the survey had till then been confined to channels of approach to Bahrein, and that no attempt had yet been made to survey the coast of Katif or Nejd (Telegram of 31st July 1873). 251.

This request, the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, was desired to move the Ottoman Government to grant (Letter No. 2265-P., dated 23rd September 1873). 252.

In consequence of bad weather he had twice to put in for shelter under Rss Tanurah on the Katif coast, but apparently no protest was raised against his movements by the Turks,63 CHAPTER SIXTH. Increase of Turkish Military and Naval Forces in the Persian Gulf % and Turkish Policy. We have in our records of this time a memorandum of 29th November 1871 written by Captain T. Doughty on Secret, July 1872, Nos. 120—122. s ^ a tQ 0 f affairs in the Persian Gulf, and addressed to Rear Admiral H. Cookburn, which, would bear being quoted here; indicating as it does the forces in operation in connection with,the Persian Gulf politics:— «I have the honour to acknowledge your memorandum of October 25th, together with your private note of same date received by mail of yesterday, and thank you much for the pleasant commendation you have been pleased to express in regard to my movements and proceedings I had much pleasure also in conveying to Dr. Mulvancy your approval and thanks tor the ability and zeal he displayed in the discharge of his duties. You desire of me more details about the politics of the Gulf. While wishing to comply with your request, 1 feel and know that I have nothing to offer beyond my own views and deductions from the events taken place around m^ therefore hesitate to commit my.elf m an official despatch. My entire ignorance of the surrounding languages and natives, even ot their very history beyond wha'. little of late I have been able to gather trom the few hooks within my reach on the subject necessitates my requesting that whatever I may say on the subject of &lt;c Gulf politics' may be regarded only as they appear to me, and not othcially trust worthy, but rather Gossip founded on current reports and rumours. The Suez Canal, as you observe, ' has its shady side' and for the pTe-eminence we have held in the Gulf since the decline of the Portuguese power a very shady side, tor most ot nations of Europe, ' Persia, and Arabia ' could have little interest, but for Kussia on one sile of this Gulf and Turkey on the other there appears much attraction. The 1st Napoleon thought lfc ^jth his while to send an embassy to the Shah of Persia in the hope of outbidding us m the Shah s graces, and get him to make a diversion on onr Indian border, when Napoleon invaded JpT'- In latter years the Russians have been steadily at work along the northern border of Persia and Independent Tartary, till the Caspian may now be regarded as a Russian lake, their road is still eastward and southward, and their influence is said to be felt in Afghanistan. West ward they have made a prodigious stride, and gained a point which thousands of our country men gave their lives to maintain in 1851-55. These things are portentious Arabia is the birth-place of El-Islam, and when driven from Europe, what,country, in spite of its sterlity, could give the Turks so much influence or power of working on the sympathies of the Moslems of all shades whether Sonnee, Shyia, or fanatic Wahabees as holding ' ^al (or Riaz) the stronghold of the latter, and Mecca and Medina, and sacred centres of all other Moslem sects. Asiatic Turkey the Turks have, their dominion extending to the head of this Gulf with the great comiftercial towns of Bagdad and El Bashra. Till the Suez Canal became a working fact, the conquest of Arabia could have been, but a dream, the great desert tracts, the want of water, the distance from supplies, and the hostility of the tribes to all invaders, must have proved insurmountable difficulties, as they have always been, in all attempts at Arabian con quest. The Egyptians managed it for a time through clever working of the element of disunion among the independent tribes in their second attempt under Ibrahim Pasha 1826, (.) Ibrahim being a Viceroy of the Turk Sultan, consequently, the conquest of Arabia made Arabia or rather Nejd (the Wahabee territory in the centre), which was the object of the invasion, a fief of the Porte. The succession of monarchs in Nejd since that time would seem to be ' Abd'alla ' captured by Egyptians and beheaded at Constantinople ; Turkee, his son, who was in exile during the Egyptian occupation, recalled by the Nejedeans when in rebellion for the expulsion of the Egyptians ; he was assassinated in 1834 by a Persian, and was succeeded by the late great ahabee Chiei'tain, Easul, who died some two or three years ago; the two^ sons of '' Fasul, Abd'alla and Saood, are the two Chieftains now ia arms and fighting for the rule. ' Abd'alla bin fasul is the elder, but primogeniture has never been the law, so there is little in that argument as a matter of justice, but it affords an opening for Turk interference. The great difficulty of sending ships and supplies through the length of the Mediterranean and so down the west coast of Africa round the Cape to the Red Sea and Persian Gult (partially got over by the Alexandria rail to Suez, which enabled supplies to be sent for shipment at Suez in foreign bottoms and native craft) is now entirely got over by just steaming fromConstantinople through the Canal to any port they like in tlie Red Sea with troops on board, or march troops across to Bagdad and ships via Canal can, and have met them at El Basra with supplies ready to convey them, as in the present instance, to Katif, or for the invasion of any part the sea-board of Arabia. The Russians are generally supposed to be desirous of having Constantinople. Possibly the Turks may be aware, and our late policy wiih poL q ;^. t Trl^ i .'o. opi ' ion of ' ie '' pp08ea re s ard t0 tlie Treat y of 1855 ma y m » ke stm more assured that we and probably Western Europe will not be disposed again to figbt in their defence, and that, under these circumstances it is their duty to seek out among more friendly creeds a counterbalance in some sort for the loss she might singlehanded sustain against Russia. This view of the case seems strengthened by the fact that of late 'Turkey has much strengthened herself at Hodeidah and other ports m the Red Sea, assembling large bodies of troops^ under the never-failing excuse of keeping rebellious Arabs in subjection, the same policy seems to have been going on at Bagdad. Till at last off starts din army fully equipped from the shores of tbe Euphrates in Turk transports accompanied by mucb Mative craft, a squadron leaves Constantinople and appears unexpectedly in the Gulf supporting them, and I believe more troops have been sent to the Red Sea. Ostensibly the Sultan of Turke}' - , the Padishah,' ' the father of his people/' fegrets to see children in Arabia destroying themselves in interminable feuds, and that as the ' Nejedeans' in particular did not do him the honour of consulting him, as he holds they should have done about the succession to the Chieftainship, he proceeds to quiet the country, establish law and peace and to put Abdullah on the throne of his father. The Turk squadron in the mean time having landed the troops, employs its spare time in paying visits to the various ports on the coast, saluting their Sheikhs and disposing of small Turk ensigns for the country craft to display, explaining them the great advantages that may accrue to them in being under the protection of so great a Power, that a day may come when this ready acknowledgment may be remembered to their advantage, and that, for the present, the Turk flag will render them quite independent of any other interfering nations there may in the Gulf waters, etc. Russia, meanwhile, we will suppose, looks on with a complacent eye; it assists to divert attention from herself, while she possibly may make some bargain with Persia for a port upon the northern sea board of the Gulf. (Bunder Abbass would suit her well, it was for over a century held by the Seyyeds of Oman, then by the Dutch, Portuguese, and ourselves for a short time, so that parting with that port and district to a Persian mind would not be felt like the giving away of territory they have always held. It is conveniently situated with res pect to the Indian Ocean, with plenty of good anchorage between it and Hormuz, which island might again be made a stronghold and emporium as renowned as in times past). Besides con quests by Turkey out here might be calculated to gradually reconcile the Turkish mind to a migration across the Hellespont; the day is half won when your opponents begin to see matters in the same light as yourself. Russia has ports m the north of the China Sea and undoubtedly would like a port somewhere m these latitudes to rendezvous her ships in : now that they can pass from Sebas- topol down the coast of Syria to the Canal, and so on oat to India to our possessions, towards winch there seems much reason fot supposing her cupidity tends. I cannot help thinking that the sultan and Czar understand each other remarkably well, and that the Turks have been lelt on to sending a squadron of ships into these waters as a feeler just to see how far we shall take nohce, or object to this invasion of a sea in which for many years we have held undisputed we 1819 The Trucial Chiefs are some seven or eight Sheikhs of sea board towns with whom have made Treahes smce the reduction of the pirate stronghold of Ras-el-Kheimah in iy—that there shall be no more fighting at sea between them, no sending to sea of armed vessels, no interfering by one Chief with the pearl boats of another, and on our part we guarantee to protect them from molestation by sea from any other Arab tribe and to defend them by eea from invasion. It appears that Sheikh Mahomed bin Thoweynee of Bidda and I believe some others of t L i -T F Tlf an ' 1 ,™ r ' ortan 1 ee t' 0 , 1 Traoial Chets) have lately been persuaded hoist the l ^ f T as , ,'} , r,' y do eo ' ^ ' tral y you may be Sultan of the sea, but who wil defend us by laud; this is doubtless a pithy reply, but it is 'gall' to W Sl tl ^ aV1D ?,. , h , el r close fitting arrangements thus interfered with—men rnttwJrS 1 when with their squadron of Bombay ships their word was law, depos- ng th s jhief and setting up that. Such is much the ease with Bahrein. The present Sheikh Esau bm KhnlMfah a son of the late Sheikh, who was murdered a few years since. Colonel Pelly established I bel.eve fairly enough) in spite of opposition, and has maintained him in his authority, cutting off all opponents. The Turks much want Bahrein; it is the only well- watered and fruitful place along the whole Arab coast of the Gulf, and there is no doubt they will neglect no opportunity of coercing Sheikh Esau, or pretext for occupying the place. Consequently, Colonel Pelly watches jealously this point, and hones to meet Midhut Pasha65 • (Governor-General of Bagdad and of the Ottoman possessions hereabouts), of whom it is reported that he intends calling 1 in there and using his .influence in spite of the protestaton of the Porte to our Ambassador at Constantinople that the Trucial Chiefs (of which Esau-ibin Khuleefah is one) shall not be interfered with. To return to the shore, Ahd alia, after the fight with his brother Saood, (reported in a former letter) fled to the Turks, who were hU proclaimed allies, but latterly he seems to have distrusted them and has given them the slip, in the hope of uniting the Arab tribes in defence of their country agaitst the invading Heretics ' as they, being strict Wahabees regard the Turks. The idea evidently having forced itself on his mind that the Turks intend making a permanent settlement in the country, I cannot but regard as intentional a circumstance that occurred the other day. The Turk Commodore when he arrived at Bahrein hoisted the Turkish flag and saluted it with 21 guns. I regarded this as an act of sovemgnty. I distinctly saw that it was the Turkish fla?, and suggested to Colonel Pelly that the question should be askpd, u who the salute was intended for.' The Commodore explained that having no u Arab ' fla^ on board he had used his own, being the nearest in appearance to it, and that the salute was in honor of the Arab forts. This explanation could not well be taken exception with but it shows there is a tendency to assert the Otttoman authority in these waters,—who ever 'thouo-ht of saluting an Arab mud fort half ruined with 21 guns ; five guns is the usual Arab salute— three guns for smaller Chiefs. The belligerents before the Turks appeared on the scene were represented by the brothers Ahd'alla and Saood, sons of the late Chief Fasul'—the independent tribes siding Vith one brother or the other, they fought for the Chieftainship with varied success. The Wahabee territory is a considerable portion of Central Arabia called ' Nejid properly speak ing they have no sea-board. Yet the province of Hassa with the sea ports ot Katiff and Ojair, such as they are (you can hardly get within sight of them,too shoal) acknowledged their sway till the Turks came. A true Arab, it would seem, loves war for its own sake. There are of course, many commercial and trading Arabs especially the coast inhabitants, but the nobler tribes hold them in contempt. Saif-bin-Ali, I can fancy, expressed but the feelings of himself and his people without exagoeration when at a protracted war council he cut all argu ment short by saying—'Blood is man's only dye, and war like the manna and quails is as • 'Imams and SyedB of Oman/'by G. P. Badger, U +C\ 1 wT ^ ^ With F. R. C. S. respect to the W ahabees, there may be some amount of personal feeling. The Turks undoubtedly feel they have a score to settle with them. The Wahabees (I think under Abd'alla ereat- grandfather of the present man, at the beginning of this century, but I have no books 'to refer to. I have only at various times been able to peep into books, which 1 have been oblio-ed to return, and trust to memory, which I find has not improved under the boiling process of the last year) captured ' Mecca,' plundered the pilgrims, its inhabitants and its mosque and defiled the sacred ^Cauba,' plundered and turned back the caravan of the then reigning Sultan of Turkey's sister who was making the sacred pilgrimage. The Wahabees hate pilgrimages and don't rospect Mecca. Mr. Palgrave, in his Central and Eastern Arabia/' describes them as Puritans that move about with a sanctimonn us face and demeanour, allowing of neither smoking, laughing, drinking of wine, or silk thread m the ornamentation of their garments, whose only source of lawful enjoyment and recreations must be found in women, fighting, and praying.

It will never be done if we put off till some other European Power has established itself in the Gulf. 257 About the close of the year 1871, there were rumours that in addition x ' to the Lebanon and Iskandena several Secret, April 1872, Nos. 99-103. more Turkish vessels would be stationed nu the Persian Gulf. Her Majesty's Charge at Constantinople was directed tcfmake the necessary enquiries from Server Pasha. The answer of Server Pasha was that he was not aware of any such intention. He however added that « Bussrah has always been, and still is a Turkish Naval station, that the number of steamers actually employed on the Arabian Coast is seven, two of which are, at this moment, rWrpr^irin a dock belonffinff to the Indian Government, which has been pleased to afford every facility for that purpose and has acquired by this obliging conduct the gratitude of t e Ottoman Government.' 258 * Her Maiesty's Government at last directed their Ambassador at Constantinople to make a representation to sccret.September 1871, Nos. 20-28. ^ Porte in regard to the Turkish pro ceedings in the Persian Gulf, in the foreign Secretary's Despatch No. 20, dated 6th June 1872, which is quoted below : — '* I have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the Government of India respecting the proceedings of the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf, more especially with reference to the increase which the Porte has recently made in the number of vessels employed in those waters. Her Maiesty's Government, however, consider that as long as Turkey is engaged m Us Witimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ask it to curtail the means which r/contiders necessary for doing so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and ^ t w n o attempt will be made to extend that authority, which would raise questions between the Indian Government and the Porte, the maintenaoce of the existing state of things t e r 3 and on its borders being considered a matter of great importance to the gene al SaMuillity of those quarters; and That the presence of large Tnrkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause the British Govern- ment to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mmd.6S If the presence o£ an excessive Turkish force requires the Indian Government to increase the British force in the Gulf, the Native mind will see in the latter an encouragement, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bad to worse, till at last, even in the admitted Turkish districts, a general feeling of uneasinefs will be produced, and will cost the Porte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth. I have, therefore, to instruct Your Lordship, while expressing to the Porte the views of Her Majesty's Government on this point, to state that they will gladly use their good offices to restore peace and bring matters to a normal state of tranquillity/' 259. The British Ambassador reported the action taken by him in his des patch No. 61, dated 23rd June 1872 :— ' I communicated to Server Pasha Your Lordship's despatch, No. 20, of the 6th instant, and pointed out to him how important it was that the Porte should not go on increasing its armaments in the Persian Gulf, so as to disquiet the neighbouring countries, and to oblige Her Majesty's Government to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. Server Pasha repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all intention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts, where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government mi^ht be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha, there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations. 'With regard to the presence of a large Turkish force in the Persian Gulf, His Excellency thought Her Majesty's Government must be under some misapprehension it being in reality of very insignificant proportions, amounting in all to four ships-ot-war, of which two are ordered to Constantinople to refit. The other vessels are hired transports, that had been taken up for the conveyance of the troops sent to the Nejd. Server Pasha showed himself very sensible of the indisposition evinced by Her Majesty's Government to embarrass the position of affairs in the Gulf by sending a counteracting force • and I pointed out that, if he wished this forbearance to continue, the Porte must give evidence of an intention of allowing things there to resume their normal state. I did not, however, elicit from him any intimation of a willingness to accept the preferred good offices of Her Majesty's Government in restoring peace, but I will revert to the question when His Excellency has had the opportunity of mentioning it to the Grand Vizier, without whose sanction he is cautious of expressing any opinion on a matter of importance.' 260.

Sir 0 Conor, however, thought it probable that the officials would be found incapable and certain that their salaries would be unpaid.73 CHAPTER SEVENTH.

If there is one fact more than another to prove the advantages India has derived from the British connection Ristory of the trade. w ith the Persian Gulf, it is the blessing of free and unrestricted commerce, which Indian merchants have enjoyed with Katif for nearly half a century, to be interrupted only by the extension of Turkish .c ™ n 1 • . a f ri o ri a /loos influence to that quarter. Their* business •See Mr. Gaskin's report, dated 2nd August 1903— ^ n • i. v.t Proceeding No. 4 in External A., January 1904, relations With Katlf Were Iirst establlSned 3 - 4 - in the year 1864i by a wealthy Kutchi, named Kalungi, who carried on a general trade for twelve years on his own behalf as well as other Hindu trading houses. In 1866 another enterprising Hindu named Telandas Khubchand with a staff of six assistants established a house of business, and two years later he took a partner named Sandal bin Kisu into the business. This firm appears to have carried on a large trade till 1876, when it had to withdraw from Katif owing to the incurrence of heavy losses through the bankruptcy of many of their leading native clients brought about by the total failure of the Indian pearl market. The large firm of Assanmul Anadram &amp; Co. opened a branch office at Katif also in 1866 and con tinued to do business there for about 18 years, first the agency of Mulchand Jairamdas and latterly under that of Sandal bin Kisu. Messrs. Gangaram Tikamdas &amp; Co. in 1880 sent three brothers named Tarachand, Darsingh, and Tekchand Dwarkadas to conduct business for them, and another capitalist named Damanmal Lalchand established himself there till his death 3 years later. The former firm, however, kept up its trnde there till 1895 when Tekchand was mutilated by the notorious pirate Ahmed bin Selman on the high sea. Besides the big firms mentioned, a number of petty Hindu traders visited Katif periodically and at one time it is said they numbered about sfxty persons. 274. It has not been possible to ascertain definitely the aggregate amount of capital employed by the Hindu firms in the Katif trade, but at one time it must have been considerable owing to the fact that, prior to the Turkish occupa tion of the port and for a few years subsequent to that event, they controlled the greater portion of the trade which was principally in rice, cotton goods, sugar, coffee, spices, metals, and hardware imported from India* via Bahrein, and pearls, dates and hides exported to the same country. During the five years ending in 1895 their trade with Katif, when about a third of the former number of traders of their community shared in it, the value of the merchandise bought and sold by them was between seven and eight lacs of rupees annually, and judging from these figures, the volume of trade carried on by them when their prospects were better may be considered to have been about fifteen lacs of rupees annually without risks of over-estimation. 275. The causes which led to the withdrawal of the Hindus from Katif date from about three or four years after the establishment of a Turkish Custom House in the port wi h a system of farming the revenues, which obtains to the present day. The farmers of the Customs to meet the exactions of the Turkish officials gradually and illegally increased the duty from 1 per cent, to 6 per cent, on the Hindu merchandise, which placed them at a great disadvantage in competing with' the more fortunate native traders whose local influence obtained for them better treatment. The unprotected condition of the Hindus exposed them to the avarice of the petty Turkish officials, who at the instigation of wealthy Katif merchants in most instances put such obstacles in their way, as the delay of weighment of dates for purposes of ascertaining the amount of duty payable, the prohibition of donkeys transporting the merchant- dise to the boats for shipment, detaining Indian sailing craft in quarantine for [C967FD] V74 unreasonable periods, though they may have been over two months out from India, and paying no attention to claims filed by them for debts recoverable from Turkish subjects. 276. The unsettled condition of the Katif district since 1885, and the attempt made on the high sea by the pirate Ahmed bin Selman in the same year to murder Tikamdas Dwarkadas who escaped with the loss of his right hand and Rs. 40,000 worth of pearls, further discouraged them from continuing their residence in that district and obliged them to carry on .their business transactions through local merchants who did not always look after the interests of their principals, and finally Messrs. Gungaram Tikamdas three years ago made another attempt to establish themselves there and sent across one of their Mahomedan employes named Haji Jima bin Naser, who was repelled by the Turkish officials, and from that date the Hindis practically suspended direct trade with Katif. 277. We shall also note below a few specific complaints of Indian and Bahreinese traders which were brought to the notice of Government. 278 In January 1884 a complaint was made by a Nakoda of a native , 7 „ vessel Mubarak owned by a British Indian Impressment of a British Indian vessel oy Tur- ■, * ,. hish authorities at Katif, 1884. trader tor forcibly compelling him to Ext e r n aiA ) -- o c t ober 1884, N qs. 434—44°. convey Turkish soldiers from Katif to March 1895, Nos , 159—166. r\* • k . w ii ji Ojair. A note veraole was addressed by the British Ambassador to the Porte requesting that a suitable indemnity might be paid to the Captain of the ship and that orders might be sent to the Turkish authorities at Basrah not to impress vessels flying the British Flag. A copy of this note was sent by Assim P^tsha to the Vali at Baghdad, and Mr. Plowden was asked to do his utmost to have the question settled. In reply to an enquiry by Mr. Plowden, Colonel Boss fixed a sum of Bs. 50 as a reasonable compensa- tiou. 279. In January 1893 the Chief of Bahrein complained to us regarding the T „ . , , .. .. . t &gt; t . * l ev y P or t dues and capitation tax on Levy of port dues and capitation tax on Bahrein t-&gt; i • i i i i • .« loatsand subjects at Katif. iialirem boats and their crews at Katif. external a, march 1893,Noa. 108— 113. Political Resident reported, however, (Letter No. 32, dated the 15th February 1893):— ' The fees referred to are levied on all vessels alike and not on Bahrein boats in particular. The port of Katif is under Turkish suzerainty, and therefore no legitimate grounds for our interference in the matter would appear to exist. The Chief of Bahrein accordingly been informed that^ it would not be possible to address the Ottoman Government upon the subject, but that if, owing to the levy of ports dues or other fees by the Turkish authorities, the voyage to Katif is no, longer profitable, the boat owners can legitimately raise their present rates of freight to Turkish ports. I have also communicated with the Resident in Turkish Arabia, in the above sense. 280. The Indian merchants also complained of the excess of export Non-refund of excess export duties levied, duties levied on them at one time.

Of this 8 per cent. 7 per cent, are to be returned on production, within 121 days, of certificates showing that the goods m question have really reached Indian ports. Though this is the rule, British Indian traders from Bahrein had, for a long time, been exporting dates to India from Katif without knowing that they were entitled to a refund, the Refunded authorities keeping the 7 percent, which they should have 280-A. Though the matter was first brought to the notice of this Eesidencv many years back, it does not appear to have been taken up strongly till 1895 when the traders petitioned, and a protracted correspondence was coramanced75 tbrougli tlie Britisli authorities in Turkish Arabia. The result of our representa* tions was that we at last, obtained a refund of the excess duty paid on all consignments in for wbicb certificates could be procured, and we were able to handover Rs. 5,012-9-0 to the British Indian traders at Bahrein, who had established their claims to our satisfaction. The amount was divided rate- ably among them, and the sum given in each case was gladly accepted, a receipt * being obtained from each individual. 281. In August 1900. the Assistant Political Agent, Bahrein, reported that a*i India* Cornel Interest, at ^ deputation of local Hindu banias had Katif. Proposal to Appoint the Assistant Poiiti- represented to him, that from time imme- morial. members of their community had External a., August 1901, No. 419. carried on a trade with Katif, and that in later years such obstacles had been thrown in their way, that for three years they had abandoned visiting the port. Their grievance was that certain native merchants at Katif, who had seats in the local Government Council, took advantage of their position and used their influence with the customs authorities to delay passing the banias' merchandise for export until after their own had left the port, so as to have the advantage of being the first to arrive at the market of destination and thereby securing the higher price. 282. There is a large export trade of boiled dates from Katif to Karachi, Eaten..! a, a-gurt 1981, no. 419. amounting to about 150,000 bags annually, besides a lars^e import of rice and other goods from India via Bahrein. Katif is also the market for pearls procured by the Koweit pearling fleet. The banias offered to pay the expenses, if a native agent was appointed by Government at Katif to look after their interests. Mr. Gaskin finally suggested that he should visit the Kaitnakam of Katif to arrange matters. 283. In reporting the matter to the Government of India the Political Resi- external a , ja.u.rj i90x, No. 419. 'Jent in the Persian Gulf intimated that he did not propose to take any official action and that he had told Mr. Gaskin to let the matter drop. 184. -In 1901, the Consul at Basrah made representations to the Wali of Secret E., October 1901, N« 8 .340-841. ^ P laCe ' aI1&lt;i the latter Undertook to send such instructions (through the Mutessarif of El Hassa) to the Kaimakam of Katif as would remove the disabilities under which Bahrein banias trading at Katif laboured. The Consul at the same time suggested that Mr. Gaskin should be made Vice-Consul for Katif, as there was a doubt whether the Turks would agree to the appointment of a native agent, 285. No action was talsen by the Government of India, but it was noted in this department that if it turned out that the Wali's instructions to the Kaima kam of Katif had been without effect, the Basrah Consul's suggestion would seem well worthy of consideration. 286. In July 1903, Colonel Kemball stated that he did not put much faith External A., January 1904, Nos. 8 -4. (Pro. No. in the professions of the Mutessarif of El 3) _ Hasa, and doubted if he had the power to support the banias against the oppression of their Mahomedan rivals at Katif. 287. Later in August, Mr. Gaskin submitted a report on the question of External A.. January 1904, Nos. s -4. re-opening trade relation with Katif by the Hindu traders of Bahrein, and furnish ed information regarding their former commercial operations and the disabilities under which they suffered there. 288. In submitting this to the Government of India, Colonel Kemball gave Extern.-, a., January 1904, No,. 3-4. (Pro. No. 4). it ^ 1118 op™ 011 that a fair case had been made out for requiring the establishment of a Consular officer at Katif to look after the interests of the Hindu traders.76 289 No action was taken by the Government of India, but the case was dis cussed personally by Secretary with Colonel Kemball, during His Excellency the Viceroy's recent tour in the Persian Gulf, and the ^ Bahremese traders were told by Secretary that the question was under consideration pending decision about raising status of Bahrein Agency and Vice-Consulate for Katif and Ojair. 290. A recent complaint was made by Tekchand Dwarkadas, a Cutchi merchant (referred to in paragraph 273) Section E, May 1904, Nos. 6—7. ^ cus toms farmer demanded a duty of 12 per cent, on the date exported from Katif to Cutch. Under the Commer cial agreement between Turkey and Parsia dated 6th September 1903, the 12 per cent, export duty on goods destined for Persia was abolished, and under the arrangements existing before the treaty, a refund of 11 per cent, would have been made on the dates exported to British Indian ports, but in the case of dates exported to Cutch ports the full 12 per cent, duty would have been levied and no rebate made. Now that the treaty referred to has abolished the 12 per cent, duties, there was, in the opinion of Colonel Kemball no longer any reason for claiming the deposit in the case of the goods sent out to India and elsewhere, Colonel Kemball, however, thought that little good would result from attempting to obtain a refund of the over charges made, but if it were decided to appoint a Consular representative at Katif, a good case would have made out for such a step. 291. The question then of appointing a Consular ofi&amp;cer at Katif was dis cussed in the Foreign Department, and the following despatch addressed to the Secretary of State (No. 3, dated the 31st March ^.801): No. 74 Secret E., dated Fort William, tlie Slst Marcli 1904. Jrom—The Government of Indiai Foreign Department. To—The Right Hoa'ble St. John Bbodbick , His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. ' We have the honour to forward, for rour information, copies of the rorrespondet.ce noted in the schedule annexed, regarding our commercial interests at Katif. Prior to the Ottcmaa occupation of El Hassa, a flourishing settlement of Indian traders carried on business at this port. In 1874 the place became the head-quarters^ of a Turkish Kaimmakam ; a Customs House was instituted ; and official regulations have since been so used, or rather abused, as to destroy the British trade which had previously been established. An export duty of 1 per cent, has practically been converted into one of 8 per cent, by the demand that a deposit of this amount should be made on the value of all dates exported. This exaction was ostensibly intend ed to prevent the diversion of cargo to the Persian coast, exports to which were previously chargeable with a duty calculated at that rate. Every possible difficulty appears, however, to have been placed in the way of obtaining a refund even on proof of the goods having reached a British destination. Remonstrances have from time to time been lodged with the responsible Turkish officials. In 1899 Colonel Meade, our Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, reported that, as the result of a protracted correspondence, the refund had been procured of a sum of Rs. 5,012-9-0, out of a total amounting apparently to some Rs. 15,000, which certain traders had been required to deposit in accordance with the practice which we have noticed. But the abuse has not been checked. 2. Other complaints which have been received have charged the local officials with deliberately hampering Indian traders by delays in Custom-hous« formalities, by prohibition of the supply of transport, and by the use of quarantine regulations as a pretext for the detention of Indian craft which had been clear of infected ports for periods entitling them to exemption from restraint even under the most rigid sanitary rules, in 1900, Colonel Meade's successor forwarded correspondence which showed that the bania community at Katif had been reduced from one of 70 or 80 persons to a single trader, and that a party of those were still desirous of carrying on business at the port had furnished the clearest evidence of the harassment to which they had been subjected by expressing their willingness to pay in advance the cost of maintaining a British Agent to protect their interests on the spot. In view of the antagonism with the Turks into which we had been brought in other parts of the Gulf, we deemed it inadvisable at the time to propose an attempt to obtain the recognition by the Porte of a British representative at Katif. His Britannic Majesty's Consul, however, brought the complaints which had been made to the notice of the Wali of Basrah, who undertook to issue instructions to the Kaimmakam to remove the disabilities under which British traders laboured. Later reports show that these representations have been ineffectual. In 1903 we were informed that our traders still found difficulty in obtaining refunds of deposits, and we have recently heard that illegal dues are still exacted in spite of the exemption of exports to Persia from the duty which previously formed the pretext for such demands. The majority of the sufferers77 • sailed straight for their destination as soon as they had cleared their cargoes, and precise figures are oot, thereforp, available, but it is stated that a sum of about Rs. 25,000 was wrongfully extorted from British traders in respect of dates shipped during the season of 1903. Daring the Viceroy's recent tour in the Persian Gulf the British Indian merchants of Bahrein renewed, in a petition to His Excellency, their request for the appointment of a British representative to protect their interests at Katif. 3. We think that a good case has been made out for such a step, the simplest form of which would probably be to appoint our Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein Vice-Consul for El Hassa, and to station a native Consular Agent at Katif. Should His Majesty's Govern ment be unwilling to take action on this sense, we can only suggest that a clear statement should be made to the Porte of the disabilities to which our traders have been subjected in order that measures may be taken for their mitigation or removal. But our experience of Turkish official action in those parts does not lead us to place any confidence in the results of such a representation.' [c967ed]78 chapter eighth- 'piracies. (I) Piracies in theKatif and Bahrein waters, 1878. 292. The seas between the island of Bahrein and the coasts of Katif and Katar haye for long been the scenes of piracies of Beni Hajir and other mar auding Bedouin tribes of Arabia. We have noticed the depredations commit ted by the Beni Hajirs (ooted in the Katar Precis and also the Bahrein Precis), since the occupation of the Katif district by the Turks in 1871. In 1878 the Bedouin tribes gave a fuller rein to their marauding habits in the Katif waters and the security of the Gulf became so endangered, that the British Gov ernment had to make up their mind either to hold the Turkish Govern ment responsible for the piracies, or to proceed on their own account to put a stop to a intolerable state of things. We now enter into an important epoch in the political history of the Persian Gulf, and no apology is needed for going minutely into the piratical acts in the Katif waters reported siuco 1878, and the questions as to the responsibility for order raised thereby.* 293. On the 20th September Colonel Ross telegraphed that the Beni Haiir had seized and plundered some Political a., November 1878, No. 108. Persian vessels off Sheikh Shaab, an island on the Persian coast of the Gulf, and wounded two men. The same gang had also plundered another vessel, nationality unknown, carrying off Rs. 10,000 in cash and murdering the Nakoda. They had then re-landed on the Katar Coast, and Colonel Ross suggested that the Ottoman Government should be addressed regarding their proceedings. He then drew attention to Zobarah, a port on the mainland opposite Bahrein, the Chief of which was said to be implicated, and enquired whether there was any objection to his dealing direct with that place and using coercive measures if necessary. Turkish rule, he said, had never been asserted there, and the claim of Bahrein to exercise authority had been disallowed by the Government of India. 294. On the 21th the Resident telegraphed again reportins: the result of inquiries made by Her Majesty's Ship Political a., November 1878, No. 112. Vulture. It appeared that responsibility for the outrages complained of rested partly with the Turkish districts of Katif and Bidaa, but in a greater degree with Zobarah, whence two vessels had been despatched under the Chief's son to attack a passing boat belonging to Katar. The Chief of Bahrein had also incurred serious culpability by re ceiving the Chief of Zobarah and his son as guests and by other acts. Speedy and severe punishment of Zobarah seemed to Colonel Ross the first measure requisite; the Turks would not, he thought, be able to co-operate inasmuch as they were fully occupied in dealing with the Wahabis. XT 295. On the 5th October the Govern- Folitieal A., November 1878. No. 116. of telegraphed to the Eesideilt as follows:— ' Your te'egrams, 20tli and 24th September. Place before Turkish Governor full proofs against Zobavah, and ask f.&gt;r punishment, offering naral assistance if required. If Governor refuse to set, report detailed measures you recommeud. With regaid Bahrein, satisfy yourself as to facts, and report proposals. In regard to Residen'y steamer, arrange to use war vessels, which will be reinforced if possible. You are authorized to use force to stop any future piracies by sea.' , xt 296. In a letter of the same date these Political A.. November 1878, No. 116. . . ,. tq i p 11 instructions were amplified as follows :— ' In reply, I am to say that, while tbe Government of India will not permit the mari time peace of the Persian (^ulf to be disturbed by expeditions, even though they proceed from ports actually in Turkish posspssion, they consider that, before any steps are taken to lling Zobarah to account, the Turkish local authorities should be nommunicated with. You are, therefore, directed to placp in the hands of the Turkish Governor the report of the Officer Commanding Her Majesty's Ship Vulture, as well as any other evidence showing that Zuba- rah is guilty. You should demand that Zobarah be properly punished and should offer any naval assistance that it may be in your power to give. If the Turkish authorities decline to • It may be mentioned here that the first three sections of this chapter are mainly indebted to Mr. Plowdeu'a and other notes in the Foreign Departmeut.79 take any steps, you are to report tlie fact to the Government of India, with a detailed des cription of the measures you would propose to take. Should any further outrages take place by sea, you are authorized to punish the offenders at once, whatever may be their nationality. «In respect to Bahrein, I am to request that you will satisfy yourself of the degree of blame attaching to the Chief, and that you will report for sanction the punitive measures which you propose to take. ' 297. On the l7tli October the Kesident applied for further instructions on certain points connected with his re- poiittcai a ., December 1878, No. 4. ference to the iTurkish authorities. He was told in reply (dated 12th October) that it was intended that he should address the Governor of Basrah, to whom, within reasonable limits, the nature, ex tent and time of punishment should be left. British naval assistance was only to be granted on condition that the Turks employed regular forces. Ibe Bedouins were not to he interfered with by land, but authority was given to suppress piracy by sea. 298. On the 21st October Colonel Ross reported that the Vulture bad captured 15 piratical dhows off Katif Political A., December 1878. No. 6. ^ surreiic lered them to the Turkish GoV- ernor. Three other dhows and four boats had been captured from the Beni Hajir south of Katif, two of them being Bahrein vessels. The Resident's proceedings were approved and a full report called for. • 299. On the Slst October the Resident telegraphed further about Zobarab. He had personally laid before the Gov- Political A., December 1878, No. 23. o{ 3^^ the evidence against that place. The Governor had undertaken its punishment, but desired first to verify proofs by independent evidence. Colonel Ross had offered naval assistance, but the Governor evidently was not desirous to avail himself of the offer ; at the same time he promised to repress and punish offenders elsewhere. Colonel Ross also informed the Governor of the operations of the Vulture noted in the preceding paragraph and showed him the Governor of Katii's written acknowledgment for the captured vessels. These communications were received with attention and apparently in a friendly spirit. In reply, the Govern ment of India instructed Colonel Ross to report the measures taken by the Turkish authorities for the punishment of Zobarab, or, if they refused, to ask their reasons for holding back. 300. On the 16th November. Colonel Ross telegraphed that the Command er of Her Majesty's S. Arab at Bahrein Political a ., December 1878, No. 48. ^rote that he had received a report of the capture of Zobarah by the Sheikh of Bid;ia and the Bahrein refugee Nasir bin Mobarik at the head of a large force of Bedouins. There were fears of an attack on Bahrein, whither Colonel Ross was proceeding in Her Majesty'^ S. Teazer. The Government of India approved this visit, and desired Colonel Ross to keep Bahrein to its treaty obligations; he was again authorized to preserve the maritime peace of the Gulf, and desired to abstain from interference with land operations. He was also asked for informatioli as Political a .. December 1878, No. 4P, to the position of Zobarah towards the » .» si. Turkish Government. He replied on the 22nd confirming the attack upon Zobarah which had been entirely destroyed with the exception of an outlying fort called Moreyr, in which the Nairn in habitants were closely besieged. The attack was said to be in retaliation for piracies and raids upon Bidaa and had not been ordered by the Turkish Gov ernor of Basrah. The Bahrein people were alarmed, but Colonel Ross had notified that any attempt on Bahrein would be forcibly repelled by the British ships, and precautionary measures to this end had been takeA. The Turkish Governor of Basrah had also sent to warn Bidaa against attacking Bahrein. Colonel Koss had nor interfered with land operations. With regard to Zobarah, the Residen observed as follows ;— '* About po-ition Zoha^ah towards Turks —Hitherto no. relations existed as Bahrein claims over Zobarah were disallowed by Government of India in 1874; and Government80 would, I suppose, uot oppose establishment o£ Turkish authority on that part of Guttur coast. Present circumstances will probably lead to that measure. Viewing from all points this seems best and calculated to terminate frequent recurrence of panics at Bahrein. Chief of Bahrein concurs in this view. I think further interference unnecessary regarding punishment of Zoba- rah, as ample retribution has befallen the place.' 301. Hitherto was narrated the coarse of events in regard to Zobarah as From Resident, Per.i .E odf, No. 245, d.ted4ft shown b y the telegraphic correspondence. November 1878. It is necessary now to notice the detailed Political A.. January 1879, No. iM. reports. The first of these relates the facts on which the Eesiaent's telegram, dated 31st October, referred to in paragraph 299 of this note, was based. 302. Polio wing the instructions of the Government of India, Colonel Boss started for Basrah on the 22nd October, having first obtained from Colonel Nixon an introductory letter to the 'Wali. He also ordered the Vulture which had just returned to Bushire after capturing the dhows off Katif, as related in paragraph 298 of this note, to accompany him to Basrah to explain matters if need should arise. Colonel Ross was courteously received by the Pasha, exchanged visits with him, and discussed the Zobarah affair. On this point there is nothing to add to the summary in paragraph 299 of this note which narrates with sufficient fulness what passed at their interviews. Colonel Ross, however, adds the following remarks:— ' The Wali was, I think, at first rather suspicious of some other object being covered by my communications about piracies. I endeavoured to remove any such impression by describing to His Excellency the importance attached by the British Government to the security of these seas, which has been attained by so great an expenditure of labor and treasure, and explaining how recurrence of instances of plunder and murder, unimportant as they might seem in themselves, would, if unchecked and unpunished, soon destroy, the fruits of the labor of so many years. ' Abdulla Pasha is known to be a religious fanatic, and he somewhat openly gives vent to anti-English sentiments. Mr. Robertson informed me that in consequence he found himself much cut off from the friendly intercourse which he used to have with persons of good social position in Basrah, The state of feeling seems unfortunate at present so much so that I feel it a duty to Government to mention the matter. ' Most well-informed persons seem to agree that the one person competent to maintain the province of Nejd in good order and subjection for the Turkish Government is Nasir Pasha of the Montefik tribe, now at Constantinople. It is thought also that he would be well disposed towards British interests, especially if British influence should contribute to his re appointment to the Basrah Pashalik. 303. The next report deals with the circumstances summarized in From Resident, Persian Gulf, No. 258, dated 26tli P ar ^gy a P^ above 300 With the attack November 1878. on Zobarah by the Shiekh of Bidaa and Political A., January 1879, No. 238. Nasir bin Mubarik. 804 On hearing of this fresh complication Colonel Eoss proceeded to Bahrein, where he arrived on the 17th November. He found the 4rad anchored there, whose Commander, Captain Dicken, had taken suitable pre cautionary measures. The Chief of Bahrein, Sheikh Esau, came on board the Teazer and pressed for some action in favour of Zobarah ; he also asked to accompany Colonel Eoss in his visit to that place. He urged that if Zob arah were occupied by his enemies (the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Moba- rik), Bahrein would incur constant danger, and be exposed to sudden attacks. Further that his failure to aid the Nairn people would turn them into enemies. Colonel Eoss declined these requests, and directed the Chief to abstain from all interference in Zobarah affairs, a decision which greatly dissatisfied him. 305. Colonel Eoss then proceeded to Zobarah and found the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Mobarik arranged against Moreyr. He writes— On ' the 18th, Captain Wodehonse took me round in the Teazer to Zobarah, where he and I landed and visited the camp of Jasim bin Mahomed Thanee, the El-Bida Sheikh. He81 appeared to have about 2,000 armed men under liim, and was pitclaed about balf a mile from the square fort of Moreyr, in which the Naeem inhabitants of Zobarah to the number of perhaps 500 were besieged. There seems to have been no Hghting as the Naeem were much out-numbered. Tbe Bahrein refugee, Nasir bin Mubarick, was somewTiere in the vicinity with another band of Bedouins, but his camp was not visible. The town of Zobarah, which appears to have been a la^ge place at some timpj was entirely in ruins. The fort called Moreyr is about a mile from the town and inland. No boats were left at Zobarah, and it was report* ed a few had been burnt. ' 306. Here it may be noted that before leaving Bushire Colonel Eoss telegraphed to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia j^nd to Mr. Hobertson at Basrah with the object of acquainting Abdullah Pasha with what had occured and so affording him an opportunity of taking prompt and. effectual action. On returning to Bahrein on the 19th November, Colonel Ross found the following telegram from the Turkish Governor awaiting his arrival, with a request that it might be forwarded to the Kaimakan at Katif ' Jasim bin Mahomed bin Thani, Chief of Bidaa, with Nasir bin Mubarick, who had been expelled from Baherin, having with some troops attacked Zobarah, a dependency of Guttur, it appears they will attack Bahrein also. Though in the event of their attack on _ Bahrein, those who are in the latter place will prevent them, still the movement involves difficulties. Thus has the matter been intimated by Her Britannic Majesty's Consul General in Bushire, who himself will also proceed to Bahrein. If this circumstance be correct, it will never be toler ated (lit. rendered passable), though security and peace be extremely desirable and necessary in those parts. You ought instantly to send steampship I&amp;kendena with some troops to Zobarah to warn and caution the Chief of Bidaa agaiost such movements, and preserving those parts from being prevailed over by the insurgents. You will endeavour your utmost in pacifying and keeping the same secure, and report your action with the result thereof to me. 3 307. Colonel Ross delivered the message to the Commander of the Turkish gun-boat Jskanderia which he found anchored at Ras Tanoorah, and promised to report the action taken by the Turkish local authorities as soon as known. Colonel Ross concluded his letter by recommending the establishment of a Turkish post at Zobarah or in its vicinity as the best means of preserving permanent tranquillity. The Chief of Bahrein had intimated his acquiesc ence in this view. 308. The piracies committed by the Beni Hajir and others, which were reported in various letters and telegrams from Colonel Ross, do not, for the most part require a detailed notice. A complete list of them will be found in the tabular statement appended to this note. It appears that Zahran, a hill twenty miles south of Katif^ and Zobarah have an evil notoriety as the prin ciple places of resort for the piratical tribes. 309. There are, however, two sets of piracies included in this list which • cannot be passed over without remark, daied 24tj Sepiember. (Political The first set is dealt with in the letters, November 1878, No. 11 Z.J -i • ji • j , , Letter No. 205, dated aist September. (Political &amp;c., cited m the margin, and are to be b, July 1879, No. 66.) noted, because the Chief of Bahrein and l ' ,vember - (i ' oli ' ic,ll his subjects were implicated. Inquiries made by Captain Jauncy of the Vulture gave the following result:— u ' (1.) On the 4th September, a boat belonging to Katur was boarded at sea near jZobarah by Mohamed bin Rashi bin Jubba, son of the Chief o£ that place. Three persons were killed and five wounded, and property plundered to the value of upwards of 700 dollars. The Chief of Zobarah watched the outrage from From Resident Persian Gulf, No. 2^, dated the top of his fort and rebuked his son for not 3rd November. (Political A. January 18/9, No. • i -n i ^ i i , j i i ,1 i 186 j having killed the whole party and burnt the boat instead of bringing on shore witnesses to the deed. The Chief of Bahrein entertained the Sheikh of Zobarah and his son after the affair. ' * (2.) On the 2nd of September, two boats with 50 armed men sailed from Bahrein for a cruize round the island. Leaving their territorial waters they proceeded to Zahran oa the mainland, quarrelled with some Bedouins and seized a boat. The Chief's excuse was that the boats had gone over to Zahran without his orders. Captain Jauncy informed him that he was responsible for the acts of his followers, and the Chief has promised to produce the three leaders in the affair if called upon. [C967PD] V82 11 &lt; (3.) On tTie 4th September, ^batil named Amorfuk, a boat named Salmah, belong ing to the Bazaar Master, and a small palling' boat, manned by about one hundred and fifty men, having on board Ali bin Esa bin Tarif, Sayid bin Ahmed (Bazaar Master), and Sultan bin Salama, left Bahrein in the morning by the Sheikh's orders to cruize to Fasht DibaL Arriving there, they proceeded on to Bas Rekhan, where they met two boats belonging to natives of Oman. They hailed them to anchor, but the boats refusing to dp so, the Bahrein boats fired at them, alleging as an excuse for doing so that they thought they belonged to the Beni Hajir tribe. One man in one of the boats was shot through the arm. The boats then stopped, and on the Bahrein boats coming up with them they found that they belonged^ to the tribe of Zaid bin Kalifa (of Abuthabi). Here again the Sheikh's excuse^ was that his men bad disobeyed orders. He ha^greed to produce the leaders if necessary.' 310. Jn the letter cited on the margin, Colonel Ross reported tke measures taken to punish these offences. The No. 244, dated 3rd November. ^Political a, Ja- leaders been fined| compensation had nuary 1879, No. 186.) been ordered for the wounded sailor of Abuthabi, and a letter of apology sent from the Chief of Bahrein to the Chief of Abuthabi. 311. The remaining case is that reported in the Resident's letter No. 260, „ _ , . _ 10 „ n XT or , dated 27th Noyember 1878, which en- onca , anuary , o. . closes correspondence between Colonel Eoss and Mr. Melrill, acting Commissioner in Sind. The subject is an attack by pirates about two miles from Katif on two boats—the Rarsingar and the Fultehkar —belonging to British subjects on their return voyage from Katif to Kurrachee. The Ear sin gar was plundered of about Ks. 200 worth of property : the Futtehhar lost nothing, but was fired into. Mr. Melvill pressed for redress as the sufferers were British subjects. In reply Colonel Ross informed him that the offenders were Bedouin Arabs residing in Turkish territory, and that the outrage appeared to have perpetrated within Turkish territorial waters. The matter had been brought to the notice to the Turkish authorities through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. He added that the Vulture had already inflicted some punishment on Katif pirates, and it was hoped that further measures for punishment and com pensation would be undertaken by the Turkish authorities. 312.

The Commander of the Iskanderia had made peace between the Chief of Bidaa and the Naeem tribe, most of whom had gone to Bidaa. 314 On the 11th January 1879 we wrote to Colonel Ross concurring with p 1A T 1«*Q V his opinion that the Chief of Zobarah had Political A, January 1879, No. 260. •. rvj • xi • i i i- i • • -i i been sumciently punished for his misdeeds by the loss and injury which he and his people had suffered by reason of the expedition led against them by the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Mubarick. 315. Colonel Ross' action in warning the Chief of Bahrein not to interfere on behalf of Zobarah, and in taking precautionary measures to protect him, was approved. 316. The Resident was also asked for further information regarding the future position of the Turkish Government towards Zobarah. 317. In our letter to the Resident of the same date the acknowledgments of the Government of India were conveyed to the officers and men of the VuU ture ' for their services in October 1.878, which resulted, as mentioned in paragraph 298, in the capture of a number of piratical dhows off Katif. The services oE Commander Pringle of the 44 Vulture ' were subsequently acknow ledged by Lord Salisbury in his despatch to the Secretary of the Admiralty of the 4th March 1879 (Secret, September 1879, No. 15). 318. The measures adopted by the Resident for the punishment of the sub jects of the Chief of Bahrein who fired upon a vessel off Abuthabi, as noted above, were approved, and the Resident was directed to warn the Chief that he would not be allowed to evade responsibility on the plea that his subjects acted without or against his orders. 319. The Resident was instructed to allow the irregularity committed by the Chief of Bahrein in receiving the Chief of Zobarah and his son as guests just after they had been engaged in piracy to stand over, as the matter would be taken up in considering the question of the Turkish authority over Zobarah. 320. With regard to the case alluded to in paragraph above, in which the ^ Beni Hajir attacked vessels belonging to British Indian subjects, the Resident was asked to ascertain, if possible, who the offenders were, as well as the locality of the outrage, i.e., whether it was committed in Turkish terri torial waters. 321. On the 9th January 1879 a telegram was received from Secretary of Political A, January 1879, No. 263. State ' ia wMch he ask e (1 *&lt;&gt; ^ furnished with all recent papers regarding piracy in the Persian Gulf. 322. Our despatch to Secretary of State, No. 6 of 17th January 1879, gave a condensed account of recent cases of piracy, and of the orders issued on the subject. 323. Two letters from the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, dated 18th and Political A, January 1879, Nos, 266 and 327. 20tl1 Nov ember 1878, forwarded the whole of the correspondence which had passed between him and Colonel Ross, the Turkish authorities and Constantinople on the subject of piracies. The Political Agent reported that the Turkish author ities were doing their best to get troops sent down to Nejd. His own opinion87 was that the disorders in Basrah and Nejd would not cease until Nasir Pasha, the Sheikh of the Montefik, was reinstated in his position as Governor, as he and his tribesmen subdued Ei-Hasa before, 324. The correspondence shows that the frequent piracies which took place about this time were due in a great measure to the disturbances which commenced in September 1878 among the Montefik Arabs and the Beni Sad. 825. On the 27th September 1878, Colonel Nixon reported to Her , _ „ Maiesty's Ambassador at Constantinople Political A, January, 1879 No. 2S6. n i t j 1 ii^i i ^ that disturbances had taken place amongst the Montefik Arabs around Goornah, and that the gunboats Nejd and Iskan- deriah had been despatched to the spot. The cause of the disturbances was the general unpopularity of the Sheikhs whom Abdullah Pasha, the Govemor- Generel of Basrah, had appointed to collect the Be venue. Colonel Nixon remarked that ever since Nasir Pasha had been superseded there had been continual disorder in Basrah. 326. In October 1878, Colonel Nixon reported that the Montefik had „ . T ,o^ « „ rt o quieted down owing to the orders issued Political A, January 1879, No. 293. / ^ . , ::5 . A , n , , from Constantinople to Abdullah Pasha to leave matters in the hands of Fahad Pasha, the nephew of Nasir Pasha, the late Governor-General.88 chapter eighth. (ii ).-~Eevolt in Hasa and piracies in Katif and Bahrein waters, 1878-1881. 827. In October 1878 the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed , . _ rT to Colonel Nixon, stating that the neiffb- Reported revolt in El-Hasa. , i i x-i? i* i j? i bourhood of Katit was very unsafe and that frequent piracies were being committed, and asking whether the Turkish authorities would assent to our acting against pirates. He also reported that the sons of Saud bin Teysal had revolted in province of Hasa and captured Damaum. Abdullah bin Feysal was said to be supporting the movement and the Turkish authority over the province of Hasa was endangered. Colonel Koss added that urgent orders for the despatch of troops were necessary. 328. Abdullah Pasha, in reply to a telegram from Colonel Nixon, admitted that insecurity to a certain extent existed in the neighbourhood of Katlf, but maintained that sufficient troops had already been despatched. The Turkish authorities also declined to accept Colonel Ross' proposal that the British Government should assist them in acting against pirates. The operations of H. M. S. Vulture restored sea communications and rendered the waterway t v.- , * t 'v towards the end of October. Political A-, January 1879, No. 300, 329. Up to this time reports from Nejd showed that the rising against political a,, january 1879, no. 315. T f k ? there had not proTed formidable. The Arabs or Hasa were, said to have assured the acting Governor of support in case of attack from outside, but they demanded relief from the misconduct and corruption of the local officials. The principal tribes in revolt were those concerned in the piracies complained of by Colonel Ross, viz,, the Beni Hajir, the Ajman, and the Amayer. 830. On the 7th November Colonel Nixon reported to Her Majesty's Political a., January 1878, No. 219. Ambassador at Constantinople that the country nea« Basrah was quieting down, as the Montefik had heard that Nasir Pasha, their Chief, had been re-appointed Governor-General of Basrah. 831. On the 15th February 1879 Colonel Ross reported the occurrence of Political A., September 1879, No. 90. frequent robberies in the villages of Bahrein attended with several murders. Several of the robbers were arrested and severely punished, but the ringleader Ali-bin-Jabir, although captured, managed to effect his escape. There were strong suspicions that his escape was arranged with the cognizance of the Chief but Sheikh Esau in a letter to Colonel Ross denied this. Ali-bin-Jabir was said to have joined the Beni Hajir pirates. 332. On the 5th March 1879 the Naval Commander-in-Chief was asked Political a ., September 1879, No. 98.

He observed :— 'The facts reported.however appear to me to indicate the expediency of an early under- fitanding with the Turkish Government in regard to Ottoman jurisdiction and responsibility for order along the Arabian shore of the Gulf; and it is therefore important that I shon'd receive, at as early a date as possible, the full expression of the views of Your Excellencv in Council in the matter.' J89 334. Before replying to this despatch, the Government of India, in their despatch to Secretary of State, No. 55 Piracie. from November 1878 to M.y 1879. 22nd May gave com p lete aoooun t of the piracies which had occurred subsequent to the issue of their previous despatch of 17th January 1879. The most important events that had occurred in the interval were as follows « 385. At the latter end of December 1878 Mansoor-hin-Minakhir, a Sheikh of tbe An man tribe, ioined with SoUfert A, September 1879^ Nos. M5-162. Zaid bin-Mahomed of the Eeni Hajir, and having forcibly seized a boat belonging to a subject of Bahrein, put out to sea. They attacked two boats in the neighbourhood of Katif and carried off from one of them property valued at Rs. 20,000. Ten boats conveying Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Katif were in sight, but, on beinsr appealed to decline to inter- ' fere. Colonel Ross brought to notice the impunity enjoyed by Zaid-bin Mahomed and other pirates residing at Zahran in the vicinity of Katif through the apathy and indifference of the Turkish authorities, and expressed an opinion that the seizure of Zaid-bin-Mahomed or his explusion from Zahran was a measure of primary necessity. The Goveinment of India thereupon, after ascertaining from the Resident, Bushire, that Zahran was within recognized Turkish iurisdiction, and that Zaid-bin- Pohticai a ., September 1879, No. 156. Mahomed was a Turkish subject, desired' the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to urge the Turkish authorities either to „ _ ope v ate promptlv agdinst Zaid-bin-Mabom- Pohticai a ., September 18/9, o. 3. ed or to accept the alternative of British action. 336. Instead of carrying wit these directions Colonel Nixon asked the „ . „ Vail of Basrah whether a British ship of Political A, September 1879, No. 158, , iii , , \ i j- i i war should be sent to check disorder, and referred the same quest'ons to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. The Vali replied that a Turkish corvette had been ordered to cruise in the disturbed parts, and that tbe Mutassarif of Katif had received stringent instructions to suppress further piracies. 337. Ultimately the Turkish Minister of Marine directed the or the Iskanderia, or Isoth, if necessary, to proceed to the Nejd coast, and declared . . „ , that tbe Basrah authorities would be held o itica a ., ep m er s , o . responsible for the restoration and mainte nance of order. 338. On the 22nd January Colonel Ross reported that Turkish force had „ v.. , * 0 . w iqto xr marched by land against El-Hussein, a Political A., September 1879, Nos. 160—166. . n n -i r rr i iit village nve miles irom Zahran, and had destroyed it; but the ringleader and other persons concerned in recent piracies were not captured. The measures taken therefore were altogether inadequate , . a , _ x , , and piratical boats continued to molest Political A., September 1879, I^o. lUa. , t i i ji A i m i trading vessels; moreover, both the Turk ish vessels of war broke down. 339. On the 14th February 1879, the Resident in the Persian Gulf tele- Political A. Septembor 1879, No 171. P/Vj ^ S I ,eCeSS had led to further piracies of Katif. A fresh gang of the Beni Hajir had stairted under another leader and captured two Bahrein vessels laden with dates ; afterwards they joined Zaid's band near El-Hussein and departed with their booty into the interior. Subsequently they put to sea as^ain in search of further prizes and closed communication between Bahrein and Katif, The Chief of Bahrein expressed alarm for his islands, and asked either that he might he permitted to take the necessary measures for the recovery of his boats, or that H. M. S. Spartan should act. In Colonel Ross' judgment the piracies were likely to attain formidable dimensions, and to prejudice British prestige and interests; he therefore suggested that the Turkish Government should arrange with the Ejiman tribe to coerce the Beni Hajir, who might be cut off from the sea, and that all the landing places should [ C967FD ]90 be occupied and the coast patrolled, a vessel of war being stationed at Bahrein for a time. 340. The Government of India directed Colonel Ross to order H. M. S. Political A.. September 1879, No. 172. in the neighbourhood of Katif and to protect Bahrein as required by treaty. He was authorized to suppress piracy by sea and to punish maritime offenders whatever their nationality, but operations on the mainland were prohibited. He was also empowered to place a British officer temporarily at Political A., September 1879, No. 178. Bahrein, and Captain Durand, the First Assistant to the Resident, proceeded thither. 341. On the 15th February Colonel Ross telegraphed that on the 11th Political a ., September 1879. No. 174. February thirty Beni Hajir from Zshran had committed a raid on Azaria, 10 miles from Man amah on the larger island of Bahrein, and killed one man. The Chief of Bahrein desired permission to seize the boats in possession of the pirates at Zahran, and begged either for complete protection or permission to attack his enemies by sea. Colonel Ross considered the Chief's fears to be well founded and recommended that our ships of war should be employed against the pirates. • Political a ., September 1879, No. 175. He was to report his plans after consultation with the naval officers on the spot. 342. Colonel Ross then recommended the thorough examination of the Political a., September 1879, No. 178.

The pirates were to be prevented as far as possible from getting boats, and he asked that a British vessel of war should be stationed at political a., september 1879, no 179. Bahrein. The Government of , ^ India sanctioned these proposals on the understanding that Colonel Ross' plans had been laid in consultation with the naval officers, and that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland beyond reach of the guns of the British vessels. 343.

Despatch No. 55, -dated 22nd May 1879, described the continued piracies of the Beni Hajir under Zaid-bin-Mahomed joined by Ajman along the coast between Katif and Ojair and the inadequate and ineffective measures of repression taken by the Turkish authorities. It noticed the apprehensions of the Chief of Bahrein, his application to the British authorities with special re ference to the daring raid on Azaria and the obligations of the British Govern ment towards the Chief. • 349. At the close of the despatch in which this description of recent piracies Proposau for suppression of piracies. was transmitted to the Secrctarv of State Political A., September 1879, No. .si. the Government of India called attention to a letter, dated 4th March 1879, which Colonel Nixon, the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, had addressed to Sir A. Layard, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, on the subject of the piracies in the Persian Gulf, and observed :— Colonel Nixon is not understood to be personally acquainted with tbe country which he describes, and the accuracy o£ the information which he has furnished to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople i'? open to question. In dealing- with these outrages our difficulty has been that they have been committed either within Turkish territorial waters or in close proximity thereto—a print which Colonel Nixon does not seem to have fully appreciated. That officer further considprs that th» recpnt piracies in the Gulf have arisen out of quarrels of the tribes on the mainland of Nejd and Bahrein. This view is not shared by Colonel^ Hoss, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who has an intimate knowledge of these localities, and who necessarily possesses far superior means of obtaining information regarding them. According to Colonel Ross no inter-tfibal disputes were going on, and the outrages were committed, for the most part, by well kuown piratical gangs whose sole object was plunder. ' Moreover, on the 20th January and 26,th February, Mr. Robertson, the Political Political A., September, No. 218. Assistant and Vice-Consul at Basrah, within »» »&gt; »&gt; » 22 8. which Pashalik the Turkish possessions on the Arab coast are situate, informed Colonel Nixon that no disturbance whatever existed in the jinterior, but that if order was not restored on the coast the disturbances might spread to the mainland. Nor is there any sufficient evidence, so far as can be ascertained, for the statements that the Turks have conquered years ago all the mainland in the interior from .Koweit to Zobarah and that the coast line of petty tribes has fallen insensibly under Turkish dominion, and that really all the interests of the Nejd coast rest in Turkey.' 350. Meanwhile Colonel Ross forwarded a copy of a letter from the Com- Poiiticai a., September 1879, Nos. 276-282. madder of H. M. S. Vulture in which he gave Ids opinion of the measures which should be adopted to suppress piracy on the Turkish Arabian coast. His opinion, although arrived at independently, coincided exactly with that expressed by Colonel Boss in his telegram* of 28th February 1879. He suc- ^ested that British cruisers, acting on Colonel Ross' requisition, should be permitted to attack the pirates, if necessary, to their bases of operation on the Isejd coast, where their boats and vessels could generally be destroyed or cap tured without going beyond the beach : that the channels west and south of Bahrein should be surveyed, and to assist in these operations he recommended that a steam pinnace should be permanently stationed near Bahrein, with the Tiew also of protecting the islands from the raids of the Bedouins. 351. I q reply to Colonel Ross* letter we forwarded to him a letter from His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in which he stated his opinion that a steam pinnace was not required, and that the ships detailed for duty in the92 Persian Gulf were amply sufficient for all purposes. His Excellency recom mended that a \essel should be stationed at Bahrein permanently, until the maraudincr tribes had entirely disappeared, and that the British India Mail Steamers should call at Bahrein in going up and down the Gulf. 362. In our despatch to the Secretary of State, No. 77 of the 23rd June 1879, we forwarded a tabular statement Political A., September 1879, No. 338. compiled by Colonel HOSS showing in detail the total reported losses from piracies on the Turkish Arabian coast and. the cases in which, in his opinion, the British Government were interested in recovering indemnity. Our despatch also forwarded papers connected with the recent course of events in the Persian Gulf. 353. A translation of Colonel Ross 5 statement of piracies was given to Abdullah Pasha, the Governor of Basrah, who promised to make enquiries in the matter, and a copy was also sent to Colonel Nixon with a request that he would urge the Turkish authorities (through whatever channel he might deem most effectual) to recover the amount plundered as far as possible. The total losses were estimated at 67,008-25 krans, of which the British Government were considered to be interested in the recovery of 8,834-25 krans. The action taken by Colonel Nixon was to send a copy of the statement to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, and another to Mr, Kobertson at Basrah. cJ54. On the 11th March 1879 Colonel Ross visited Bahrein and stayed i tj „«» ^ there till the 18th. He had several inter- Colonel Ross' visit to Banrein m . m i -n i i • i ji March 1879. views with Sheikh Esau, and his brother Political A., September 1879, No. 303. Sheikh Ahmed, and found them in a state of considerable irritation, because of the restraint placed on them in the matter of reprisals towards the mainland, the gist of their complaint being that whilst they themselves were prevented from acting against the Beni Hajir and others, Colonel Ross has not succeeded in obtaining restitution of property stolen or compensation, nor had the Turkish Government taken steps to punish the piratical Bedouins. 355. Colonel Ross invited Sheikh Esau to state any measures he was desirous of having carried out, and to offer suggestions in connection with the recenfdisturbances. Sheikh Esau's requests were-r (1) That the Bahrein robber, Ali-bin-Jabir, and his associates, of whose proceedings an account has been given in another part of this precis, and who had been arrested by the Turkish authorities and sent a prisoner to El-Hasa, should be handed over to him for punishment. In support of this request the Chief urged that when certain robbers concerned in the Kashmir piracy at Basrah had fled to Bahrein, he had caused them to be seized and surrendered to the Turkish authorities. Colonel Ross, in reply, promised that he would endeavour to obtain the extradition of the criminals, on the understanding that the Chief would be res ponsible that they did not again escape. (2) That as the port of Zakunniyah, near Ojair, was a resort of pirates, either steps should be taken to prevent its being inhabited, or he should be allowed to send some of his own people to reside there. To this Colonel Ross replied that the place was in Turkish territory, and that the interference of Bahrein was impossible, but that his statement should be made known to the Turkish authorities. (3) That Colonel Ross would obtain restitution of 311 sheep which had been stolen from Bahrein and landed in Turkish territory. Qolonel Ross promised to use his best endeavours in the matter. Besides these specified requests Sheikh Esau intimated his hope and ex pectation that with the aid of the British Government the value of all property plundered from his subjects in Turkish waters would be restored, and that protection would be continued to the islands.93 He furtlier expressed a wish to take measures to coerce the El-Bowasiri tribe, his own subjects residing in Bahrein, whom he suspected of treason and collusion with the Beni Hajir. On this point Colonel Ross refused to advise and only expressed a hope that the Chief would be careful not to act so as to cause disturbances on the island. In the letter which contained an account of his visit to Bahrein, Colonel Ross also reported the operations of H. M. S. Vulture in the recovery of another Bahrein vessel which was lying ashore on the beach near Katif. 356. Colonel Ross' proceedings in these matters were approved in our Political A, September 1879. No. 335. letter No. 1501-E. P. of 2nd June 1879. 357. In pursuance of his promise to the Chief, Colonel Ross wrote to Colonel Nixon on the 31st March sending Foiiticai a., September 1879, No. 308. him an account of a fresh case of piracy in which about 30 Bedouins under Mahomed-bin-Fowaz, Dowasiri, had attacked a boat belonging to Ali-bin-Hassan, a subject of Bahrein. He added that until some signal punishment was inflicted on the offending Bedouins by the Turkish authorities, it was idle to expect the former to desist from these mal practices, amd he gave the names of the best known leaders of piratical bands— (1) Zaid-bin-Mahomed (Hajiri). (2) Mozi-bin-Tozah (Hajiri). (3) Mahomed-bin-Powaz (El-Dowasiri). 858. He then urged Colonel Nixon to move the Turkish authorities to grant Sheikh Esau's requests for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates, and for the restoration of the stolen sheep, and to take steps for the proper control of Zakunniyah. 369. Colonel Ross also wrote to Mr. Robertson, the Political Agent at Surrender of Aii-bin Jabir. Basrah, on the subject, and heard from him ioiiticai a, September 1879, Ko. 334. jjis Excellency Abdullah Pasha of Basrah would authorize the Mutassarif of Nejd to deliver up Ali-bin-Jabir and his followers to the Sheikh of Bahrein on his sending an agent to claim and receive them. On this Colonel Ross directed Sheikh Esau to send trustworthy Political a.. September 1876, Ko. sja persons with a letter to the Mutassarif for- mally requesting extradition of the culprits, and stating clearly what crimes they bad committed in Bahrein. Sheikh Esau acted accordingly, but was told by the Mutassarif, on the 15th April, that he was awaiting instructions from Abdullah Pasha. 360. Meanwhile Colonel Ross had been told apparently verbally that the «i»i.. ,. c . u x- oor • Mutassarif declined to give up Ali-bin- Political A., September 1879, &gt;o. 325. -r -i • i on -i i in r J abir unless Sheikh Esau gave up one Ali-bin-Hassan, presumably a Turkish subject, accused of having defrauded the Turkish Government whilst employed as an accountant in the service of that Government at El-Katif. Colonel Bo&gt;s immediately addressed Colonel Nixon asking him to move Abdullah Pasha to maintain his orders for the extradition of Ali-bin-Jabir and his associates irrespective of the case of Ali-bin-Hassan which was of a very different character. He also sent a copy of this letter to Mr. Robertson, who obtained an acknowledgment from the Pasha that the cases of Ali-bin-Hassan and Ali-bin-Jabir were quite distinct and should be treated separately. The Pasha further said that his order for the surrender of the robber could not have reached the Mutassarif when he declined to give the gang up. 361. On the receipt of this information Colonel Ross instructed Sheikh Esau to again apply to the Mutassarif for the surrender of the prisoners. 362. On the 16th May Colonel Ross forwarded translation of a report from Operations of the Governor of El-Haea agaiart ^16 NeWS Agent at Bahrein, deSCribingthe Jabaii operations of the Mutassarif or Governor Political a., September 1879, No. S36. of e1 . hasa a g a i nst the Arab village Of Jahail situated north of El-Katif. [096711)] 194 The Mutassarif proceeded to Jabail in the with some troops and plundered the castle of Sobaih, the inhabitants of which place fled on his approach. 363. On the 30th Mav 1879 the Turkish blockade runner arrived • A1 ._ n . v at Basrah from Constantinople with two life boat cutters, each fitted to carry a small gun. 361. In our despatch No. 91 of ^8tb July 1879 we forwarded to Secretary of State copy of two letters from Colonel Poiitioai a., September 1879, No. 350. Boss. The first of these contained a state- oWth*! 18 „ /9 ' ment drawn up by Colonel Ross, show- Appendix. maritime aggressions brought to the notice of the Resident by the Chief of Bahrein, as having been committed on vessels belonging, and persons subject, to his authonty. 365. The Government of India observed that the British Resident was bound, b'v Article 3 of the Bahrein Convention of 1861, forthwith to take the necessary steps for obtaining reparation, and that accordingly application had been made through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to the Turkish authorities at Constantinople. The recovery of four stolen boats'by H.M.S. Vulture was also reported. 366. The second letter was a reply to a reference from the Government of India, and contained Colonel Ross' reasons for his non-concurrence with the opinion expressed by Colonel Nixon that the recent piracies m the Gulf had emanated from internecine quarrels among the tribes upon the mainland. Colonel Ross attributed these lawless outbreaks to the neglect of the Turkish local authorities to deal vigorously with the offenders at the beginning. 367. On the 15th July 1879 the Resident in the Persian Gulf reported by Zaid-bin-Mahomed. telegram that Zaid-bin-Mahomed, the political a., september 1879, no. 503. notorious Beni Hajir robber, was again engaged in piracy. He had plundered a Bahrein pearl vessel and killed or wounded four persons. Tbe Resideut remarked that this was to be expected from the complete immunity enjoyed by the pirates. 368. Colonel Ross was asked by telegram to report tbe locality of the piracy whether it took place in Turkish waters Political A, September 1879, No. 515. ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ wheihGV he deeme(i it necessary to order the British gun-boats to aid on this spot. 369. Colonel Ross' letters Nos. 249 and 261 of the 16th and 19th July 1879 , , „ „ , _ though written before the receipt of this Political A., September 18/5, Nos. 504 and 510. . , 0 1 , • telegram, answered the questions contain ed in it. 370. The depredation took place off Ras Lafan, the north-eastern point of the Katar promontory w ithin Turkish jurisdiction. The pirates were alleged to have been aided by the inhabitants of Khor Shujeej, a village to the south of Ras Lafan and about 20 miles nortlf of Bidaa. 371. Mahomed-bin-Ibrahim A1 Chaarban, a diver and a subject of Bahrein was in command of the boat attacked. His story was that he and other Bahrein subjects had finished their pearl-fishing on July 5th, and went to anchor in the evening in five fathoms water off Ras Haffan. Towards next morning, Zaid-bin-Mahomed, his brother (Jand-bin-Mahomed) and ten others of the Beni Hajir in a Buggarah, together with some men of the A1 Mahondah, who lived at Khor Shujeej; in a small shoee attacked his boat, fired at them, killed one man and wounded three, and then plundered the boat. The pirates carried off two slaves and 2,026 krans worth of property. They then put themselves with some of his crew, including the wounded, into a buggarah, and made off with his boat. He met a friendly buggarah, and, having received assistance, pursued the pirates who landed near Rasoon Hasoa and escaped. He then recovered his boat, which was left on the shore and came to Bahrein, where he reported the occurrence, and the JNews Agent informed Colonel Ross.95 372 Colonel Ross telesraplied to Mr. Robertson at Basrah, who thereupon wrote strongly to Colonel Miles at Baghdad, and also to the Governor of Basrah urein^ the necessity of prompt action. He also spoke to Commodore Ahmed Beg (of the Arkadi ?), who expressed his readiness to act at once, but Abdullah Pasha threw cold water on his zeal and forbade hasty action. In Mr. Robertson s opinion Abdullah Pasha had neither the intention or capacity to stop these and similar outrages, which he looked on 'as the results of English artifice and intrigue,'* and it was well known that he hated the English. 373. In two later telegrams, dated the 18th and 22nd July, respectively, Colonel Miles reported that— 'he bad received a telegram from the Governor of Basrah saying that he (the Governor) had sent stringent orders to the authorities at Nejd and the Naval Officer for the capture of the offenders' 374. In the second telegram Colonel Miles stated that he had received a despatch* from the Ambassador at the Porte informing him that the Minister of Marine had telegraphed to enquire what measures were taken by the authorities at Basrah relative to piracies, and to ascertain whether the state of affairs was owing to negligence or to want of means of suppression. Also that two corvettes were being despatched to the Gulf. 375 Colonel Ross intended to request the Senior Naval Officer, who was at Bahrein, to investigate the guilt of the people of Khor Shujeej, on whom he thought Government should induce the lurks to inflict punishment should their guilt be established. • 376. In reporting the matter to Secretary of State, the Government of India observed in their despatch No. 102 of the Political A,. September 1879, No. 620. ^ S8 p tember 1879— a While it is very desirable on general grounds that an understanding should be speedily arrived at on the question dealt with in our despatch No. 127, dated 5i2nd May, it is necessary that in the meantime, pressure should be brought to bear on the local Turkish authorities wherebv they may be induced either to adopt adequate measures of their own for the capture and punishment of Zaid-bin-Mahomed, or to acquiesce in the needful action being taken by the Resident in Persian Gulf. Your Lordship will perceive from the inclosures of this despatch that as long as Abdulla Pasha, whose shortcomings have been already brought to notice, remains at Basrah, the requisite measures are likely to be indefinitely postponed/'' 377. The Resident's action in respect to Zaid-bin-Mahomed and the Beni Hajir was approved, but the Government of India disapproved of Colonel Ross' proposal that the Turkish Government should be called upon to inflict punish ment on the Khor Shujeej, inasmuch as they were unable to admit that Khor Shujeej and Ras Lafan were situated within acknowledged Turkish juris diction. 378.

The Political Agent accordingly addressed the Pasha on the sub- iect. and pointed out that Zaid-bin-Maho- Political A., January 1880, No. 428. j x f 4-j* li. med was not a man or any standing, but that impunity had made him daring and success as a pirate had procured him a following. Where pressure put on the Sheikhs of the Beni Hajir, they would, no doubt, readily capture and deliver him to the authorities. 383.

Should anyone so settle, a ship would be sent to destroy their settlement, 384.

He obtained assurances from the Sheikhs that they would act in accordance with the wishes of the British Government. At the same time Captain Woodroffe made enquiries as to the cause of the removal of the Albu-Kowarah tribe from Bidaa to IWeyrat. Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani of Bidaa accused the Sheikh of Bahrein of having instigated the tribe to leave Bidaa, and from the reports of the Native Agent at Bahrein it appeared that some of the eiders of the tribe had gone to Bahrein, and had there received presents. 3S5. Colonel Ross was of opinion that the removal of Sheikh Mahomed bin Said, the chief of the tribe, arose from jealousy of Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani who, as the nominee of the Turks, had obtained ascendancy at Bidaa, and he remarked that the secession had caused much irritation to Jassim and satisfaction to the Bahrein Sheikh. Colonel Ross also reported that he had written to Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali, who was in charge of Bahrein during 4he absence of his'brother, and warned him against interfering on the mainland. The Sheikh denied any interference, and promised to abide by the Resident's advice, and not to visit the mainland during his brother's absence. Political a.^ May 1 isso^Nos. 163-167. ^86.

Colonel Ross, therefore, considered the presence of one of Her Maies- ty s vessels at Bahrein desirable as a matter of precaution.97 389. The Turkish authorities were addressed and sent strong and positive orders to the Mutasarriff of Nejd to enquire into the fresh cases of piracy. 390. The Government of India requested political a., angast 1880, No. 84. the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, to report the result of these orders. 391. On the 9th December the Eesident in the Persian Gulf telegraphed Nasir-bin-Mobarik's attempt to attack Bahrein, that a body Of Arabs Under Nasir bin-MO- secret, january 1881, no. 47. barik had assembled on the mainland op posite Bahrein, and were watching for an opportunity to attack the island. Pre parations were made for sending a vessel of war to the spot, but the raid failed owing to the want of boats. 392. The orders issued by the Vali of Baghdad to the Mutasarriff of Nejd, _ 100 , XT regarding the suppression of piracies had o itxca ., anuary , os. ■ . effect whatever, and from subsequent correspondence with the Political Agent, Turkish Arabia, aod with the Resident in the Gulf, it appeared that the Turkish vessel Arkadi had not been engaged on any duty connected with the arrest of Zaid-bin-Mahomed and other pirates, as alleged by the Turkish authorities. 393. In December 1880 Colonel Ross forwarded by post some further parti- , , ^ culars of Nasir-bin-Mobarik's attempted A - January 1881 ' No ' U1 - 157 ' attack on Bahrein. The Arabs with him were said to belong to the Jiiunasir, Beni Hajir, and Al-Murrah tribes, and were about 600 in number. They assembled near Ruais and Abul Dhuloof, whence they intended to cross over to Bahrein, but were prevented by the inhabitants who refused to lend them their boats. 364i. In January 1881 Colonel Ross forwarded copies of letters received , 0 o, xt m from Nisir-bin-Mubarik and Sheikh ecret, une , o. . Jassim-bin-Mahomed Thani, Chief of Bidaa, written after the failure of the attack on Bahrein. Nasir-bin-Mobarik asked for the support and assistance of the British Government, and promised to act in accordance with their wishes. He also announced his intention of crossing over to Bahrein, as his family, friends, and property were there. Colonel Ross, in reply, informed him that any hostile descent on Bahrein by him or any other person would be opposed and punished. 395. Jassim-bin-Thani asked Colonel Ross to act as mediator to make up the quarrel between Nasir-bin-Mobarik and Sheikh Esau, to which Colonel Ross replied that Nasir's right to property in Bahrein was not recognized, and that any allowance given him by the Bahrein Government would be, on condition of his abandoning his evil designs and selecting an approved residence, other than Katar. 396. Erom Nasir-bin-Mobarik's letter is seemed probable that he would* before long renew his attack on Bahrein. 397. In March 1881 the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia forwarded a copy of a letter from the Vali of Baghdad, m which he reported that he had ascertained from the Mutasarriff of Nejd that no piracy or plunder of vessels had been committed by Zaid-bin-Mahomed, and that perfect tranquillity and security prevailed on the Katar coast by sea and land. £98.

Jassim, however, in the Resident's opinion bad been all the time secretly assist ing Nasir in his projects for recovering his possessions in Bahrein, and had recently attempted to ^et rid of his responsibility on the ground that Nasir had left his jurisdiction, and was supported by Bedouin Arabs. The Resident, how ever, informed Jasim that he must still hold him responsible for the conduct of [C967ED]98 ISasir-bin-Mobarik so long as he was on the Katar coast. Colonel Koss also thought it advisable that the Turkish Governor and authorities should be informed of Nasir's designs with a view to having his proceedings watched, and he recommended that Jassim should be warned that any hostile movement on the part of Nasir would be attributed to him. With this view he forwarded copies of the papers to the Political A^ent, Turkish Arabia, for any action he might think fit. 399. In subsequent letters of the 2nd and 9th April 1881, Colonel Eoss secret, june 1881, nos. 27 and 3i. reported that Nasir-bin Mobarik received . an allowance of 60 dollars monthly from the Turkish Government, and that he himself asserted that he was encouraged in designs against Bahrein by promises of support in the event of his succeeding in gaining a footing on the island. Nasir who had on previous occasions been invited to visit Colonel Koss at Bushire, had replied that he feared his doing so would give umbrage to the Turkish authorities, and that* his allowance would be s ^PP e( ^* ^ ■^- e proposed, however, to send to Bushire his cousin, Ali-bin-Nasir who had lately been released from Aden, and Colonel Ross saw no objection to this. Colonel Koss also forwarded a letter from Jassim, who persisted in deny ing that he was in any way responsible for ISTasir's conduct. 400. On the receipt of Colonel Ross'letters on this subject, the Political Agent, Secret, June i88i, No, 34. Turkish Arabia, made enquiries from the Vali of Baghdad regarding Nasir-bin- Mobarik s movements on the Katar coast. The' Vali replied that after enquiry from the Turkish authorities on that coast, he found that nothino- had beon done by Nasir-bin Mobarik to justify any alarm on the part of tbe people or bbeikb of Bahrein. The Political Agent considered that this statement, which was so inconsistent with the state of affairs reported by Colonel Ross was due to anxiety on the part of the Turkish officers to minimize the danger' lest they should be called upon to take effective measures to guard against it. Pend ing instructions from the Government of India he did not think it advisable to make any further representation to the Turkish authorities, as had been suffffested by Colonel Ross, as no practical results were likely to follow from aiwsuch communication. If Jasim and Nasir-bin-Mobarik disregarded the warning con- reyed to them by Colonel Eoss, he advised that they should be dealt with under the orders of the Eesident m the Persian Gulf in such manner as the circum stances of the case might seem to require. The effect of such procedure he considered, would not only be decisive as regards the two individuals named but would greatly simplify our future course of action in the Gulf, and althouErb the proceedings of the Resident would probably elicit from the Turkish Govern- ment a demand for explanation, it would not be very difficult to prepare an ade- quate answer to any reclamations which might be put forward. 401.

In reporting the matter to Her Majesty's Secretary of State the Government of India observed— 'The disposal of this case is to a certain extent embarssed by the fact that th e Tmkg have laid some kind of claim to jurisdiction at Bidaa, and at other points on th e Katr coast, whence Nasir bin Mobarik is believed to be mediating a decent on Bahr in; and it has been ascertained that there are some 130 Turkish soldiers in Bidaa itself'. Direct dealings with the Bidaa Sheikh may possibly, therefore, bring about a remonstrance from the Turkish authorities. Under these circumstances, we have given the matter very careful consideration before the issue of orders. But the result of this consideration has been to convince us that, having regard to the necessity of defending Bahrein, which is under British protection, and to the veiws of Her Majesty's Government regarding the recognition of Turkish juris diction on these coasts as announced in Lord Salisbury's despatch to Sir H. Layard of the 5th January 1880, we should, in the event of an expedition against the island being under taken from the neighbourhood, not be justified in allowing vague claims of territorial rio-hts— if unsupported by any practical attempt to discharge the correlative duties which suchrighta necessarily imply—to prevent us from taking measures to coerce both Nasir-bin Mobarik and the Bidaa Chief. At the same time it ssemed to us proper that every opportunity should be afforded to the Turks of using whatever authority they may possess, and may be willino* to exert, upon this part of the coast. We have accordingly issued to the Political Agent^ * 7th. Baghdad, and the Kesident, Persian Gulf, the telegrams of the 9th * May which form an en closure to this despatch, and we trust that our action in the matter may meet with the ap proval and support of Her Majesty's Government'100 chapter eighth. (Ill) —Turkish Eesponsibilities and jurisdiction for the purpose of suppressing piracies in Katif waters. 1878-1881. 401. Eeference has been made already to the question of Turkish juris- c .t. r. V 1 otq at on diction on the Katif and Katar coasts Secret E.. December 1878, Nos. 2-11. « ,i /» . . , for the purpose ot suppressing piracies recently committed on Bahrein waters. The question was raised in the Secret tary of State's despatch No. 42, dated 17th October 1878, and the opinion of the Government of India invited on the point. This involved the question of the demarcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jarisdicticn on that coast and the nature of the responsibility for order which should be held to devolve on the two Governments. On these points an expression of Colonel Ross' opinion was called for in Foreign Department No. 255 O.P., dated 17th De cember 1878. Colonel Nixon, also the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, was 'j 4. x} on a j omu t told in a letter of the same date, that the , Resident, Bashire's No. 30, dated 20th January -.i 1879. Government of India would be glad to 1879 ^ Turki8h Arabia * No '^ dated 12tl1 January receive any statement of his views which he might desire to submit. The replies received from both officers, are summarised below 405. Colonel Ross found the same difficulty which troubled the Govern ment of India (see paragraph 349 above) in understanding the precise character of the reference made by Colonel Nixon to the British Ambassador at Cons tantinople. He points out that we had not been engaged in any disputes with the tribes of Hasa ; that interference in their inter-tribal affairs had been avoided ; and that every effort had been made to hold the Turks responsible for disorder in Turkish districts. He then observed that if Colonel JNixon in writing of El.Hasa has intended to include Katar, a mistake had been made. The Turks have subjugated El-Hasa, and their military occupation of that province had involved the establishment of their authority at Katif and Ojair. In Katar, however, their authority was acquired at a later period and in a different manner, viz., by the invitation of the local chiefs of Bidaa; and with the exception of Bidaa and the immediate neighbourhood, no steps have hitherto been taken to establish Turkish authority on the Katar coast. Strictly speaking, therefore, the continuity oi the Turkish authority terminates at some point near Ojair, and from this point to El-Bidaa there is a tract where their supremacy has not been established, and which includes the peninsula on which Zobarah is situate and which is headed by Ras Reccan. But having explained this distinction, Colonel Ross goes on to say that the Turkish Government might with some reason argue that * their present actual position on this coast does involve, constructively, domination over the entire tract lying between Ojair and Bidaa, provided, of course, that no British rights or obligations exist with reference to this particular tract' of a nature to constitute an obligation to oppose the full establishment of Turkish authority therein.' The conclusions at which he arrived were— ' (1) That failing the exercise of British interference there is no obstacle in the way of completion of the chain of Turkish occupation of El-Katr as far as El- Bidaa. (2) That the British Government is not bound by any existing engagements to oppose that proceeding. ' (3) That assuming that the British Government see no sufficient ground for re- assuming the supervision and control over the portion of coast in question, it would be best that the Turkish Government should undertake the responsibility and take efEectual measures to maintain good order, u But there is a point, of course, beyond which it would be impossible, consistently with the due maiotenauce of Britisli rights and performance of our duties, to permit the furtherextension of Turkish rale or influence. This line should, it appears to me, be drawn not far from El-Bidaa, the furthest 'point on the coast, to which the operations of that Government have extended. The adjacent township of El-Wukran should, I consider, be rendered as accompar ying El-Bidaa, and so included in the, zone of allowable Turkish influence. The southern boundary of these districts might be conveniently drawn at the 25th degree of north latitude.' 406. Colonel Ross noticed that a difficulty will probably arise in respect to the Turkish pretensions to Arabia generally, but nevertheless advises that the Turkish Government should be invited 4 to state the exact extent of the Ara bian coast for which they are prepared to accept responsibility and make effi cient arrangements for tiie maintenance of order and prevention of maritime irregularities, the British Government at the same time stating beforehand plainly the nature and extent of British paramount influence in the same coast, and the line beyond which this will be maintained. The islands of Bahrein would, of course, be so reserved as well as the entire 4 trucial region ' including Odied.' 407. The next question was what action should be taken by the British Government in case of the maritime peace of the Gulf being broken by expe ditions proceeding from acknowledged Turkish ports, and which the Turkish authorities were unable or unwilling to put down. Colonel Boss considered it * highly necessary to reserve the right to suppress by means of our naval force such irregular operations undertaken for marauding purposes in the high sea.' 408. On the very important question of the effect which the recognition of Turkish rights and obligations will have upon the British and Persian Govern ments Colonel Boss wrote :— ' There can be no doubt the appearence of the Turks in the Persian _ Gulf and their acquisitions somewhat curtailed the sphere of British control and limited our influence corres pondingly. But practically this was unavoidable ; and as we have already for some years abstained from the exercise of active control over that portion of the coast actually, or poten tially, under Turkish rule or influence, the transfer of so much of our jurisdiction may be regarded as an accomplished fact. It having been apparent to all, from the outset, that the British Government did not mean to oppose Turkish progress, where our own interests were not materially concerned, I do not think that full recognition of Turkish rights and obliga tions now would injuriously affect British influence and prestige as regards our own reserved sphere. Again, were a clear understanding arrived at, as suggested, and it being plain to the Turkish Government that no naval interference would be tolerated where we exercise authority and influence, there would be little inducement for the Turks to increase their naval force in the Gulf unduly, and the British naval force will remain as at present paramount. As re gards Persia, its Government and coast authorities have become accustomed to the presence of British ships-of-war, and recognise the advantage accruing therefrom. They would certainly resent any attempt of the Turks to assume a similar footing, but I do not think the latter would see any inducement to do so.' 409. The reply of the Government of India, Despatch No. 127, dated 22nd May 1879, was :— As to territorial jurisdiction along the coast, we would admit and recognize it herever it now practically exists. The sea line of the El Hassa district, as far south-east as Ojair, is apparently under some hind of established Turkish authority; and this May he recognized ly accepting, with reservations to he . explained 'presently, an understanding that the Turks desire to he held responsible for maritime disorders on that coast. But we should be averse to enter into any discussions which might appear to , countenance claims by the Turkish Government to recognition of its. authority beyond Ojair, or upon any part of the coast of the El Katr promontory, except at El Bidda, where the Turks appear to have some real influence and representation. Beyond El Bidda and Wakra the Turks are not known to have any sort of authority; and near this point begin the territories of the Arab Chiefs who are under treaty with the British Government for the maintenance of peace and for the res traint of piracy. We entirely agree with Colonel Ross that the intrusion of Turkish authority or influence within the territory of these maritime tribes would be inconsistant with the due observance of British rights and obligations, and would be likely to derange a system which has been most beneficial to the interests of all nations in the Gulf. 15. We may add that it will be essential, with regard to thepe Treaty Chiefs, to stipu late that not only shall they be free from interference in their sea coast, but that on the mainland also their boundaries must be respected, so far as the limits of their territories are known and can be varified. For otherwise it might be easy for the Ottoman Government to [C967FDj N102 bring pressure upon these chiefs from the land side ; and they might thus find themselves subject to a divided or double authority, which would produce confusion, would crpate factions, and would tempt them to hoist the Turkish or the maritime treaty flag: as might be most convenient at the moment. This possibility is illustrated by the proceedings of the Sheikh of El Bidda, who now declares himself subordinate to Turkey, and by the attempt of the Odied Sheikh to follow the example of El Bidaa.' It may, also, be necessary to protect the islands of Bahrein by special arrangements which should provide— i*—For the maintenance of the territories of the Chief of Bahrein under the protection of Great Britain. ii.—-For the fulfilment by the Chief of his treaty obligations including abstention from all interference with the mainland. But in the event of attack upon his territories the Chief, acting under the sanction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, should be permitted to take such defensive measures as may be necessary, even to the extent of following up his assailants into Turkish jurisdiction. The justification for this last provision lies in the peculiar situation of Bahrein. The islands are so near the mainland as to render them peculiarly liable to piratical attacks, while this same proximity affords the aggressors every facility for rapid escape into Turkish jurisdiction. 16. Secondly in regard to Ottoman responsibility for order ? Beyond the limits of ac knowledged Ottoman jurisdiction, no such responsibility would, as a matter of coarse, exist. But for the reasons already stated, we consider that within these limits the British Govern ment must continue to exercise some concurrent maritime protectorate ; at least until we can be better assured than at present that the Turkish Government can protect our subjects and our interests effectively. It may not be found necessary to place on record any formal agreement as to the exercise of this joint protectorate ; but some understanding of the following nature might be arraged :— i*—That pirates, whatever their nationality, taken at sea, as well as pirates followed up and taken within the territorial waters of Turkey by British officers, or on shore within reach of the guns of British vessels, shall be dealt with under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. ii'-~That the British authorities shall not undertake operations on the mainland within the Turkish line, as the duty of destroying pirate strongholds so situated will devolve upon the Turkish authorities. iii.—That the necessary representations to the local Turkish authorities shall be ordi narily made by the Political Agent at Baghdad. If, however, immediate action is necessary^ they may be made in the first instance by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should inform the Political Agent at Baghdad of his pro ceedings. iv.—That in case of piracies committad from within their jurisdiction, the Turkish authorities shall enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of com pensation. 17. It may also appear to Her Majesty's Government that the present opportunity should be taken to. revise our agreements both with Muscat and the Arab Trucial Chiefs including, of course, Bahrein. It is due to the policy which the British Government has persued for manv years at heavy expense, and to the efficient naval police which it maintains, that piratical out rages have ceased on all that part of the Arab coast subject to British influence. In conse quence of this condition of permanent security, the commerce of the Persian Gulf has deve loped to an extent which a few years ago would have been dpemed impossible, and it continues steadily to increase. The Arab Chiefs and the Sultan of Muskat have prospered under the prolonged and settled peace which the British maritime protectorate has secured. Neverthe less, they contribute nothing towards the maintenance of a condition of thing so profitable to themselves, and their engagements contain no distinct acknowledgment of the British Gov ernment as the paramount power. The Government of India has never exercised any right of sovereignty over these Chiefs, nor, except as regards maritime proceedings, does it possess any control over them. For the purpose of obtaining a complete and recognized title, and of securing on a valid international basis the position which the British Government has ac quired by a long coarse of settled policy, and at much cost, it will be very advisable to arrange that the Treaty Chiefs shall render a small tribute to us in exchange for our protection. 18. The question of the effect which a settlement with Turkey is likely to produce upon Persia, scarcely falls within the province of the Government of India. Colonel Ross remarks that the Persian Government and its authorities along the coast have become accustomed to the presence of British ships-of-war, and appreciate the advantages of our operations. He adds that Persia would certainly resent any attempts on the part of Turkey to assume a similar p si' ion ; nor does he think that the Turks would think it worth while to make the attempt We may however observe that a determination, somewhat on the lines indicated, of the posi-103 tion to be occupied henceforward by tbe Turkish Government in these regions, would not be prejudicial to Persian interests. As long- as the limits of Turkish authority remain undefined, plausible arguments may be advanced for strengthening the Turkish squadron on duty in the Gulf. An increase in the number of Turkish vessels in these waters would add appreciably to the Turkish power of aggression against Persia, at a point where the Shah's capabilities of resistance are specia 1 ly feeble. When once those limits have been settled, there would be less excuse for an indefinite increase to the Turkish fleet in the Gulf, such as, for instance^ was contemplated in 1871. In this view, therefore, the proposed settlement would be of advantage to Persia. 19. Colonel Ross anticipates that the claims of the Turkish Government to the suzer ainty of the whole of Arabia will hinder the proposed settlement of the limits of Turkish authority. In former days the Turks have asserted that Nejd is a Turkish province, that the Wahalee Amir is aTurkish official, and that Bahrein, Abuthabi, Debaye, and other towns on the coast are included in Nejd territory. We do not think that these pretensions would necessarily be revived by a discussion of the question of litteral jurisdiction; but if, they should be put forward, we presume that they would be negatived by Her Majesty's Government as firmly and conclusively as tlie Turkish claim to Bahrein has been already negatived. 20. There remains the question of the procedure to be followed by the Resident at Bushire, and the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia in the transaction of business in which the Turkish authorities are concerned. There is no doubt that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should keep the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia fully informed of proceedings which involve a reference to Turkish officials. In such matters, it is essential that there should exist between the British Agents constant and confidential intercourse. The difficulty is to deter mine by rule at what point the conduct of correspondence should pass from the Resident in the Persian Gulf to the Politrcal Agent in Turkish Arabia. Generally speaking, all matters relating to Turkish jurisdiction or responsibilities should be transferred to the Baghdad Agency as soon as possible, though on emergency the Bushire Resident would, in the first place, address the Turkish authorities direct. The same rule applies mutatis mutandis to correspondence between the Political Agent at Baghdad and the Persian authorities in Khuzistan. For the rest, a great deal must be left to the discretion and experience of the officers concerned, and to their joint action; and in this sense it might be advisable to issue some general instructions to the two Agencies. 410. The question of the suppression of piracy in the Persian Gulf was No. 55,Political, dated 22nd May 1879, already under consideration when the ' 77 ' ' ' 23rd June ' despatch from which the extracts cited are taken reached the India Office. A copy of it and the other letters noted in the margin were forwarded to the Eoreign Office in Sir L. Mallet's letter, dated 1st August, with the following remarks :— 'Lord Cranbrook is disposed to concur generally in the views set forth in the Government of India letter No. 127 of the 22nd May last, more particularly as regards the expediency of defining the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction on the coast of the Persian Gulf will be recognized. So many important questions are however involved that flis Lordship prefers to delay expressing any positive opinion, until he has been able to consider more fully all the correspond ence connected with the subject/' 411. The Poreign Office replied in Sir Julian Pauncefote's letter, dated 23rd August. This dealt first with the subject-matter of the despatches from the Government of India, No. 55, dated 22nd May, and No. 77, dated 23rd June, cited above, and intimated the action which Lord Salisbury proposed to take in respect to them. It then explained the position of the Odeid affair, and concluded with^ the following expression of Lord Salisbury's viewson the question of Turkish jurisdiction :— 41 Upon these proposals Lord Salisbury will be glad to receive the further observations from Lord Cranbrook promised in your letter. It appears to Lord Salisbury, however, at first sight that the arrangement to which it is desired by the Government of India that the Turkish Government should be brought to consent, is one which would, no doubt, be convenient in view of British interests, but which offers few or no ' corresponding advantages to Turkey. The Porte is apparently expected to agree to a definition of its authority along the coast, as not in any way extending beyond the neighbourhood of El-Bidaa. It would be called upon to abandon the claim, which, though practically rejected by Her Majesty's Government, it has never itself in terms renounced, to sovereignty over Bahrein, to acknowledge that island as independent under British protection ; and further, to concede to the Chief, in the event of attacks upon his territories, the right of taking such defensive measures as may be necessary, under the sanction of the British Resident at Bushire, even to the extent of following up his klOi assailants into Turkish jurisdiction. It is moreover, proposed that until we are assured that the Turiksh Government can effectively protect onr subjpcts and interests. British cruisers should everciso the right to pursue and capture pirates within Turkish territorial waters or on shore within reach of their guns : captures so made to be dealt with under the orders of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. To the Turkish authorities would be left the exclusive conduct of any operations that may be requisite on the mainland, and the care of enforcing restitution and compensation in case of piracies committed from within their ;jurisdiction/ , ' The object in view, viz., the repression of piracy and the maintenance of an efficient maritime police in the Gulf, is one in which this country takes Considerable interest, but to which the Turkish Government are admitted to be very indifferent. Lord Salisbury therefore fails to see what are the inducements which would lead a Governmpnt inclined to be jealous of foreign interference, and singularly indisposed to renounce claims of sovereignty or jurisdiction however shadowy, to give an explicit consent tj the principles above set forth. «It would seem more practical and more in accordance wi^h usace that, having settled for ourselves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction may be admitted, and beyond which it should be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to ^he-Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Turk'sh territorial waters under speeial circumstances when the consent of the local authorities has been obtained. The measures adopted by the Porte have undoubtedly been as yet insuffi cient, and ineffectual, but further exertions and fresh naval reinforcements have been promised. Until the rpsuit of these has been seen, there scarcely exists sufficient ground for a geneKil proposal of joint police in Turkish waters without any reciprocal concession to Turkish cruisers. ' The Government of India make a further proposal which, as Lord Salisbury understands it, is to the effeot that the Trucial Chiefs on the coast) who have hitherto been.independent under certain treaty obligations to this country, and the Chief of Bahrein also, who is in a somewhat similar position, should, for the future, become tributary dependents of Great Britain. It is further suggested that our relations with Moskat should undergo revision, but whether in the same sense is not positively stated. 'These are proposals which, in Lord Sa^isbnry^ opinion, should not be entertained with out very serious cons i deration. As regards Maskat, Lord Cranbrook is, ho doubt, aware that this country is under an engagement with France (dated March 10th 1882) to respect the independence of the Sultan. The sovereignty of B ihrein has long forme3 the subject of claims advanced by Trnkey and Persia. These claims, have always,been repudiated by Her Majesty's Government, but such a step as is now suggested would doubtless lead to renewed controversy, and give rise to suspicion and ill-feeling on the part of both these powers. Jt may be true that the extension of Turkish authority along the coast will be attended with inconvenience and disadvantage to British commerce, and that the present position of the Trucial Chiefs does not offer the same facilities for opposing such an extension as a more definite dependence on Great Biitain. But the acquisition and maintenance of British sovereignty over this strip of territory on the coast of Arabia is not unlikely to give rise to questions equally inconvenient. 412. In Sir L. Mallet's letters, dated 6th September and 7 th October, the No. 77, dated 23rd June, Nos. 102 and 104, dated despatches noted in the margin were for- ist September 1878. warded to the Foreign Office, and even-, tually in Sir L. Mallet's letter, dated 17tb September, already cited, the Secre tary of State for India gave fhe following opinion on the general question :— ' There can, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, be little doubt that the prssent disturbed state of the Arab coast and tha seas adjacent is, in a great measure, a consequence (1) of the obstacles to direct action on the part of the British authorities in the Gulf, which are inter posed by the position assumed on the Arab coast by the Turkish Government since the Nejd expedition of 1871-72; (2) of the uncertain nature of that position; and (3) of the practical inabi ity of the Ottoman officials to maintain order even along that part of the coast where Turkish influence is strongest. ' This being so, it appears to Lord Cranbrook to be important to determine, as speedily as possible, with whom shall ivst responsibility for order along the coast, whether with the Government of India alone, or with the Porte alone, or with the two Governments conjointly. &lt;f His Lordship has considered with attention the views of Lord Lytton's Government on this point, expressed in their despatch No. 127, dated the 22nd May last, and also those of Lord Salisbury, as set forth in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of the 23rd August. 'The Government of India recommend that from Bussorah to Ojair the authority of the Porte should be recognized as established on land, but that at sea the Brinsh Government should continue to exercise some concurrent protectorate, pursuing pirates, if necessary, into Turkish waters, and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits, through the Resident in the Gulf; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish author ity should not be recognized except at El Bidaa on the Guttur peninsula; and that the Porte should be required («) to stipulate not to interfere, either on tue coast or inland, with the105 Tmcial Chiefs between Odied and Kas-el Kliyma; (i) to recognize the territories of the Sheiks of Bahrein as unler the protection of Great Britain; and (c) in case of piracies from within it jurisdiction, to enfoice restitution of plundered property, aud payment of compensation. ' Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreiprn Affairs ^observes, with reference to these proposals, that in the absence of inducements the Porte is not likely to assent to the suggested limitations of its sovereignty or jurisdiction, or to independent action of another power in territory or waters admitted to the Turkish. Lord Salisbury, therefore, su-ggests that it would be more practical, and more in accordance with usage, that having settled for ourselves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction m iy be exercised, and beyond which it whould be rejected or opposed, we should, as a general rule, look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police io those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Turkish waters under special circmnstances, when the consent of the local authorities has been obtained. 'The principal objection to the course recommended by the Government of India appears to Lord Cranbrook to be that it involves a previous understanding with the Porte which His Lordship agrees with Lord Salisbury in thinking scarcely possible of attainment Apart from the notorious difficulty of negotiation with the Turkish Government upon any subject, the past correspondence in reference to Nejd and Bahrein indicates that upon this particular question that Government is likely to be found specially impracticable, and that it is hopeless to expect that the Porte could be induced to record, in even the most informal diplomatic document, its assent either to limitation of its authority in Arabia or to anything like a joint maritime protectorate with the British Government along any part of the coast., and, still less, to an exclusive British protectorate over Bahrein. ' It must further, from past experience, be regarded as very improbable that any under taking on the part of the Turkish Government to enforce from third parties restoration of plundered property and payment of compensation would be operative in practice. On this point, the complete absence of result from the representations made at Constantinople in 1876 and 1877, in reference to the cases of the British Indian subjects, Cheyla and Kama, and the attack on an Abuthabi boat in the harbour of El Bidaa, are significant. ' Lord Cranbrook, on the other hand, fears that the course suggested in Sir J. Pauncefote's letter of the 28rd August, while it would probably be little less distasteful to the Porte than that proposed by the Government of India, would fail to attain the object in view. ' If adopted, the authority and responsibility of the Turkish Government would be recog nized as complete within certain territorial limits to be fixed by ourselves, and would be wholly disallowed bejond these limits. ' The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to he defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point vorth of Ojdir, which is opposite the southern extremity of the island of Bahrein ; hut it is precisely between that spot and Kateef that, smce the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odeid was broken up in 187S, the operations of the piratical tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity. Upon this point Lord Cranbrook would invite Lord Salisbury's attention to Colonel Ross' letter of the 8thMay, enclosed in Government of India's despatch No. 91 of the 28th July last, which was communicated to the Foreign Office on the 6th instant. 4 ' His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognising any particular part of the Arab coast and the waters adjacent as Turkish, and as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken advantage of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would he unable to control without a considerable and permanent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, which the Forte had declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on politi* cal grounds. ' The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord CranbrooJc is led is that negotiation or discussion with the Torte on the territorial question should be avoided; hwt that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fuelled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to adopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of El-Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points. ' It seems to Lord Cranbrook that Her Majesty's Government have a right to regard the fact of particular ports being used as ba«es for piratical attacks, and certain tribes being en gaged in those attacks, as prima facie evidence that such ports and such tribSs are not under the effective control of the Ottoman Government, and that they would be justified in issuing instructions to their officers in accordance with this view. ' Lord Cranbrook is further of opinion that, having regard to the repeated assurances given by the Turkish Government in 1871-72, at the time of the operations in Nejd, that no iaterference with the littoral tribes was intended, and to the as often repeated declaration of106 the British Government that it would object to any disturbance of the ttatus quo as regardg those tribes, Her Majesty's Government might, if it were deemed expedient, legitimately decline to recognize any part of the coast soutb ef Koweit as subject to Turkey, even if Ottoman authority were established there much more firmly than is really the case. ' Provided, however, that no obstacles be interposed to any operations which may b© qecessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interference is attempted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from Odeid to Ras-el-Khyma, or with Maskat, Lord Cranbrook does not consider that exception need be taken to the proceedings of the Turks at any point of the coast north of Odeid. In expressing this opinion, His Lordship does not forget that the Government of India vfould restrain the Porte from extending its influence beyond Ojair • but, subject to the condi tions above stated. Lord Cranbrook does not see any sufficient reason for objecting to the establishment of such relations between the Turkish authorities in EI-Hassa and the tribes ol the Guttur peninsula to the north of Odeid, as may be agreeable to the parties concerned. It will have been gathered from the foregoing remarks that, in Lord Cranbrook's opinionf it is essential to the restoration and maintenance of order in the Persian Gulf, that no merely nominal extension of Turkish authority should be permitted to hamper the action of the officers of the British Government, and that His Lordship would desire a return, as far as possible, to the system followed until within the last few years, under which the Resident at Bushire, and the British Naval authorities acting under his orders dealt directly with the Arab tribes along the entire littoral, captured piratical craft wherever they might be found, and ex acted from tha local Sheikhs redress for outrages committed by their people. tinder instructions which were issued by the Admiralty in the month of May last, the Commanders of Her Majesty's ships in the Gulf are prohibited from hostile action within Turkish territory or its waters, without the consent or co-operation of the Turkish authorities. Lord Cranbrook would suggest that these instructions should be modified, and that naval officers should be authorized, when so directed by the Resident in the Gulf, to act in any particular case in such wise as may be necessary for the capture and punishment of marauders, collision with Turkish cruisers or troops being, of course, scrupulously avoided. If, upon further consideration, Lord Salisbury should be prepared to acquiesce in the policy above suggested, it might, Lord Cranbrook thinks, be left to the discretion of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, either to intimate to the Porte at once the determina tion of Her Majesty's Government, or to await a remonstrance against the action of the British authorities in some particular case. The pretensions, however, which Abdulla Pasha the Governor-General of Bubso rah, hag lately asserted, to regard all ports in Southern and Eastern Arabia, including Bahrein and Maskat as Turkish should, in Lord Cranbrook's opinion, be distinctly negatived and the oppor tunity might, perhaps, be taken of intimating plainly to the Porte that, so far as Eastern Arabia is concerned, to whatever extent Turkish supremacy may eventually be admitted by the littoral tribes north of Odied, Her Majesty's Government will not recognize its extension over either the Tru.cial Chiefs, or the Sultan of Muscat, I am, in conclusion, directed to state that Lord Cranbrook concurs in the view which Lord Sali-bury takes of the proposal for a revision of treaty relations between the British Government and Sheikh of Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs and the Ruler of Maskat, which is contained in the India letter of 22nd May last. It does not seem to Lord Cranbrook that closer connection with those Arab potentates is necessary or expedient in British interests, or that any object, which cannot otherwise be obtained, would be gained by exacting from them tribute or any other formal recognition of British supremacy. The policy of the Indian Government has always been to abstain from interference in the disputes and conflicts oi; the Arab tribes on land, and a departure from that policy, to which closer relations might very well lead, would almost certainly result in embarrassment. ''Lord Cranbrook will reply to the Government of India in the above sense,, so soon as he may be favored with Lord SalisburyVviews on the main question which is the subject of this letter.' 413. The three different proposals as to the manner inwhieh Turkish juris diction in the Persian Gulf should be dealt with may be summarized as follow:— i,—The# Government of India recommended the recognition of Turkish jurisdiction within certain specified limits, subject to the admission of British concurrent jurisdiction by sea, under certain defined contingenoies. And they are ayerse from any further extension of Turkish authority. ii.—The English Poreign Office opposed the establishment of concurrent jurisdiction or a joint police, and advise the recognition of Turkish authoritywithin limits to be settled by the British Government, and its absolute repudi ation beyond those limits. Ordinarily, the Turks should be held reponsible for the maintenance of a proper police within their own jurisdiction, but British operations in Turkish territorial waters would be permissible in special cases with the previous consent of the local authorities. iii.—The India Office was against any definition of the limits of Turkish jurisdiction. Mere pretensions to sovereignty on the part of the Turks should not be allowed to hamper British action. But where Turkish authority has been, or may hereafter be, effectually established in any part of the coast north of Odeid—the islands of Bahrein being excepted—it must be recognized. Further, provided that no obstacles were interposed to any operations which might be necessary to preserve the peace of the seas and to punish marauders, and that no interference was attempted either with Bahrein or the Trucial Chiefs from Odeid to Ras-el-Khyma or with Maskat, the Turks may be left to establish Ottoman authority as far south as Odeid. The proposals of the Government of India differed essentially from those of the Foreign Office, in that the latter would ordinarily not permit British operations within Turkish jurisdiction. The practical effect of this difference would be found to depend upon the extent of the territorial limits within which the Foreign Office must be prepared to recognize the existence of estab lished Turkish authority. The Foreign Office did not absolutely reject the Indian idea of a joint police. There is an apparent inclination to give the Turks another trial, and to wait the result of the renewed and more vigor* ous measures which they have promised to initiate. 414. The views of the InSia Office, it will be seen, had undergone a com plete change. In Sir L. Mallet's letter, dated 1st August, Lord Cranbrook concurred generally in the proposals of the Government of India, more especi ally in the suggested definition of the liniits of Turkish authority. In Sir L. Mallet's subsequent letter the inexpediency of any such definition constitutes the distinctive feature of Lord Cranbrook's policy, and special stress is laid upon it. 415. Another point to notice was the suggestion made by Lord Cranbrook in respect to the instructions to be issued for the guidance of naval officers in the Gulf. 416. In March 1879 Colonel Ross wrote to Captain Wodehouse, Com manding Her Majesty's Ship Teazer, intimating that the Government of India had accorded their sanction and approval to naval action against pirates along that portion of the Turkish Arabian coast, of late infested by robber bands, whether within or beyond Turkish territorial waters, to the extent of thorough examination of the coast referred to, recovery of Bahrein vessels stolen by the Bedouins, and removal beyond their reach of boats likely to be seized and used for further depredations. 417. The sanction was given on the condition that the naval officers and the Resident in the Gulf were in accord on the subject, and on the under standing that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland, subject to Turkish authority beyond the reach of the # guns of Her Majesty's ships. 418. Captain Wodehouse referred these instructions to the Naval Com mander-in-Chief, and in due course they were submitted by the Admiralty to the Foreign Office, with an enquiry whether it was the desire of Her Majesty's Government that the course directed by the Indian Government should be adopted. Lord Salisbury felt a difficulty in the absence of further explana tions in expressing concurrence in the measures proposed. He apprehended that in the absence of treaty stipulations, Her Majesty's ships could only deal with piracy jure gentium^ that is piracy committed in the high seas beyond the territorial waters of Turkey, and that any expeditions by them on the mainland, although within reach of the guns of Her Majesty's ships*108 might be the subject of just remonstrance on the part of the Turkish Government, Tn • Telegram, dated 20tli May. answer to the Secretary of State's call* for a full report, the Government of India referred to their despatch of the 22nd May, and, pending- further instructions, the Admiralty desired the officers in command of Her Majesty's ships in the Gulf to take no hostile action within Turkish terri tory or its waters without the consent or co-operation-of the Turkish authorities. 419. It was observed in paragraph 4 of this note that Sir J. Pauncefote's letter, dated 23rd August, dealt also with the subject-matter of two despatches from the Government of India, Nos. 55 and 77, dated, respectively, 22nd Mav and 2Srd June. 4i0. Sir J. Pauncefote intimated that copies of these two despatches would be sent to Sir H. Layard, who would be authorized to use his discretion as to making further representation to the Porte, either with regard to the surrender of Bahrein subjects implicated in the recent raid upon that island, or respecting the expediency of obtaining compensation for those of the sufferers from the various depredations recorded in whom the British Government were interested. Sir H. Layard, it appears, had already supported the application made by Colonel JSixon on the former of these two points in a note verbale, a copy of which has not been communicated to the Government of India. 421. In a later letter, dated 22nd September, Sir J. Pauncefote forwarded copies of further papers received from Sir H. Layard, which show the further steps taken to compel the Turks to adopt vigorous measures in the Persian Gulf. Early in September, in consequejoce of a despatch from the Political Resident at Baghdad on the increase of piracy in the Gulf, Sir H. Layard addressed the following note verbale to the Porte in continuation of previous notes on the same subject:— ' Her Majesty's Ambassador considers it his duty to communicate to the Sublime Porte, and to recommend to its serious consideration the accompanying extracts from a despatch addressed to him by Her Majesty's Consul-General at Baghdad, relating to piracy in Turkish waters in the Persian Gulf. u The Sublime Torte is, no doult i aware that the British Government at a great sacrifice of life and treasure succeeded, after many years, in putting an end to piracy in those waters. Her Majesty s Government can never permit that British interests and commerce should suffer by its revival in consequence of their recognition of Turkish jurisdiction over certain parts of the Arabian coast. It must he quite evident to the Sublime Porte that, if the state of things des cribed h Her Majesty's Consul-General be allowed to continue, Her Majesty's Government will be compelled to take such measures as may he necessary for the protection of British subjects and shipping in the Persian Gulf, would appear from the reports which have reached Her Majesty's Embassy, that the responsibility for this recent revival of piracy mainly rests with Abdulla Pasha, the Governor of Bnsreh, who has shown himself indifferent to the urgent representations made to him on the subject by the British authorities, and has failed to adopt the means required for suppress ing piracy and tor punishing those who have been guilty of it. Her Majesty's Embassy has much satisfaction in admitting that Ahmed Bey, who was sent some months ago to command the Turkish squadron in the Euphrates and the Persian ljult, showed an earnest desire to deal with this grave evil. ' ^ ^ with much regret that Her Majesty's Ambassador has heard of his untimely death. It is to be hoped that his successor will prove equally active and equally determined to discharge the duty confided to him, notwithstanding any opposition that he may receive from Abdulla Pasha. Should, however, the tribes on the Arabian coast over which the Sublime orte claims jurisdiction revert to those,piratical habits from which they were deterred by the action of the British authorities, and should the safety of British shipping and British subjects be again endangered by such piratical attacks as are described in the accompanying documents, the Porte must alone be responsible for the consequence.' xv i. ^ 0 ^ serv ed that in this note verbale Sir H. Layard admits that Turkish jurisdiction on certain parts of the Arabian coast has been re cognized ; and he throws the responsibility for the further continuance of piracies upon the Turkish Government. Apparently it was intended that the action of Her Majesty s Government would be restricted to the measures necessary for the protection of British subjects and shipping in the Gulf.109 follots 2 -— T0 Sir H ' :Laj,ard ' s notethe Turkisl1 Foreign Minister replied as '•No. 181, ' 'S P ome, des aft. etrange, le 8 Septembre 1879 ' Note verbale. ^ w niSt \ e f 68 a ^ ire8 ^tra ; gere S a re^ efc communique avec son annexe au dep. de la marine la note verbale que 1 ambassadeur de S.

The remaining despatches noted by the Secretary of State are No. 91, dated 28th July, and Nos. 102 and 104, dated 1st September. The first of these dealt specially with the losses suffered by the Chief of Bahrein, and explained the action which the British Government was bound by treaty to undertake to recover compensation. . It ^ 1 f enclosed a letter from Colonel Ross, contradicting, for reason given.

Colonel Boss attributed them to the neglect of the Turkish authorities to deal vigorously with the offenders at the beginning. The next despatch is No. 102, dated 1st September, which enclosed papers relating to a fresh piracy by the Beni Hajir and the orders issued to Colonel Boss. The remaining despatch No. 104, dated 1st September, sent home the correspondence relating to the surrender of Ali bin Jabir to the Sheikh of Bahrein.' 423. In continuation of his despatch No. 40 of the 6th November 1879, Political a, May 1880, No. 37. dealt with in the foregoing note, the Sec • /CS n f or^i T n retar y of State in his despatch No. 4 (Secret) of 29th January 1880, forwarded further correspondence between the India and Foreign Offices on the subject of Turkish jurisdiction along the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, and the maintenance of the peace of the seas in those parts. Eor reason explained in the correspondence, the policy suggested by Sir Louis Mallet in his letter of the 17th September (quoted in paragraph 412) was not adopted; but Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was authorized to propose to the Turkish Government an arrangement under which, in the territorial waters of that portion of the mainland, where Ottoman authority had been to some extent established, i.e, along the coast north of Odeid, British cruizers would be allowed sufficient liberty of action for the repression of piracy. 424. In the course of the discussion the Foreign Office submitted to the Law officers of the Crown a point of international law, whether, under the circumstances shown in the correspondence on this subject, and in view of the unwillingness or inability of the Turkish Government to prevent outrages by piratical bands organized in, and emanating from, territories under their authority and jurisdiction. Her Majesty's Government would be justified in authoriaing the commanders of Her Majesty's ships to pursue the pirates and marauders in Turkish waters, and to destroy their strongholds on the Turkish mainland. , 425. The Law oflBcers held that the circumstances, as stated, would not justify such a course. Lord Salisbury therefore considered that there were other and larger considerations of Imperial policy, which rendered it inex pedient to adopt a course in the matter which might be regarded by the Porte as unfriendly and aggressive, or might he pointed out by other powers, as showing an intention of subverting or weakening the Sultan's authority iu a portion of his Asiatic dominions. [C967FDJ110 426. The result was that Sir H. A. Layard was informed that the existing state of affairs could not be allowed to continue, and that the Turkish Govern ment must be called upon co-operate for the suppression of piracy. Her Maiesty's Government proposed for this purpose that the commanders of Her Majesty's ships, charged with the duty of keeping the police of the Persian Gulf, while they would be instructed to pursue their operations, as far as possible, outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid, should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the three-mile limit on that part of the coast, whenever this course of proceed- ino- might seem indispensable to the attainment of their object. It would be understood that in the case of any Turkish vessels of war being within reach, the British cruizer would not act without inviting the co-operation of its com mander, and leaving to him, if he desired it, the principal share in the operations, and further that whenever practicable, the previous consent ^ of any Turkish Governor or similar official on the mainland immediately adjacent would be solicited. In either case any prizes made within recognised Turkish limit would be dealt with according to the wishes of the Turkish authorities. Sir H. Layard was directed to ascertain whether such an arrangement would be accepted by the Sultan's Ministry. 427. In a more confidential communication, Sir H. Layard was instructed that, wherever the Turkish authority was at the time actually and firmly estab* liahed upon the coast, Her Majesty's Government were ready to recognize it % and would he glad to see it accompanied hy a regular and civilized administra tion. Further as regards Maslcat, Bahrein, and the po*se*nons of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and Bas-el-Khyma inclusive, Ber Majesty's Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for am formal declaration from the Borte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of these claims, and considered themselves hound hy their treaty engagements with the several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect to give them practical effect, 428. In discussing the proposals given above, the Ambassador was directed to express these considerations to the Turkish Ministers, in order to show how far the arrangement was intended to extend, and what might be the possible consequences of refusing it. Sir H. Layard was further given discretion to abstain from any attempt at an arrangement of the kind proposed if he thought fit, in which case it might be better simply to leave to Her Majesty's naval officers a certain discretion as to visiting the waters of the El-Hasa coast for police purposes, obtaning the previous consent of the local authorities whenever possible, and taking the risk of remonstrance in other cases. If he considered it advisable to suspend action on these instructions, he was asked to propose an alternative course. In any case, he was, directed to make it clear to the Porte that Her Majesty's Government could not acquiesce in further attempts to meet their representations and overtures by delay and evasion, while the evil which it was desired to repress continued unabated. 429. In His Secret despatch No. 44 of 12th November 1880, the Secretary „ of State forwarded a copy of further Secret, January 1881, o. . correspondence on the subject. From this despatch it appeared that the instructions given to Sir H. Layard were communicated to the Porte by His order in a memorandum by Sir A Sandison. Abedine Pasha, Governor-General of Baghdad, subsequently requested Sir A. Saudison to furnish him in writing with views of Her Majesty's Govern ment. Mr. Goschen took the opportunity thus offered to address the following note to the Governor-General:— « ' Dated Therapia, 7th July 1880. ' From—E ight H on'blb G. J. Goschen , M. P., H. B. M.'s Ambassador at Constantinople, ' To—His Exchlibncy Abbdinb Pashx , Governor-General of Baghdad. ^ I have the hanonr to invite Your Excellency's serious attention to a subject which has been repeatedly brought to the notice of Sublime Porte by Sir H. Layard, the injuryIll inflicted on the commprce of tlie Persian Gulf by the suecpssion of piratical expeditions which have issued during the course of the last two years and upwards from a portion of the coast of Arabia over which the Porte claims to have established its jurisdiction. From the reports which have reached Her Majesty's Embassy of the injuries sustained bv British subjects, or others under British protection from these attacks, it is evident that, unless the marauders are effectually checked and punished, the peaceful traders of those waters will be seriously disturbed. « Certainly there has been no want of courtesy or good-will in the replies which have been returned by the Porte to Six H. Layard's representations. But unfortunately whether from the lack of alacrity on the part of the local officials, or the want of an adequate means for efficient naval or military measures, the assurances of the Central Government have-not; received any practical fulfilment upon the spot. As yet little has been done by the Turkish authorities towards the capture or punishment of the offienders, and so far as Her Majesty s Government are aware, there has been no attempt on their part to obtain the recovery or restitution of the plundered property, and there is too much reason to anticipate that tlie offenders emboldened by the absence of proper measures of prevention will continue their depredations upon a large scale. Indeed, a report has lately reached Her Majesty s Embassy that the Beni Hajir tribe have again been plundering boats of the Gutter coast in the Persian Gulf It U clear that such a state of things should not be allowed to continue either in the interests of the Turkish Government itself, or in that of other countries interested in the commerce of the Persian Gulf. ' It would indeed, be incredible that the Turkish Government should allow any country really and effectively subject to its authority to be made use of in time of peace as a station for the preparation of marauding expeditions directed for purposes of indiscriminate plunder against the commerce of the surrounding waters, and Her Majesty s Government are convinced that the Porte will readily co operate in any plan which may seem well adapted to prevent such a contingency, and the irritating claims and questions to which it cannot tail to give rise. ' Thev would propose for this purpose that the commanders of Her Majesty's ships charged with the duty of keeping the police of the Persain Gulf, while they could be instructed to pursue their operations outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Aden (? sic OdeidU should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the three-mile Umit on that part of the coast whenever this course of proceeding might seem iadispensable to the attainment of their object. 'It would be understood that in case ot any Turkish vessel-of-water being in reach, the British cruiser would not act without the co-operation of the Turkish commander, and leaving to him it he desired it, the principal share lu the operations, and further that, whenever practicable the previous consent of any Turkish Governor, or similar official on the mainland immediately adjacent, would be solicited. ' In either case any prizes made within recognized Turkish limits could be dealt with according to the wishes of the Turkish authorities. &lt;i I have now the honour to request that Your Excellency will take this matter into your consideration, and that you will have the goodness to inform me at an early opportunity whether the Sub ime Porte is disposed to enter into an engagement of the nature described above, the tendency of which would be rather to establish than in any way to dimmish the Sultan's authority in the districts concerned.' 430. Mr. Goschen at the same time forwarded the following memorandum by Mr, Flowden:— ' MEMORANDUM. tt Turkish Jurisdiction, on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf % &lt;( 1 It appears that in the recent correspondence on the subject of Turkish jurisdiction in the Gulf the British Government has used expressions which amount to an acquiescence in the existence of some Turkish authority on the El-Hassa coast, consequently Your Excellency has resolved to conclude with the Ottoman Government an arrangement of the kind described in Foreign Office No. 12 of 5th January, and to reject the alternative policy suggested in another Foreign Office despatch No. 13 of the same date. ir i venture to say on this point is that an arrangement of the kind contemplated in despatch No. 12, based as it is upon a definite recognition of Turkish sovereignty, may be expected to facilitate the establishment of Turkish claims on the Arabian coast generally, and will thereby strengthen in a very considerable degree the advantage already gamed by the Porte from the tenor of recent correspondence. Putting aside this correspondence, with the precise nature of which I am not acquainted, valid objections of exist to the Turkish title both in El-Hassa and elsewhere on the coast. The conclusion of the proposed arrangement\vil], it appears to me, stop tKe British Government from pleading 1 those objections on any future occasions. The admissions which have been made, However much they are to be regretted, are perhaps still capable of being explained away, but once an arrangement has been concluded which formally reco^nipes the Turkish claims, we shall not be able to wq behind ifc. Again, while it is possible that serious considerations may influence the Porte to accept the contemplated arrangement, it is also conceivable that they may after some dis cussion and correspondence back out of it. They may take the ground that their sovereio-a ri f• ^ Xten( ^. £ar be ? 0W E l-Hassa, and that they cannot consent to any understanding bv whicli these rights will be abbreviated In this event the fact of our having endeavoured to conclude the arrangement, whereby Turkish sovereignty on the El-Hassa coa^t was acknowled ged, would place us in a worse position logically than that which we now occupy in conse- qupnce of the language of passed communications. It would, for instance, augment the diniculty now felt m sanctioning local visits for police purposes by British men-of-war. With regard to the arrangement itself, I beg to suggest— (1.) That its operation be confined— ' {a) to the El-Hassa coast and waters, and ' W to tIl0S ? Portions of that coast where Turkish authority may for the time being actually and firmly established. (2.) That pirate captured by British officers in pursurance of the provisions of the arrangement bp dealt with under the orders of the Eesident at Baghdad or the -ttesident at Bushire as may be most convenient. r ®» ar( * ^ (6) the Foreign Office despatch proposes the recognition of Turkish Fo ft rj ' er r t t r Urk,Sl ; aUth0 . r ty i6 at the ^ ent ^6,.^ e tab shed ior the words 'at the present t.me ' I p.-opose to substitute the words ' for the time beint ' JL n0 o ^VVohMetUtthe Turks may be ousted from the positions which tbey now „„ • a °r 'f .^^.^.ntosrency should arise, we should be relieved from the obli- futhoritv otST' k T , 0n any !;iTen P art of Ule C(,ast ' ^e moment Turkish authority ceased to be actively and firmly established there.

In the face, however, of a report received from the Law officers of the Crown and of^ other considerations, Lord Salisbury was reluctant to sanction so decided a course, and, under these circumstances, Lord Cranbrook felt that he had no alternative but to acquiesce in an attempt, m the nrst instance, to come to s^ine friendly arrangement with the Porte. ' As regards Mr. Plowden's objections, lam directed to state that his memorandum as Mr. Croschen observes, reproduces the views of the Indian Foreign Office which were fullv con sidered when the correspondence of last year was in progress. With respect to the territorial limits within which Ottoman jurisdiction might recognized, it was then deliberately decided that, while interference either at Odeid, or with Bahrein, or with the coast occupied bv the Crucial Chiefs, and the Sultan of Maskat, should not be permitted, there was no sufficient reason—provided the peace of the seas was preserved—for objecting to such relations between the Turkish authorities in El-Hassa and the tribes to the north of Odeid as miuht be ao-reeable to the parties concerned. D ' Lord Hartington is of opinion, therefore, that Mr. Goschen's proceedings should be approved. His Lordship would, however, suggest that the particular attention of His Excel lency should be drawn to paragraph 2 of Lord Salisbury's 4 very confidential' despatch, No 18 of the 5th January last, which refers to possible Turkish pretensions over Maskat, Bahrein and the possessions of the Trucial Chiers and re-affirms the aften declared policy of Her Majesty s Government in respect to those territories. ' It also appears to Lord Hartington to be very desirable that Mr. Goschen should not permit himself to be entangled in any discussion with the Porte on the territorial question but that, in the event of reply to his note being either long delayed, or evasive, or otherwise unsatisfactory in tenor, the negotiations at Constantinople should be dropped. It would then be for consideration whether the policy suggested in my letter of 17th September 1879 should tinf. no ruvprfo/i fn r A copy of this letter was forwarded to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople for his guidance in negotiations with the Porte. In a subsequent despatch to the Foreign Office, Mr. Goschen suggested secret, January i88i, No. iic. should he be unable to obtain any satisfactory offer of an arrangement from the Porte, the commanders of Her Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf might be instructed not to allow themselves to be too much hampered by the three-mile limit in pursuing and capturing pirates, especially as the Turkish authority on the coast was at so many points of a very shadowy description. 434. This despatch was sent to the India Office, and Lord Hartington con curred with Lord Granville in thinking that the Porte should be called upon' for a reply to Mr. Goschen's note of the 7th July 1880, which, as already shown proposed that, subject to certain restrictions, Her Majesty's cruizers should be permitted to act freely within the territorial waters of that portion of the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf where Turkish authority was imperfectly established. Should that reply be delayed, or be unsatisfactory in tenor, His Lordship was of opinion that Her Majesty's ships engaged in the suppression of piracy in the Gulf should he instructed not to permit their operations to be hampered by considerations connected with Ottoman claims to jurisdiction along the coast. Mr. Goschen was accordingly instructed, on the 26th October 1880 to press for a reply from the Porte to the proposals contained in his note'to Abedine Pasha of the 7th July 1^80. 435.

The Resident in the Gulf remarked that, as the depredations of the tribe were committed from ' districts under Turkish occupation', the Turkish Go vernment was responsible in the matter. The Government of India merely for warded the papers to the Secretary of State. 437. The India Office then addressed the Foreign Office and drew atten- 4, Political e., February 1884, No, 178. ti0n t0 remarks about the responsibility of the Turkish Government. 438. Shortly after his first report, the Resident sent another (dated the 26th a . Political e „ Octobor 1883, No. is, July 1883) This showed that four slaTes, who formed part of the plunder carried off by the Beni Hajir robbers, had been restored by the Turkish authorities of Katif. The Government of India forwarded the papers to the Secretary of State, and noticed that, in this instance the Turkish authorities had taken action^ 439. The Secretary of State sent on the papers to the Foreign Office. Mean- a , Political e„ Fcbrnar, 1881, No., 179-181. while the Foreign _ Office had communi- eated with Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople on the subject of Colonel Eoss' first report (dated the 14th June 1883) of the robbery. His Excellency stated in reply that the Turkish version of the occurrence was quite different from that given by Colonel Ross, and that the Vali of Baghdad would be instructed to have the case thoroughly in vestigated again. 440. When the foreign Office had received this report from Her Majesty's ibid,So i8i. Ambassador and the second report from .. ■%, /-\yy» .i , , ,, , Colonel Ross, Lord Granville proposed to the India Office that he should ** inform the Earl of Dufterin that Her Mmes- iy's Government are of opinion that the matter should be allowed to drop, as they do not consider it desirable to raise the question of Turkish sovereiantv over these coasts:' * ¥ 441.

Thereupon Her Majesty's Ambassador was informed by telegram— 'Piracy by Bsdonms in Persian Gulf. Matter should be allowed to drop as it is' IKd, No. 188. not desirable to raise question of Turkisli so- rereignty.'116 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (V) Piracies in Katif and Bahrein waters in 1886. 440. In October 1886, the Officiating Resident, Busbire, (Colonel Miles) eitemai a., January 1887, No® 5i 63 (No. 5i). reported that the Chief of Bahrein had complained to him of piracies committed on his subjects by the Beni-Hajir Bedouins of Katar. Colonel Miles sent the complaint on to the Resident in Turkish Arabia for ' such action as he might deem proper.' It was then observed m the Foreign Office that the Resident in the Gulf evidently regarded the country ( m ?., the Katar coast) of the offen ders as within Turkish limits, while Her Majesty's Government had concluded *at the end of 1883 that it was not desirable to raise the question of Turkish sovereignty in this neighbourhood. The attention of the Resident in the Gulf and Turkish Arabia was therefore drawn to the views of Her Majesty's Govern- Extemau, May 1837, N ob. 108.125 (No. io7&gt; nient on the subject. Colonel B oss re plied by letter No. 179, dated 31st Decem ber 1886, sending a copy of a letter he had circulated to 41 the various petty Chiefs of Katar and Jasim-bin-Mahomed Thani of Bidaa.'* This merely called upon them to co-operate in stopping depredations ' as the sea is under the protection of the British Government ' It might be noted here that in September 1883 tthe Turkish Ambassador was informed that Her Majesty's Government were not prepared ' to waive the right which they had exercised at intervals during a long period of years of dealing directly with the Arab Chiefs of the Katar coast, when necessary, in order to preserve the peace of the seas, or to obtain redress for outrages on British subjects or persons entitled to British protec tion'. This decision and the general responsibility accepted by the British Government in regard to the security of the waters of the cover Colonel Boss^ circular; and besides Bahrein subjects along the coast might base a special claim to British protection on articles 2 and 3 of the Bahrein convention, dated the SlstMaj 1861, 441. Colonel Ross* letter proceeded to discuss the applicability to the Katif coast of the conclusion formed by Her Majesty's Government in 1883 about Turkish sovereignty . On this coast, he said, piracies or robberies were mostly impossible to deal with M direct' {i.e., with the local or tribal Chiefs) because • 4 Katif is wholly and completely in Turkish possession.' He added that w we have over and over again recognised' the Turkish occupation of Katif, and that m such recognition does not necessarily apply to other parts of the Arabian coast.'* Moreover, he thought that the view of 1883 had special reference to the circumstances of the particular case, in which partial repara tion had been obtained and would not be held in regard to outrages committed with impunity under the shadow of the Turkish flag. The Resident therefore hoped that the matter might be referred again to Her Majesty's Government. 442. Colonel Ross also reported in his letter No. 172, dated 23rd December External ▲., May 1888, Nos. 103-105 (No. 103). c ^tain sailors belonging to Bahrein boats had been plundered m the port of Katif which was under Turkish occupation.' -ColoBel. Ross asked whether he should or should not protest' against the lawlessness prevailing about Katif.' He did not think that such a protest would have any practical result; but as, ' this outrage occurred actually in the waters of Katif where the de facto jurisdiction of Turkey had repeatedly been reeognised, ,, he suggested that 41 perhaps it might be well to go through the form of protesting.' With refrence to^this suggestion the^uestion was whether Her Majesty's Government had not objected to raising the question of Turkish sovereignty over the (ad jacent) Katar coast, and whether the same considerations applied to the Katif coast. 413. In this (the Katif) part of the case the questions for consideration were-^ Jirst, and whether the Resident in the Gulf should or should not formally protest 44 against the lawlessness prevailing about Katif,' and secondly, whether a reference should or should not be made to the Secretary of State about the applicability to the Katif coast of the view taken in 1883 regarding iurkish sovereignty. • See para. 440, ante, f tee Katur Freeis,444. The Eesident's statements regarding the Turkish occupation of Katif as distinguished from other parts of the Arabian Coast of the Gulf were quite correct. The despatches cited in chapter eleventh were sufficient to show that Katif was, and is recognised as being, in the effective possession of the Turks, and that other parts of the Arabian Coast were not so, and were not recognised as being so. 445. It was further clear from correspondence summarised above (see Section III Chapter Eighth) that the Turkish possession of the Katif coast had been frequently recognised by complaints against the Turkish authorities on account of outrages committed in that neighbourhood. In 1882 Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, on the representation of the Resident in Turkish Arabia, addressed a special and general protest to the Porte on the subject. In these circumstances the Government of India asked the Secretary of State s definite instructions whether it was still desired by Her Majesty's Gov ernment that representations to the Porte should not be made in respect of piracies committed off the Katif coast (Despatch j S t o . 44, dated 11th April 1887). 446. The following instructions were then issued to Sir W. White by external a., augnst 1887, nos. ioo-io5. Her Majesty s Government in June 1887 :— , z Her Majesty 't Government have on several occasions recognized the fa izoio authoritv of the Urkish Government over the Katif Coast, although they have had reason on more than one occasion to complain that tt xs not exercised efficiently for the repression or punishment of such act*, ™ those reported tn the enclosed papers. Her Majesty's Government have, on the other hand, refused to admit that the Sultan has any rights of sovereignty over the Katar Coast and have c aimed right of dealing directly with the Chiefs on that coast. A correspondence took place 0I mi fi 1S i ? )et ^ eem ^? ld Granville and Musurus Pasha, in 1883, of which Your Excelkncv will find copies m the archives of Her Majestiy's Embassy. th, 18 h 87 t t he ? arl 0f Pf erin re P or,ed . that he had aiMre ^d a representation to the Poite on the subject of an act of piracy committed on a Bharein boat by the Beni Haiir Arabs residing m the neighbourhood of Katif. A promise was given to make renquiry into the matter and to send the necessary instructions to prevent any recarrenee of such lot. The report however which was received from the Wali of Baghdad was of sn unsatisfactorv character and entirely at variance with the account received from the British authorities It even denied that any tribe of the name given existed in the neighbourhood of Sf Lord Dufferm as reported m his despatch No. 6t(3 of 26th October 1883, thereupon presented a memoiandum to the Porte, reiterating the details of the outrage, and the Minfster Affairs ? reneyed investigation.

When Her Majesty's Government were apprised of these acts of External a ., August 1888 Nos. 411.446 (No. 412 they caused Sir W. White to a .) address a note veroale to the Porte in July 1887J in which reference was made to several representations made to the Porte previously about the piracies in the Katif waters, and while disclaiming any intention of discussing the rights claimed by each Power along the Coast, it was pointed out that ' posses sion of any territory entails ohligations and that any acta of negligence gives q corresponding right of compensation' 449. About the 12th of November 1887 the British Embassy at Constanti- External a ., August 1888. Nos. 271.400. no pl e ma(ie further strong representations to the Porte and warned the Ministers of the Interior and Marine ' that the time has come for me to report to* Eer [C967ED]118 Majesty's Oovernment the uselessness of looking to the Forte for the re-estab lishment of security in the waters of the Persian Oulf and the necessity of taking the matter into our own hands' (Despatch dated 14ith November 1887). 460, On 29th November 1887, Sir W. A. White reported that he had again made a representation to the Grand Hid, No. 845. Vizier. Hia Highness said, that a second gun-boat had been despatched te the Katif waters and that the enquiries insti tuted by the first gun-boat had led lo the discovery of only one case of ' robbery It was then pointed out to His Highness that there could be no doubt as to the number of the piracies reported to Her Majesty's Government, and it was urged that no satisfactory results could be got unless action was taken by land. 451. In December 1887 Mr. Bobertson (Consul at Basrah) pointed out the necessity of taking action against the Beni jm. No. 859. Hajirs, by land, since these pirates were not sea-farring people. He also described the naval force of the Turks pre sent in the Persian Gulf, and expressed the opinion that ' any material increase in the Turkish naval power in those waters which might result from pressure in connection with robberies of boats off the Katif Coasts would be almost un desirable than themselves, and that for every reason action on land should be urged rather than action at Sea, 452. Quoting this remark of Mr. Robertson, Sir W. A. 'White in hi 8 v despatch dated 18th [February 1888, men- External A., August 1888, Nos. 411-441, (No .4J0), ^ Turkish ship8 had p r0 . ceeded to the Persian Gulf, and that it was in contemplation to send additional ships, and observed :— ' I do not see how, after having on various occasions urged the Turkish Government to take steps for the supression of piracies in the the Persian Gulf, I can now make any objec tion to the reinforcement of their naval force in those waters.' 453. There were reported two or three more piracies on the Katif Waters , v in April and May 1888. But this time Kiternal A&gt;, August 1888, Nofl. 441-446 (No. 443). w white COIltented l limse lf with calling the attention of the Grand Vizier to these piracies, in view of the opinions expressed above as to the increase of the Turkish naval force in the Persian Gulf, and asked for instructions as to further action. Her Majesty's b d No 444 Government, decided that it would be ' ' 0 * • undesirable to take any further steps in the matter in view of the probability of an increase of the Turkish naval force in the Persian Gulf should Her Majesty's Oovernment urge the Ottoman Porte to take more active measures, 464. Colonel Ross did not wholly see the wisdom of this policy, and in fop- KT warding a letter of the Chief of Bahrein External A.. Jauuwy 1888| Nos. 150*177 (No. 159). i • • c 11, l c. ' J ' y complaining of another act of piracy, and pressing for energetic measures being taken to put a stop to the piracies, observed (Letter No. 276 dated 15th September 1888) *' What Sheikh Esau undoubtedly feete most keenly is the continuance of a state of law lessness and insecurity at Katif and in the adjoining waters^ where crime is on the increase. Prom the indifference of the Turkish authorities and consequent impunity to the robbers, the mischief spreads and general insecurity on the seas prevail. Owing to the shallowness of the waters about Katif, vessels of war are nnahle to operate, and the only course open has been to malce remonstrances to the Turkish Government, Although no attempt to afford redress has ever been apparent, still the repeated remonstrances of Her Majesty^s Ambassador at the Porte did, during the Government of Nafiz Pasha at Basrah, pro duce some effect. Since the departure of the Wali and cessation of British remonstrances matters have gone from bad to worse, and the complaint of the Chief of Bahrein is well founded. From the latest correspondence on this subject, forwarded to me under your office docket No. 1558-E., dated 30th July 1888,-1 learn that ifer Majesty's Government consider it un~ desirable to press the Oovernment of the Vorte further in regard to these complaints. I under* •119 stand that Her Majesty's Government have been led to tliis oonclusion, from the promises (1) that an increase of the Turkish Naval force in these waters is undesirable, and {2) that persis tence in urging the Porte to maintain order in their waters of Katif would lead to that undo* tirable increase of Naval force* As the question is one of. much importance in connection with our efiorts to supress piracy in the Persian Gulf, I venture most deferentially to submit for consideration that, in the first place, it is action on the land by the authorities on land and in districts occupied by TurJcey that is required, a fact which might be always dwelt on in communicating with the Turkish Government. Then, it does not appear from the disposition hitherto shown that the Porte attaches much real importance to the supression of piracy, or that they would go to any con siderable expense for that object. Certainly thev might make the representations a pretext for reinforcing their squadron at Basrah ; but then&gt; if they have any wish to do that&gt; they do not require any invitation or permission to do so at any time. However undesirable the increase of the Turkish squadron may be, I would respectfully submit that the continued indifference of the Turkish authorities is seriously injuring our interests and prestige. This latter is an existing and pressing evil; and 1 am disposed to think that the Government of India may attach more importance to it than to the possible addition of another vessel or so to the Turkish Naval force in these waters'* 455. The Foreign Office forwarded a copy of Colonel Eoss's letter to the British Embassy at Constantinople External A. March 1889. No B . 300-302. (Despatch No. 18, dated 16th January 1889) observing : — il I must, however, leave it to Your Excellency's discretion whether you should make any further representations to the Porte on the subject. lam myself inclined to doubt whether under present circumstances such action would be useful or jiftlicious. The Turkish Govern ment must be perfectly well aware that the state of affairs is unsatisfactory, and it has been repeatedly explained to them that what Her Majesty's Government desire is that they should take effective steps to repress plundering expedition from the coast under Ottoman jurisdic tion without endeavouring to extend the jurisdiction beyond its recognized limits. But tU only result which appears to follow representations to this effect is some measure to assist lurkish authority beyond those limits under cover of the restoration of order. It is difficult to suppose that this course of action is unintentional on the part, at all events, of the local authorities, and it seems undesirable to give excuse for proceedings which will cause fresh irritation and suspicion.'120 CHAPTER EIGHTH.

They killed one of the crew and threw the rest into the sea. The Turkish troops were to have gone in pursuit of the robbers; but it is nob reported whether any attempt was made at the time to capture the latter. 2 Ditto The same men then captured a boat belonging- to Basri, killed one of the crew and took everything that could be found; some lucerne grass, date sticks, and even the fails. The Turkish gun-boat Safar appears how ever, to have been despatched lafor on, but the robbers could not be found. July 1891 A shooi of Katif was boarded near Ojair by 18 men of the Beni Hajir tribe. One of the crew was wound ed ; and the pirates carried away fts. 223 in cash some dollars, gear belonging to the shooi, its canoe and sails also two slaves forming part of the crew, and a cousin of the Nakhoda whom they took for a slave. Turkish troops were sent in pursuit, but the robbers could not be found. 4 SOtii August 1891 Some 16 Bedouins of the Beni Hajir tribe attacked a Persian shooi of laluriyeh, containing a cargo of wheat, sheep hides, charcoal and fire-wood intended for Bahrein. Most of the goods were landed at belwa by the robbers, who also carried away property consisting of gold, pearls, copper utensils, clothes, sails, etc., amounting in value to Rs. 2,495. One of the lascars of the shooi was also taken away by the pirates, but he is said to have escaped eventually. The Turkish are said to have taken no action in the matter.121 ? 457. With a view to the suppression and prevention of such piracies, Major Talbot, Political Eesident in the Persian Hid, No. 207» Gulf, i n a letter to Colonel Mockler pro posed to obtain the consent of the Ottoman Government to the action of our cruisers within the Katif waters, either in combination with, or independently of, its own vessels. 4&gt;58.

U p 0n ^ and the following were the instinc- tions which the Poreign Office addressed to Sir Clare Eord in their Despatch of March 1892 « I have received Mr. Fane's despatch No. 68, of the 25th February 1892, forwarding a despatch addressed to him by the Acting Consul-General at Baghdad on the subject of piracy in the Turkish waters of the Persian Gulf. The view of Her Majesty's Government in regard to the action to be taken by the Com manders of Her Majesty's steamships in cases of the kind reported by Colonel Mockler, are contained in Earl Granville's despatch to the Earl of Dufferin, No. 515, of 22nd July 1381, to which 1 have to refer Your Excellency. In consequence of the failure of the Porte to protect British and general commerce in the Persian Gulf, and its refusal to make any special arrangements with Her Majesty's Govern ment by which Her Majesty's steamships should be permitted to pursue pirates withm Turkish waters in places where the Sultan's authority was not well established, new instructions were at that time issued to British Naval officers. They were authorized in future, when necessary* to take such measures as they thought fit for the protection of British commerce and shipping without reference to the Sultan's claims to territorial jurisdiction. The attitude of Her Majesty's Government in this matter should be explained to Colonel Mockler and he thould he informed that they do not consider it advisable to invite the co-opera tion of the Turkish authorities as suggested by Volonel Talbot ) in his despatch of 31st December 1891.' 459.

One of the boats was carried off and secret e., febmary 1900, no. 72. abandoned near Zobarah on the same coast. The total value of the property stolen was over Es. 16,000. Part, to the value of Es. 2,067, was recovered through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katar. (5) On the 17th August 1900, a Bahrein boat was plundered on the Khora pearl bank near Eas Tanaura by men from Daren. One of the Persians in the boat was drowned, and property valued at Es. 3,924 was carried off.

Most of the property belonged to Turkish subjects and was recovered124 oy the Mutassarlf of Hasa who punished the tribe responsible for the outrage. None of the property belonging to the Bahrein owners appears to have been restored. 465. There was considerable delay in taking measures for obtaining redress in the first fourth and eighth of the cases mentioned above. Of these the two piracies which occurred off the coast of Katar in 1899 were reported by Colonel Meade on October 9th, 1899. Colonel Meade then said he would postpone his recommendations for exacting reparation Secret e .. February 1900. Nos. 68-76. until he had consulted the Senior Naval Officer. On the 28th October 1899 he telegraphed that he proposed first to demand restoration of property, or failing this, payment of indemnity, otherwise a punitive expedition could be arranged. We replied by telegram on 2nd November 1899 that Colonel Meade might, at his discretion, demand restoration of property or indemnity, but a punitive expedition would, of course, require distinct sanction from Government. On the 17th November 1899 Colonel- Meade telegraphed that he proposed shortly to visit the Trucial Chiefs and would enquire into the piracies on bis way. 466. On the 2nd of December 1899, Colonel Meade reported that he had enquired into the cases, that some of the property had been recoverd by Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, and that the latter had promised to recover as much as he could of the remainder. Colonel Meade added that he would report again in a month, and that he did not think that anything in the shape of an expedi tion would be necessary. 467. Colonel Meade did not fulfil his intention of reporting again, and we % heard nothing more on the subject until Bwret E., November 1900* N ob . 61-69, (No. 6B). September 1900) when Colonel Kemball, who had succeeded Colonel Meade on 17th April 1900, reported that Ahmed- bin-Thani, as was only to be expected, had taken no steps to recover the remainder of the property and had given a very unsatisfactory reply to the letter which Colonel Kemball had written to him. Colonel Kemball mentioned certain suggestions in the way of reprisal which might be feasible, but made no definite proposals and promised to submit a further report, in which definite recommendations would be made. 468. The next report on the subject is dated the 9th November 1900, . ooftn/lkT in which Colonel Kemball, after finding Secret E., April 1901, Nos. 83-90 (No. 87). , , jj / u • 1 v himself unable to recommend the seizure of the Chief's property in Bahrein, or the despatch of a Naval expedition, expressed the opinion that it would be sufficient if he informed Ahmed-bin- Thani that the Government of India consider him to be responsible for the control of the Bedouins who reside in Katar, and that steps would, if necessary, be taken to bring this responsibility home to him. He also proposed to require the Sheikh to warn all boat owners to be careful not to allow their boats to be used by the Bedouins; as in future the owners of the boats used by pirates would be held responsible. The Government of India concurred in these proposals. 469. The third case of piracy, which occurred in August 1900, was reported xr x. i n /\rt xt in September 1900 ; no suggestion was Secret E., November 1900, Nos. 61-69. i £ £ • i.* 5 xi,* made for enforcing reparation tor this case until October 1901, when Colonel Kemball reported that it might be advisable to attack the Chief's property in Bahrein, and even then no definite proposal was made. 470. In December 1901, Colonel Kemball submitted certain proposals in connection with these piracies. These proposals and the orders passed by the Government will be clear on perusal of Foreign Department letter to Colonel Boss. No. 429 E. A., dated 6th February 1892 ''Your letter deals with three cases of piracy, two of which occurred in August 1899, whila the third dates from August 1900. In the third case the stolen property is valued at Rs. 815-8 only, but ill two earlier cases property of the value of more than Rs. 12,000 is alleged to hav®125 teen plundered. It is understood that of the property stolen in the two piracies which occurred in August 1899, a portion, valued at about Rs. 2,067, has been recovered by Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, the Ruling Sheikh of Katar, but that no effort has been made by him to recover the remainder of the property which was looted on those two occasions or to exact redress from the Bedouins who committed the smaller outrage at Graimia Pearl Bank in August 1900. You may suggest that, in order to obtain compensation for the sufferers by these piracies, the property of the Katar Chief in Bahrein should be attached, or that, as an alternative, the cases should be allowed to drag. A third alternature which was suggested in your letter No. 270, dated the 19th November 1900, would be to send a boat expedition to punish the villages from which the pirates embarked. The Government of India have decided, in view of the time which has elapsed since the occurrence of these piracies, and of certain pre-occnpations in other parts of the Persian Gulf, that active measures for the exaction of redress from the Sheikh of Katar or from the offend ing villages cannot now be wisely or profitably undertaken, and that the cases must be allowed to drop. Having regard, however, to the language held by Colonel Meade to the Sneikh m November 1899, the Government of India have come to their present decision with reluctance, and they cannot but regret that, owing to the want of definite proposals from the successive Political Residents, the opportunity for exacting full and timely reparation for these outrages should have been allowed to pass. In the opinion of the Government of India, some speedy measures of redress should be adopted in future if such outrages are repeated; and, in the event of any fresh case of piracy occurring off the Katar peninsula, the Political Resident should not only cause the property of the Katar Chief in Bahrein to be attached until redress is oiven, but should also submit proposals at once for a boat expedition against the^ villages immediately concerned, if that appears to be the best and most effective method of mtiicting punishment and enforcing reparation.' [C967FD]126 CHAPTER EIGHTH. (IX)—Piracies in 1902 and proposal of the Chief of Bahrein to main tain an armed dhow for pursuit of pirates, 1902-1903. 471. In 1902 there was recrudescence of piracies in the vicinity of Katif secret e., january 1904, nos. 118-139. and Bahrein, committed hj a party of Bern Hajir under the leadership of the notorious Ahmed-bin-Selman. In July 1902 they stopped a boat at Seaalis, with which they crossed to the island of Urn Nasan, and on 4th August captured a Bahrein dhow of 28 tons burden, which was lying there to load lime for Bahrein, by means of which dhow, some ten days later they waylaid and robbed another Bahrein boat of Thaein in the Katar peninsula, of property valued at $ 5,400. 472. In his letter No. 167, dated 8th December 1902, Colonel Kemball No 12 3 reported that Ahmed-bin-Selman belonged to the A1 Khalifa branch of the Bahrein Sheikhs, and had been once a subject of Bahrein, but had long since turned an outlaw. He first settled on Katar but had removed to Katif before the recent piracies were committed. In these circumstances the chief of Katar could not be held responsible for these piracies. The chief of Bahrein proposed that he should be permitted to employ an armed dhow in pursuit of the pirates. He believed that a small vessel like a dhow at his disposal *could pursue the pirates'boats at a moment's notice and with great facility and quickness in the narrow channels between Katif and Katar, and Colonel Kemball was inclined to think (paragraph No 1 33 &lt; last of his letter No. 167, dated 8th Decem ber 1902), that the chief might be given the permission applied for on the following conditions :— (i) That the permission of the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein be obtained in the first instance; (ii) that one of the Chief's sons or other responsible person be put in charge of the boat; (iii) that the operations of the boat be confined to the seas between a point north of Ras Tanoura and eastward round of the Katar peninsula towards the neighbourhood of Bidaa. 473. The Government of India then addressed the following letter to Sir C. C. Drury, Commanding His Majesty's Naval Eorces, East Indies Station (No. 675-E., dated 16th April 1903):— Under the terms of the agreement which he executed in 1861, the Sheikh of Bahrein ]y 0&gt; 124 hound to abstain from any act of aggression or retaliation at sea, and any departure from the piinciple of this agreement might be attended by undesirable risks. At the same time there would probably be considerable advantage in making some special arrangement for the patrolling or policing of the waters in this neighbourhood; not only oq account of the increased security which should result, but also from the point of view that earlier and more accurate information might, if suitable measures were adopted, be obtained as to the condition of affairs on the neighbouring mainland. In the circumstances, I am to invite any suggestions or advice which Your Excellency may be in position to offer on the subject. The alternatives which present themselves to the Government of India are: (i) the maintenance at Bahrein of an armed dhow of the class that has, it is understood, been recently employed with good effect in checking piracy and the trade in arms in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea; or (ii) the maintenance by the Sheikh, at his own expense, of a dhow manned by his own subjects, but which would be commanded by a junior British officer lent from the Royal Navy or from the Royal Indian Marine, to ensure that it only employed for proper purposes. If Your Excellency is able to propose any precise arrangemeiits, I am to request that an estimate of the probable cost may, if possible, be furnished. On receipt of Your Excellency's reply, the Government of India propose to addrew His Majesty's Secretary of State.127 474. His Excellency Sir C. Drury's ieply was as follows (letter dated 26th April 1903) :— In reply to your confidential letter No. 675-E., the ISth April, be pleased to inform His Excellency the Viceroy in Council that I consider that the agreement made with the Sheikh of Bahrein in 1861, to abstain from any act of aggression or retaliation by sea should still be adhered to as, if it was cancelled, complications might easily arise. I would desire to point ont that in my opinion the results achieved by the use o£ armed dhows in the Gulf of Aden have not been as great a success as is generally supposed, and it is very demoralising service for officers and men. The brst course appears to me to be that I should be informed every year when the pearl fishery is to begin and end, and I would then endeavour to arrange for a gun-boat to police thosa waters during the time the fishery was being carried out. If it is decided that an armed dhow is necessary, I am of opinion that ehe should be commanded by a Royal Indian Marine officer who would require a commission from the Admiralty ; the vessel would fly the white enskrn and be under the orders of the Naval Commander-in-Chief on this station, and be a tendered to the Senior Naval Officer's ship in the Persian Gulf. She might be provided and maintained by the Sheikh of Bahrein and partly manned by his subjects, as his interests are primarily affected, but he could have absolutely no control over her movements and actions on the high seas. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, the Consul General at Berbera has recently bought and equipped two armed dhows, and could give you all details, so as to enable an estimate of the cost of one to be arrived at. As far as I am aware, they have each one 3 pounder quick-firing gun. Two Europeans, one as Captain and one as Mate, The Captain receives £ 120 a year. The services of his dhows are confined to the territorial waters of British Somaliland. The dhows recently employed by the Royal Navy in the Gulf of Aden for the suppression of the arms traffic were hired by us at the rate of Rs. 225 a month, which included the services o£ the native crew. The guns, fittings, etc., were supplied by the ships to which the dhows were attached.' 475. When Lord Curzon visited Bahrein and had an interview with the chief on 26th November 1903, the latter said that there had been no piracy in the year, and he did not mention the matter of the armed dhow then or later. Rear Admiral Atkinson Willes told His Excellency that the difficulty was that an armed dhow under the Sheikh could not operate beyond his territorial waters. The admiral suggested that the Government of India shamed arm, the dhow, if this was really required. Lord Curzon agreed that the matter might stand over till we knew if we should have to strengthen our agency at Bahrein in view of the customs arrangements and the settlement of foreigners on the island (see extract of Mr. Dane's note, dated 27th November 1903, on page 18 of Secret E., January 1904, Nos. 118-139.) 476. So far as the Turkish Government is concerned, it appears from Mr. Crow's report, dated 17th August 1903, Bact. to Pro. No. 138. that ^ Mutagsarif of Hasa took m easureS for the Persian and capture of Ahmed-bin-Salman, but without any success, and that he had fled towards Koweit side. His break by default before the Court of Cessation in Nejd was proceeding at the time. 477. In March 1903 a large body of the Behaik Arabs came to a place called Tharan, south of Katif, whose object, it was feared, was to commit piracies on the pearl fishing boats and other boats, plying between Bahrein, Katif and Ojair. The chief of Bahrein asked for permission to attack them with the double purpose of taking revenge and getting the coast rid of their presence. The Political Eesident was opposed to this request being granted, but suggested that might be given the permission alluded to in the last paragraph of his letter No. 167, dated 8th December (Telegram dated 22nd May 1903). No 12£) 478 The Government of India tele graphed back to him on 26th May—- ' Bahrein chief must n^t attack Behaik Arabs. If Bahrein is threatened or there is risk of serious piracies, naval authorities should be asked to take necessary preoautions.'128 CHAPTER NINTH- Murder of Sheikh Selman-bin-Diaij-el-Khalifa, a cousin of the Chief of Bahrein and his party about 40 miles south of Katif Question ^of satisfaction and compensation for it- 1900-1904. 4(79. As an instance of Arab inter-tribal feuds and the incapacity of the Secret e, Febru.^ i9oi. No,. 1-4. Turkish Government to control these unruly tribes and their dilatory menectual methods in obtaining redress for the most daring crimes, is furnished to us in a case of the murder of a party of Bahreinese, which has been the subject of correspond ence for some four years. 480. The facts of the case were first reported in Mr. Gaskin's letter No. 219, dated the 12th December 1900. The murdered Sheikh, on the 18th November 1900, crossed to the mainland on a hunting expedition, and took with him his two sons, Diaij and Bishir, a nephew named Abdul llahman-bin-Rashid, 20 followers and four companions, one from the Morra, one from the Ajman, and two from the Beni Hajir as a precaution against molestation from the tribes to which they belonged. A party of about fourteen men of the Dowasir tribe of Bahrein crossed at the same time and encamped near Sheikh Selman. On the 3rd December a large body of the Almorra, Bedouins came on their camels from the interior, and at nightfall, after tethering their camels a few miles from Sheikh Selman's camp, they surprised the hunting party a little after midnight, and massacred them all except Bishir and two followers who escaped with wounds. One of the Sheikh's negroes was said to have killed three of the attacking party before he was killed. The Dowasir lost one man who happened to be in the Sheikh's tent, but the rest of them managed to escape to their boats and offer no assistance to Sheikh Selman. When Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab Pasha of Darin heard of the carnage, he went out with a number of persons and buried the victims. 481. It was generally thought that the cause which led to these regrettable murders was that, in 1898, some Amameras of Bahrein, while engaged in hunting on the mainland, were attacked by Almorra robbers, and two of their number were killed. The Amameras to be even with the * Almorra killed the son of their Sheikh in 1899, and the Almorra undertook the recent massacre to avenge their Chief's son. The Khalifa family of Bahrein have no blood-feud with the Almorra, and, though the Amamera were residents of Bahrein, their behaviour could not be considered as being sufficient ground for the Almorra to commit the murders. It seemed that the hope of obtaining plunder was the inducement. 482. The Chief of Bahrein, in speaking to the Resident on the subject, in December 1900, said that there were two courses open: ' either that the* British Government should represent the matter to the Turkish Government, and urge the Turkish authorities to give him redress, or that he should be allowed to organize an expedition to pursue and punish the murderers.' Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball agreed to represent the matter to the Turkish authorities, through Her Britannic Majesty's Consul at Basrah, but advised the Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein to communicate on the subject with the Kaimmakam of Katif. On the Government of India receiving the Resident's report on the occurrence, the Secretary of State was addressed by telegram, and it was said that the case appears to be one in which reparation by Turkish Government must he insisted on. Only alternative would be independent action by Sheikh, which Kemball has properly dissuaded. The telegram was followed up by a despatch in which the suggestion as regards the necessity for obtaining reparation with the least possible delay was reiterated (Desnatch No. 7, dated the 17th January 1901.)129 483. From a further report of Mr. Gaslda's No. 9, dated the 27th January 1901, it appears, that Sheikh Selman and Secret e ., Apni 1901, os.B-io. p ar ty went to the mainland for no other purpose than that of huntins: customary 'for them to do in that season of the year. The members of the ruling family of Bahrein every year at the end of the autumn make up hawking parties and visit Katar, Thahran (the country between Katif and Ojair) and Lingah, and in accordance with this practice Sheikh Selman, in November 1900, elected to go to Thahran, and^ others at about the same time went to Katar and Lingah. The Khalifa family, had in fact no blood-feud with any tribe residing in Turkish territory. 431, The question was then raised by the Poreign Office whether the place where the murder occurred was within Secret e ., April 1901, Nos. 540. Turkish Jurisdiction. Attention was -in vited to the India Office letter, dated the 2nd November 188S, in which it was' proposed that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople should be infornied that Her Majesty's Government did not consider that the Porte was in effective occupation of the Arabian Coast beyond Katif. In 1893 Sir C. Tord informed the Porte that Her Majesty's Government while admitting the sovereignty of the Sultan from Basrah to Katif comidered that the coast^ running to the south of that place was looked upon as dehateahle land. The Viceroy on being consulted, replied by telegram on 7th March 1901 :— 44 1 cannot find that Turkish Territorial Jurisdiction south of Katif town has-been explicitly recognized. But notwithsfanding Ford's JJespaich of 11393, it is difficult to dispute that Katif district extend* to Ojair' It was also mentioned in the telegram on the authority of Mr. Wratislaw that the Vali of Basrah had ordered the arrest and punishment of the murder- ers of Sheikh Selman, &amp;c., and that in these circumstances action by Her Majesty's Government seemed unnecessary. The Foreign Office had, however, in the meantime addressed the Ambassador on the subject and asked for his views. 485. Sir N. O'Conor pointed out the inadvisibility of acknowledging Turkish jurisdiction in a place where it secret e., June i90i, Nos. 9-17. was so ineffectively exercised. He there fore proposed awaiting further instructions and was told to defer making any representations on the subject to the Porte until the result of Mr. Wratislaw's representation to the Vali of Basrah was known. 486. In July 1901 we were informed, through the Resident, that the Vali's attitude was unsatisfactory. He replied secret e . ( August 1901, Nos. 220-226, (No. 220). ^ Q onsu ]' s remarks with nonchalance, and when he was reminded that the Sheikh of Bahrein might take the matter into his own hands, if the Turkish authorities did not do their duty, his answer was 41 that, after all, the occurrence was merely an act of reprisal for a previous crime committed by natives of Bahrein. It was then explained to him that ' the previous murder referred to had been paid for in the customary manner by the Sheikh of Bahrein and could not be quoted as justification for the assassination of Sheikh Selman.' 487. The Sheikh of Bahrein too, at about this time, requested to be allowed to prosecute his revenge on a md. No. 22i. party of the offending tribe who were encamped within striking distance on the mainland, but he was warned against making any such attempt by the Assistant Political Agent. 488 In September 1901, the Foreign Office authorised the Ambassador at • secret e.', march 1902, noa.78-107, (No. 93 Constantinople ' press for the arrest and Enclosure). punishment of the fugitives while they are in the interior of Arabia,' as, while they were there within Turkish territory, the request would not prejudice the question of Turkish sovereignty on the south coast of Katif. 489. In October 1901, at the request of the Eesident, sanction was given by the Government of India for a gunboat Jb{d - No - 91 - to be sent to Katif in order to stimulate the Turkish authorities to greater activity in exacting reparation for the murder [C967ED1 z8130 frrid to enquire what steps, if any, had been taken in the matter. Doubt was, however, expressed by Lord Curzon at the time whether any satisfactory result would be produced. The result of the visit of His Majesty's ship Sphinx to Katif, as reported by the Resident in February 1900, was most unsatisfactory, and the attitude of the local Turkish authorities towards the Commander and the Assistant Political Agent, who accompanied, was described as ' decidedly discourteous.' The report was communicated to the India Office on the 13th March 1902. 490. In a further report (letter Ko. 74 dated the ^nd April-1902) lieute- „ ™ x. ii^o /-vr nant-Colonel Kemball discussed the Secret E., May 1903, Noa. 117-143 (No. 121.)^ . p xt ' u 'T a c 1.x • • ■ v question of the possibility of obtaining redress, ir^ the event of no satisfactory settlement being made by the Turks. The only suggestion he had was that the Chief of Bahrein should be advised to stop transhipraeat at Bahrein of cargo destined for Katif and Ojair and prohibit trade ^ith those ports until justice is done to him. ,, This would, in his opinion, effect the Turkish customs and inconvenience the mercantile community of the places, who would probably induce the Mutassarif to take early action. The information was also received by the Resident that the Vali of Basrah had teceiyed ' a strongly worded ' telegram from Constantinople directing him to cause the arrest and punishment of the murderers, and it was confirmed in Sir N. O'Conor's despatch No. 68, dated the 20th February 1902, to the Foreign Office, a copy of which was received with the Secretary of State's Secret des^ patch j ST o. 10, dated the 28th March 1902. The Resident was asked by telegram on the 20th April to furbish the information required in the despatch, vis., whether the Sheikh of Bahrein would accept pecuniary compensation and to what amount. 491. The reply of Colonel Kemball was as follows (No. 4-S. A., dated 6th c ^ ™ , 0 no ^ n* iocn June 1902), which might be read as throw- Secret e ., May 1903, Noa. ii7-i4^. (No. 128). . tu*. i.i • i. x- * ^ ing light on the interesting vendetta customs of the Arabs ' The question of pecuniary compensation has been placed before the Chief of Bahrein, who says that, so far as the murders of Shpikh Selman and the latter's son and nephew are con* cerned, he cannot accept pecuniary compensation. It is against Arab tradition for a Chief to accept bloci-mouey for the murder of members of his family, and as regards these three murders a settlement of this nature is not possible. On behalf of the relatives of the other twenty-one Bahrein subjects, who were murdered at the same time, he is willing to accept pecuniary compensation. He says that, where pecuniary compensation in such cases is offered and accepted, the customary amount paid is 800 Austrian dollars for each life. The blood- money, therefore, for the 21 murdered persons amounts to 18,^00 dollars, equivalent at the present rate of exchange to Rs. 23,520. On account of the camels and other plundered pro* p^rtj', he claims Rs 11,620, and his total claim, therefore, amounts to Rs. 35,140. On account of the three murdered members of his family above referred to apparently the Chief requirt-s ' blood for blood/' and he states that he cannot accept less than the surrender to him of three of the persons implicated in the murder for execution or possible pardon, if it is besought of him in a proper manner by the Chiefs of the Morra tribes. It thus appears that the Chief is willing to accept pecuniary compensation in partial settlement of the case, but that, for a full and final settlement, he requires that the murderers should be punished, so that the blood-feud between the Bahaih tribe to which the murderers belonged and the Khalifa family may be at an end. It would, of course, be highly satisfactory if the Turkish (jovernmenfc could be induced to effect a spttlement of this nature, that is to say, pay the amount of Rs. 35,140 for the 21 murders and the plundered property, and also surrender to the Chief of Bahrein three of the murdererSj or otherwise satisfy him on account of the murders of the three members of his family. Judging, however, from the attitude of the Turks so far and from the unsatisfactory nature of their authority in the Hasa district, I doubt very much if so satisfactory a settlement can be expected at their hands. ' The Chief of Bahrein has informed the Assistant PJitieal Agent that he has received a communication from Sheikh Aha ed-bin-Thani of Katr, to the effect that the Bahaih tiibe have expressed their desire to come to an arrangement of a nature which will settle the case, and have asked Sheikh Ahmed to approach the Chief of Bahrein in the matter. The Chief of Bahrein has hitherto refraioed from giving Sheikh Ahmed a direct reply, thinking that negotiations with the tribe through him may not be advisable while the discussions in the case are proceeding at Constantinople between His Britannic Majesty's Ambassador and the Turkibh Government If he were to negotiate with the tribe through Sheikh Ahmed, he cannot yet make a definite statement as regards the nature of the settlement which he would131 anake, as he must, be guided by tbe conditions wbicb tbe Babaib are willing to accept. Hd cannot accept Ipss than the surrender to him of three of the implicated persons, and he may leave the families of the other 21 mutdei-ed persons to settle their feuds as be^t they can if the Bahaih decline to pay blood-money. Of course, if the Chief can obtain the surrender of three of the murderers, it puts him in a position which will enable him to dictate to the tribe ; and even if he cannot obtain fall compensation for iiis murdered subjects, he will be able to effect a settlement which will put a stop to the feud so far a? his own Family is concerned, I see no reason, therefore, why the Chief should not proceed to negotiate with the tdbe through Sheikh Ahmed, but I do not propose to suggest this course to him until I receive your further instructions in the matter.' 492. As regards the suggestion contained in the last paragraph Of Colonel 0 Kemball's letter No, 4-S A., dated 6th Bid. No. is! J un ^ tlle g 3cretar y of State was asked (telegram dated the 6th October 1902) u Have tou any objection to Sheikh of Bahrein be in? authorized to negotiate with Behaih tribe through Slieikli Ahmed-bin-Thani of Ka'ar? This teems to le only mean* Of gaining redress short of allowing Sheikh to seek his revenge hy forced 4d3. It would be well to quote here Lord Curzon's note dated, the 12th May 1902, on which the sentence italicised is baselT 1 - « We have wasted 12 years in futile efforts to get the Porte, or the Wali, or Jhe Kairamakam to make amends.

We know the game well. If the Sheikh ^ willing t;o com promise for pecuniary .compensation, well and good. It ^ not, I cannot see why we should not let him take action, provided he is strong enough to do it effectually- 494 There was only one difficulty, the Government of India thought, in the way of the suggestion to negotiate a settle- ibid. is09.129 and 131. ment through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani, namely, that if it were adopted, it might lead to complications in connection with the recommendation made by Colonel Kemhall, in regard to the desire of the Sheikh to come nnder British protection. Colonel Kemhall however thought that no such difficulty need be apprehenaefl. 495 The Secretary of State too saw no objections to the proposed uegotia. tions. The Chief of Bahrein was accord- is,i. No#. 183and 137. ingly authorized to negotiate direct with the Behaih tribe, through Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Thani of Katar. 496 In despatch of the Secretary of State, No. 24-(Secret), dated 6th June 1902, attention was also drawn to an mi. No. 127. • opinion expressed by the Turkish Minister md.No. 127, Eucioaurei Sub-enciosura 2. to Sir O'Conor to the effect that—- « As a matter of fact the whole affair is the consequence o£ the murder Sheikh Rashid. bm-Mekaiatikh by the Dowasir tribe and is the nsual vendetta to which the tribes always resort on this occasion, it is the Bahreiuese who hare be-ti the cause of the occurrence , without appealing to the Gorernment, they ought not to have gone shooting in that distnct. 497. On this point. Mr. Gaskin reported no. No. 131, Enclosure. (letter No. ITS.datcd 21th August 1302):— 'In 1898, four Amamerah tribesmen accompanied a party of Dawasirs to Tbahran to hunt, and the two parties went down the coast below Ojair where the Amamerah separated to to after gazelle, and were attacked by four Bahaih Arabs who k.llcd one of thein named Abdullah-bin-Mahomed and wounded two named Mahom d and Ras hid, sons of Majid, and took their rifles. In the following year the two sons of Majid mentioned above aud another named GaHh-biu-Rashid of the same tribe crossed over with two others to bunt and to look out for any Bahaih tribesmen, and they fell in with some grazing camels attended by a young son of iTheith fiashid-bin-Magarih Sheikh of Bahaih and they took the opportnmty to Ell the boy in the place of Abdullah-bin-Mabom-d. It will be seen from these facts that the Dawasir have no blood-feud with the Bahaih to adjust. After tbe as.asnnation of the son of Sheikh Rashid, the latter came over to Bahrein and made a settlement with Sheikh Hamid, the eldest son of the Chief of Bahrein, to put aude all further hostilities between him and the Amamerahs, ' No Amamerahs accompanied Sheikh Selman on the bunting expedition which proved so disastrous to himself and h,s follower,; and the fact that the camp of the Dawas.rs which132 was clcse to his was not attacked by the Bahaih shows that the latfer's object was not the Dawasir's. The Amamerahs are a distinct tribe, and have no connection whatever with the Dawasirs, and live in a separate village near the Dawasirs at Bidaa on the north west corner of the Island of Bahrein, * 'Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Hassan, tbe Chief of Dawasir, was not killed in the attack on Sheikh Selman, but another Dawasir. Sheikh Abdullah is still alive, aud is personally known to me. The Dawasirs are subjects of the Chief of Bahrein. Rashid-bin-Meganh, the Chief of Bahaih, and his second son and a Bahaih tribesmen only were killed by a slave of Sheikh Selman in the attack on the latter and his party, and not thirteen persons as stated by the Turkish Minister of the Interior. The Morra, Ajman, and two Beni Hajir, companions who went with Sheikh Selman and lost their lives in the attack, were killed by the Bahaih, aud therefore must not be included in the number of the persons killed by the party attacked. ' There was no connection whatever between the party of the late Sheikh Selman and that of the Dawasir tribe The simultaneous crossing of the two parties to the mainland waa a mere co-incidence, as that is the usual season for such parties to cross over for the purpose of hawking the ' hubara.^ ' It will be observed that the Bahaih were the original aggressors against the Amamerahs whose blood-feud was finally settled amicably, and subsequently the Bahaih without any cause attacked the late Shaikh Selman and his party starting a fresh blood-feud. As explained m the previous correspondence, according to tribal custom, it is only the section of the tribe, a member of which sheds blood is responsible, and not the inhabitants of a whole district, as it would seem the Turkish Minister desires to imply. In this case the Bahaih assassinated persons belonging to Bahrein, and if a balance is struck, there are 21 lives to be accounted for by the Bahaih, but the Bahaih being undoubtedly the aggressors, it seems contrary to justice to allow any deductif n being made when settling the matter. The Chi^f of Bahrein tells me that he cannot accept blood-money for the lives of the three members of his family ; and, if peace is to be established between him and Bahaih, the only means to be adopted are those mentioned in the third paragraph of my letter No. 109, dated the 17th May 1902. As Sheikh Ahmed-bin-'l hani would be acting as a peacemaker between the two parties. I do not see what complications can arise in the future/' 498. On 18th August 1903, Colonel Kemball reported that the negotia- Secret E.,September 1904, Nob. 56 87. (So. 66.) 'T attempted thrOUgll Sheikh Ahmed had proved abortive, and suggested as the only alternative that His Majesty's Government should clearly inform the Turkish GoTernment that if satisfaction were not given within a definite period, the Chief of Bahrein would be permitted to take his own steps to obtain satisfaction. The satisfaction demanded by the Sheikh, as noted above includes the payment of a sum of Rs. 35,140, as blood-money and compensation for property plundered and the surrender of three of the three persons impli- eated for execution or possible pardon. 499. In telegraphing the purport of Colonel Kemball's report (telegram Hid, No. 57. (iate(i 13fcI]L September 1903), the Viceroy expressed concurrence with Colonel Kem ball, suggested that satisfaction should be demanded within two months. The Secretary of State replied on 3rd JNovember ly03 :— Sir N. O'Conor has caused the Forte to telegraph instructions to Bisrah asking for an Hid No 59 immediate report on the present position with regard to Behaih, and stating that full redress for the murders is required. He suggests that before allowiog the Sheikh of Bahrein to take tho matter into his own hands, a reasonable time should be allowed for an answer/' 500. Then followed the Secretary of State's despatch No. 11 (Sf cret), datf d Ibid 69 . 19th February 1904, which forwarded the correspondence between the Foreign Office and the India Office and Sir N, O'Conor. It appeared from it that Sir N'Conor had insisted on reparation being made by payment of blood-money as sug gested by Colonel Kemball. The Minister of the Interior stated in reply tha* it would be impossible to exact such a large sum from the delinquent tribes, especially nomadic as they were. Nevertheless the Ministsr communicated by telegram the substanxje of Sir N. O'Conor's note and instructed him to take action accordingly, and Sir N. O'Conor undertook to recommend His Majesty's Government to let matters stand until a reasonable time had elapsed ' during which the Vali could endeavour to execute the fresh orders sent to him. ' Sir133 N. O'Conor also wished to know the names of the persons who had committed- the murder. The Secretary of State observed :— ' In the event of the Turkish Government failing to obtain payment of an adequate compensation or of their resorting to further procrastination, His Majesty 9 s Government are prepared to agree to the SheiJch of Bahrein being allowed to exact reparation for himself from the Jtehaih, In this event, however, it would he necessary to take precautions to avoid raising as far as possible, the question of Turkish sovereignty in these regions, and it would he desirable to inform the Sheikh that he must on no account proceed against the Behaih, while they were in the interior within Turkish jurisdiction' 601. This despatch of the Secretary of State was sent to the Political Hid No. 70. Eesident for necessary action, hut the portion italicised was not to be communi cated to the Chief of Bahrein, as the status of the Agency and of the arrange ments to be made for the customs administration in Bahrein were under con sideration. 502. There was then further correspondence between the Poreign Office lUd No 73 an ^ O'Conor, which was forwarded to us with the Secretary of State's despatch No. 16, dated 1st April 1904. Erom this it appeared that according to the account given by the Turkish Government, a number of the offending tribe, probably including those responsible for the murder, had been killed in an encounter with the Turkish forces. The Turkish Officers v^ere reported to have been unable to obtain compensation from the Behaih tribe. In these circumstances, His Majesty's Government decided to instruct Sir N. O'Conor to inform the Porte that as they have been unable to obtain compensation from the Behaih, His Majesty's Government can no longer dissuade Sheikh of Bahrein from taking his own measures, hut that they will use their best efforts to ensure that he shall take no action as long as the Behaih are in territory recognized as Turkish. Sir N. O'Oonor was instructed accordingly in the Foreign Office despatch No. 132, dated 12th April 1904. 503. As regards the last proviso in these instructions it was ascertained and reported by Major Cox (telegram dated 14th June 1904) that the offending tribe had never left the territory of Hasa and Katar and was then in the latter district. 504. Major Cox also submitted Mr. Gaskin's report regarding the persons w 0 , „ , concerned in the murder and such of them ISidNo. 85. Enclosure. t, j i i -n i * , ... as had been killed in an encounter with the Turks, No. 135, dated 11th June 1904, from which the following para graphs are extracted:— ** I am informed by the Chief's messenger that the leaders of the raid were Rashid-bin Mekarih, Mutib-al-Munnakhas, Mohsin and Talib, sons of All-bin-Noman, nephews of Hashid bin-Mekarih, and Rashid and Mohsin, sons of Dewairis-al-Hamaidi, also nephews of Rashid-bin- Mekarih; that Rashid-bin-Mekarih and Rashid-bin-Dewairis-al-Hamaidi were killed in the attack on Sheikh Selman and Mohsin-bin-Dewairis-al-Hamaidi was wounded in the thigh on the same occasion, but subsequently recovered. The other members of the raiding party were Behaih tribesmen whose names have not yet been procured. As regards the persons mentioned in the communication from the Porte to His Majesty's Embassy at Constantinople, I would venture to report that the only member of the Mekarih family killed by the Turks since the murder was Ibn Retaiban, a nephew of Rashid-bin Mekarih, on the 10th September 1902 at Zarnooga about 14 miles south of Hofuf. This youth was not concerned in the outrage. Ali-bin-Monakib was a Behaih tribesmen and was killed in the first week of October 1902, in the incident mentioned in the entry dated 13th October in this Office diary for 18th October 1902. These two men were not concerned in the attack at Tinofa. Ibn Ketifa is also a Behaihi and is known to be alive and is with his tribe. Mahomed-bin-Nejdan, Hassan Cheiimet and Toritor do not appear to be known as having been members of the Behaih tribe. Though the actual mzmber of the attacking party is unknown, it is generally stated that it was composed of over [C967ED]134 •fifty persons. The fact that two of the leaders were killed in the attack and possibly five tribesmen may have been subsequently killed in skirmishes with Turkish troops despatched in connection with cases entirely disconnected with the murder of Sheikh Selman, and his followers, I cannot see how the Behaih can be considered as exonerated by the Porte since four of the leaders in the attack and over forty tribesmen are still at large. The connection of the Governor of Nejd to the effect that the crime was due to the animosity existing between the Sheikhs of Bahrein and the Behaih tribe is erroneous as wilt be seen from the date of the case set forth in my letters No. 219, dated 12th December 1900, j and No. 9, dated 27th January 1901. With reference to the question of compensation, it is hoped that the fact that the Rs. 35 140 represent blood-money for the lives of only 21 victims and the value of the camels, arms, and camp equipment taken by the Behaih and that the Turks will still have to execute three 5 of the principal men concerned in satisfaction of the lives of Sheikh Selman, his son Diaii and his nephew Abdulrahman-bin-Rashid, for whose murder the Chief cannot accept compensation as pointed out in my letters Nos. 98 and 109, dated the brd and 17th May 1902 respectivelyj will not be overlooked. I may mention that the Behaih Arabs are a sub-division of the Morra Arabs, and are not powerful enough to separate themselves from the main tribe and to go into the desert of Neid for the reason that they would be soon exterminated by the large tribes in that district and consequently they have never been bejood the limits of Hasa or Katar and now the tribe is encamped at'Salwa on the western border of Katar. The statement that the tribe has fled into the desert of Nejd is fabricated with a view to cover the inactivity of the Hasa authorities. I have duly warned the Chief to take no independent action in the matter.' 505. In forwarding copies of reports received from the Gulf, the Govern- , . ment of India observed in despatch No. IHi No - 87 - 143, dated 11th August 1904 c( prom the details now furnished, it will be observed that the persons reported, by the Wali of Basrah, to have been killed in a fight at Zernaka between the Turkish Convoy and Bin Mekiriah and Ms companions, were not those actually concerned in the murder of Sheikh Selman and his followers ; and that the real perpetraters of the outrage are still at large, and presumably within Turkish jurisdiction. The contention of the Governor of Nejd that the murder was the outcome of animosity is also refuted. In view of the attitude adopted by Sheikh Isa in refusing to accept our advice in regard to the administration of his Customs revenues, we have deemed it advisable to withhold for the present from the Chief any intimation regarding the concession which His Majesty's Govern ment are prepared to make to him in the matter of avenging himself on^ his enemies on the mainland and we intend, with your approval, to make no communication to him on the subiect pending the receipt Of the order of His Majesty's Government on the proposals put forward in our Secret despatch No. 85, dated the 21st April 1904, for a revision of the arrangements for British representation at Manama. If there is likely to be delay in the issue of these orders, we would sugest that, in order to prevent the posslbilitv of the Sheikh's ease being prejudiced by delay, the fact of the murderers being still at large, and in Turkish territory apparently, might be brought to the notice of the Porte. As the Sheikh is precluded from proceeding against them while in that territory, the advis'ability of again pressing for the payment of pecuniary compensation might also be considered/' 506. Copy of this despatch has been forwarded by His Majesty's Government to Sir N.' O'Conor with the following instructions ' The information obtained by the Officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf is to the effect that the persons who were reported by the Turkish Government in February last to have been killed in an encounter with Turkish troops were not those actually concerned in the outrage, but that, on the contrary, the offenders are still at large in Turkish territory. In view of the continued failure of the Turkish Government to exact any reparation for the murders, there seems no reason for further delaying the representation which ifour Excel lency was instructed to make in my despatch* No. • Vide ^9x9.. 502 ante. jgfj 0 f ^ i&lt;jth April last, and which was to the effect that Hu Majesty's Government can no longer restrain the Sheikh of Bahrein from resorting to such steps as he may think necessary for the 'purpose, though they will use their best endeavours to insure that he shall take no action against the Behaih as Long as that tube remain in territory recognized as Turkish, J have accordingly to request that you will make the representation already proposed.135 CHAPTER TENTH. Tnrkisli designs on Oman and tbe rest of East Arabian Littoral, 1888-1899. 507. We have dealt with several measures taken by the Turks to extend their dominion on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, their expeditions into Neid their increase of their naval and military forces, etc. We shall now note a few more of their actions, which disclose their designs towards that object. 507A. The Turks have always cast longing glances on Oman. In 1888 there were persistent rumours of a threatened invasion of Oman by Ibn Eashid in con- external a., november 1888, nos 102-151. junction with Sheikh Jasim of Katar and under the auspices of the Porte.

Eepresentations were made to the Porte in the matter, and the Porte denied that there were any communica- External A., July 1889, Noe. 235-239. ^ e ^ ween Eashid and the Sultan, except exchange of presents. From the British Ambassador Sir W. White s letter, dated 9th May 1S89, it appears that Ibn Rashid was anxious to secure from the Sultan iurisdiction over Hasa, while the Sultan was desirous of secur- ino- a greater hold over Nejd and Shammar. Both these purposes could not be^attained having regard to the facts that tbe Porte's policy was to e ^end its Jurisdiction over the Arab littoral, and the ambition of Ibn Eashid to be practically independent ruler, only nominally acknowledging suzerainty of the Sultan. . f -n 508. The Turkish Government have always assumed the role of the Protec tor of pilgrims to Mecca. One of the pil- Turlcish control of 'pilgrim traffic in Hasa. glim routes being from Hasa by Way of External A., August 1888, Nos. 8-10. Hofuf, the Turkish Governor of Hasa has been always at pains to undertake the protection of pilgrims on this route. For this nurnose a temporary Amir was once appointed to control the traffic and eiven the privilege of bearing the sacred standard on the way. In one instance in 1888, the Mutassarif of Hasa went so far as to address a very insolent letter to the Chief of Bahrein ordering in peremptory terms to notify the appoint ment of the temporary Amir, and the date by which the pilgrims should arrive at Hasa to accompany him, etc. , , , . rnq Tn 1892 some men of the Monasir tribe, aided by people belonging to t . „ ► other Arab tribes of the Persian Gulf, plun- Z. mass.

The MutaSSadf of Hasa and the Valt of Basrah then wrote to the Chief of AbuThabi, in a threatening tone, charging him with responsibility for the acts. The Chief replied disavowing all connection with the Monasir tribe. The Political Kesident Colonel Talbot thought that though this tribe were said to be more or less under the control of the Abu Thabi Chief he could not be held responsible for the acts o£ so scattered a tribe some' 400 miles from Abu Thabi. What Colonel Talbot objected to was tbe threatening tone of the letters addressed by the Turkish authorities to the Sheikh. Should they adopt a similar tone again, he suggested that the true position of the Chief in relation to the British Government should be pointed out to the Porte. He also advised the Chief that in future he should consult the Resident before replying to such letters, an advice which tbe Chief accepted. * 510 In 1893 we received reports from various sources of attempts made ebv the Porte to adopt a comprehensive 0 ' !r scheme to bring the Chieftains in Arabia secret e., january 1894, Nos. 449-460. under Turkish control and to check their rebellious spirit. One of the schemes was to appoint a Civil Governor for the whole of Arabia, in which should be included Maskat and the rest of Oman (includin 0 * the Pirate Chiefs) Bahrein and Hasa. Secret agents were deputed to induce 0 the Chieftains to visiUhe capital, Constantinople, and to counteract the growing influence of the British.136 511. It was probably with ibis object in view that the Porte was anxious to Agreement with Trucial Chiefs communicated to ascertain the exact terms of tbe relationship the £orte ' in which the Trucial Chiefs stood with ns. 512. The Turkish Ambassador in London in 1893 requested that he might Secret e., may 1893, nos. 165-168 ^ with the text of our treaties : with Arab Chiefs of the Persian Gulf. It was thereupon decided by Her Majesty's Government that the text of the agreements of 1892 with the Trucial Chiefs on the Pirate Coast of the Persian Gulf should be communicated to the Turkish Government. 513. In 1899, we find the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf arousing an Uneasy interest on AraMan affairs, 1899. uneasy interest in Turkish circles. Hamdi . Secret E ' rebruary 1 . 900 ' Nos * t 0 ' 41 *. Pasha, the Vali of Basrah, was for pursu ing an aggressive policy in Hasa and at Koweit, cne of his schemes being the extension of the telegraphic line from Fao to Katif, which would pass through Koweifc. An Irade was actually issued by the Sultan to carry out this project. It was however given up by his successor Mohsin Pasha. 613A. The Porte at this time appears to have been alarmed at the news of a Secret e., February 1900, Nos. 40-41. deputation of the Amir of Nejd being on , , its way to the Khedive of Egypt, &lt;( with presents and dangerous advice.' The Vali of Basrah was ordered to be on the look out for these messengers and to arrest them if found. What the Porte probably feared was the extension of the British influence in Arabia from the direction of Egypt. 513B. At an International Sanitary Conference held at Paris in 1894, it Sanitary Posts in the Persian Gulft WaS res olved, among other measures, to Secret E., ^rch 1895, Nos. 19-68. establish certain sanitary posts in the c ^ , Persian Gulf,[and to give certain powers to the banitary Board at Constantinople, which the Turks soon utilized to extent their influence in the Gulf. A nnexe III (ii) of the convention. Sanitary posts to he established, 1. At Eao, or near this point, a large lazeretto on terra firma, with a complete sanitary establishment having under its control the sanitary posts in the Persian Gulf mentioned below :— 2. A small lazeretto in one of the two islets, Ottoman Selhiye or Yilaniye, situated near Basrah, to supervise such individuals as may have evaded the visit to Eao. 3. Maintenance of the sanitary post actually existing at Basrah. 4. Establishment of four sanitary posts in the Bay of Koweit. 6. Sanitary post at Menama, capital of the Bahrein Islands. 6. Sanitary post at Bander-Abbas. 7. Sanitary post at Bander Bouchir. 8. Sanitary post at Mohammerah. 9. Sanitary post in the port of Gwadur (Baluchistan). 10. Sanitary post in the port of Maskat (on the Oman Coast). 513-C« There were also made regulations, which would give occasion for Ibid Xo. 21. vexatious interference with the British Indian commerce. The Eoreign Office therefore refused to accept the arrangements proposed for the Persian Gulf. 613-D. The Government of India, who were asked to state their opinion iiid No. sy. after consulting the British Officers and in the Gulf, expressed the fol lowing views m there Despatch No. 22 (Secret), dated 3rd January 1895 ' For some time past a quarantine station has existed at Pao, and, as the information in our possession shows, under cover of quarantine and customs regulations. Turkish officials are enabled to board Indian native craft bound to and coming from Mohammerab and to levy137 * blackmail. We do not doubt that, if a lazaret were also established there, the extortions to which native craft are now subjected would be more freely practised, and probably extenied to vessels of greater burthen, so that the inconvenience and loss inflicted by delay at Fao would fall more heavily on British trade. It has also been represented that delay at Fao might involve the loss of one of the fortnightly tides needed by large steamers in crossing the bar, and if in consequence it became necessary to tranship into lighters, the loading and unloading would entail heavy expenditure. The objections we entertain to the proposals of the Conference are no less serions in view of the political considerations involved. The 'pretensions of the Porte to sovereignty over Bahrein, its claim to Mohammerah as evidenced hy the levy of dues on its imports and exportSy and the jealousy evinced hy the Turkish Government of the position of Great Britain on the Persian Gnlf, render it especially inexpedient that Turkish officials should he allowed, under the pretext of enforcing quarantine regulations, to interfere in the affairs of Arab trihes under the influence, of Her Majesty's Government. It will be observed moreover from the letter cited in From Major Hayes Sadler, dated 9th October 1894, the margin that His Highness the Saltan of in Enclosure No. 3. Maskat wotld object to sanitary posts at bwadur and Maskat, and if this portion of the scheme were left unexecuted, the object with which the measures have been proposed would be defeated. Similar considerations apply to Fao. The position of this place at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab would render these quarantine measures ineffective without the assent and co-operation of Persia. It would be contrary to the pro vision of the capitulations and of the treaty of Erzeroom for the sanitary establishment at lao to control the movement of British and Persian ships bound for any place on the Persian side of the stream. Such control would amount to exercise of ^ sovereignty over the_ entire Shat- el-Arab to the detriment of Persian rights and of our traffic with Basrah.

Summary of British declarations against Tarkish encroachments in the Persian Gulf and of the Porte's assurances, 1871-1904. 514. With reference to the designs of Turkey to establish a supremacy oyer Bahrein, the Bombay Gouernment in 1847 informed the Eesident that Bahrein Precis, page 4 ^ obviously desireable to exclude as much as possible all interference^ hy foreign powers, in the affairs of the Persian Gulf since it is only by retaining the supreme authority in its own hands that the British Oovernment can hope to secure the permanence of the objects it has gained in that quarter at such a large expense.' (Letter No. 33J, dated 31st July 1847.) The Board of Directors agreed with the Bomboy Governments in thinking that any attempts upon JBahrem ought to he resisted by the British navatl force in that Gulf, and ice authorize you to inform Major Rennel {the Besidenl) accordingly ' (Despatch dated 6th October 1904). • 514-A. In 1861j the Turkish Governor General of Baghdad wanted to know by what right we have had bombarded Damaum, a place which, as lying within the territory of &lt;{ I'eysal Beg, the Kaimmakam of Nejd,' was ' part of Turkish protest against British proceedings in the hereditary donainians of the Sultan 1861, paragraph 45 ante. To Her Britannic Majesty's Consul- General at Baghdad replied that we had hitherto ' always maintained direct relations with Amir Feysal as well as with all the Chiefs and Principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf; that our pacific policy in the Gulf was well known, and that in the prosecution of that policy we had never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State—an authority or jurisdiction moreover which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarts' In reporting this correspondence to Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople the Consul-General wrote as follows :— il Although it may not be detained that^ since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40 Amir Fey sal has remained tribufary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Forte has never exercised any jurisdiction, or attempted to extend its authority over that country. 514-B. We had then to deal with the Turkish expedition in April 1871. Colonel Pelly, then Resident in the Persian Gulf, was told that if the Irabs took part in the quarrel (between the Turks and the Wahabis) he should limit his action strictly to maintaining the maritime peace. He then enquired whether the Government of India desired him to use any influence towards preventing the Trucial Chiefs from aiding the Wahabis against the Turks, or in any way moving by sea, and what reply he should give to the Trucial Chiefs if, ^ while continuing to observe the maritime peace, they asked whether the British Government would protect them against an attack from the Turks by sea. Colonel Pelly also suggested that it would be advisable to intimate to the Turkish authorities our engagements with the Trucial Chiefs, as it was suspect ed the Turks might have an eye on Bahrein. 515. On 25th April 1871— k ' Colonel Herbert reported a rumour that if the expedition to Nejd was successful, it would eventually be directed to the acquisition of Bahrein, Maskat, and the Arab coast/' 5^6. On 28th April Colonel Herbert again telegraphed as follows 'Ambassador telegraphs repeatedly at my request the following: 4 1 have positive assurances from the Ottoman Porte that they intend establishing supremacy over hahrein, Maskat, and independent tribes of Southern Arabia^ and that no special attack is contemplated against them ^ 517. Colonel Herbert's telegram of the 25th regarding the rumoured inten tions of the expedition was reported cn the 28th to the Secretary of State, who was asked whether an assurance couid not be obtained from the Turkish 'Gov ernment that the expedition had no other object than the settlement of the affairs of Nejd. The Secretary of State replied :— ' Her Majesty's Government have received assurances from Constantinople that Turkish Government have no such designs as those mentioned'139 518. To clear up the discrepancy between the information received from Her Majesty's Government and that received from the Political Agent at Baghdad, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was immediately com municated with by telegraph, both direct and through Colonel Herbert. The result of this reference was that Sir H. Elliot telegraphed on the 3 2th May « The Ottoman Porte explicitly denies all intention of extending supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and contemplates no attack^ against them. The sole object of the expedition is declared to be the restoration in Nejd of the tranquillity which is disturbed by the hostility of the brothers, Abdullah and Saud/' 519. The Grand Vizier commuQicated these assurances through M. Pisani to Sir H. Elliot Your Excellency, said Ali Pasha, may give the most positive assurances to Hev Majesty's Government that the Porte entertains no intention whatever of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the independent tribes of Southern Arabia, and does not contemplate any attack upon them, or harbour any design to subdue them. He asserts that the true and sote object of the present enterprise is to picify the two brothers^ to prevent the protraction of disorder, and to restore tranquillity' 520. Midhut Pasha then at Baghdad also communicated to Colonel Herbert the assurances of the Porte. These assurances enabled the Government of India to give on the 17th May the much required instructions to Colonel Pelly, w., to communicate the substance of Sir H. Elliot's message to the Chief of Bahrein and those of the Truoial Chiefs who had made enquiries regarding the object of Turkish expedition. 521. With regard to the general questions put by Colonel Pelly it was said:— « He should be informed that it is impossible for His Excellency in Council to give instructions regarding contingencies of the occurrence of which there is no immediate prospect The Turkish expedition, however, in no way ajfects the Treaty rights and obligations, either of the British Government or of the Chiefs who have subscribed to the maritime peace. Colonel Pelly may so inform the Chiefs who have consulted Jpn, and should use all legitimate means to maintain the stipulations of the treaties. 522. Colonel Pelly having enquired whether tribes, who are parties to the maritime truce, should be allowed to undertake operations by sea in the interest of either party, he was told on the 30th May to go to Bahrein and there assure the Chief of the assurances given by the Porte; to inform him that so long as he observed conditions of Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty, our obligations would be fulfilled ; to inform all the Chiefs, trucial and others, that the Turkish Gov ernment contemplated no attack on them and had no intention to obtain supremacy over any independent State. 523. With reference to Colonel Pelly's enquiry regarding Trucial Chiefs, the Secretary of State was asked :— « If Pellv asks whether he is to stop by force any military operations by sea on part of Chiefs either for or against Turks, ana I to authorize him to do so ? I advise this course, and that you should infor n Turkish Government accordingly. This will not include Koweit Chiefs who ijave already sailed.' 5^4. The Secretary of State replied «Persian Gulf Trucial Chiefs may be interdicted from maritime operations, but no otheBs/' 525. Thereupon the Bombay Government were directed to inform Colonel Pelly accordingly, and to instruct him to use all the influence he possessed with the other Chiefs to maintain the maritime truce. 528. The instructions given to Colonel Pelly having been communicated to the Porte, Ali Pasha expressed his thanks for the communication; in un equivocal terms repeated his assurances that the Porte contemplated no naval operations, and said that it had no intention of applying for assistance to any of the Chiefs included in the maritime truce. At the same time the Porte having no cognizance of the truce could not be expected to be held bound by it, and would not hesitate to accept the services of any of the Chiefs who might tender them.140 627. Midhut Pasha also again asserted that Bahrein was not within Turk ish contemplation, and assured Colonel Herbert that his orders to the Officer Commanding the expedition were on no account to turn his eyes on Bahrein. 528. Sir H. Elliot wrote in September 1871 that lie had made AH Pasha understand that Her Majesty s Government would not see with indifference any attempt to disturb the arrangements existing with regard to the Arab tribes in the Persian Gulf. 52J. Again in February 1872 the Secretary of State forwarded papers Proceedings, Secret, May 1872, Nos. 52-88. received from Constantinople. Server , T . A ^ , Pasha desired M. Pisani to state that Her Majesty s Government might rest assured that the policy followed previously by the Porte towards the independent tribes along the Persian Gulf had under- a ^ era ^ on . w ^ a ^ ver » an( i His Excellency asserted again on the part of the Porte that no intention was ever entertained, nor any design harboured to subdue those tribes or obtain any supremacy over them. The sole obiect of tne JNejd expedition he stated to have been, and still to be, to restore order and tranquillity there, and establish a regular and cohesive administration more in conformity with the requirements of the country. 530. la April 1872 the Bombay Government wrote that they attached no Proceedings, Secret, May 1872, No. 77. importance to the assurances of the Turk- ^ n L \ isl1 Government as reported in the papers fu i • n 9 c ons J 1110 ? 16 ' as ^ ere was no information as to what tribes in the Persian Gulf would be considered by them to be independent, or what they considered to be the l.mits of the Kingdom of Nejd. The Government of ^ 0m i^ . SOme spe0lfic declaration as to what the claims were should be at once obtained. The Government of India replied that the assur ances repeatedly given by the Turkish Government, to the effect that tbev had no intention of obtaining supremacy over Bahrein, Maskat, or the other' inde- pendent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf, were accepted as satisfactory and that it was not considered expedient or likely to lead to any good result to ask for a specific declaration of the claims of the Turkish Government. • j 531 ' P oli °y of Her Majesty's Government was laid down in the follow ing despatch, dated 9tb May 1872, addressed to the British Ambassador at Constantinople:— ' I have received of late, through the Foreign Office, repeated representations from the troverament of India rpspectmor the proceedings o£ the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf more especially with reference to the increase which the Porte has recently made in the numbed of vessels employed in those waters. Her Majesty s Government, however, consider that as long as Turkey is enqaged in upholding its legitimate authority in the Gulf, they cannot ask it to curtaitthe means which it considers necessary for doiy so, but they may fairly say to the Porte that they trust and expect that no attempt will be made to extend ihat authority, which would raise questions between the Indian G.overument and the Porte, the maintenance of the existing state of thin-s in the trulf and on its borders being considered a matter of great importance to the general tranquillity of those quarters; and that the presence of lar^e Turkish armaments is generally calculated to disquiet the bordering countries, and must necessarily cause of the British Ciovern- ment to take counteracting steps to reassure the public mind. Vf he P; esenee 0 f excessive Turiish force requires the Indian Government to intrease the British force in the Gulf the native mind will see in the latter an encouragement, not only to resist, but to thwart the Porte, and things will go on from bad to worse, till at last, even in the admitted lurktsh districts, a general feeling of uneasiness will be produced, and will cost the Forte more to subdue or mitigate than the country is worth. „ L h * v&lt; ? t , he * efore ' to instruct Your Lordship, while expressing to the Porte the views of Her Majesty s Government on this point, to state that they wiU gladly use their good offices to restore peace and bring matters to a normal state of tranquillity/' 532. This despatch was duly communicated to Server Pasha in June 1872 and he repeated the assurance, already so often given, of the absence of all in tention on the part of the Porte of doing more than re-establish their legitimate authority in those districts where their right was undisputed, adding that Her Majesty's Government might be satisfied that since the recall of Midhut Pasha there would be less than ever a disposition to extend the field of operations111 583. The question of Tarksh jurisdiction on the Arabian Coast of the Persian came particularly under the consideration of the Government in 1879. The question was the line of demarcation of the Turkish sphere of territorial jurisdiction on that coast and the nature of the responsibiliti^ which should devolve on the two Goyernments. On these points in their despatch No. 29, dated llth July 1878, the Government of India recommended that from Basrah to Ojair the authority of the Forte should he recognized as established on land, hut at sea the British Government should continue to exercise some concurrent protectorate pursuing pirates if necessary into Turkish waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on shore, within certain limits through the 'Resident in the Gulf'; that south or east of Ojair, Turkish authority should not he recognized except at Bidaa on the Katar Peninsula; and that the Potte should be required (a) to stipulate not to interfere, either on the coast or in the islands with the Trucial Chiefs between Odeid and Ras- ul-Khima; (b) to recognize the territories of the Sheikh of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain; and {c) in case of piracies from within its jurisdiction, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. 534. There passed upon this despatch correspondence between the India lsm and Foreign Offices which was forwarded Pol. a., May 1880, no. is, sir Mullet's letter, to the Government of India with Secre- dated 27th September 1880. tar y of State 's despatch Nr. 40, dated 6th November 1880 The view to which the Secretary of State for India (Lord Cranbrook) was inclined was :— cc The limit of Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to le defined at all, could scarcely he fixed at any point north of Ojair, which is opposite th* southern extremity of the island of Bahrein •, but it is precisely hetucn that spot and Katif that since the settlement of the Beni Yas at Odied was broken up in 1878, the operations of ih-e pirat cal tribes have been carried on with almost complete impunity ' His Lordship apprehends that the effect of formally recognizing any particular part of the Arab coast aod the waters adjacent as Turkish, ftnd as, in consequence, closed against British cruisers, so far as action against piratical craft is concerned, would be the formation of an asylum which would be taken advantage of by marauders in general, whom the local Ottoman authorities would be unable to control without a consideroble and permanent increase to the Turkish naval force in the Gulf, which the Porte has declared itself precluded from making by considerations of expense, and which would be open to many objections on political grounds, 'The conclusion, therefore, to which Lord Cranbrook is led is that negotiation or discus- sion %vith the Porte on the territorial question should he avoided', but that, in order that the obligations contracted by the Government of India towards the Sheikh of Bahrein and the parties to the maritime truce may be efficiently fulfilled, the Resident in the Persian Gulf should be authorized to (xdopt all necessary measures for the preservation of the peace of the seas, without regard either to Turkish pretensions to sovereignty over the whole Arab coast, or to the recognition of Ottoman supremacy by individual Chiefs, such as the Sheikh of Bidaa, or to the presence of Turkish officials at isolated points.' 535, In continuation of his despatch No. 40, dated 6th November 1879, p . , ^ iqqo at o* referred to above, the Secretary of State Pol. k.,May 188^, No. 37. ^ ^ ^ of ^ January 1880, forwarded further correspondence on the subject between the India and Foreign Offices. In a confidential communication regarding these papers. Her Majesty*s Ambassador (Sir H. Layard) was instructed by the Foreign Office, London, that wherever Turkish authority was at that time actually and jirmly established upon the coast. Her Majesty's Government would be ready to recognize it and would be glad to see it accompanied by a regular and civilized administration. He was also directed to press upon the Porte the advisability of allowing British ships—while pursuing their opera tions against piratical vessels outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid—to pursue and capture them within the three mile limit of that part of the coast. Further as regards Maskat, Bahrein, and the possession of the Trucial Chiefs on the coast between Odeid and llas-el-Khymd inclusive, Her Majesty's Government, while they considered it unnecessary to seek for any formal declaration from the Porte, renouncing all claims of sovereignty over those two territories, were in no way disposed to recede from their repeated denial of [C967FD] zll142 these claims, and considered themselves hound hy their treaty engagements with their several Chiefs to resist any attempt, whether direct or indirect, to give them practical eflect. 536. la July 1880 Her Majasty's Ambassador at Constantinople (Mr. Goschen) issued a note to the Governor-General at Ba^lidad drawing his atten tion to the increase of practical expeditions in the Persian Gnlf issuing from that side of the Arabian littoral, where the Turkish Government claimed to have established jurisdiction, and asking his co-operation in a plan of opera tions for the suppression of the piracies north of Odeid. Mr. Goschen's pro ceedings were approved, but he was. warned not to entangle himself in any discussion with the Porte about the territorial question. 537. As no arrangement could be arrived at with either the Porte as the Porte of Baghdad, Her Majesty's Government ultimately decided that our naval officers should not he hampered by the three mile limit in pursuing the pirated craft in Turkish, waters. 538. The practical outcome of the correspondence and discussions of the 1fiQl two years was (see Mr. Moore's memoran- 18 dum of 1881.)

Beyond that point we consider the Chiefs to be independent, and having engagements with them we object to attempt to extend Turkish autho rity over them.■'■ , 540.

If* 8 , ^ lUs TaQ - urah, the India Omce stated— u ' Her Majesty's Government have declined to admit the claim of Turkey to sovereignty over the El Katr Coast, while the Sultan uncompromisingly asserts his rights over that coast. The Sheikh of El Bidaa on the eastern side of the El Katr peninsula an independent Chief and not party to the maritime truce, has allowed the Turks to maintain a small military post there since 1^72, and Her Majesty's Government have never protested against this assertion of Turkish supremacy on this portion of the El Katr Coast. Lord Cross thinks that it may be sufficient for the present to acquaint Sir W. White, if the' Marquis of Salisbury sees no objection thereto, that Her Majesty's Government do not consider that the Forte is in effective occupation of the Arabian coast beyond Katif, and that they adhere to the declaration made in 1883, that the claims of the Porte to rights of sovereignty over the Al Katar Coast is not admitted by Her Majesty's Government, but as there is no reason to anticipate that any practical result would be attained by provoking a discussion with the Turkish Government as to the extent of its jurisdiotion on that coast, it is undesirable to raise the question at the present time. * * ' ' * Has Tanurah is the south point of a long strip of land * * which forms the north side of Katif Bay. No objection could, therefore, apparently be offered to the formation of a coal depot by the Turks at Ras Tanurah * * ' 541. In 1888 when we heard of a threatened invasioji of Oman by the Turks and Ibn Eashid, we warned both against the step (see para. 607-A ante.) 542.

We take this opportunity of enquiring whether the policy laid down in 18s3 of denying Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr should be continued. The Government of India are not aware of any circumstance which would justify a departure from it in the present state of affairs in the. peninsula. We would, therefore, recommend that the line of action hitherto adopted by Her Majesty's Government: may continue to be followed ; and we have, at the same time, the honour to state that the proceedings of the local Turkish authorities have caused and are still causing injury to the trade of Bahreia.' , _ o 548.

As regards the recommendation of Your Excellency's Government that the policy of refusing to recognise Turkish jurisdiction over El Katr should be adhered to. Her Majesty's Government observe that the Turkish authorities, although they maintain a garrison at El Bidaa, appear to have practically no hold on the country. So long as they do n6t move beyond the limits of the town, the nominal suzerainty of the Porte is recoymzed; but any attempt to extend Turkish authority is resisted. There seems therefore to be no sufficient reason for allowing the pretensions of Turkey to interfere with our liberty of action, or to prevent Your Excellency's Govern ment from making such treaties with the Chiefs of El Katr as may be con sidered desirable. Her Majesty's Government maintain the policy hitherto followed, and continue to deny the claim of the Turkish Government to exercise sovereignty over the El Katr Peninsula; but they do not think it necessary to make any official communication on the subject to the Porte, unless the question is raised official ly by the Turkish Government * * * Secret E., May 1904, No.. 658-669. 5 49.
