The islands in the Persian Gulf are owned either by Persia or by Arab Chiefs. Bahrain, the most important, is under British protection. Next in note is Kishm which is owned by Persia, but Great Britain possesses an enclave at Basidu by virtue of grant from the Imam of Maskat, to whom the island originally belonged. .At Jask a reserve of British territory exists under an agreement concluded in 1887 between the British and Persian Governments; here and at Charbar small detachments of Indian troops are stationed for the protection of British telegraph officials. On the southern and western coast is the still independent Sultanate of Oman. The dejucto position upon the waters and on the shores of the Persian Gulf reflects a more positive British Be facto position in the Persian Gu . predominance than is perhaps indicated by the preceding paragraph. Order has been established and enforced by British Agency on land and on water up and down the whole coast which has restored, with the industries of peace, prosperity and trade of which i ritain has so far succeeded in preserving a liberal share, but in which the enterprise of all nations is free to take a part. This position is solely the result of a century of British effort. Many British lives and millions of money have been spent in the suppression of piracy and the slave trade in the Persian Gulf, in the pacification, surveying, lighting and buoying of its intricate and troublous waters, in laying cables, in fostering and increasing trade which, if beneficial to Britain and India, has been so also to the world at large and especially to Persia, Arabia and Turkey.

Great Britain has claimed no exclusive privileges or direct compensation, but she has declared publiclv* that no hostile roli- • Pages 87 nnd 88 .md 89 G. of Persian Assurances. influpnce ^ be intro(hlced in any form by either of the territorial Powers ceding to a third, land for the establish ment of a naval base or other pied a terre. Such a proceeding Britain has proclaimed would be a wanton rupture of the status quo which she would put forth her whole strength to prevent. Nor are there wanting other factors which tend to increase an already predominant British influence. ^ At the north-west extremity of the Gulf, the still independent Shaikh of Kuwait has bound himself and his successors not to receive the representative of any other Power than Great Britain and not to alienate any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power, a proceeding which was dictated by the increasing encroachment of Turkish authority and by the incipient intrigues of other Powers. Outside the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but included within the same political sphere, the Arab Stale of Mask at has for years been controlled by British influence, its trade is in Anglo-Indian hands and its ruler, though supported by the joint declaration of Great Britain and France of 1862, has not merely been subsidised for years by the Government of India, but in 1891 entered into an agreement with us, not to alienate any portion of his dominions to any other Power. Such, briefly summarised, is the position that has been won by Great Britain in 'the Persian Gulf. In its vindication we have more than once been called upon to enter into military occupation of ports or islands iathe Gulf. Ahwaz on the Karun, Bushire, Kais, Kharak, Kishm and Mohammerali have witnessed the presence of Indian forces. The occupation of these places was an illustration of the vigour with which in past yeirs our ascendancy has been maintained. Their abandonment remains an indis putable evidence of pacific purpose. The recognition of these considerations is essential to a right understanding of the attitude adopted by Great Britain in regard to the maintenance, un impaired, ol her control in the Persian Gulf and to her resistance to the possible intrusion of a hostile Power in that region. Lhe grounds on which this claim is advanced and the steps by which her predominance has been acquired in this maritime field of diverse nationalities and clashincr interests, will be briefly traced in view of recent Turkish preten sions to challenge it. 2. In the 17th and 18th centuries the Persian Gulf was the arena of The Pirate days. successive conflicts between Portuguese. ^ ^ British action. I ) utch&gt; French and British&gt; By the beginning of the 19th century, the European factories had disappeared and piolonged internal turmoil had so greatly weakened Persia that her efforts were ineffectual in establishing supremacy among the tribes on the Arabian shore of the Persian Gulf. These petty Arab rulers who held sway along the littoral from the mouth of the Tigris to the Indian Ocean were either independent tribal chieftains or yielded nominal allegiance to the Wahahi Amirs of Nejd. Under the proselytising influence of the Wahabi movement which the lurks were unable to control, and which extended its aetivitv from the interior of Arabia to the shores of the Persian Gulf, the natural pirates of the coast were fused into an aggressive force of formidable character which brought them into sharp conflict with the British Government. The result was that not only had the naval forces constantly to be maintained in active service to suppress disorder in the Persian Gulf, but three large military expeditions were necessary between 1805-1819, before this lawless brood and the Jo was mis were subdued and a decisive blow dealt to piracy and slave trading. This vigorous contiict conducted entirely by British agency and means, unaided bv Persia or Turkey, resulted in 1820 in the establishment of the first General • Ahchison *8 Treaties, Vol. xn, page 172. treaty* between the British Government . „ and the combined Arab Chiefs of the Irucial Coast. Other treaties followed, serving a temporary purpose and was t Aitciuson's Treaties, Vol. xn, page 180. succeeded in lb53t by a Treaty of per- t petual peace under which the Chiefs bound themselves to refer all maritime disputes to the British Resident Bushire. In 1868 the Shukh of El Katar (Bida)-a peninsula which the lurks have claimed since 1871 on the ground that it formed an integral portion of the Wahabi^ dominions to which they had succeeded— signed - l similar agreement, pledging himself to observe the maritime peace of the^Gulf • but m 1871, desiring to escape this obligation which was too severe a strain upon his buccaneering propensities, he placed himself under Turkish protection and accepted a Turkish flag. 1 3.

But , • i r • , i ^ events were now ocourrinsr in N^irl which furnished the Porte with an excuse to meddle in affairs of the Arabian littoral. It will be necessary therefore hric% to refer to the Wahabi move ment and to the subsequent Turkish conquest of Neid and the reduction oft to vassalage, as it is on these conquests that the Porte mainly based its claim fn interfere in Nejd affairs in 1871. to carve out a portion of Arabia on the Persian Gulf as its teintory and to claim even sovereignty over Bahrain. „ O' th . e l r ] i3 t e , of Wahabism in Nejd, the Arxbs of the coast from Oiair to Katif had to yield their independence to the Amir of Neid. In 1800 Abdul 4 stormed Katil, occupied Bahrain and the adjacent islands of the Persian ft,,if The task of punishing the VVababis was entrusted by the Turkish Governmentto Ali Pasha, Viceroy of Egypt. Two expeditions were led and were so far sin-cesstul that the Amirs intermittently paid a small tribute to Exypt and, in order to he left undisturbed to pursue their designs of aggrandisement, they ncknow lodged the Sultan of lurkey as their Suzerain, although the vassalage wns merely nominal. Ihe Suzerain Power exercised no control over the aggressive course pursued by these Nejd Amirs.. Numerous remonstrances were addiessed to them by 15i'itain and only the appearance of a nMval armament at • Bombay political Department, Vol. 106 a of 1860, Bahrain* (1859) and Maskat compelled and A.tohi.on's awie,.

Eeysul, whom Colonel Pelly visited at Riadh with a view to enjoin on him the necessity of maintaining general peace and commercial development in the regions of the Persian Gulf, died in 1865, and was succeeded bv his son, who, in that year, entered into an engagement with the British Government not to molest the tribes under British protection. Ihe succession, however, was challenged and disturbances continued till 1S71 when Abdulla bin Feysul of the reigning Wahabi family being engaged in a conflict for the throne of Nejd with his brother Saud, applied to Midhat Pasha, the Turkish Vali of Baghdad, to co-operate in his restoration to power. The opportunity of extending Ottoman sway was too good to be missed. An expe dition under ^lidhat Pasha was sent ostensibly to settle differences between the two brothers but more probably to establish Turkish supremacy on the coast. There was at the time, also, a rumour reported by Colonel Herbert, His JVlajesty s Consul-General, Baghdad, 'that if the Nejd expedition were success ful, it would eventually be directed to the acquisition of Bahrain, Maskat and the Arab Coast ' and this rumour gained strength from a statement of Midhat Pasha, who asserted that Bahrain and its dependencies were countries t Secret i., 1871. No 9 .581-655. of ^ 0ttom an dominions. The Porte explicitly deniedf any intention of such designs. The Turks never penetrated to Nejd, but the military occupation of the district of Hasa involved the est iblishment of Turkish authority at Katif and Ojair and the location of a Turkish post at El Bida on the Katar Penin sula. Prom this expedition resulted the subsequent complications regarding British and Turkish claims along the Arabian littoral from the Shat-el-Arab to Odeid at the extreme southern corner of the Katar Peninsula. 6. It will perhaps be convenient here briefly to note the tribes and nilers Tribes, &amp;o., in occupation of the occupying the Arabian littoral mentioned Arabian Coast line. ^ succeec ii n g chapters as a help to an understanding of the whole. The territory of the Sultan of Maskat extends along the Arabian coast from Rakhiut in the south to Khor Kalba and from Dibba to Tibba. J he coast between Khor Kalba and Dibba is under the Shaikh of Sharga. From Shaam, adjoining Tibba, to Khor-el-Odeid at the extreme south of the Katar Peninsula, the coast line is divided among the Trucial Chiefs of Oman Ras-al-Khaimeh, Umm-al-Kowein, Ajman, Sharga, Debai and Abu Thabi. From Khor-el-Odeid round to Dohat-as-Salwa is the Katar Peninsula with Shaikhs of its own in the coast towns and villages. From Dohat to Ojair, the sea-port of the Hasa Sandjaq which belongs to the Turks, the tract is desert, while from Ojair to Has Tanura above Katif belongs to the Turks. The coast from Has Tanura to Kuwait may be said to belong to the Shaikh of Kuwait, who, however, claims jurisdiction down to Qasr-as-Subaih, while Jinnah and Musallamiya, two islands off the coast, are perhaps under Turkish jurisdiction.CHAPTER II.

Kejd or Hasa Sandjaq claim the whole of Eastern Arabia down to Odeid, if not further. Our view of Hasa is the Jlasa oasis and the Katif oasis which are the only inhabited localities and in the occupation of the Turks, and also the coast line from Katif town to Ojair, the latter being the seaport of the Hasa oasis and a Turkish Mudirate. 2. Boundaries of the Hasa oasis. —The boundaries of the Hasa oasis are ♦Page642. tbus described in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer.* The Hasa oasis has its north-western corner at Jabal Qarab-ar-Rukban and its south-western corner at Jabal Bu Ghanimah, while its southern boundary runs from Jabal !Hu Ghanimah to Jabal Arba and thence tor several miles further to the east * on the remaining sides the borders of the district are not preciselv defined by conspicuous features. Within these limits, its extent is about 35 'miles from north to south, and its breadth may be taken at 20 miles. The Hasa oasis is enclosed by the desert tracts of Ghuwar on the west, Kharmah on the south and Biyadh on the east and north, at Jabal Qarab-ar-Eukban it touches Badd-al-Asis and at its opposite or south-eastern extremity it meets Jafurah. Ihe town of Hoi'uf, of which the position is well ascertained, is situated in the district near its south-western corner; and the eastern border of the oasis approaches within ab(ut30 miles of the Persian Gulf coast at the port of Oqair' (Ojair). 1 t Page 1535. - The Katif oasis is thus describedf in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. 3. Boundaries of the Kaiif oasis.—' The • * oasis immediatelv adjoins the coast for a short distance on both sides of the town of the same name; on the east it is bounded by the sea, and 011 the other sides it is enclosed by tne large desert tra' t ot Biyadh, execpt at its south end upon the coast where it meets Barr-adh-Dhahran. The oasis extends about nine miles north and the same distance south of Katif town, and has thus a total length of about 18 miles; its depth from the coast inland is on the average about three miles.' 4. Extent^ of ihe Arabian littoral recognised by JI s Majesty's Gov- ernmenf as in lurkish control.—The correspondence after the Neid expedition regarding the extent to which Turkish jurisdiction on the Arabian coast of &gt; &gt; r recognised is entangled and the pronouncements ot Bis Jlajesty s Government conflicting.* 0. In 1&amp;79, however, the question of Turkish jurisdiction on the Arabian Secret, Septeuiber 1879, Nos. 25-47. shore of the Persian Gulf came verv n 1 -p t i• m particularly under the consideration of the Government of India. They recommended that the authority of the Porte should be recognised as established on land from Basrah to Oiair. From this it would appear that the Government of that day accepted the Hasa Province a^ extending from -Basrah to Ojair. South and east of Ojair the Government of India recommended that 1 urk'sh authority should not be recognised except atElBida on the Katar Peninsula and that the Porte should be required to stipulate not to interfere on the coast or inland with the Trueial Chiefs between Odeid and Eas al Khaimrh. The Government of the day apparently held that Katar began at Ojair and ended at Odeid, JThe conclusions of the Secretary of State for India were * * ' ^0 limit of the Ottoman jurisdiction along the coast, if it is to be defined at all, could scarcely be fixed at any point north of Ojair.' , ' Her Majesty's Government might, if it were deemed expedient, legiti mately decline to recognise any part of the coast south of Kuwait as subject to Turkey, even if Ottoman authority were established there much more firmly than rt ally is the case.' Subject to the conditions above stated Lord Cranbrook ' does not see any snificient reason for objecting to the establishment of such relations between the Turkish authorities in A1 Hasa and the tribes of the Guttur peninsula as may be agreeable to the parties concerned.' 6. The territorial question between the British and Turkish Governments remained shelved, not solved for many years later. In 1888 the London Foreign Olfice telegraphed to His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople 'our External A, November 1888, Nos. 102-151 (Fro. position is clearly defined. We rCCOg- No ■ 30 ^ nise Turkish jurisdiction as far as Katif, and are anxious that it should be effectively exercised within thosb limits. Beyond that point we consider the Chiefs to be independent, and having engagements with them we object to attempt to extend Turkish authority over them.' (Incidentally it may be remarked that in 1888 His Majesty's Gov ernment apparently considered that below Katif the Guttur or Katar coast commenced.) A similar declaration was made in 1893 by Sir C. Ford, His Majesty's Ambassador a 4 ; Constantinople, who admitted Turkish suzerainty only as far as ' a place called Katif'. Now in 1901 in connection with the murder of some Bahrainese at El Derya about 30 or 40 miles south of Katif^ the question of Turkish jurisdiction south of Katif—the place —arose. The Secret e ., Apni iQoi, Noa. 5-io. Secretary of State in this connection asked ' Have we ever recognised terri torial jurisdiction of Turkey south of El Katif, and considering ineffective nature of Turkish control is it advisable to recognise it ? If so, within what limit ? ' The Viceroy replied— 'I cannot find that Turkish territorial jurisdiction south of Katif town has been explicitly recognised. But notwithstanding Ford's despatch of 1893, it is difficult to dispute that Katif district extends to Ojair. Resident now writes that in reply to complaint of Consul, Wali of Basrah states he had already heard of occurrence and has ordered arrest and punishment of offenders. In these circumstances, it seems unnecessary that Foreign Office should take action'. 7. Whether in consequence of the foregoing statement or not it is difficult to trace, but the position for some years has been that His Majesty's Government recognise Turkish claims as far as Ojair: south of Ojair and on the Katar Peninsula including El Bida, where the Turkish garrison has been tacitly allowed to continue, though never actually acquiesced in, His Majesty's Government have always declined to recognise Turkish pretensions. 8. But Turkish acceptance of the position stated in the preceding para graph is desirable and steps to this end are being taken (May 1911) in connec tion with the settlement of the Kuwait and Baghdad Railway questions. The Ottoman Government desire the assent of His Majesty's Government to the increase of the Turkish Customs duties. The occasion will be utilised to , T7 ., . TT propose* to the Porte that the southern- • Vtde Appendix II. , t •, &lt;• m i • i • • -i • • most limit or lurkish jurisdiction on the littoral of the Persian Gulf shall be Ojair in the district of Katif and that they should renounce all claim to the supremacy over any point on the littoral south of Ojair.CHAPTER III. Turkish occupation of El Bida. Extent of the Katar Peninsula. Mention was made in Chapter II of the recognition by His MaiestVs Government of Turkish claims in Hasa and as far south as Ojair, and of the denial ot Turkish authority on the Katar Peninsula. It is, however, well to draw a distinction between Hasa and Katar and not to include the latter in the former. The military oocupation of Hasa secured the recognition of Turkish claims as far south as Ojair, but not in Katar where the footing of the Turks is somewhat different and acquired later by different means, viz., hy the invitation of the local Chiefs of Bida. At that place a small Turkish guard is maintained, but the administrative authority still remains in the hands of the local Arab Shaikhs. The Turkish Government may, therefore, with some reason, argue that their present actual position on tnis coast does involve constructively domination over the entire tract lying between Ojair and El Bida. Such a claim would, of course, be affected by any British rights or obli-a- tions on the coast referred to. Between Ojair and the' Solwa bay, which latter according to the Persian Gulf Gazetteer, is the southernmost limit of the Hasa Sandjaq, there are no habitations. It is desert and may, therefore, be omitted irom consideration. 2. Boundaries of the Katar Peninsula. —The boundaries of the Katar 1 eninsula are described in tiie Persian Gulf Gazetteer as follows * ' On the east, nortli and west Katar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak, thence, according to one account, it strikes east north-east to the north end ot the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east bv south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-Odaid ' • * • ' The British Government have recognised Khor-al- Odaid as belonging to Abu Tbabi, and the boundarv consequently cannot he placed nearer Trucial Oman, though the A1 Thani Shaikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat JVlatti. ,, + ad(le(1 . tlle London Foreign Office intend to get the Turks out ot hi Bida and negotiations in connection with the settlement of the Baghdad Railway and questions connected with the Persian Gulf are under the consider- « vide Appendix ii. at i 011 His Majesty's Government. nu n x • xi x / 0ne of tlie Proposals* to be put to the Ottoman Government is that tbcy should renounce all claim to supremacy over any point on the littoral of the Persian Gulf south of Ojair in the district of Katif, and the India Oftice has suggested that the door should be left open to us to conclude agreements with the Katar people, if necessary. wifW ^ ^ h ° W . far ' in the absence of special agreements TW I .

A further incident which took place in 1895 is important on account of the pronouncement made to the Porte. A division of the Al-bin-Ali tribe, residing in Bahrain, quarrelled with Shaikh Isa and fled with their Shukh and formed a settlement at Zobara with the support of the Turks and Shaikh Jasim, intending to attack and plunder Bahrain. A Turkish official, appointed Mudir Secret e., February 1897, noa. 157-158. Zobara by the 1 orte, declared Bahrain unconditionally, and the Katar Coast as partly, subject to Ottoman jurisdiction. His Majesty's Ambassador addressed a remonstrance to the Porte regarding the proceedings of the local Turkish officials on the Katar Coast, and on the 23rd August 1895, the following memorandum was communicated to the Turkish Ambassador in London:— ' Her Majesty's Government do not admit that the part of the coast (Katar Coast) is under Turkish jurisdiction and they have several times given notice of this to the Turkish Government and have notiiled to tiiem that Bahrain is under British protection ' It was also added that the above- mentioned contention of the Mudir of Zobara could not in any way be admitted. The Government of India decided that, as Jasim had been the cliief instigator in the Al-bin-Ali trouble, he should be compelled to pay Rs. 30,000 which lie refused to do, but which was recovered to a great extent by other means. Meanwhile, a British Naval expedition proceeded to Zobara, persuaded some of the Al-bin-Ali to return to Bahrain, destroyed and captured a nunib o r of boats belonging to those who refused, and caused the place to be evacuated. The recalcitrant portion of the Al-bin-Ali under taeir Shaikh removed to Bida.9 Tho Porte having protested on the 6th November 1896 against the British naval expedition to Zohara, the following note was addressed to the Turkish Ambassador in London in December 1896 :— ' Your Excellency states that Zobara has been under the dominion of the secret E, p,bra.r, 1897. No., 161 -168. Turkish Empire from the earlie8t times, and that the Imperial Government con sider that the proceedings of Her Majesty's ships against a tribe which had taken refuge under the Ottoman flag constitute an act of hostility incompatible with the friendly relations existing between the two countries. 'In reply to Your Excellency's note, I beg leave to remind you of what is stated in regard to the position of Bahrain and Zobara in the Memorandum which was communicated to Your Excellency's predecessor on the 23rd of August of last year. ' Her Majesty's Government adhere to the view expressed in that Memo randum. They consider that the measures in question were necessary for the defence of Bahrain, which is under the protection of Great Britain, and they cannot admit the contention that the portion of the coast of the Persian Gulf in which Zobara is situated is within the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Empire.' 7. In December 1893, the Turks objected to the visit of H. M.'s 'Brisk' to Bida and to the proposal of the Commander to hold torpedo practice in what was claimed to be Turkish waters. In this connection the Government of India authorised the Kesident in the Persian Gulf * to secret e.. may 1894, Nos. 558-5C9. inform the Senior Naval Officer, Aden Division, that His Majesty's ships were not to recognise Turkish rule at El Bida, and that British Naval Com manders had long been empowered to act at El Bida, as at other places on the El Katar Coast, in such manner as might be necessary to prevent, or punish, disturbances of the ^maritime peace. It was explained, however, that the Governor-General in Council was desirous that British Naval Officers should avoid giving Turkish officials any opportunity of asserting by overt action, such nominal authority as the Porte possesses in the locality, and considered that, to this end, His Majesty's ships should refrain from visiting the harbour of El Bida, except when special occasion arose for so doing. The instructions were approved by Her late Majesty's Government. 8. His Majesty's ships can further take action against the Ratar Chiefs Secret e., March 1907. Nos. 72C-.728. ? nd tribesmen in cases of proved piracy in territorial waters. This principle was enunciated in a case of piracy committed in 19U7 on a Persian boat at Abu Dhaluf on the Katar Coast, and affirmed in 1910 in a similar case at Euwairat also on the Katar Coast. The following extract contains the present views of His Majesty's Government as regards action in cases of piracy on the Katar Coast:— ' It will be seen that, although the deliberate wrecking of the Persian boat is not clearly established, the Acting Political Besident is of opinion that the tribesmen on the coast were guilty of improper action in the case, and it is proposed that a fine of Rs. 1,000 should be exacted and paid to the Persians in partial compensation of their loss, and that the gear, &amp;c., of the wrecked boat in the possession of the tribesmen should be restored, or in default, that their value, Bs. 650, should also be paid. If necessary, this penalty would be enforced by seizing at sea some of the tribesmen's boats. ' On the other hand, the Porte claims sovereign rights over the coast of El Katar which have never been admitted by the British Government. But since the question has not been settled and it is doubtful whether the penalties proposed could be enlorced without action on shore, it would seem to be expedient to avoid intervention unless a clear case for it could be established. In the present case there are elements of doubt, and Secretary Sir E. Grey may be disposed on these grounds to defer the action proposed by the Government of India until a better case is established.'10 r • India Office to Foreign Office, dated the 17th Jann- •S nry 1907. ^ .

In 1903-01, Turkish Mudirs were appointed at Odeid,—which the Government of India consider to be Abu Thabi territory (see Trucial Chiefs)—Wakra and Zobara. His Majesty's Government protested and the officers who had started to join their appointments were recalled, a British warship being sent to prevent the Mudir landing at Wakra. Again in 1910 similar appointments were either actually made or attempted. Hepresentations were made at Constantinople that the proceeding was a disturbance of the status quo, and an assurance was given by the Porte that if sunh appointments had been made by the Mutasarif of El Hasa, they would be cancelled. 10. But while vigorous action against these appointments on the Katar Coast was taken by His Majesty's Government, they have nevertheless deprecated (1903-05) the revival of our Treaty of 1868 with the principal Chief of Katar, who, at the time of the Turkish occupation in 1871, accepted a Turkish flag and the title of Kaimakam, but who in 1902 asked to be taken under British protection. —' ' The request was referred to Secretary of State, with the remark that the Government of India saw no objection pro. ao. 526 in secret e., jdy 1902, nos. 519-526. to the Resident being permitted to institute enquiries as to the actual position of Ahmed-bin-Thani, and that, should it prove that the Shaikh was established as Chief of El Katar, they would propose to authorise Colonel Kemball to conclude with him an agreement similar to those excuted with the Trucial Chiefs of the Arab Coast. It was added that this agreement would involve an assurance to the Chief of protection agairst Turkey and other Powers. On the 5th September 1902, the Secretary of State concurred in the Pro. No. 66 in Secret e ., May 1903, Nos. 64- proposed action, but said that, before any 87- steps were taken towards the conclusion of the proposed agreement, the question of the extension of the British Protec torate in Arabia would have to be considered carefully, both from the political and from the military point of view. The Secretary of State was informed on the 19th Jar uary 1903, to the effect that Jasim-bin-Thani was the recognised Chief of Katar, and that the Turks styled him Kaimakam, though he repu diated the title ; that his brother, Ahmed-bin-Thani, was the de facto Chief, and was regarded as heir to his brother who was over 80 years of ai?e. The Viceroy suggestedf that to prevent Tur kish designs, it wouid be wise to enter into an agreement, but that if His Majesty's Government were not prepared to take this step at once, which would, perhaps, depend upon the attitude of the Turks, the Shaikh might be told that we prefer to wait till he succeeds later on to the Chiefship.

In this view the'Foreign Office concurred in November 1903.

At the present time (February 1905) when a general sense of insecurity and suspicion prevails in the neighbourhood of the Persian Gulf, His Majesty's Government are unwilling to raise any question touching the status quo in this quarter. They propose shortly to refer for examination by the Defence Com mittee the whole question of our policy in this region.' 11.

The Secretary of State requested the views of Government, and the following reply was sent on the Ist December 1910:— 'El Katar, Colonel Cox has been consulted on the question raised in your telegram, dated the Gth October. Ue has sent the following reply : ' I find it difficult at the present juncture to discuss question apart from general Anglo- Turkey situation in the Guif. 'Consul, Basrah, writes in a letter which I have just received that the new Vali when asked what action be had taken regarding Zakhnuniyeh, replied • ir-v ^ ^ vi • i C i that the island is Turkish territory and • i tde nnder Zakbnuniyen on page 51. in i .1*. o J challenged right* of Consul to discuss it either officially or privately. He added that he was astonished that the Consul did not mind his own business, which was trade. It is thus perfectly + i/^r. at r 0 a ka clear that communications made to tl e t rtde pages 54-56. n • j ^ 1 rorte regarding recentf incidents have had no effect, and it seems to me that the position has become humiliating and impossible, and that frequent recurrence oi; unpleasant incidents is inevitable unless atmosphere is quickly cleared. ' It appears to be generally agreed that the temporizing policy which we have pursued for years past v\ ill not serve the purpose with the young Turk regime, and I submit that their recent attempts to upset the stutus quo and their assertive attitude give us strong and imperative grounds for settling issues now. ' From a local standpoint, what is needed in order to clear the air is: t Vide Kuwait,p.g e .21.46. first, that we should cease to make a secret 01 our agreement with Kuwait| and should inform the Porte that we intend to make it effective—if we cau simultaneously eliminate the anomaly of the Turkish Hag at Kuwait, I strongly recommend it: second, that we should bring about the withdrawal of the § Vide page 47. Turkish military posts from Bubivan,§ Bida, Zakhnuniyeh, Um Kasr, and Jinnah, and the final abolition of Mudirates at Wakra, &amp;c., and induce the Turks to confine themselves to recognized possessions at Katar (Katil ?) and Ojair: third, that having achieved second item we should make treaties on lines of Trucial Coast Agreement with Bin Thani and, if necessary, with other headmen on the west coast of Katar. ' Whether the achievement of the above end is possible by means of comprehensive reciprocal compromise, or whether coercive measures will be12 necessary is a question beyond my purview, but I oan conceive no quid p^o quo which we could offer Porte in this sphere in exchange for withdrawal of her pretensions. Possibly it could be found in some other sphere. 'In the event of coercive measures bein? necessary we can never expect the recurrence of such a favourable juncture locally as at present exists. We have strong squadron in the Persian Gulf in connection with arms traffic, which would make naval demonstration simple matter, while the numerical strength of Turkish military posts in question has just been reduced to minimum under Nazim Pasha's scheme for concentrating troops at Baghdad. ' The achievement of above measures would be complete consolidation of our position on Arab Coast and in Gulf generally, especially in regard to pearl fishery question,* and if it is ever to • r %de p«ge 57. ^ about, it seems essential that action should be taken now. If action is delayed, the suggested association of Turkey with Triple Alliance and the increase of her Navy may render the task very difficult, if not impossible. In any cnse, therefore, I respectfully urge necessity for adjusting position with Turkey forthwith by one method or another, and eliminating the chronic elements of friction which have now become dangerous. ' I consider that on grounds above explained, it would be useless now to make treaty with Bin Thani, unless we are prepared to do so openly and to bring about elimination of Turkisii influence from Katar as suggested in item 2 above. Without such simultaneous action, the existence of the treaty would only be a source of dansrer to the Thani family from the present Turkish regime and they would themselves fight shy of it. ' The Government of India added— ' We concur with Colonel Cox. In our opinion, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions at Katif and Ojair, no advantage would accrue from treaties with Katar Chiefs, and Chiefs would probably not now agree to enter into treaties.' The matter regarding the proposed treaty was dropped. His Majesty's Government were of opinionf (Decem- f External B, March 1911, Nos. 13-30. , -i m a \ i-i * i i .ii her 1910) that no advantage will accrue from any treaty or treaties with the Katar Shaikhs from the point of view of our relations with Turkey, unless the Turks can be induced to confine themselves to their recognised possessions in El Katif. If, and when, the Turks have been induced so to confine themselves, the treaties will, from an inter national point of view, be no longer necessary. This opinion has, however, since been modified and in connection with the proposed general settlement with Turkey the India Office has suggested to the Poreign Office that the door should be left open to us to conclude agreements with the Katar people, if necessary— vide paragraph 3, Chapter III. The wider issues raised by Colonel Cox and the suggestion to come to a comprehensive settlement with Turkey are dealt with on pages 64 to 56.CHAPTER V. Trucial Chiefs. (Pirate Coast.)

We have been in treaty relations with the Trucial Chiefs since 1820 British relations with the Trucial an ^ our - Position there is one of tacitf Chieis predominance. Tlien it was that the first + S e!; April S n^'Sw 6 ' General Treaty was signed and in 1839 the maritime truce was concluded by which the Chiefs engaged not to engage in hostilities by sea. So successful was the truce that it was renewed from time to time until 1853 when it was succeeded by a treaty of perpetual peace that has lasted ever since. The treaty provided for a complete cessation of hostilities at sea between the subjects of the signatory Chiefs and laid down that in the event of aggressions on anyone by sea, the injured parties should not retaliate, but refer the matter to the Political Resident, Eushire, and that the British Government should watch over the peace of the Gulf and secure the observance of the treaty. 4. In 1892, a fresh agreement was concluded with the Trucial Chiefs Treaty of 1892, with the Trucial Chiefs. which provides that— (i) On no account shall any agreement or correspondence be entered into with any Power other than the British Government. (ii) Without the assent of the British Government they shall not consent to the residence within their territories of the agent of any other Government. (iii) On no account shall they cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation any part of their territories save to the British Government. 5. When Lord Curzon visited the Gulf in 1903, he addressed the assembled Chiefs at Sharga, declaring that out of the relations thus created (vide paragraphs 3 and 4 supra) and which by the consent of these Chiefs had ' constituted the British Government the guardian of inter-tribal peace,' there had grown up political ties between the Government of India and themselves, ' whereby the British Gooemment became your overlords and protectors, and you have relations with no other power. Every one of the States known as the Trucial States has bound itself ' * * * « U ot to enter into any agree ment or correspondence with any other Power, uot to admit the Agent of any other Government, and not. to part with any portion of its territories. These engagements are binding on every one of you, and you have faithfully adhered • to them. They are also binding in their reciprocal effect upon the British Government, and as long as ihey are faithfully observed by the Chiefs there is no fear that anyone else will be allowed to tamper with your rights or liberties '. 6.

It has been proposed to locate a European British officer on the coast and to issue an Order in Council legalising British jurisdiction there. There is also a proposal to colonise Zora making it a Britisu enclave. These proposals are under consideration. 9. Among the conditionsf which His Majesty's Government propose to t Appendix ii P ut ^ ie ^ ur ^i s ^ Government in return for British assent to the increase of Turkish Customs duties is that the Porte renounces all claim to supremacy over any point on the littoral of the Persian Gulf south of Ojair and recognises that subjects of the Trucial Chiefs, who may be resident in Turkey, shall enjoy British Consular protection. 10. Wahabi incursions penetrated to Oman and the Trucial Coast and Wahabi relations with the Trucial the Amirs w r ere successful for a time in chie ^ s _ ^ extracting a religious tithe (Zikat) from the Trucial Chiefs.

In 1906, however, there was an attempt by the present Wahabi Amir to visit the Trucial Coast which caused the Chiefs some anxiety. His Majesty's Government agreed that if the Wahabi Amir canied out his intention he should be warned against interference in the aifairs of the Chiefs who were likewise told not to intrigue with Bin Saud. y* yCHAPTER VI. Maskat and Gwadur. Following the coast line mentioned in Chapters IT, ITT nnd V the domi- nions of the Sultan of Maskat are now xten o man reached. Tt 1»as been shown (Chapter II)that D is Majesty's GoYemment recognise Turkish authority as far south as Ojair: from Ojair to Khor el Odeid thp sovereisrnty is uncertain. At the last named place the Pirate Coast (Trucial Chiefs) begins and terminates at Shaam. adjoining Tihha, where the Sultanate of Oman begins and runs as far as Dibba. From this point to Khor Kalba the coast is under the Shaikh of Sbarga (Trucial Chief) and Oman territory is again entered and runs to Bakhiut in the south where it terminates. 2. The weakness resulting from a disputed succession gave the Wahabis ^ _ a footing in Maskat. In 1800 they Wahabi Power m Oman. j ^ ^ J made the nrst appearance in Oman, reduced all the sea coast of the Persian Gulf from Pasrah to Debai, released the Chiefs of Zahira and Sohar and forced the Sultan to seek a three years' truce which they soon broke. Wahabi contests with Maskat were renewed in 1808, 1832, 1845, 1852 and 1864-1805. During these contests the Wahabis were invariably victorious and succeeded in exacting annual tribute to the extent of about 17,000 crowns. The Pritish Government rarely actually interfered between Maskat and the Wahabis. but it always lent a moral support to Maskat in the difffrences of that State with the Wahabis by sending vessels of war to the Arab Coast when hostilities threatened, and in one instance (1865-66) guns and material were supplied to the Sultan of Maskat in resisting the Wahabi Amir. Put tne Wahabi Power in Oman was net crushed. It retained its hold till 1871 when the Turks occupied Hasa and necessitated withdrawal of the Wahabis to meet difficulties arising in Central Arabia. 3. Pritish connection with Maskat is of long standing. Treaties of ^ friendship and commerce, as well as for British connection witn Maskat. ,, * c i • i the suppression of slavery, piracy and for the extersicn of the electric telegraph, have been concluded with successive Imams of Maskat on different occasions since 1798. In that year the first erffacrement was entered into for the exclusion of French influence which con templated finding a convenient base at Maskat for an attack on India. 4. In 1856 a dispute arose, on the death of Saiyid Said, between his sons as to the possession of Zanzibar and IVIaskat, hitherto united under the same ruler. The Government of India was referred to as Arbitrator, and Lord Canning's award (1861) was that the two States should remain separate and that Zanzibar should pay a \early subsidy of 40,000 crowns for the abandon ment bv Maskat of all claims on Zanzibar. On the death of the ruler of Maskat,'Zanzibar refused to continue the subsidy, on the ground that it was personal to Saiyid Thoweni, the Puler at the time of the award. The Govern ment of India stepped in and insisted on its continuance. In 1873, on the conclusion of slave treaties with Zanzibar and Maskat, the former was relieved, though not formally, of the payment of the subsidy, which since that date has been paid without intermission by the Government of India—except when suspended on account of the Sultan's obstructiveness and when taken into account to pay in part losses suffered by Pritish subjects on account of cmeutes or fires in which the complicity of the Sultan was unquestionable. The condi tions of the subsidy were clearly laid down and guaranteed in 1873'to Sultan Saivid Turki during his rule ' so long as he ccntimus faithful to fulfil his treaty engagements and manifests his friendship towards the Pritish Govern- mtnt '. No similar guarantee of the continuance of the subsidy has ever been given to the present ruler, Saiyid Faisal. 5. Generally it is a fact that since 1856 no Sultan of Maskat has been able effectively to establish his position without obtaining the recognition ofthe British Government, while there is nothing to show that any other Foreign Government has ever been applied to for similar recognition. Notably in 1888, it did not seem by any means certain that the present Sultan, Saivid Faisal, would make good his claim to the throne. Ttiere is no reoognised law cf suocession in Maskat. The formal recognition by the Government of India was withheld temporarily, but on the Sultan's formal assumption of power the subsidy, Rs. 7,200 a month, was continued to him and he was finally recog nised in 1890. Upon that occasion the Sultan intimated his intention to maintain to the full the same relations as existed with the British Government in the time of his father, and to act up to all the engagements undertaken by his father and predecessors in the Government of Maskat. He then also pledged himself in an assurance to the following effect: ' It is my earnest desire to be guided in all important matters of policy by the advice of the British Government and to so conduct the Government as to secure the conti nued friendship and approbation of the Viceroy and the British Government.' , 6. Throughout our relations with Maskat, the Government of India have on several occasions been called upon to intervene in dynastic disputes, have interned claimants in India and preserved the reigning Sultan from atrack, and have given him loans to carry on the Government and discharge personal debts and otherwise dealt with him as only a Power possessing a recognised and effective supremacy could rlaim to act. In 1871, the British fleet actively supported the Sultan against his rebellious cousin ; in 1877 and 1883 a Briti/li ship defended the town of Maskat from attack by rebellious tribesman ; in 1877 the Dutch Consul requested British co-operation in the negotiation of their treaty with Maskat, and the Sultan of 1814 communicated the commer cial treaty wrh France regarding tariff to the British Government for approval. In ]89i. the present Sultan voluntarily entered into an engagement not to cede, sell or otherwise give Maskat territory to any Power except the British Government. In 1894!-95, when the Sultan's position was threatened by rebellion the Government of India warned the rebellioiis Suaikh to ce ise from attacking the Sultan, and when the French Government deprecated unilateral action of this nature. His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris was ins tructed in 189o to state that there was 'no intention on the part of His Majesty's Government to depart from the eng igement of 1862,' and in Nov ember 1895 tlie Sultan was authorised to issue a notification warning the lead ing Shaikhs of Oman that Government would not permit attack on Maskat or Muttra, whatever differences might arise between the Sultan and his Snaikhs; and in the same year, when the people of Dhofar rose in rebellion, tho Govern ment of India enabled the Sultan to put an end to the rising. Finallv in August 1909 when a Maskat dhow was captured by the Italians on the Banadir Coast, the Sultan appealed for redress to His Majesty's Government, who have come to an arrangement (February 1911) with the Italian Govern ment on the subject. Such are the evidences of the friendly and nenevolent spirit consistently displayed by the British Government to the Sultan, who in tne main owes to them his present position, the means he enjoys and the continued occupation of his throne. 7. British political predominance at Maskat has been accentuated by the facts that the trade of the British dominions with Maskat amounts to 66*57 of the entire trade of the country, and that the latter is mainly in the hands of Indian traders, while the French and American trade, the other two countries who have direct treaty relations with Maskar, is respectively 2 3i and 6 , 39. The only other country which takes any considerable amount is Belgium on account of the arms trade which amounts to 11*02. 8. It was not till 1891 that a French Vice-Consulate was established at .. . , __ , . Maskat. llus \Aas followed bv French connection with Maskat. . . . . , * xiance obtaining in lb98 the lease of a coaling station at Bunder Jissah, which was held to be a violation of the agreement of 1891 and an ultimatum was presented to the Sultan demanding the cancellation of the lease, which was complied with. Tne Sultan at the same time requested British protection against the French, in case it should prove that he had incurred the displeasure of tiie latter. When the case was submitted to the Law O.licers of the Crown, they held (1) that the Franco-British declaration of 186217 rpciprocally puarnnteeing tlie i n depend en oe of Maskat did not require the British Government to abstain troni exercising piedominant intluence in IVJaskal so long as that influence was not exerted in a wav inconsistent with the independence of Maskat; the subsidy and the terras on which it was made payable involved no breach of declaration ; and (2) that the British Govern ment would be justified in punishing and even deposing a particular Sultan who broke engagements with the British Government, the consent of Prance not being necessary. Another question of importance was the French flag case. The award of the Hague Tribunal (1905) is as follows :— (1) That before the 2nd January 3 892, France was entitled to authorise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to fly the French flag, only bound by her own legislation and administrative rules; (2) that owners of dhows, who, before 1892, had been authorised by France to fly the French flag, retained this authorisation as long as France renewed it to the grantee; and (3) that after the 2nd January 1892, France was not entitled to autho rise vessels belonging to subjects of His Highness the Sultan of Maskat to fly the French flag, except on condition that their owners, or fitters-out. had established, or should establish, that they had been considered and treated by France as her ' proteges ' before the year 1863; and, with regard to the effect, transference or transmission of flags so granted, it was decided— (1) that dhows of Maskat authorised as aforesaid to fly the French flag were entitled in the territorial waters of Maskat to the inviolabi^ lity provided by the French Maskat Treaty of 17th November 1^44); (2) that the authorisation to fly the French flag could not be trans mitted or transferred to any other person, or to any other dhow, even if belonging to the same owner; and (3) that subjects of the Sultan of Maskat, who were owners or masters of dhows authorised to fly the French flay, or who were members of the crews of such vessels, or who belonged to their families, did not enjoy, in consequence of that fact, any right of exterri toriality which could exempt them from the sovereignty, espe cially from the jurisdiction of His Highness the'Sultan of Maskat. i 9. It will have been noticed that His Majesty's Government have long Treaty rights at Maskat. exercised a preponderant influence at Maskat, but that this influence does not amount to the direct control of the foreign relations of Maskat, the Sulian of which has treaties with the United States (1833), France (1844), Franco- British declaration (1862), Holland (1877). For present purposes, the above treaties sutfice and notice only need be diwn to Article II of the Treaty of 1883 and Article 11 of the Treaty of 1844 and the Franco-British declaration of 1862. Both the French and American treaties provide that import of all kinds of merchandise into Maskat shall be entirely free and the French treaty provides that there should be no prohibition either of import or export of anv article. The treaty with the Netherlands simply provides for the most-favoured-nation treatment. The question arises whether in view of the above articles the Sultan can, if he desires, prohibit import of arms and ammunition into bis territory. From page 365 of Hall's Internatioral Law a treaty becomes void 'by incompatibility with the general obligations of a State when a change has taken place in un disputed law or in views universally held with regard to morals'. It is reasonable to argue that such a change has taken place since the above treaties. When the treaties with France and America were concluded, the possibilitv of Maskat becoming a centre for the distribution of weapons endangering the peace of the Sultan 's own dominions which have been secured to him byBritish intervention and support was not contemplated. America, France, and the Saltan would appear to have accepted the position as one that has changed since the date of the treaties in question. Since the date of tho^e treaties the Sultan has issued proclamations prohibiting the import of arms into Gwadur and also prohibiting export from Maskat to India, Persia and the Somali Coast. Neither Prance nor America has protested against the pro clamations as infringements of the terms of the treaties and the validity of the (January) 1898 proclamation was demonstrated in the S. S. ' Baluchistan '* case. The case as regards France is strong, for in 1897, when the Sultan proposed to raise the import duty on arms from 5 to 7^ per cent, the French Government refused to consent, on the ground that it involved a modification of the tariff presented by the treaty of 184)1. As mentioned above, they raised no protest against the proclamation of 1898. One of the reasons which induced the British Government to come to arrangements with Maskat was the Sultan's desire to stop the growth of the traffic as dangerous to his own position. Rebellions against his authority in Dhofar and Muttra had proved that the tribesmen were armed and the British Government had given advice and even lent its active aid in restoring the Sultan's authority. The London Foreign Office is, however, of opinion that it would be difficult to argue that conditions have altered to such a degree since the con clusion of the Maskat treaty with France as to justify the Sultan in withdraw ing from the treaty against the wishes of France and that such arguments would not hold good in an international court. 10. There is abundant evidence that His Highness, Sir Faisal bin Turki has been prevaricating and that so far from discouraging the export of arms he has aided the trade, despite his proclamation of 1898 which he issued under the belief that he would not suffer pecuniarily by assisting us. It is because the stoppage of the arms trade touches his pockets through the Customs Depart ment that he is determined to oppose our endeavours to suppress the trade. France, however, is practically the only country we shall have to reckon with— arms merchants have already appealed to the French Government—although, there are not wanting signs that Germany is active at Maskat through Habib Sulayim, a Maskati, long resident in the Congo, who visited Germany in 1907, and is seemingly an agent for a firm in Hamburg and a confidant of the Sultan. It may be added, in the event of strong measures being contemplated, that in March 1898 the Political Besident was told to bear in mind that, thougu strong measures would relieve the situation, they are incompatible with the desire of His Majesty's Government to avoid complications with France. Political conditions have since altered, but despite the entente cordiale, the French Government have been consistently antagonistic in the matter of the arms trade. As recently as September 1908, a renewed suggestion to approach the French Government on the subject of the arms trade w-as made bv the Government of India in exchange for territory elsewhere. Negotiations between His Majesty's Government and the French Government are still (May 1911) in progress, but there is little hope of a satisfactory issue. 11. The Sultan is a G.C.I.E.—conferred at the time of Lord Curzon's visit to the Persian Gulf in 1903—and has a permanent salute of 2i guns. 12. Gwadur. —The Sultan of Maskat also possess Gwadur on the Mekran shore of the Persian Gulf which has been in possession of the Rulers of Maskat since the close of the 18th century when it was conferred upon Sahid Sultan a Maskat refugee, by the Khan of Ivalat. Whether it was a free gift in perpe tuity and in sovereignty as a fief with obligation to pay tributeor only a tempo rary gift for maintenance is a moot point. Lord Curzon in his ' Persia', Vol II page 432, holds the view that it was a free gift. Tribute, however, in the shape of presents of slaves and money, was paid to Kalat till 1858. Shortlv after Khudadad Khan sent his son to Mekran to recover Gwadur, but troubles caused by the Nowsherwans of Kharan prevented the attainment of this object Thus, for over 50 years Maskat has been in possession of Gwadur as absolute owner and sovereign. The question of the rendition of Gwadur to Baluchistan was first raised during Lord Curzon's Viceroyalty by Saiyid Muhammad bin Azam, Vazir of the Sultan of Maskat, in conversation with Major Cox in the months of19 January and Pebmary of 1901. The Vazir told Major Cox repeatedly that it was vitally important for the British Government to become possessed of (xvvadur. Major Cox did not feel sure whether the Vazir's motives were honest or whether he did not wish to entrap him into some expressions, which M. Ottavi, the French Consul, could make capital ot to create a misunderstanding between the British Government and the Saltan. It was possible that the Bussians had designs on the place, and there was one M. Zaroudny who was lurking about the Perso-Mekrau frontier at the time. Major Cox was told in reply under orders of Lord Curzon— ' So far nothing has been heard of foreign designs on Gwadur, but it is a Pro. No. us in Secret e ., September 1902, point that requires careful watching. ^^09 ■ llM18 - I am to request that should the Saltan ever allude again to Gwadur, the opportunity may be taken to remark that the Hritish Government would certainly not permit Gwadur, surrounded as it is by territory under their control, to be in any way associated with another power.' The question was then raised whether, in order to prevent the importation Secret e., September 1902, nos. iii-iis. arms by way of Gwadur, it would not be feasible to detach it from the Sultan's dominions in Oman. The Secretary of State was addressed, it being suggested that an attempt should be made through the Khan of Kalat to obtain the cession of Gwadur on reasonable terms—the main reason being to forestall foreign attempts to obtain a footing on the Baluch-Mekran Coast. 13. With reference to this despatch. Lord Lansdowne agreed in the* Secret E., April 1903, Nos. 128-129 conclusion arrived at by the Govern- ment of India that the sale or lease of Gwadur would not, strictly speaking, be in contravention of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, but he anticipated that the transaction would be strongly opposed by the Erench Government, who would have at least colourable grounds for their opposition. In these circumstances. His Majesty's Govern ment were of opinion ' that it would not be judicious to raise the question at the present time. ,, Lord Lansdowne, however, asked whether it might not be possible that the proposal should be of a more limited character, as, for instance, that the Customs Administration of Gwadur should be leased to the Khan of Kalat for a term of years in consideration of a fixed annual stipend. As to this suggestion. Lord George Hamilton feared that there might be inconvenience in making an arrangement which might furnish a precedent that could afterwards be used by other Powers for endeavouring to negotiate the lease of the customs at some port in the Persian Gulf, or in the Persian littoral; moreover the situation of Gwadur brings it so indisputably within the prepondering influence of the British Government, that the warning alreadv conveyed by the Indian Government to the Sultan of Maskat might be ex pected to prevent effectually any interference of the kind apprehended by us. The Government of India thought there would not be much gain in Secret e ., April 1903, nca. 128-129. acquiring a lease of the customs at Crwadur at present, but that we migut operate on these in an indirect way by trying to open a port * of our own, and attracting the trade to that port, which would of course reduce the income at Gwadur and make the Sultan disposed to part with it if we wanted it. The Secretary of State was told that the Government of India do not at present propose to move in the matter of leasing the Gwadur customs '. 14. Later, Major Cox reported that there was much chaos in the secret e , March 1905, Nos. 203 -209. customs administration at Gwadur. secret e., july 1904, nos. 147-152. Enquiries were made into the circum stances which led to the port coming into the Sultan's possession and as to the Khan of Kalat's title to the place. First, the Khan of Kalat and then the Jam ot Las Bela came forward to claim the rendition of Gwadur. On the claim of the latter, the Political Agent, Kalat, observed that the point was one, which could, if thought desirable, be taken up as between Kalat and Las # This has since been doue at .faam.20 Bela should Government ever press Baluchistan claims to the port and obtnin its rendition, but that as the Jam and his immediate ancestors had not raised this claim before, as Gwadur is situated in Kalati Mekran and not in Las iirla, and as Kalat has undoubtedly had recent relations with M.iskat with regard to the port, it hardly seemed that the Jam's pretensions need bo seriously considered. Colonel Yate concurred in this opinion. 15. It might be also argued that the British Government, as the suzerain Secret e ., September i;03, nofl. 111-118,notes. Kalat, might claim also suzerainty over Gwadur, if it once belonged to Kalat and if Kalat has still a reversionary title to the place. Against this view, it might be contended that Gwadur was presented to Ma skat when we had no political relations with Kalat, when the latter was a vassal of Kabul, and that therefore we cannot claim now a suzerainty, which did not exist at the time of the original grant. 16. As regards the Khan's formal claim no action was taken at the time. Lord Curzon wished to wait and see whether anything came out of the nego tiations with France about Maskat and the French treaty, case regarding the issue of French Hags to Maskat subjects which had been referred to the Hague tribunal. This decision was prompted by the fact that, in section IV of the French Secret e., may 1905, Nos. 170-287, page iyo. expose befoie the Hague tribunal, they referred to the fact that on various occasions, notably in January 1896, the British had landed troops at Gwadur, en route, to suppress internal disturbances in Baluchistan, without any previous notice to the Sultan oi Maskat, and ibis they represented to be an infringement of the declaration of 1862, guaranteeing the independence of Maskat. The Hague award was delivered in 1905, but has no reference to Gwadur. 17. In 1907 when the arms question came again to the fore, there was a Secet k., June 1907, Nos. 395 .407. pioposal to land tioops at Gwadur as a precautionary measure to support the Jkekran Levy Corps post, but as it was unlikely that the post would require support the proposal was negatived. 18. The Turks have not put forward any valid reasons to justify their Turkish claims to Oman and Gwadur claims to Oman and Gwadur except , ' that they claim the whole extent of the Vv ahabi dominions, and it is a fact that in 1831, 1815, and 1852, the Wahabis invaded Oman But in 1865-66 the vigorous British operations, undertaken to punish VVahabi outrages against British Indian subjects, saved the Maskat State trom almost total extinction. At the conclusion of these operations the aitclison's treaties, vol. xii, page 156. A\ ahiibi Amir declared that ' he will . . I10 t injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially the kingdom of Maskat, further than in receiving the Zukat that has been custom ary of od As regards Gwadur the Turks do not put forward any valid claims, but in the words of Sir G. Lowther ' it is not difficult to glean that they secret e., january 1911, noa. 56-64i. base their claims on the fact that in the - ; ii , T&gt;- IX T. 1 beginning of the 16th century a Turkish flotilla, under 1 iald) Pasha, annexed Gwadur •fi treaty with Maskat.— Our Commercial Treaty with Maskat, which came into force in March 1892, was terminable in March 1904. In August 19( 3, the subject of renewing the treaty was considered, but eventxiaily postponed pendnig settlement of the French flag question. In March 1911, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, reported that the Sultan desired certain modifications. He has been authorised to discuss the subiect with the Sultan and submit proposals for a new treaty, 20. Status of subjects of Maskat in Turkish territory.— # Vide Appeiidix ii. Among the conditions* which it is pro- it .. _ , P ose d to put to the Turkish Government in connection with the Baghdad Railway and other outstanding questions is one affecting Oman, viz., that subjects of the Sultan of Maskat who may be resident in iurkey shall enjoy British Consular protection.CHAPTER VIL Kuwait. In his report on the tribes, &amp;c., around the shores of the Persian Gulf, dcted 16th July 1863, Colonel Felly noted : — ' I he family of the present Shaikh have ruled at Kuwait some five genern- tions, or about 250 years; for, as these men live to the good age of 120 years, their generations are, of course, nearly double ours, or about 50 years each. • or Um Kasr ? which is now in dispute. Originally the Shaikh's progenitors dwelt yide page 47. i n a sma ii fort, called Mumgussur,* situated at the head of the Khore Abdullah, near Bunder Zobair; they were the pirates of the north of the Persian Gulf and lower channels of the Shat-el-Arab; but about 250 years ago the Basrah authorities attacked and expelled them. The original Shaikh then came down the Bubiyan creek with his followers, and debouched on the bay, at present known as that of Kuwait or Grane. Crossing the bay, he settled on its southern shore and there erected a Fort or Khote; hence the name Khote; or Kuwait. The term Grane is rather applied to the shore line of the entire bay, from its resemblance to the curve formed by two horns, Keor or Ghern, 'meaning horn. The settle ment was subsequently increased by the son of the founder, who erected the longer portion of the present walls, which, however, have since been again extended along the shore line as the increase of population from time to time demanded «»«*«*» 'The Shaikh said that his family had always been tributary to Turkey ; but I learnt from another source that, during some years, they had hoisted their own flag'. ««««*»« &lt;£ Be the suzerainty of the sublime Porte, however, of old or recent date, it is merely nominal; the Arabs acknowledge the Turks, as we do the 39 Articles, which all accept and none remember.' The boundaries of Kuwait as given in the Persian Gulf gazetteer are as follows:— *' The boundaries of the Kuwait principality are for the most part fluctuat ing and undefined; they are, at any given time, the limits of the tribes which then, either voluntarily or under compulsion, own allegiance to the Shaikh of Kuwait. The northern and southern frontiers in the neighbourhood of the sea may however be regarded as fixed; on those sides the question is not between the Shaikh and nomadic Arab tribes, but between the Shaikh and the Turkish Government. On the north the most advanced Turkish outposts upon the mainland are at Um Kasr and Safwan and the influence of the Shaikh of Kuwait is unquestioned up to the very walls of those places; we may accordingly consider the frontier on this side to be a line running from Khor- as -Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Um Kasr and Safwan to Jabal Sanam and thence to the Batin. On the south the Turks have no station nearer to Kuwait town than Musallamiyah island, nor does the Shaikh claim to exercise any real control over the lladaif tract; his boundary on this side may accordingly be considered to run westwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na'airiyah hill at the north-western corner of lladaif. It is a task of great difficulty to circumscribe the Shaikh's territories on the remaining sides with even approximate accuracy. The Shaikh Mubarak states (1904) that on the north-west his influence reaches to the Batin and somewhat beyond it, and that on the west the inhabitants of Summan, but not those of Dahanah, acknowledge him; and his assertion is to some extent borne out by known tacts in regard to the occupation of Hafar which Ibn Bashid, though at one time he seized it, was unable for long to retain. We may therefore consider that the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and that south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanaht as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route22 from Wabrah to Riyadh, These being the limits of the Kuwait Principality its length fiom north-north-west to south-south-east is about ^190, and its breadth from east-north-east to west-south-west about 160 miles.' 2. The position of Kuwait, as regards Turkey, has given rise to consider able discussion. In 1871, when Midhat Secret E., March 1202, Nob . 127-857. Pro. No.289. p aslla a successful attempt to reduce the Amir of Nejd to subjection, the Shaikh of Kuwait declared himself on the Turkish side, assumed the Turkish flag and was instrumental in inducing other Chiefs on the Arabian Littoral of the Persian Gulf to imitate his example. For this action he received the title of Pasha, and was granted considerable tracts of land in the neighbourhood of Fao. It would appear that about thht time a Turkish Custom House was established at Kuwait, but it must have been maintained for a short time only. 3. In 1876, Lieutenant-Colonel Prideaux, the Acting Resident at Bushire, enumerated as the principal Turkish Political a , May 1880, Nos. 18-53. ports on the Amb side of the Persian Gulf, Kuwait, Katif, and Ojair. In May 1879, the Government of India proposed ' that from Basrah to Ojair' (which is situated on the coast consider ably to the south of Kuwait) 'the authority of the Porte should be recognised as established on land, but that at sea the British Government should continue to exercise some concurrent Protectorate, pursuing pirates, if necessary, into Turkish waters and dealing with them wherever found, whether at sea or on stiore, within certain limits through the Resident in the Gulf.' This proposal was discussed between the Toreign Office and India Office and somewhat modified. 4. In January 1879, Lord Salisbury authorised His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, to propose to the Porte an arrangement by which British ships of war should be instructed to pursue their operations for the repression of piracy, as far as possible, outside the territorial waters of the Arabian mainland north of Odeid, but should also have authority to pursue and capture piratical vessels within the 3-mile limit on that part of the coast, wherever this might seem indispensible to the attainment of their object. This arrangement, w r hich would by implication have admitted Turkish terri torial sovereignty as far south as El Odeid (which is south of Ojair), was mentioned by His Majesty's Ambassador to the Turkish Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, and submitted by them to the Council of Ministers, but got no farther. 5. In August 1888, in consequence of a report that the Turkish Govern ment contemplated an attack on Oman, Sir W. White was instructed that Her Majesty's Government recognised Turkish jurisdiction on the coast as far as El Katif, and were anxious that it should be effectively exercised within those limits. Beyond that point Her Majesty's Government considered the Chiefs to be independent. (El Katif, though situated to the north of Ojair and Odeid, is still considerably south of Kuwait.) 6. Sir W. White, in reply, called attention to some recent practical asser tions of Turkish jurisdiction south of El Katif, and represented that it would be difficult to lay down that Katif was the hard and fast limit beyond which Turkish influence should not extend. He did not, therefore, make any state ment on this point in bis communication to the Porte protesting against any aggression on Oman. 7. In April 1893, Sir C. Ford stated officially to the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that Her Maiestv's secret e., july isys, nos. 124-231. Government admitted Turkish ereignty from Basrah to El Katif. 8. Two memoranda prepared in 1896-97, at the time when the present Shaikh Mubarak was making efforts to consolidate the position which he had acquired by the murder of his brothers, show considerable divergence between the views of British officials as to the actual status of Kuwait at that time. The first, by Mr. Stavrides, Legal Adviser to the Embassy at Constantinople, Secret E., November 1806, Nos. 181-187. Contains the following *. ' The country of Kuwait, although entirely independent, figures in the maps as being a part of the Ottoman Empire; the reigning family possesses23 Inrge landed property at Basrah, and especially at Fao, which belongs to them. That is the reason why the Shaikhs accept their investiture sanctioned by the Sultan, who grants them the rank of Kaimakam, with the title of Pasha, of which the Shaikh does not deign to make use'. A subsequent memorandum, by Captain Whyte, formerly His Majesty's Consul at Basrah, directly traverses this Secret E., Marcli 1897, Nos. 101-115 (Pro. No 107). . J view:— ' Mr. Stavrides describes Kuwait as being entirely independent, but it seems to me that the acceptance by the Shaikh of an appointment from the Sultan as Kaimakam precludes the possibility of any foreign Power recognising under the present conditions his independence.' In view of these conflicting statements, Sir P. Currie, British Ambas sador at Constantinople, enquired in July 1897, what was the view of Her Majesty's Government in regard to Turkish authority. The answer was as follows :— ' Her Majesty's Government have never admitted that Kuwait is under the protection of the Turkish Govern- Sccret E., November 1897i Nos. 83-141, \ t&gt; i. • ^4. i ^ merit. But since it is practically under Turkish influence, it is doubtful whether we could deny the latter.' The Government of India were at the time inclined to recognise Turkish authority in order to exact satisfaction from the Ottoman Government for the alleged connection of Kuwait with a piratical attempt on the Indian vessel ' Haripasa' during the previous year. This was, however, decided to be inexpedient, and a proposal for the appointment of a commission containing British, Turkish and Persian members was dropped. 9. By the autumn of 1897, the question of Kuwait had assumed more serious politicnl importance. Shaikh Mubarak, despairing of obtaining from Turkey a recognition of his independence, had preferred a definite request for British protection on the same terms as the Bahrain and Trucial Chiefs, alleging that Turkey intended to absorb Kuwait. The Secretary of State replied ' Her Majesty's Government are not dis posed to interfere more than necessarv Ibid.. Pro. No. 121. * • x e l if for maintenance or general peace ot Persian Gulf, or to bring Kuwait under protection.' But this declaration was afterwards modified. 10. The Resident at Bushire was of opinion that Kuwait was, in itself, desirable as a harbour; that its importance in relation to a possible railway from Port Said was considerable; while the extension of the pax Britannica to Kuwait, as to Bahrain and the Trucial Chiefs of the southern shore, would further the ends of civilisation by checking the growth of piracy and the slave trade. The Shaikh, though he had procured his title by a double murder, appeared to British officers in other respects a popular and enlightened ruler. It was urged (1) that the responsibility of protection would be amply repaid; (2) that the Shaikh's position was precarious. If our help were refused, he would make terms with Turkey or seek protection elsewhere, in either case changing the status quo to our disadvantage. Sir N. O'Conor was consulted, but before his reply was received, on the v 21th December 1898, the Secretary of Secret E.) March 1899. No.. 581-691. il)fol . mcd tlle GoTernment of India to the effect that if they were of opinion that the Protectorate could be undertaken without difficulty, or any inconvenient extension of the duty of police already exercised in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office would approve of such a step* and would be prepared to acquiesce in the establishment of such Protectorate, which w r ould be supported diplomatically in case the Porte should raise counter-claims. Sir N. O'Conor's observations were shortly afterwards received. While supporting generally the idea of a British Protectorate, he pointed out that caution was necessary. A Minute existed recording a conversation, in 1889, between Sir A. Sandison, Oriental Secretary to Her Majesty 's Embassy, Con stantinople, and the Grand Vizier, which implied a recognition of Turkish sovereignty as far as El Katif, and His Excellency was of opinion that any forma ^assertion of British Protectorate would produce very serious diplomatic24] complications. He thought, however, that ' acts of piracy and of regular traffic in slaves would justify the interference of the Indian Government^ and alfoid ground for coming to a direct and special arrangement with the Shaikh, which need not necessarily be made public,' and such acts were of frequent occurrence. 11. At this stage (December 1898) more decisive action was precipitated by the report of a Russian Railway Concession (Count Kapnist Concession) from Tripoli in Syria to Kuwait. It was then proposed to enter into a separate engagement which was to take the form of a promise by the shaikh not to alienate any portion of his territory to any foreign Power, and was to be considered distinct from the question of an ultimate British Protectorate. The Imperial Government merely availed themselves of the superior facilities for negotiation possessed by the Government of India, while in no way pledging the latter to accept any liability under any circumstances that might arise in the future. The proposi tion for the establishment of a Protectorate was tacitly dropped, though the Government of India were of opinion at the time that the proposed negotiations would have a Protectorate as their final result. On the 23rd January 1899, the Shaikh signed an Agreement pledging Secret e., Mnrch 1899, Nos. 581-691. himself not only to cede no territory i. TJ . T i » ut to rece ^ ve no foreign Representative without British sanction. In return for this, he was promised the good offices u ^ er Majesty's Government, and a payment was made of lis 15,000 f^om the Bushire Treasury, half of which was recovered from Her Majesty's Gov ernment. The Government of India were also authorised to instruct British naval officers to prevent by force any attempt on the part of the Turks to attack Kuwait. The conclusion of the Agreement, however, involved a serious question regarding the property of the Shaikh in Turkish territory. Aliens are bv Turkxsh law precluded from holding landed property, and it was feared that it the Shaikh were suspected of having agreed to a British Protectorate, the lurkish autliomies would attempt to dispossess Mul)arak of lus pronerty near lao. The hope was therefore, held out that the British Government would do \uiat they could to protect him and his brothers in the matter. 12. Lifficulties with Turkey. —A local Quarantine Board on several occasions attempted to impose illegal and vexatious restrictions on British vessels in the Gulf, but its protests were disregarded when clearly contrary to tlie Venice Con vent ton, and Colonel Meade understood that - the Quarantine arrangements nnclei the Sanitary Board at Constantinople in no way implied that the Turks Lave any sort ol jurisdiction or rights at Kuwait.' In September 1899 it was reported* that a Turkish Harbour master had • Secret e., February 1900, noar 77.82. been appointed at Kuwait. This was .1 r. , ,. . .j . . „ considered a more serious matter, and, for • ! con f cl ^ s } on tlle Agreement, it was proposed to intimate affairs interest taken by the British Government in the Shaikh's After consultation with the India Office, Sir N. O'Conor was informed by telegraph that his was not a matter we could recognise as depending on the a aawts MS^ Govtrnmelt.''^ 1811 0UStC,mS Wlth0Ut I,reVioUS a S rcement Wlth Her A gunboat was ordered to Kuwait, hnt, at the suggestion of Sir N O'Conor, .t was afterwards directed merely to call at Kuwait and tooome awav It was easy, he thought, to watch Turkish action and to counteract it without any hostile demonstration. The Government was inclined to be friendly and • 0 dl , s ^ a,m ^ponsibility for the appointment, which had heen made by the Naval Commandant at Basrah, and not by the central authority. Admiral Douglas had reported in February that in ease of attack the Navy token UIldeitake the deieQct ot Kuwait, and no further measures were23 Hamdi* Pasha, Vali of Basrah, was soon afterwards a^ain dismissed. The • Secret E.. June 1890, No., 94-119. P ause ° f his , ff 1 ' is apparent nor important, but the eiietjt was to replace a prominent official with a definite anti-English policy by a rival who, in order to maintain bis position, was anxious for the moment to avoid controversial matters, and to limit the interference of his Government in the Shaikh's affairs. But difficulties were already arising in a fresh direction. 13. German railway scheme.—In 1899, it became apparent to the promoters of the German railway from Konia to Baghdad that an outlet upon the sea was vitally necessary to their scheme. They proposed, therefore, to acquire Kathama Bay at the western end of Kuwait harbour, and Sir N. + « f ■p t iqaa O'Conor reportedf that the Germans t Secret E., January 1900, I^oi. 144-145. ii ■ n , , , .. would, in all probability, negotiate direct ly with the Sultan without regard to the Shaikh of Kuwait, w r ho would not be asked to grant a concession of land. Lieutenant-Colonel Meade feared that the Turks and Germans combined would take some action on the strength of which Turkish authority over Kuwait might afterwards be claimed to exist. The impression prevailed that it was intended to take advantage of the entanglement of Great Britain in South Africa to push the matter to a conclu sion in conjunction with Turkey. In the opinion of Captain Denison of the ' Melpomene' then in the Guif, 'the presence of the German Consul-General for Constantinople pointed to greater things than a simple railway terminus.' On the receipt of information of the arrival (January 1900) of the railway commission at Basrah, the Viceroy proposed to inform Germany of our relations t secret e , october loco, nos. 175-281. (pro with Kuwait, but Lord Salisbury J con- No - 181 ) sidered the moment inopportune and preferred waiting till Germany showed an immediate intention of addressing Turkey, when we could either renew our previous warning given to the Porte or come to terms with Germany as to the terminus of the railway. Colonel Meade's views were unchanged : 'our own preponderating influ ence at the place must be maintained to the exclusion of any other'. The presence of Turkish, Russian or German officials was equally injurious to our interests. Sir N. OTonor pointed out that the enterprise was private and inter national rather than political. A friendly warning, he thought, to the pro moters of the scheme would obviate any official notification of our relations with the Shaikh, a course of action likely to induce an international scramble in which Britain would at the moment be heavily handicapped. The view of Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople received con firmation some months later from Berlin. Count Bulow informed Sir F. Lascelles that the German Consul-General had been granted leave to accompany the Mission, not in his official capacity, but on account of his ' local knowledge '. / In April 1900, some more definite steps were taken towards an understanding with Germany. Sir N. O'Conor, who had pointed out in January that immediate action was inexpedient in view of the situation in South Africa, in April explained to the German Ambassador at Constantinople the full sense of our agreement with the Shaikh for non-cession of territory. Her Majesty's Government, he said, had an agreement with the Shaikh of Kuwait, which, although not opposed to the status quo, yet prevented the Shaikh from making any concession of territory to another Power without the consent of Her Majesty's Government. Baron von Marschall said that he supposed this would not prevent the construction of a railway, and that he was quite alive to the disadvantages of provoking any feeling in England which w r ould have the effect of preventing British capital from taking part in the construction of the line. ' I was anxious', Sir N. O'Conor proceeds, ' that no doubt should remain in his mind as to the position in which the Shaikh of Kuwait stood towards Her Majesty's Government, and to make it quite clear that the Shaikh was not at liberty to cede or otherwise alienate to the railway company either the26 harbour of Kathama or any otlier part of his territory without the consent of Her Majesty's Government * * * . In the course of conversation, he said that Kuwait was a part of the Turkish Empire, to which I promptly replied that we did not want to disturb the status quo, but that the Shaikh was not a free agent * * * /' At the same time Sir N. O'Conor informed Tewfik Pasha that— 'Her Majesty's Government did not desire to interfere with the status quo or with the Sultan's authority in Secret E, October 1900, Nos. 175-281. ^ ^ in ^ iew of great interests in the Persian Gulf, they could not view with indifference any action which would alter the existing condition of affairs or give another Power special rights or privileges over territory belonging to the Shaikh, with whom Her Majesty's Government had certain agreements'. Meanwhile, however, it was reported that the German Railway Company had taken the matter into their own hands, and were already making arrangements for the construction of a pier. Sir N. O'Conor suggested the appointment of a British Secret Agent. The India Office, when consulted, replied that ' until the question of policy was determined, the presence of a secret Agent would be a mere waste of money At this juncture the Admiralty forwarded a report stating that two German steamers were expected to go to Kuwait, and enquired what would be the policy of Her Majesty's Government in the event of a collision between Germans and Arabs. The reply was that Lord Salisbury scarcely thought that any definite instructions were necessary until some confirmation was received of the reported intention of German ships to visit Kuwait, or until there was some indication of the methods of action they intended to pursue. If the construction of a piev were attempted by private persons without a mandate from some recog nised authority, the Shaikh would be within his rights in opposing such an attempt and, in this event, if any action was to be taken by Her Majesty's ships, it should be in support of the Shaikh's authority '. The India Office concurred, while pointing out that the eventuality con templated (in which alone action was to be taken) would in all probability never occur. 14. After the summer of 1900, various incidents began to point to a renewal of Turkish interest in Kuwait. In August the first of several attempts was made to induce the Shaikh to visit Bnsrah, and Mubarak found some difficulty in avoiding direct communi cation with the Turkish authorities. In October the Order of the Tmtiaz was conferred upon him as 44 Kaimakam' of Kuwait, and the ' Ikdam' of the 10th November announced that at Mubarak's request a mosque erected by him was to be called after the name of the Sultan, the Shaikh again being given the full title of Mubarak- es-Sabah Pasha, Kaimakam of Kuwait. About this time an opportunity for more effective intervention, of which the Turkish Government were not slow to avail themselves, was afforded by the growing dissension between Mubarak and the neighbouring ruler of Nejd. The affair, which on its merits was little more than an inter-tribal squabble, led to political results of such importance that it is necessary io describe in some detail the course of the struggle. The quarrel arose from a raid by Shaikh Abdur Rahman-bin-Paisal upon Secret E., Febpuarv IflOl, Nos. 22-107. ^ temtOrV With the COunivaDce and assistance or Mubarak, the move ments being supported on the north by Sadun I'asha, a Turkish subject. Chief of the Montefik Bedouins. At the first news of disturbances, it was at once proposed to send Colonel Kemball to Kuwait ' to counsel Mubarak to avoid giving the Turks an excuse for interference,' and as the Agreement of 1899 had promised the good offices27 of Her Majesty's Government, the Eesident was also to be instructed ' to endeavour to warn the Amir that no attack on Kuwait would be permitted. Preliminary measures were to be taken to protect the Shaikh, but no force was to be landed without reference to the home authorities. Shortly afterwards, however, reports were received that the crisis was over, and at Colonel Kemball's own request his visit was postponed. It appeared that Mubarak was able to hold his own, and the presence of a ship of war would give him undue encouragement. A despatch from the Consul at Basrah summed up the situation. A conflict had been averted, though at the er st of a considerable increase of Turkish prestige. The Vali, Mohsin Pasha, having prevailed upon both sides to keep the peace, had induced Mubarak to accompany him to Basrah, there to make solemn professions of allegiance to the Sultan, and to promise to cease 'coquetting with foreign Powers.' The result seemed to an independent observer likely to 4&lt; prove considerable blow to any pretensions of Mubarak to being an independent Shaikh A declaration of some importance was made about this time with regard to the status of Kuwait. An Arab native of Kuwait, concerned in a case of smuggling arms, had been claimed as a Turkish subject. The Resident was informed by the Foreign Office, in answer to his enquiry whether he should contest the claim, that, ' although Her Majesty's Government had promised their good offices to the Shaikh of Kuwait, the district has never been formally placed under British protection. Her Majesty's Government cannot, therefore, claim natives of Kuwait as British-protected persons 15. Late in December, Mubarak was reported to be making fresh prepara tions for an attack on Nejd, and the second phase of the quarrel began. In February 1901, Sir N. O'Conor expressed his opinion on the general situation. An outbreak of hostilities, His Excellency observed, would scarcely fail to bring the Turks again into the field. 'Her Majesty'? Government may thus be placed in a difficult position, and be forced either to raise an unpleasant question with the Ottoman Govern ment, or to assert effective control over Kuwait, or else sacrifice the privileged position acquired by the Convention of January 1899. It is hardly to be expected that the Shaikh of Kuwait will respect an agreement from which he derives no security and little material advantage'. His Excellency was strongly averse to doing anything which would 'encourage the Sultan's anxiety in regard to Biitish policy in the Persian Gulf,' and he suggested that the Amir of Nejd should be approached through his Basrah Agent, while the Porte might be informed that Colonel Kemball would use every effort to restrain the Shaikh. On the 28th February 1901, the Viceroy telegraphed that the Resident's ^ v, advice to the Shaikh to keep quiet had Pro. No. 66 in Secret E„ March 190), Nos. .68. ^ tendered to Mubarak (though, as afterwards appeared not personally but through the news-agent) and refused. The proposed visit, therefore, did not seem likely to have any result, while 'a second failure might even be embarrassing'. As in the previous November, hostilities were commenced without any formal remonstrance on the part of the British authorities. On the 29th March, the complete defeat of the Kuwait forces was reported. secret e., June 1901, nos. 118-230. and it was rumoured that the Shaikh Pro. Kob . 129, 129,137,148. | )a( ^ been killed in action. If the report was true, it was obvious that Mubarak's death would seriously endanger the Agreement of 1899, and a ship of war was placed under orders to proceed to Kuwait with Colonel Kemball to ascertain the position. Colonel Kemball visited Kuwait (17th April). He found the Shaikh alive, but was satisfied that he had been severely defeated. Nothing was said to the Amir of Nejd. Mohsin Pasha had remained comparatively inactive since his diplomatic success of November, but the defeat of Mubarak now brought on Turkish interference in a more acute form. A Turkish Field-Marshal left Baghdad28 for Basrah on the 19th April, followed on the next day by Turkish troops. It was generally believed that the Ottoman Government intended to make use of force with a view to the deposition of Mubarak. A Br^ish crunboat was ordered to Kuwait, and Sir N. O'Conor was definitely authorised, in the event of hostilitifs being resumed, to warn the Porte ' to refrain from any action against the Shaikh in view of our arrange ment with him.' But the astute policy of Mohsin Pasha again prevented matters from coming to a head. The Turkish Eield-Marshal stopped short of Kuwait, and the Vali himself, with a small escort, paid a friendly visit to the Shaikh. He was unable to enforce proposals for the establishment of a Turkish garrison, but Mubarak accompanied him to Eao, renewed his protestations to the Sultan, and returned to Kuwait after a second act of apparently spontaneous loyalty. On the 28th May, the Amir of Nejd appealed for British protection, but, after consultation with the Government of India, the India Office expressed the opinion, in which the Eoreign Office concurred, that it was not advisable to sicret e ., October 1901, Nos. 184-315 (Ito . ' incur the difficulties and embarrassments Ko - 196, • which must ensue from the declaration of a Protectorate over either the territories of the Chiefs of Kuwait or Nejd The Viceroy, however, pointed out that some answer must be given to the Chiefs, and Colonel Kemball again visited Kuwait with general instructions to find some modus vivendi between the Shaikh and Amir, while maintaining our hold upon the Shaikh. Early in August he saw Mubarak, who suggested the Shaikh of Moham- merah as intermediary, and Mr. Wratislaw, His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, was subsequently authorised to assist communication between the latter and the Agent of the Amir. 16. ^ Renewed rumours of Turkish concentration now again raised the larger diplomatic question. In July 1901, Sir F. Lascelles had had a conversation with Dr. Rosen, of the German Foreign Office, upon the prospects of the Anatolian Railway and the general situation. An expression used by His Excellency describing the Shaikh as ' techni cally a subject of the Sultan, but enjoying a considerable amount of independ ence,' which on a previous occasion had passed without comment, now drew from the German Representative an assertion that the Shaikh was 'merelv a subject of the Sultan.' It w as, therefore, pointed out to Sir F. Lascelles that the German Govern ment might take advantage of his language to argue that the Sultan could dispose of the territory of the Shaikh. The view that the Shaikh was simply a subject of the Sultan was one that His Majesty's Government were totally unable to accept, and His Excellency was instructed to use language on the lines already used by Sir N. O'Conor in April 1900. Sir N. O'Conor was at the same time (August 1901) authorised to state if occasion arose, that if Kuwait were threatened, His Majesty's Government would use force to prevent attack. Important communications (August-September 1901) followed at London and Constantinople. Considerable pressure was being exercised on the Ottoman Government Secret E., October 1901, .Nos. 184-315. (Pro. Kos. 295 by the German and Russian Emhn&lt;!«jific 29(!,2y&lt;J) . and though a proposal of the Vali of Basrah to use force against the Shaikh had been rejected by the Council of Ministers, Tewfik Pasha informed Sir N. O'Conor that Kuwait was regarded as an integral part of the Ottoman Empire. A warning given by the Commander of thePerseus ' to the Captain of a Turkish corvette off Kuwait that no troops would be permitted to land w largely magnified in transmission and occasioned further protests. ^29 Tewfik Pasha enquired on the 29th August whether His Majesty's Govern ment intended to establish a protectorate, and on the same day the German i? at uiono m iot tm ,, irq ^ Embassy in London received a pressing •Jsrcret E , Mftrch 100^, N ob . 127-357 (Pro. No. 169). . 1 , 1 0 instruction to state that a British Protec torate would be contrary* to the treaty of Berlin, and that, in view of her interest in Kuwait as the future terminus of the Anatolian Railway, Germany would be compelled to regard such a proceeding as an unfriendly act. The reply in each case was that His Majesty's Government had no such intention, Sir N. O'Conor adding the reservation, ' provided that Turkey did not force our hands by interfering with the Shaikh On the 3rd September 1901, Count Metternich called at the London j-i .j D v Foreign Office to sav 'that, if by iota., Pro. No 135. p p r-r. ^ threats or force His Majesty s Govern ment prevented the Sultan from landing troops at Kuwait, they were refusing to recognise the Sultan's authority with which they had stated (in a memo randum communicated by the late King to the German Emperor) that they did not desire to interfere in those parts, and that the German Government con sidered that Kuwait formed unquestionably part of the territories belonging to the Sultan Sir T. Sanderson promised to report his observations to Lord Lansdowne, and said he could at once state that His Majesty's Government had no desire to disturb the status quo. Next dny, telegrams were communicated by the Turkish Ambassador protesting against the reported intention to declare a British Protectorate, and describing the Convention of 181)9 as without validity, but the Sultan had meanwhile been advised by the German Government to be satisfied with the assurances given to Count Metternich, and to ask for their repetition. On the 6th September, Sir N. O'Conor was sent for by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The assurances given by His Excellency on this occasion were considered by the Ottoman Government ' of a nature to terminate the present contro versy ' and Anthopoulo Pasha was instructed to ask for their confirmation. ri.-j o xt The following note was accordingly Pro. No. 162. , , -i • 0,7 addressed to him :— ' The Marquess of Lansdowne to Anthopoulo Pasha. 'Foreign Office, 11th September 1901. ' Your Excellency, ' I have taken note with satisfaction of the telegram from the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, communicated by you on the 9th instant, in which His Excellency states that the Turkish Government will not send troops to Kuwait, and will maintain the status quo there, on condition that His Majesty's Government will abstain from occupying that place or establishing a British Protectorate there. ' I have pleasure in confirming the assurance which has been given to His Excellency by His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that, provided tlie Turkish Government abstain from sending troops to Kuwait and respect the status quo tiiere, His Majesty's Government will not occupy that place or establish a British Protectorate over it. ' I am, &amp;c., Lansdowne,' In a Secret telegram,f dated the 7th September 1901, Lord Lansdowme, x J n , while pointing out that 'the situation f /otrf., Pro. 156, . 1 0 p i i n • requires very carerul handling, as our arrangement with the Shaikh is not very precise, and it was entered into with out the knowledge or concurrence of the Porte, ' instructed Sir N. O'Cunor that ' we cannot recede from our position and if Porte should insist on30 raisincy qnestion of their rights, we may have to convert into something much more precise the present indefinite understaudins: with the Shaikh.' In view, however, of the assurances recorded in the note quoted above. His Majesty's Ambassador did not find occasion to communicate the^e instruc tions, and the controversy with the Porte rested for the moment on the basis of a mutual maintenance of the status quo. The Turkish Ambassador expressed himself well satisfied with the present state of affairs and on the s ime day Sir N. O'Conor was assured by the Minister for Foreign Affairs ' most positively that the Imperial Government had no intention whatsoever of occupying or attacking Kuwait*'. There was an understanding that the two Governments were to co-operate in maintainins: the peace, Turkey endeavouring to restrain the Amir, while His Majesty's Government would do what they could to discnurasre the Shnikh from aggressive action. Mubarak was told that the good offices of His Majesty's Government would be extended to him only if he followed their advice. On the 9th September 1901, a further Secret E., March 1902, Nos. 127-357 (Pro. No. 167). ... i , r^iinf v communication was made to Oount Metternich. A Memorandum upon various subjects, including Kuwait, drawn up by Lord Lansdowne for the late King's personal use, and handed by 11 is Majesty to the German Emperor at their recent meeting, had elicited a formal reply from the German Governrnenr, which Count Metternich had left at the London Foreign Office on the 3rd. It was explained to him that the Memorandum, which had been hastily prepared, was a purely informal and unollicial document. The statement referred to by Coun 4- . Metternich on the 3rd was a repetition of Sir N. 0' Conor's language in 19 (0, which might be more correctly described as having stated that His Majesty's Government have no desire to interfere with the Sultan's authority as ?.t exists in those parts. There could be no doubt that this authority was of a very limited descrip tion. The Shaikh belonged to a class of Native Cuiefs enjoying a large measure of practical independence, with whom His Majesty's Government found it necessary to have direct relations for the sake of the maintenance of tranquillity and the protection of British trade. Therefore, although ready to maintain the status quo, His Majesty's Gov ernment had been unable to acquiesce in attempts recently made by Turkey to impose on the Shaikh conditions from which he had hitherto been free. They had considered it a matter for direct and friendly discussion with the Porte, who now regarded the incident as closed, and Count Metternich was informed of the assurances exchanged. Lord Lansdowne, on his return to London, said to Count Metternich that it was necessary to bear in mind that, where minor Eastern States were concerned, it was not unusual to find that they owed a divided allegiance to more than one Power. The German Memorandum stated that Kuwait had an importance for Germany merely as the proposed terminus of the Baghdad Railway, and gave an undertaking that the Manager of the Railway Company would be instructed to come to an understanding with the British Government when the time for purchasing land for a railway terminus and a landing-place at Kuwait should arrive. Count Metternich confirmed this assurance in conversation with Lord Lansdowne, adding that the railway might be made five years or fifty years hence, or not at all, but that, when it was made, it was important for Germany to find a peaceful condition of things in that part of the Gulf. 17. But to return from this unavoiaable digression in which Turkey as well as Germany figure in Kuwait politics, to the question of further inter ference by Turkey alone in Kuwait affairs. 18. Turkish activity at Kuwait. Pronouncements by flis Majesty's Government.— In November 1901, the of Basrah visited secret e., M^rch 1902, Nos. 127-357 (Pro. No. 2i3j. ^ uvva it and handed to Mubarak a tele gram purporting to have emanated from Constantinople and expressing disapproval by the {Sultan of the Shaikh 's31 assertion of independence, and threatening him with punishment if the Shaikh did not make his submission to the Sultan. This matter was brought to the notice of the Porte, who disavowed both the telegram and the action of the Nakih. Soon after this the yakib again appeared at Kuwait with a message from the Sultan deshing Shaikh Mubarak either to come to Constantinople or reside elsewhere, away from Kuwait, on a Turkish pension. Representations were a^ain made, and both the Sultan and the Porte disavowed all knowledge of the NakiVs mission, and explained that rhe Turkish Government had no intention to send troops to Kuwait or disturb the status quo. Having failed in their attempts to overawe or cajole the Shaikh, the Turks took rather an effective measure to force his hands. They prohibited the export of provisions to Kuwait from Turkish territory and thus tried to starve the town. Representations were made, and the Turks disavowed the order in question and directed it to be rescinded. Another move was made by the Basrah authorities They made the nephews of the Shaikh institute a suit Secret E., October 1902, N0 S . 11-41. against b i m i n connection with the family estates at Fao. This case assumed such proportions that an attempt was made to attack Kuwait by Yusuf-al-Ibrahim, who had espoused the cause of the two nephews in connection with the murder ot their father. The Vali of Basrah was evidently in sympathy with Yusuf. Representntions were made and the Porte ordered the Vali to expel Yusul from Basrah and also the two delinquent nephews of Shaikh Mubarak. The dispute between the Shaikh and his nephews as regards the property was compromised. In December 1901, the Political Resident was ordered to communicate to Pro. nos. 226 and 230in Secret e ., March 1902, the Shaikh a message iecei^i,d Irom the Nos. 127 -357. Secretary of State in w hich it was stated that His Majesty's Government are prepared to support Shaikh and will not tolerate an attack by Turkish troops or ships on Kuwait. Shaikh should not leave Kuwait, and should continue to observe his engagements with us.' 19. The opening of the year 1902 witnessed further encroachments and an effort bv Turkey 'to squeeze out' Kuwait, Secret e, july 1902, No*. 307-509. Eaiiv in that year the Turks established posts on the borderland between the undefined Turkish and Kuwait territories at the west corner of the head of the Persian Gulf. In February, the Com mander of the ' Sphinx' went up the Khor Abdulla to enquire into the matter. He reported that in addition to a position which they had occupied at L m Kasr (claimed by Kuwait) the Turks had for the first time about a fortnight previously stationed a force of some 20 men on Bubiyan island which the Shaikh of Kuwait also claims. The matter was brought to the notice of the Secretary of {State through the Government of India, the importance of the positions seized being pointed out, and it w as suggested that the Turks be told to quit Bubiyan imme diately even if no protest were offered against the occupation of L m Kasr. The question was considered in London. The * Pro ' No ' 4( '' tbtd ' following* memorandum, dated 21st March, by the Marquis of Lansdowne shows the trend of policy at the time:— «' The situation at Kuwait is becoming more and more embarrassing and the time has come for looking it in the face. We have saddled ourselves with an impossible client in the form of the Shaikh. He is apparently an untrustworthy savage. No one knows where his possessions begin and end, and our obligations towards him are as ill-detined as the boundaries of his principality. ' We have distinctly announced that he does not enjoy British ' protec tion ;' on the other hand, we once made him a present of 1,000/., and promised him our ' good offices,' whatever that may mean. When we made this pro mise we were, 1 feel no doubt, thinking of Kuwait proper, if there is such a thing, and not of Bubiyan or other outskirts, over w hich the Shaikh has rights of one sort or another We have up to the present sheltered ourselv( s not unsuccessfully, during our discussion with the Turks on the one side and foreign Governments on the other, behind the plausible announcement that we desired to maintain the status quo in regard to Kuwait. But I doubtwhether anyone really knows what the status quo is. We have, at any rnte in my opinion, no ri^ht to tell th^ Turks that they may not move troops for the purpose of putting down a rebellion in the Nejd region, or that they must not look for a suitable terminus of the Baghdad Railway for fear of disturbing the status quo. ' If matters nre left as they are, we shall involve ourselves in a very un satisfactory dispute. And we shall, as Admiral Bosanquet has lately pointed out, be obliged to keep the squadron on sentry go at the head of the Gulf in order to maintain the peace. ' We mi^ht, it seems to me, explain (1) to the Porte, (2) to the Shaikh, and (3) to the foreign Powers immediately interested the objects of our policy. I should be inclined to say that our engagements to Kuwait do not extend beyond the district adjoining or close to the bay of the name, and to endeavour to obtain the adhesion of the Porte and of the Shaikh to an approximate definition of that district. It may be necessary to reconcile the Shaikh by the payment of another 1,00(H., or of an even larger sum. ' I would make it clear to the Turks that we do not want to stand in the way of an arrangement under which the terminus of the line might be placed at some spot other than Kuwait to their advantage if they can make anything out of it. ' As to the foreign Powers, I have already explained to most of them that we are not going to oppose the Railway project, provided British Capital receives a share at least equal to that of any other Power in respect of con struction, management, and orders for materials, and I have added that while we do not grudge a debouche for international commerce in the Gulf, and have no wish to make it into a British lake, we shall resist to the utmost all attempts by other Powers to obtain a foothold on its shores for naval or military purposes. ' This, I take it, is the ' bed rock ' of our policy in the Gulf, and we shall pursue that policy, not in virtue of ambiguous understandings with local Chiefs, but as the predominant Power in Southern Persia and in the Gulf: the Power whose c« mmercial interests in those jregions far exceed those of other Powers, the Power to whose efforts in the past it is due that the waters of the Gulf are open to the trade of the world, and whose duty it will be in the future to protect the new trade route. If it is understood that we have to be reckoned with, whoever builds the railway, and wherever it finds a terminus, because we are that Power, we can regard with indifference the local intrigues of any number of Shaikhs and Amirs.' In consequence. Sir N. O'Conor was instructed by telegraph on the 24th March (repeated 26ih March to Government of India) as follows:— Instructions have been sent to O'Conor to address Porte in following sense regarding Kuwait:— Begins. His Majesty's Government have acknow ledged Kuwait to be part of the Ottoman dominions, and do not desire to encourage Shaikh to throw off allegiance to the Sultan. They are, however, bound to support him against encroachment, but are not disposed to raise irritating discussion about movements of Turkish troops to places to which Shaikh's title would be difficult to prove. They do not wish to obstruct pro longation of Haghdad Railway to Gulf, whether at Kuwait or elsewhere; but their assistance is conditional upon British capital receiving at least equal shares with any other Powers in respect of construction, materials and manage ment. This condition is based upon the necessity for British financial co-opera tion and on predominant British interests in commerce of Gulf, which has been opened in the past, and must in future be safeguarded, by British efforts. British co-operation will be necessary to secure good-will of Kuwait Shaikh and to restrain piracy at. whatever point the terminus may be placed.— JHnds.' In making his representations to the Porte, iSir N. O'Conor modified his instructions considerably and did not refer to Kuwait as being within the Sultan's dominions, and reported later in April that he had repeated his observation to the Porte that the occupation by the Turks of Um Kasr33 and Bnbiyan could not be regarded as prejudicing the Shaikh's rights and authority over them. Here the question of these places, which will be considered* separately, may be left to resume the connection • see page 4. with the Secretary of State's telegram of the 2Gth March to which the Viceroy replied on the 29th as follows :— 'We do not understand policy of His Majesty's Government. Does _ „ _ acknowledgment of Kuwait as part of SocretE., July 1902, Nos. 307-509 Pro. o. 3 6). Ottoman dominions involve abandon ment of position hitherto taken up, and defined in Lord Lansdowne's letter to Sir F. Lascelles of 12th September 1901, as one in large measure of practical independence, and by O'Conor in his letter to Lord Lansdowneof 10th September 1901 ? Purther, when intention is declared of supporting Shaikh against encroachment what encroachment and where is it meant ? Are we to resist the Turkish advance on Kuwait side of Khor Subeih ? These questions may assume practical shape at any moment, and we shall be grateful for more explicit instructions, since statm quo is in danger of being whittled out of existence ' On the 8th April 1902, the Secretary of State explained the instructions sent to Sir N. O'Conor as follows :— ' Foreign Office points out that no new departure was indicated by instructions to O'Oonor of 24th March. What was contemplated was merely to preface statement of the view of His Majesty's Government by admitting, not by any means for the first time, that Kuwait is within Turkish Empire, subject to all qualifications upon which His Majesty's Government have throughout insisted as to unsubstantial character of the Sultan's authority and reality of large measure of independence always claimed for Shaikh. As a matter of fact, O'Conor, in subsequent interview with Grand Vizier and Foreign Minister, did not refer to status quo of Kuwait, but His Majesty's Government, while adhering to position taken up in despatch to Lascelles of 12th September 1901, cannot, in view of admission above referred to support O'Conor's statement in despatch of 10th September 1901 in which lie rejected Sultan's suzerainty. They desire to maintain status quo at Kuwait and to preserve Shaikh's privileges and territories. These, however, are insuffi ciently defined, specially territories, and His Majesty's Government desire, firstly, to avoid entanglement in doubtful disputes, and, secondly, to have it understood that their rights and policy in Persian Gulf do not depend upon their shadowy connection with Kuwait, but upon other and broader considera tions. and that, in order to establisii claim to have voice in such questions as that of railway terminus, it is not necessary to prove that proposed location is within Kuwait territory.' * These constant measures taken by the Turkish authorities to harass the Shaikh, appear to have shaken his Secret e., July 1902, Nos. 3o7-5uy. spirits and driven him to try to reconcile himself with Turkey by offering bribes to the Vali of Basrah, which apparently were refused, but nothing important resulted. In September 1902, the Secretary of State requested that the Shaikh should be warned against encouraging Jn. No, 164 iQ Secrrt K., P.br-.rj 1903, No., 1 62. ^ likely to i nvolve |,i m in Fro.

Fro No. 1)9 in Secret E., Kebruary 1904, Nos, 33-127 lllis W aS^ done, and the shaikh (eud of paragraph 12 of despatch). promised implicit compliance. In October ]902, His Majesty's Government authorised the Government Pro. Nos. 181, 188 and 190 in Secret E. f February of India to inloim the Shaikh that, it 1903, Nos. 162-307. he complied with the injunctions conveyed to him in December 1901, they ,would charge themselves with the34 defence of the Kuwait district, provided that it was clearly defined as the district adjoining or close to the Bay of Kuwait. 20. In January 1904, the Shaikh was advised not to involve himself with Pro.

In 1910, a similar warning was conveyed to him when he contemplated operations in combination with Bin Saud against the Montefik and Dhafir trihes, and the Shaikh's reply amounts practicnlly to an undertaking that he will do nothing to involve himself in conflict with the Turks or Nejd. In December 1904, when the question of the temporary withdrawal Pro. no, 1366 in Secret e., February 1905, nos. of our Agent was under consideration, 1310-1373. Majesty's Government declared ' that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia and that nothing should be said or done to connect them, even indirectly, with warfare * * • in the interior They also ordered that the previous warnings given to the Shaikh against entanglements in the interior should be repeated, and indicated that it was not intended to make the temporary withdrawal of oar Agent a concession to Turkey in consideration of a reciprocal action, but that they reserved absolutely the right to send the Agent to Kuwait at their discretion from time to time.

In September 1907, the Government of India referred to the Secretary Pro No. 487 in Secret e., September 1907, ^f State regarding the action of the Nos. 426-486. Shaikh of Kuwait in taking part in an expedition organised by the Shaikh of Mohammerah against his rebellious tribesmen. In reviewing the situation, reference was made to the Agreement of 1899 and to the warnings conveyed to the Shaikh to abstain from aggression, and it T\as held that it should be considered that the settled policy of the British Gov ernment was to have in their hands the external relations of Kuwait. It was advocated that this principle of policy should be embodied in a formal agree ment, as the Shaikh appeared anxious to repeat his pledges as to the exclusion of all foreign interest in Kuwait other than British, and it was recommended that to fulfil this purpose advantage should b 'e taken of the negotiations then in progress for the acquisition of the Kuwait foreshore. Should His Majesty's Government not approve the proposal it was submitted, as an alternative, ' that the Shaikh should be informed that the Government of India have taken strong exception to the share taken by him ' in the incident reported, ^and that unless he seeks, and is guided by our advice in such matters we should not be able to exercise our good offices on Pro. No. 419 in Secret e., December 1907, Noe. 412-451. his behalf. I he Secretary of State replied that ' no action should be taken at present in direction of either proposal.' The Government of India also telegraphed in September 1907 to the Pro. No. 417 in ibid. Secretary of State about the Shaikh's • desire to despatch a messenger to keep the peace between Bin Saud and Bin Rashid by guaranteeing the former in possession of his territory, the latter in that of Hail, and by guaranteeing the independence of El Kasim against both. The Government o^ India recom mended that the Shaikh should be informed that they had no wish to prevent him frcm using his influence with Bin Saud and' Bin Rashid to prevent internecine warfare which threatened the prosperity of his own country and trade, but that the proposed guarantee would involve him in definite political action in Central Arabia and could not be allowed, and the opinion was expressed that the situation emphasised the desirability of obtaining from the Shaikh formal recoguition of our right to control his external relations.35 The Government of India also repeated to the Secretary of State the pro. No. 4i6 in Secret e., December 1907, Nos. 412- instructions sent to the Political Resi- /i5L dent to the effect that the Shaikh should be induced to postpone consideration of the policy proposed by him pending conclusion of negotiations regarding the foreshore. But, in the event of the Shaikh pressing the matter he was to be told that the case must be placed before Government, and he was to be referred to previous warnings against interference in Nejd affairs. The Secretary of State approved these instructions, but advised that even p xr this action should be deferred until the irro. No. 421 in tbtd. , . „ agreement about the toreshore was con cluded. 23. The most important development in the consolidation of our influence in Kuwait has been the acquisition of the foreshore (October 1907). Jb'or an annual payment of Rs. 60,000 the Shaikh has granted us the perpetual lease of the Bunder Shweikh foreshore. He has further renewed his undertaking of 1899 not to cede, sell or lease to any Foreign Power, in cluding the Ottoman Government, or their subjects, any of the land within Kuwait boundaries without the permission of His Majesty's Government; he has given us the right of pre-emption, in sale or lease, of certain lands (Shweikh and Warba islands, Ras Kathama, &amp;c.) and the right of retusal to acquire such property in the event of an offer from any one else. He further has granted certain customs facilities to our traders; has Enclosure, Pro. No. 73 in Secret E., July 1908, Secured OUr recognition of Kuwait and Nos. 54-108. its boundaries as belonging to him and to their continuance in the possession of his heirs; has precluded us from levying customs duty on lands occupied by the British Government within his territory ; has promised not to accept any proposition for acquisition of land in Kuwait from any other Power or to permit them to have any authority within his dominions; has expressed his wish for the permanent care of the British Gov ernment ; has bound us to a desire not to interfere in the affairs of Kuwait except for the profit of the people of Kuwait and the increase of trade and knowledge and friendship; and has declared the object on both sides to be that of perpetual friendship. An agreement on these lines has been concluded, and accepted by His Majesty's Government. The only points that have called for remarks from them have been— (1) the Shaikh's rights to Warba island; (2) that in clause 9 of the agreement, a pledge, capable of being con strued as a grant of dynastic guarantee, has been accorded ; and (3) that in clause 12 a guarantee of internal independence has been given. As regards (1), vide page 47. In reference to (2), the Secretary of State was informed, in January 1908, that there was no intention of giving a dynastic pledge in the agreement, and the view held by the Government of India and the local authority at Kuwait as to the real interpretation of the passage in vernacular relating to the same was explained. In respect of (3), the intention of the Secretary of State, in referring thereto, was merely to point out that a guarantee of internal independence has been granted as was proposed by the Government of India in August 1907, when they remarked that ' as to proposed guarantee of internal independence we understand Shaikh's suggestion to be that we shall guarantee not to interfere with his internal autonomy, such guarantee not affecting rights, if any, of Turkey.' Prom the above it will be gathered that our intentions are non-interference in the internal affairs of Kuwait, and a desire to protect Kuwait against hostile attack either on the part of the Turks or from any other quarter within the limits of Kuwait territory. 24. Early in 1909 the Vali of Basrah insisted that Kuwait subjects in Pro. No. 85 and enclo. 1 to No. 85 in Secret E., Basrah should register themselves as September im Nos. s*- loo. Ottoman subje3ts, and also that the Pro. No. yi in Secret L., September 1909, Noa. 84- if u u x i 10 5 Shaikh himself should take out a36 certificate of Turkisli nationality in connection with the registration of his Fedaghia property. Sir G. Lowther was instructed to explain to the Turkisli Government that*the attitude of His Majesty's Government had not been modified with regard to the status of Kuwait, since the recent constitutional r, ^ c . u. o . v mnn v mo changes in Turkev. The representation Pro. No. 94 in Secret K, September 1009, Nos. 84-100, n » T r and Pro. No. 294, in Secret E., November 1909, has, llOWCVer, not yet been made tllOUgll, Nos. 294 -295. appears, indirect influence was brought to bear on the Council of Ministers. 25. During the year 1910 there were several instances of Turkish attempts to acquire a hold on Kuwait and of a disregard of their promises to respect the status quo. In April 1910 the Vali of Basrah is reported to have told the Shaikh of Kuwait that he had received orders from the Ministers of War and the Interior to take from Kuwait 20 or 30 men for gendarmerie service at Hasa. The Shaikh replied that his own men were engaged in their occupations , , _ „ and could not be spared. The Minister e., july 1910, os. - . of the Interior declared that no such orders had been given, but the Vali maintained to His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, that such had been the ease. In June 1910, it was reported that the Vali had attempted to induce the x, o v xr lam.o Shaikh to agree to the installation of a Secret E., September 1910, Ncs. 137-142. , i-i it j ? n i -I-* land telegraph line irom Basrah or i ao to Kuwait, thus reviving the old idea of 1899, when the Vali pressed the Shaikh for the prolongation of the telegraph line from Fao to Katif through Kuwait. The Sultan then issued an irade for its construction, but the proposal came to nothing. In the case of 1910, the Shaikh disparaged the idea on the ground of expense and trouble with the Bedouin, who would constantly cut the wires. In July 1910, the Shaikh corroborated the local rumour that the Vali of Basrah bad offered to obtain for him n, firman giving him control on behalf of the Porte over Nejd, Hasa, &amp;c. The Shaikh claims to have replied to the Vali a . t . Q * v iqin xr , c o that his own local affairs occupied his Secret E., September 1910, Nos. 154-162. ,. „ a i i , , , i ^ . time lully and that he had no desire to extend his responsibilities. In October 1910, information was received that the Turks had offered the Shaikh a pension of £400 Turkish per annum as Kaimakam, and enquired how be would like to receive it. The Shaikh, after consulting the Resident, wrote politely rejecting the offer. During the greater part of 1910, Mubarak was again harassed (as in 1909, vide above) by the Vali in respect of certain property he had purchased at Fedaghia in 1909 for £T. 48,000. When the Shaikh took steps to register the transfer at the Turkish land office he was informed that he must register him self as a Turkish subject, such a demand in reference to transfer never having been made before. On Mubarak's refusal the Vali tried by tortuous methods to instigate the vendor to impugn the Shaikh's title, despite the title deeds being held by the Shaikh and bearing the signature of the vendor, besides those of all the Basrah notables as well as that of the British Consul. His Majesty's Government proposed to include representation on this matter in the general letter of October Iv^lO, which has been held up (see pages 54-56), but unofficial representations were made by His Majesty's Ambassador in this matter, pending the question of the general representations being made to the Porte. It is proposed to settle this question in connection with the comprehensive arrangement with Turkey regarding Gulf questions— vide (q) on page 62. 25. Use Of Turkish flag at Kuwait —The declarations repeatedly secret e .. November 1901. No,. 181.315. mad ! ^ p s Government of non-mterierence with existing Turkish authority have involved some controversy with regard to the use by the Shaikh of the Turkish flag, to which British officers in the Gulf are strongly averse. Mubarak bad constantly flown the Turkish flag, not only on his dhow while in the company of the Vali of Secret e ., October 1901, Kos. 184-315. Basrah, but also at his house on the occasion of the British Resident's visit.37 When asked the reason of this, he replied that ' it was flown by his father and grandfather on such occa- eudtosure E * June 1901 ' No8, n8-230 ' Pro - No -228, s i ons as a Muhammadan flag, and did not indicate that they were under any control or protection of the Turks.' On the 16th August 1901, the Government of India pressed a suggestion of the Resident that the use of the flag should be discontinued, on the ground that it was inconsistent to allow the Turkish flag to be flown while Turkish troops were forbidden to land. On the 28th, the Secretary of State enquired what flag it was proposed that the Shaikh should fly, and pointed out that Lord Lansdowne was not prepared to support any action which might seem inconsistent with the assurance given by Sir N. O'Conor that His Majesty's Government would respect the status quo. The Besident in the Persian Gulf recommended the use of the ordinary red Arab flag, and intimated that the events of the past two-and-a-half years had so disturbed the status quo that a determination of the status of Kuwait could not be much longer postponed. The proposal was vetoed* in September 1901 by His Majesty's Govern- • Secret e., March 1902, N ob. 127-357. (Pro. No. ment, on the ground that the Shaikh !r78 -) had accepted the post of Kaimakam, that he held property in Turkish territory, that the Turkish flag had been liown since 18/1, and that Lord Lansdowne did not consider that there was anything in the events of the last two-and-a-half years to justify a departure from the status quo, upon the maintenance of which His Majesty's Gov ernment had always laid the greatest stress. Pro. No. 437 iu Secret E., January 1907, Nos, 434- In December 190G the flag (JUestlOQ 438 - was again referred to the Secretary of State. No reply was received, but it will be observed that Lord Morley was not Pro. No. 218 in Secret E., September 1907, Nos. 218- i^ fa\ OUr of endangering OUr position 244 - by pressing the proposal about the flag. Sir N. O'Conor, however, considered that our agreement with Kuwait, although not formally or officially acknowledged ro. No. —3 m %hid. ^ the Ottoman Government, had weight with them, and would influence their course of action under certain ciroumstances. He also opined that ' any exhibition of weakness on the part of His Majesty's Government, or of a desire to shirk the consequences of our agreement w T iih Kuwait, would materially aifect our position, which is a political factor in the situation which * * * His Majesty's Government ought not lightly to ignore.' That the question of the flag should be mooted by the Political Re-ident at an opportune moment, but not impolitically pressed as w r e had 'already marked our connection with Kuwait by the appointment of a Resident, and * * * by the establishment of a British Post Oihce, as well as sundry other ways'. In November 1910, in connection with the proposed treaty with the Katar . Shaikh and the general Anglo-Turkish e pa^cs i ante. situation in the Gulf, Colonel Cox strongly recommendedf the elimination of the Turkish flag at Kuwait. His Majesty's Government were informed accordingly, but this and other questions became later merged into that of a general settlement regarding Kuwait in connection with the Baghdad Railway question, which will be noted ou in its proper place {vide below—paragraph 28). 26. Proposal to make Kuwait a port of call for mail „ ^ , steamers. —In July 1900, an attempt Secret E., October 1900, Nos. 175-281. ^ * 4. ur l 11 11 4- was made to establish a weekly call at Kuw ait of the British India Company's steamers. Mr. Lyle, an Agent of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., of Basrah, was well received by the Shaikh, who made, however, the important stipulation that the call of steamers should not bring with it the establishment ot quarantine. 1 he Turkish authorities, who were38 paying much attention to Kuwait, would alrmst certainly enforce at that place, as at Basrah, a ten days' quarantine against arrivals from all ports other than Turkish. It was generally agreed that this extension of quarantine would both be ruinous to the trade of Kuwait and undesirable as increasing- the influence of Turkey in the Gulf. Colonel Keraball further pointed out that, in the event of H^r Majesty's Government making successful representations to the Porte against a quarantine for Kuwait, the Shaikh would he subjected to a goner il system of reprisals and his town treated as a foreign port (a similar difficulty having already presented itself in connection with the Shaikh's property in Turkish territory). The question was solved for the moment by the Shaikh withdrawing his „ „ „ , „ » consent to the scheme. The witli- Secret E., February 1901, Nos. 22-107. -i , . . j • drawal was not, however, conveyed in very decided terms, the compulsion of extraneous influence was apparent, and it seemed to Lieutenant-Colonel Kemball that the Shaikh's objections would be removed at a future date. In June 1901, the Shaikh intimated that he was now favourable to the a . t ? a . v. ,om xt .01 Q 1(; scheme. It was accordinglv arranged Secret E., October 1901, Nos. 181-315. ji , -i .1 . , ~ ', , t , 0 , that the mail steamers should call at Kuwait on the upward voyage from Bombay to Basrah. The quarantine officials at first imposed certain restrictions, but their objections were not of as serious a character as had been anticipated, and they were not maintained. In 1908, it was proposed by Colonel Cox to replace the rough and ready Secret E., January 1909, Nos. 33-40. 0f quarantine at Kuwait by a regular system. The shaikh s attitude was unfavourable. Eventually in 1909, it was decided to discontinue the fast mail to Kuwait, secret e., june 1900, nos. 751 -757. the mails tor and from Kuwait being Secret E., November 1909. N OS. 296-298. delivered at Fao by the Political Agent's steam-la inch. This procedure solved the quarantine question. 27. Opening of a British post office at Kuwait.— The first pro- secret e.. may 1902, Nos. 13-17. posal for opening a British post office at Secret e ., Jaiy 1904. Nos. H20-659. Kuwait was made by the Shaikh in November 1901. The Secretary of State agreed, but desired that-the Shaikh should undertake not to allow the establishment of the post offices of other countries. This undertaking was obtained in 1901, but for political reasons the post office at Kuwait is not yet a regular post office. In October 1910, the Government of India proposed to the Secretary of State, on the recommendation of the local authorities, that a regular post olfice should be established in view of the increased postal work there. The Secretary of State rejected the proposal for the present, as in the opinion of the British Ambassador at Constantinople it might arouse Turkish opposition. 28. Proposed settlement of the Kuwait question in connec tion with tne Baghdad Railway.— Reference has been made to the advantages of acquiring control over Kuwait, which are (a) a very fair harbour; (b) a potential railway terminus; (&lt;?) a trade depot; {d) control over piracy and slave trade; {e) exclusion of foreign influence. Our main object twelve years ago in entedng into relations with Kuwait was to prevent the Baghdad llailway from reaching the Gulf, except under conditions consonant with our interests, and to turn our position there to account in discussions regarding the terminus. In January 1911, His Majesty's Government desired to be in a position to discuss with the Porte a settlement of the Kuwait question, as part of an arrangement for British participation in the Baghdad Railway. The follow ing telegraphic correspondence shows the position up to date. Telegram P., dated the 27tb January 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. In the opinion of the Foreign Office, the time has come when His Majesty's Government should bo in a poiition to discuss with the Porte a39 spttlement of the Kuwait question as part of an arrnngement for British participation in the Baghdad railway. The following lines are suggested :— First. —Turkish suzerainty to be recognised by His Majesty's Government while stipulating for full measures of self-government in the administration, especially as regards customs: Second. —Shaikh to pay fixed tribute to Turkey for which he might perhaps recoup himself from port dues on through traffic : Third. —The continuance of tribute to be subject to Shaikh's equitable treat ment as regards date groves in Basrah Vilnyat: tmirth.- —Control of port by Bis Majesty's Government and Shaikh, thus excluding interference of Turkey or Germany at Kuwait in internal affairs. Importance of safegarding Shaikh's position is fully recognised. Please telegraph your observations. Tek^ram P., dated the 16tli February 19] 1. Froin—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. Kuwait. Please expedite reply to my telegram of the 27th ultimo, as subject will be shortly broached by the Turkish Government. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has indicated a scheme by which tii« Gulf section, while being an Ottoman railway, should be internationalised, Britain, France, Germany, and perhaps Turkey being joint shareholders. Presumably you would consider it essential for us to have control of Port, as defined in condition No. 4 of my telegram above cited. Telegram P., dated the 23rd February 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to your telegrams, dated 27th January and 16th February. Kuwait. Colonel Cox happened to be visiting Kuwait and we authorised him to endeavour to elicit Shaikh's views, without informing Shaikh of motive. On 10th instant we received following telegram from Cox :— Begins. The present Vali, whom Shaikh has not yet met, has assured Shaikh that if he would only comply with their wishes by taking out Turkish papers for his sons, the Porte were ready to^grant him firman gufiranteeing to preserve present position and abstain altogether from interference in Kuwait affairs or government. The Shaikh said these overtures had always been rejected by him; first, because he believed it was our wish that he should reject them, and second, because lie thought, in virtue of our agreement with him, we should in due course achieve an adjustment of the property difficulty on other lines. Personally he believed that if he placated the Turks by registering his sons he would receive fair play in future in regard to his property in Turkish territory and, as regards the likelihood of such registration ultimately resulting in Turkish interference at Kuwait, in spite of firman, he said that he would not apprehend it in his own case, and, besides, he felt that Kuwait was safeguarded by his engagement with us; at the same time, he considered that in this connection the British Government were much better able than he was to gauoe the possibilities of the future and he must accept our estimation of them. 3. In reply to a question whether, in the event of the Porte being ready to grant a firman in satisfactory terms, he considered that he would be ren dered quite secure, if we obtained a documentary undertaking from Porte that firman would be strictly observed, Mubarak rep:ied in the affirmative. It would appear that sufficient recognition of Turkish sovereignty to satisfy Porte would be provided by above means, and that it would not be resented by the Shaikh, provided that our engagements with him held good. 4. As regards suggestion that Shaikh should pay tribute, I think I am right in stating that tribute has never been paid by Shaikhs of Kuwait. Indi cations of their dependence on Turkey have been limited to the honorary title of Kaimakam, the reception of complimentary annual presents on the receipt ofdates from Basrah authorities, and the rendering of voluntary co-operation in emergencies, such as that afforded to Midhat Pasha in 1871. These indications, which ceased in 1898, might be tacWy resumed ; but the payment of tribute would seem to be both unnecessary and unexpected and its suggestion would be greatly resented by Shaikh, while it would create the worst possible impres sion among other Arab Shaikhs in their relations with us. I would venture earnestly to deprecate it. 5. As regards suggestion 4. I presume that ' control of port' is intended to cover effective control on shore as well as afloat, such as we exercise in Egypt. Without that, the position would, in my judgment, be fraught with innumer able impracticabilities especially if last section of the railway were not under our control. Once Kuwait has become terminus of the railway and a large com mercial port, with foreign business houses, questions of territoriality, &amp;c., must necessarily arise and the crude regime of the Shaikh would have to give place to a more civilised administration, and this must be under the supervision of British Government who would deal with Foreign Powers on Shaikh's behalf. 6. Whatever form of recognition of Turkish suzerainty be decided upon it should include the stipulation that Bubiyan, Um Kasr and Warba be recog nised as within the Shaikh's sphere of control, and the present Turkish guardian ship should be removed. 7. It would further seem necessary to stipulate that the recognition of suzerainty was specifically contingent upon definitive decision to make Kuwait the terminus. Otherwise, having brought about such recognition by us, Germany might say that on further consideration it had been decided that Fao or Basrah would be the most convenient place for the terminus. In this con nection it is well to remember that, before the Baghdad Railway reaches the Persian Gulf, we might have found it necessary to undertake the dredging of the bar in connection with the Mohammerah-Julfa Railway or the require ments of the oil trade. 8. Finally, it is clear thit Turks cannot be expected to agree to the transfer to the treasury of the Shaikh of Kuwait of the large customs duties and transit duties which they now realise at Basrah. Nor on the other hand would the Shaikh allow bulk of customs revenue to go to Turkish Government. If then Kuwait and not Basrah is to be terminus, a fair division will be essential. It would seem probably that it is this consideration which will mainly influence the selection of terminus. In my opinion, the settlement of Fedaghia question can await the opening of railway negotiations, provided that these are not likely to be long deferred. Ends. A change of policy is involved by the proposals of His Majesty's Govern ment, and I earnestly recommend that there should be no surrender of our position until (1) we secure predominant control in Baghdad-Kuwait section of railway, say, 60 per cent of capital and control as minimum, and (2) share with the Shaikh the absolute control of Kuwait harbour and port ashore and afloat. I would further urge as a sine quz non that before concluding suzerainty negotiations a specific assurance be secured that lerminus shall be at Kuwait. If these essential conditions can be secured, I generally support Cox's views. It would be better that there should be no question of payment of tribute : an arrangement under whicli the Shaikh and the Turks divide the Kuwait customs receipts to compensate latter for losses of revenue at Basrah, would seem all Uiat is required. I also assume that our own agreements with Shaikh will not be invalidated by recognition of Turkish suzerainty. Telegram P., dated the 3rd March 1911. From—H is Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, With reference to your telegram of the 23rd February, I await your despatch regarding Persian railways, but, meantime, have you considered what will be the effect of extension of Baghdad Railway to Khanikin if the trans- Persian line is not constructed ? It is precisely in order to compete with the41 former that the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line is proposed by us, as the only means of extending and saving our trade in Western Persia. Secret. In the opinion of the Foreign Office the prospect of our being able to obtain a controlling share in the Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway is remote, but nevertheless it may be worth while that we should participate. Telegram P., dated the 3rd March 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, Lond n, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. Baghdad-Persian Gulf Railway. Please telegraph any observations which you wish to make on following summary of proposals by Turkish Govern ment :— Summary begins. Porte proposes that a new joint stock company should be formed, the capital to be found by the Ottoman Government and British, German and French capitalists; 40 per cent by the Ottoman Govern ment, and 20 per cent by each of the others : the cost of construction to be provided by State bonds which would be issued in London, Berlin, Paris and Constantinople. Kuwait is mentioned as most suitable for the terminus, but as terminus must be under the Ottoman Government's direct administration, and the status of Kuwait presents certain particularities the relations of Kuwait to the Ottoman Empire must be regularised. Utility of arriving at an under standing as to respective rights of Britain and TurKey in the Persian Gulf is also referred to. Summary ends. Telegram P., dated the 2nd March 1911.

I am addressing Foreign Office officially, strongly supporting your views. ' But terms are pretty stilf, and contingency must be faced that rather than accept them Turks will choose Basrah as terminus. If necessary, would you abate any of your conditions to avoid this and, if so, which ? Foreign Office express opinion that it is highly improb ible that we shall in any case secure control ol Gulf section, but that it may nevertheless be worth while to participate.

Please refer to your telegram of the 2nd March 1911, re ^ardin'- Kuwait. In my opinion, it would be far better, rather than that we ^should accept anything that might weaken our position and that of the Shaikh of Kuwait, that the terminus of the railway should be at Basrah. Such an acceptance would have far-reaching consequences iu the Gulf, where it is absolutely necessary that our predominance should be assured. The only abatement of our conditions that I can suggest is a 40 per cent instead of a 60 per cent practicipation in the Gulf section, although this presents some danger if the interest in the line of the Turks is a nominal 10 per cent; and the German 20 per cent, respectively. Telegram P., dated the 7th March 1911. From —His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Your telegram, 3rd March, regarding elfect of extension of Baghdad Railway to Khanikin. If the Trans-Persia line fails through, we consider that the Mohammerah-Khoremubad line becomes of primary importance. Our opinion as to inutility of latter was expressed on the understanding that the proposed Trans-Persia line would be constructed.42 Telegram P., dated the 7th March 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London. Your telegram of 3rd IV1 arch. The Turkish Government's proposals can hardly be taken seriously. Their effect is to place England in the Gulf and Mesopotamia in the same position as that of Germany and !ranee, which is absurd ; moreover, they imply our desertion of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the absolute surrender of our position at Kuwait, while all that is oflered is a 20 per c ent participation in the Gulf section. If we pursue such a policy, we should lose the confidence of the Trucial Chiefs and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, upon whose rights the Turks would at once begin to encroach. [ think that we should tell the Porte that it is our intention to maintain our position in the Gulf and at Kuwait, and that there can be no question of ceding the 4 per cent customs increase, and that the additional 3 per cent will be withdrawn in 1913, unless satisfactory conditions are made for our participation in Gulf section. Telegram P., dated the 18th March 1911. ■F roin —His Majesty's {Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. Please refer to your telegram of the 7th instant, and last sentence of mine, dated 3rd idem. Baghdad Railway. I should be glad to know your views as to participation without control, provided that Kuwait is absolutely secured in sense of your telegram of the 23rd ultimo. lirst. Might equal treatment for British trade be secured by assent to the enhancement of customs for fixed period only, conditional on non-imposition of differential rates? Second. In the event of our not having control, would it matter commercially whether our share is 20 or 40 per cent. Third. If we get only 20 per cent, will not loss of prestige be less than if we are left out altogether ? Apparently the alternative is to stand out and try to use our assent to increase of customs to buy out Turkish claims in the Gulf and at Kuwait. Basrah would then presumably be the terminus, and for our trade with west of Persia we must rely on Mohammerah- Khoremabad line, if we get it. Should, however, no friendly arrangement be arrived at, the Baghdad Railway will nevertheless be built, and as Turkish power consolidates the dithculty of continuing our good offices to Shaikh will be increased. Adverting to Kuwait itself, please refer to paragragh 5 of memorandum* by Lord Lansdowne, dated 21st March 1902, enclosed in India Office letter of Xlth March 1902. How would you define region to w T hich our obligation extend ? Do you accept general description of boundaries as given on page 10o9, &amp;c., in Persian Gulf Gazetteer ? Do Warba and Bubiyan cense to matter if railway terminus is at Bunder Shweikh ? Presumably, it is not possible to claim Um Kasr. I shall be glad of a reply as quickly as possible. Telegram P., dated the 23rd March 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Secret. Your telegram of 18th March. If statement telegraphed by Renter's Agency is correct that an agreement has been concluded by Turkey with Germany for the internationalisation of the Gulf section of the Baghdad Railway and that Germany is to have a share equal to that of any other Power, we can now never realise the predominance of England on that section of the line. Erom a British point of view the situation is tlierefore serious and, unless a firm and consistent policy is adopted in the Persian Gulf, pregnant w r itii future possibilities to our detriment.43 I The essential and first condition of such a policy is that the position of Kuwait sliould be absolutely secured in the sense of my telegram, dated the 7th Mnrch. Any hesitation upon that point would be a complete surrender; it would encourage further encroachments by the Turks and would create new and worse difficulties with the Shaikh of Bahrain, the Trucial Chiefs and possi bly also the Sultan of Maskat. (See Sir G. Lowther's despatch No. 106, dated loth February last.) With reference to your numbered enquiries as to British participation with out control, I am of opinion :— First. In event of the Gulf section being constituted and internationalised Turkish line, we can insist with the Turkish Government that differential rates against British trade should not be imposed. By according assent to the enhancement of customs duties for so small a concession we should be surrender ing an extremely powerful weapon for a very small return. It must be remembered that until we have consented to pay the enhanced duties no other Power will agree to do so. It is consequently essential for Turkey to placate us and even if British trade were to be treated differentially on Gulf section, the loss to our trade would be less than that which our general trade would sustain, owing to the enhanced import duties. Second. Even without control, the greater the share of participation that we can secure the stronger our position becomes for seeing justice done to our trade. Third. Whether we have 20 per cent participation or none at all there will be little difference in our loss of prestige. 20 per cent would be better than nothing, provided that France had an equal share and that we could rely on France supporting our interests. But it is obvious that when our position in Southern Mesopotamia is placed on a footing of equality with that of Germany and France our loss of prestige cannot fail to be great. It is worthy of consideration whether the best and most dignified policy at th^) present moment would not be to decline to discuss the question further with Turkey, until a more reasonable attitude is shown in regard to British interests. All indications point to the probability of a forward movement by Turkey on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and of a contiict with us over our rights and interests in those regions, and it is for His Majesty's Government to decide whether the best course would not be to seize the first oppoi tunity of a forward move on the part of Turkey to check it by resistance with the aid of our naval forces. I propose to reply separately without delay to the questions contained in the penultimate paragraph of your telegram. Telegram P., dated the 23rd March 1 ^11. From—His Majesty's Secretary o£ State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta. Following telegram, dated the 21st March, from His Majesty's Ambassador, Constantinople, is repeated for your information : — Begins. Baghdad Railway. Three Conventions have been signed to-day. The first relates to building of section between Halif and Baghdad to be completed in five years. The second concerns construction of branch between Osmanie and Alexandretta. The third cedes the construction and working of Port Alexandretta to Haidar Pasha Port Company. A declaration is made by which the German Company abandons right to Ba ^hdad : Persian Gulf section and renounces right to ports at Basrah and Gulf terminus. It maintains, however, right to share in new company equal to that of any other Foreign Power, and reserves to itself right to settle with new company the amount of indemnity to be paid for loss arising out of working expense's guaranteed on that section. Telegram ends.44 Telegram P., date l the 25th March 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Calcutta, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. In reply to questions contained in concluding paragraph of vour teWram of 18th instant we are of opinion— (1) that our obligations extend to the limits of the Shaikh of Kuwait's territory; (2) to the best of our knowledge these limits are defined with fair accuracy in Mr Lorimer's Persian Gulf Gazetteer, especially as regards the northern portion ; (3) we attach importance to the retention of Bubiyan and Warba for the Shaikh. The occupation of Bubiyan in 1902 by the Turks was a departure from their engagement to maintain the status quo and repeated representations were made to the Porte. Further in xNovember 1907 the Foreign Office informed the In(lia Office that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs considered that the jurisdiction of the Shaikh over Bubiyan island should be supported reso lutely by His Majesty's Government on the grounds so forcibly stated by the Government of India. With reference to Warba it is to be remembered that in the agreement made with the Shaikh in 1907 we secured from him the right of pre-emption in lease or sale ot the entire island and its surrounding foreshore. The Shaikh must undoubtedly regard this as an admission on our part that Warba belongs to Kuwait. 0 The Shaikh's claims to Um Kasr are shadowy and we do not think it advisable to press them. Telegram P., dated the 31st March 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Private. Following counterproposal in regard to Baghdad Eailwav is under consideration. The section from Baghdad to Gulf to be undertaken en bloc by a company which, while nominally Turkish, would in fact be half British, half German. The port and terminus to be at Kuwait on our land which we will sub judice let to the company on conditions which would ensure that our strategic interest should be secured. One of these conditions would be that the port should be policed by us alone. We would recognise Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait, but Turks to give Shaikh a guarantee of complete autonomy, though it might be necessary to introduce Turkish customs for through trade. The adjustment of all Turkish claims in Gulf would be part of settlement on these lines. I shall be glad to know your views The Bo-ird of Trade are of opinion that a 50 per cent share is sufficient protection against duieiential rates on the Gulf section, while, as regards the main line we should make our concurrence in increased customs duties for fixed period conditional on our obtaining satisfactory assurances in this respect, and we should also llailwav 001110 a PP omtmeilt of one or two Directors on the Baghdad How would this affect Kuwait, and what would you precisely suggest should be the conditions referred to above ?

Please refer to telegram, dated 14th October 1903, from Secretary of State i t0 ln . Keil J ball,s ie'' Ko. 172. dated 11th December 1902 was definition communicated to Shaikh of Kuwait ?

The alternative proposal set out in your private telegram of the 31st ultimo, at first sight, appears to offer better hopes of arriving at a satisfactory settlement. I consider, however, that it is essential that the strength of our position at Kuwait and in the Gulf should not be ignored, that, when dealing with the adjustment of all Turkish claims in the Gulf, no opening should be allowed for Turkey or-any other Power to encroach on the shores of the Gulf. The following are the conditions which I consider should be secured :— 1. The autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait to be as complete as that of Egypt, or formerly as that of Eastern Eoumelia. 2. The construction of the port to be a British concession from the Shaikh. 3. Ourselves and Shaikh jointly to administer the port customs, subject, in the rase of transit duties, to scrutiny by Turkish representative and to repayment. 4. The duration of enhanced Turkish customs to be dependent on non infringement of British rights in the Gulf, and on absence of preferential rates on the Baghdad and branch lines. 5. We should retain in our hands the policing of the port. 6. Except where subjects of Shaikh are alone concerned, civil and criminal jurisdiction of port to rest with us. 7. No troops other than those of Shaikh and ourselves to be located, and no fortifications to be built at Kuwait, without our consent. 8. The pilotage and lighting buoys of the Gulf including the Shat-el- Arab to be in our hands. This I regard as important. I consider that the Shaikh of Kuwait would be so favourably affected by assured autonomy that it would be easy to arrive at a satisfactory agreement with him regarding the second, third, fifth and sixth of above conditions. Telegram P., dated the 6th April 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy (Camp), To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Kuwait. The point to which you refer in your telegram of the 31st March was not overlooked here and view expressed in my telegram of 25th ultimo is not affected thereby. Definition was most probably communicated to Shaikh, and it may be assumed that it was. But this only referred to pledge to defend Shaikh against Ibn itashid, by whom at the time the immediate neighbour hood of Kuwait was being threatened. 29. The reply to the Ottoman Government's proposal for an increase to the Turkish Customs duties from 11 to 15 per cent for a limited period is under the consideration of His Majesty's Government whose assent, if given, is to be subject to the following conditions so far as concerns Kuwait:— (а) The assent of all other Powers, and especially Prance and Russia, must be secured to the increase. (б) A new Turkish Company shall be formed for the line south of Baghdad: of the capital of this Company, which shall arrange both for the construction and the working of the line, 50% shall be British and the remainder German or Turco-German. (o) There shall be two British members on the Board, and the Chairman shall, in alternate years, be British.46 (d) There shall be no sort of discrimination in freight rates on any railway in Asiatic Turkey connected with Baghdad. (e) The British representation on the Board shall always be kept up to a fixed minimum. {f) of the capital of the line south of Baghdad shall be retained in the hands of the British shareholders : and in order to secure this, some arrangement, such as a right of pre-emption at 5% above par, to vest in the Bank of England, shall be drawn up by the Board of Trade. {g) The above arrangements shall not be subject to a concession granted for a limited time, but shall be continued so long as the enhanced Customs duties are levied by Turkey. (/&lt;) The railway terminus shall be at Kuwait. (i) The policing of the port of Kuwait, both ashore and afloat, shall be carried out, in the interests of international trade, by the agents of the Shaikh of Kuwait, under the direction of British officers of experience. (j) Kuwait shall in no circumstances be fortified. {k) The harbour of Kuwait shall be constructed by British contractors, and ir shall be built on land to be leased for this purpose by the British Government, and controlled by a separate Company. (/) Harbour dues, on a scale to be determined, shall be arranged, and the net proceeds of those dues shall be divided in equal portions between the Shaikh and the harbour company, which shall be British. (m) The territorial stains quo of Kuwait shall be guaranteed by Turkey and Great Britain. (w) An arrangement shall be made for the levy, in the interests of Turkey, of Customs dues on all throuyh traffic entering Turkey through the port of Kuwait. (o) The administration of local affairs at Kuwait shall remain, as heretofore, in the hands of the Shaikh or his successors. (p) The suzerainty of the Sultan of Turkey over Kuwait shall be recognised, and the limits of the Shaikh's jurisuiction defined (territorially). (&lt;?) The Shaikh shall take out Turkish nationality certificates in the names of his sons. (?') Kuwaitis resident abroad shall enjoy Turkish consular protection. (c) will perhaps be amended thus: 'the number of members on the Board [i e., of the new Company] shall be in proportion to the amount of the British capital and the Chairman shall in alternate years be British **. The question of a British Director on the Baghdad Kailway itself will perhaps be taken up with the Germans. (r) Kuwaitis abroad. This will probably be held in reserve. In connection with the above negotiations His Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed on the 29th April 1911 as follows Private. —If an arrangement with Turkey on the terms * * # * • * could possibly be secured, the result will be eminently satisfactory. IheiL* are, however, a few amendments that I would like to suggest:— Paragraphs (/) and (w) —It might be laid down that w r e and the Shaikh are to jointly administer the Customs and transit duties. It would have to be so, and it is as well to state the fact clearly. Paragraph (o;.—We should add that 'except when subjects of the Shaikh are alone concerned civil and criminal jurisdiction of the port should rest with British officials '. This is a counsel of perfection, but to obtain these points, if possible, would, I think, be wise.CHAPTER VIII. Um Kasr, Bubiyan and Warba. Reference has been made* to the Turkish occupation of Um Kasr and •seepage31, ante. Bubiyan by the Turks in 1902 and to Sir t/iirf, page 32, on&lt;e, O'Conor's reportf that he had inform ed the Porte that the Turkish occupation could not be regarded as prejudicing the Shaikh of Kuwait's rights and authority over the places. During Lord Curzon's tour in the Gulf in 1903, the Shaikh repeatedly urged his claims to Bubiyan and asked why the Turks were not compelled to evacuate both Um Kasr and Bubiyan. The subject was discussed in the despatch from the Government of sec^t e., march 1904, nt&gt;a. 2oo-ioi. Ma of February 1904.. It was held that the claims of Kuwait, so far as concerns Um Kasr and the neighbouring mainland, were not apparently s r ron^, but, whatever their validity, the time for successful pr test had' passed. Bubiyan was entirely on a different footing. The question of the importance of the shores of the mainland and of Bubiyan island were noticed. It was considered that the Shaikh had claims to the islard which ould be maintained with prospect of success. It Mas suggested that the Porte be informed that its claims to maintain a station on Bubiyan could not be recognised and that Turkish troops should be withdrawn, a British post, beina: at the same time established on the northern end of the island on behd? of the Shaikh. As a less pronounced course of aciior, it was recommended thai, the Porte should be informed that His Majesty's Government regard the island as belong ing to the Shaikh, and that, unless the Turkish foree was withdrawn, thev would be compelled to support the Shaikh in establishing a po^t on the northern shore of the island to balance the Turkish posts at Um Kasr and A1 Geit. The matter remained unsettled, and three years later assumed a dilferent aspect in connection with the Baghdad Bail way and the Bunder Shweikh Secret 1908. No,. 64.108. foreshore agreement In October 1907, an inter-aepartmental conrerence was held on the question of the Basrhdad Bailway terminus. They reported (^nd October 1907) that the three places best suited for a terminus were Bunder Shweikh, Wsrba roads including Um Kasr, and Basrah. On the 3rd November, the Government of India informed the Secretary of S ate that, owing to a misunderstanding on the part ot the Political Agenr, Kuwait, the Bunder Shweikh foreshore agreement included a clai^e, giving the British Government right of pre-emption to the entire island of Warba, and they subsequentlv reported that, in their opinion, the inclusion in the lease of this rii:ht, which merely conveyed to them the Shaikh's rights for what they were worth, could not embarrass them, even if the Shaikh's title to the island was doubtful. In a letter, dated the 12th November, Sir E. Grey entirely concurred that, ' it would be desirable to assert any rights which the Shaikh of ivuwait may possess in respect of Warba island, though he is of opinion that, even if it were not possible to substantiate those claims, the S iaikh's jurisdiction over Bubiyan, should be resolutely supported by His Majesty's Government on the grounds so forcibly stated ' in the Government of India's despatch of February i90Ji.

As regards Um Kasr, the Government of India, in a telegram to the Secretary of State dated the 25th March 1911, expressed the opinion that the Shaikh's claims were shadowy and they did not think it advisable to press them.CHAPTER IX. Bahrain, Zakhnuniyeh and Mohammerah. In the bay between Katif and the Katar Peninsula lies the island of Situation Of Bahrain. Bahrain. Favoured by nature, famed tor its pearl banks, the richest in the Persian Gulf and advantageously situated for commercial purposes, its posses sion has been coveted by Arabs, Persians and Turks.

With the aid ot the Wahabis, the Utubis recaptured Bahrain and paid tribute to the former for the help given. In 1810, the Wahabi ruler assumed t he government of Bahrain and Zobara, but in the following year the Utubis drove out the Wahabi Governor and regained supremacy over their islands. In 1816, the Imam of Maskat attempted to subdue Bahrain, but was repelled with great loss. From this period the Utubis have remained paramount and supplied the ruling dynasty.

Be that as it may, since 1820, when Shaikh Suleiman bin Ahmed signed the General Ireaty for the pacification of the Gulf, Great Britain has steadfastly rejected as totally inadmissible Turkey's and Persia's pretensions to sovereignty over the island which have frequently been put forward, while, in 1861, Uis Majesty's Government agreed with the Government of India that Bahrain should be regarded as independent of both the above Powers, and, in 1871, the Grand Vizier gave a formal assurance that the Porte entertained Secret E., January 1872, New. 119-122. 110 whatever of obtaining supremacy over the island. Further, a Note Verbale which formally asserted British protection over the island of Bahrain was presented to the Porte in August 1895.

A note was addressed to the Turkish Ambassador on the 14th April 1874 which, after drawing His Excellency's attention to previous communications, distinctly stated that His Majesty's Government did not admit the claim of 1 urkey to consider Bahrain as part of the Turkish Empire and that, if natives of the island applied to British Consuls in Turkey for protection, the latter could not refuse their good offices on behalf of such persons.

The Government of India expressed their full concurrence in the attitude of His Majesty's Government in declining to admit Turkish claims over Bahrain and insisting on the right of British Consular officers to intervene, in Ottoman territory, on behalf of Bahrain subjects.\ ^ 50 In 1898, the Porte informed His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that a rumour had reached them of the Secret k., May 1898, N ob . i-6. appointment of a British Vice -Consul at Bahrain, and requested that His Majesty's Government should apply to the Porte for the Exequatur. His Majesty's Government replied that they cannot admit the ri^ht of the Porte to insist on Consular officers in Bahrain being provided with an Ottoman Exequatur. As a matter of fact, no Consular officer had then been appointed to Bahrain. In accordance with the foregoing precedents, instructions were issued in 1908 by His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople to His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, who appeared to be unware of the status of Bahrainese in Turkisli territory, that he should extend British protection to natives of Bahrain in Ottoman territory. In 1910, the question again came np. On this occasion the Vali, while inclined to deny that the British Gov- seciet e.. may 1910, nos 4.0-431. ernment have any rights of supremacy in Bahrain, admitted that he had been instructed not to protest against, but at the same time not to accept, any assertion regarding the status of Bahrain. His Majesty's Consul at Basrah was instructed by His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople (who proposed to take to further action and the Foreign Office agreed) merely to communicate to the Vali the instructions of 1908 in order to show him that the intervention of British Consuls in Tui^key on behalf of Bahrainese was well established, and that, in 1871, the Grand Vizier gave a formal assurance 'that the Porte entertained no intention whatever of obtain ing supremacy over Bahrain.' The local officials have, however, as recently as March 1911, evinced a desire to claim Bahrainese as Ottoman subjects. On the arrival at Basrah of three Bahrainese with British passports, the Vali ordered them to take out Ottoman passports and, on their refusing to do so, arrested and imprisoned them, and the police declined to inform the Consul's dragoman of the charges against them or to admit Consular interference, the Vali replying officially that the Turkish Government neither know of nor admit British protection of natives of Bahrain. Ihe Ambassador referred the matter to the Foreign Office suggesting that, in view of negotiations concerning the Baghdad Railway and other matters at the head of the Persian Gulf, the action of the Vali should be taken advantage of to secure a definite solution of Bahrain and analogous questions there. He was instructed at the end of March to inform tne Turkish Government that the Vali's assertion of Ottoman claims over Bahrain, and the denial of British protection, constituted a flagrant violation of the status quo, and that such violations would impede negotia tions now pending for a settlement of Gulf questions outstanding and compel action to protect British rights, and that the Bahrain natives should be released forthwith and the passports accepted. Information received in April show3 that the prisoners have been released.

No. 425 m Secret e ., June 1906, Nos. 4 ,21-450, they considered, in practice, to be the, approximate limits of the British Protectorate in Bahiain. His Majesty's Government, however, were of opinion that the time had not yet arrived for defining, in strict terms, the position of the Shaikh of Bahrain towards the pro tecting British power.

The British position in Bahrain may be summed up as follows : * * * in virtue of the agreement of 1892 with the Shaikh of Bahrain, we exercise a practical protectorate over him, including the right and duty of intercession in dispute between his subjects and the officials or subjects of foreign Powers * * '.

All three in a way form one group and the last-named to the Turkish mind is a sort of stepping stone to El Katar and perhaps even to the Irucial Coast. The small sandy island of Zakhnuniyeh lies close to the mainland and ten miles to the south-east of Ojair, and is claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain, wh( se father built a fort there, and used to garrison it 60 years ago. It is regularly frequented by the Dowasir (subjects of the Shaikh) of Bahrain, during the winter months and remains uninhabited during the summer. &amp; +1? 11 iq ^ qxi I 11 March 1909, the Mudir of 0]air Secret E., July 1909, Nos. 538-548. • -i i ji , n * , visited the place, and ran up the Turkish flag and located a guard there. The matter was reported to the Secretary of State and the Government of India recommended removal of the Turkish garrison, support of the Shaikh's claim, and that he should be advised, as suggested by Colonel Cox, to fly his flag there. His Majesty's Ambassador was instructed to bring the facts to the notice of the Porte and to request the issue of instructions for the withdrawal of the garrison, on the ground of avoiding any disturbance of the status quo. He was also instructed to refer the Porte to the correspondence of 1903 which took place in regard to the Katar Coast. The question of our protectorate over Bahrain was not raised, it being considered undesirable, in the then phase of the political situation in Turkey, to make representations of a controversial nature to the Ottoman Government. In regard to this matter the Secretary of State intimated 'it appeared desirable that question of our protectorate over Bahrain should not in the first instance be raised. As to the proposed advice to Shaikh to fly his ow T n flag, belore deciding on any line of action, result of our representations can be awaited.' In October 1909, the Secretary of State telegraphed that the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs reported that the e'endarmes sent in March ^ l v ,0,^ xt had been withdrawn in June, and that. Secret E., Kbrnary 1910, Nos, 6/7-705, -i! • i.i cii *1 i i i i ^ i it this was so, the Shaikh should not be allowed to hoist his flag on the island and that the policy of His Majesty'#Government was to avoid disturbance of the status quo. The withdrawal of gendarmes was conftrrned by our local officers in November 1909, and they were informed in January 1910 that permission to the Shaikh to tiy his Hag on the island could not be given, as such a procedure might raise questions of policy, and that if the Shaikh reverted to the subject he should be told that, as no flag had been flown since the time of his father, it seemed unnecessary at the present juncture to depart from established precedent. ' So matters remained till June 1910 when the island was re-occupied by Turkish soldiers and the Turkish flag hoisted there every Friday. His Majesty's Ambassador was again instructed to point out that the occupation violated the status quo, and to request immediate and permanent withdrawal of the guard. He was also told to point out to the Porte ' that His Majesty's Government have « ♦ i? n v, ioia xt o xt oao ^ hitherto allowed the Shaikh of Secret E., December 1910, N ob , 296-324, Pro. No. 309. -r* i /i i • i i Jiahrain to hoist his nag on the island, lest the &lt;/«(? should be infringed'. On the 17th October 1910, the Turkish Minister of the Interior informed His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople that instructions had been issued to the Vali of Basrah that the gendarmes, who had proceeded to the island for the fishing season, should not return there without special orders from Constantinople. The Vali, however, on being questioned, denied the receipt of ary instructions, claimed that the island belonged to the Turks and told His Majesty's Consul that he had no right officially or privately to interfere in these matters and to mind his business, which was trade. On the 8th November, the Ambassador enquired from His Majesty's Consul whether the gendarmes had quitted the island, but, on being informed of the attitude of the Vali, instructed His Majesty's Consul not to enter into official communication with him on the subject, owing to his having questioned the Consul's title to make representations in the matter. « t? i? k ion xr .o.

Negotiations are pending between His Majesty's Government and the Turkish Government (May 1911) for the renunciation of the latter's claims to Zakhnuniyeh. No further information of the re-occupation of Zakhnuniyeh has been received.

The experiment has also recently been tried in the south-west corner of the Shah's dominions at Mohammerah, which is important to us alike strategically, politically and commercially. The town has played an important part in the conflicts between Turkey and Persia in the first half of the 19th century, but, when the Treaty of Erzeroum was signed in lfc47, Mohammerah was left, and has ever since remained, in Persian hands. Its rising fortunes are as gall and wormwood to the Turks of Basrah and Baghdad, and only some 15 years ago the claim of the Porte to Mohammerah was evidenced by the levy of dues on its imports and exports. Similar claims may be omitted and a recent concrete instance narrated illustrating Turkish activity at Mohammerah. During 1908-10, chronic unrest prevailed in Persia. The wise administra tion of the Shaikh of Mohammerah maintained peace in the tracts under his control. Trade v ith Persia through the southern ports was seriously dislocated, and a safe entry only obtainable through Arabistan ports. Apart from this, British relations with the Shaikhs of Mohammerah are of long standing, and under assurances given in 1902, and subsequently renewed, we are bound to use our good offices on behalf of the Shaikh in the event of a dispute with a foreign power. Such was the position in May 1910, when the Shaikh of Mohammerah and Nazif Bey, late Vali of Basrah, were on the best of terms, and the latter indeed was under some obligation to the former tor promoting friendly relations with the Vali of Pusht-i-Kuh and a reconciliation between the Vali of Basrah and an important Arab Chief of Turkish nationality. Suddenly, the Vali of53 Basrah brought charges against the Shaikh ^ ot harhouring f ^i« v e C'm ! naU from justice and refusing to deliver Secret e , July i9io t no 8 . 173-248. them 'up, and of being the cause of all the river troubles from Eao to Jiasrah. There was no evidence of any such serious troubles on the river during the previous winter or the spring of 1910. K o serious p. oof of these accusations was ^ ever offered, nor was opportunity e:iveii External B, December 1910, N ob. 158-178. ^ t j ie §1^^ to disprove them, which be was Quite willing to do. During the Shaikh 's absence at Ahwaz, under orders of the Vail, a Turkish gunboat shelled the village of Zam, belonging to the Shaikh on the Turkish side of the river, which was then looted and destroyed by Turkish soldiers. During the bombardment, the bouse of the Shaikh's mother was burnt and one of his wives died from shock. The a then threatened to bombard Mohammerah itself, and issued an offensive circular telegram to all Turkish officials in the Basrah District inciting them against the Shaikh, who, throughout this incident, was guided by our local officers and induced to maintain a pacific attitude and refrain from raising the whole country from Fao to Amara against the Turkish Government. Ihe Government of India, in view of their large interests at Mohammerah, uiged on the Secretary of State the need for the Vah's recall and replacement )y a less aggressive official. An amicable Secret e,, jaiy 1910, Nos. 173-248. settlement was later arrived at. The Vali accepted the Shaikh's explanations, but refused to express regret for the destruction of the Shaikh's mother's house, or thedeatbof his wife.ortopay compensation for the losses incurred by the unjustifiable bombardment of Zain. The Vali was recalled in September 1910. bir G. Lowther gathered that the step was due to the too great Pro. No. 149 in Secret E., October 1910, Nos. 139-166. 0 f activity by the Vali, but llis recall was made to have the appearance locally of being due to friction with his official superior and not connected ibid., Pro. No. 158. with the Zain incident. One further iniustice to the Shaikh was also committed. The Shaikh is owner of much land on the Turkish side of the Shat-el-Arab. A decree «as issued bv the Sublime Porte forbidding the registration of land in the \ ilayet of Basrah in the name of the Shaikh or his representatives, a measure which appears to be contrary to Ottoman law. When His Majesty's Government came to examine the case, they acquitted the Shaikh of all blame in connection^ with the dispute ^ Vali of Basrah and extended assurances were given to bun in October 1910, and the honorary title of K.C.l.E. was at the same time conferred upon him.CHAPTER X. Proposed British action consequent on Tarkish aggression. The incidents of political aggression at Zakhmmiyeh and Mohammernli, narrated in the previous chapter, coupled with the repeated instances of the arbitrary and vexatious treatment of British subjects in Asiatic Turkey and tue v general hostility of the local Ottoman officials, caused ilis Majesty's Govern ment to instruct (17th October 1910) the Ambassador at Constantinople Extenmi b, December lyio, No*. 158-178. to a representation to the Porte regarding the acts 01 aggression of the Turkish authorities in the Persian Gulf. The Ambassador reported an intense a//^-British feeling to exist in Constantinople, and it. was decided to defer making representations for the present. The India Olfice expressed rearet that from the point of view of Indian interests the representations, were withheld, and deprecated piecemeal representations as not likely to have the Secret E., January 1911, 485-542. desiled effect Oil the Turkish (JoVem- ment. Hie question of a naval demon stration in the Persian Gulf, pending a comprehensive settlement, was next considered. Mr, Marling suggested in November the despatch of the 'Redbreast' to Zakhnuniyeh to ascertain if there were any gendarmes there and if the Turkish fl ig was still at the bottom of the mast as had heen reported. He considered the appearance of the ship would create an impression on the local Arabs up to Basrah and Baghdad and reassure the British Indian population in those parts. The London Foreign Office favoured the proposal, but the Secretary of State for India, while preferring a comprehensive settlement of our differences ^ with Turkey, assented to the proposed visit of a ship, but did not think that ^ the mere visit of a gunboat would restore British prestige in any appreciable measure, and suggested that, if tiiis result was thought necessary, the gunboat should remove any Turkish soldiers or flags that might be found on the island or that she should at least be accompanied by such other ships as could be spared from the arras traffic blockade, and should cruise to the head of the Persian Gulf and remain as long as possible in that neighbourhood. His Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs agreed to the action proposed which'was communicated to the Admiralty. I he latter, while intimating that the '• Redbreast-' was being refitted at Bombay and that the approaches to Zakhnuniyeh island were unsurveyed and repo'ted to be full of dangerous &gt; shoals, expressed their willingness to direct the Naval Commander-in-Chief to send a vessel to the island, provided that the Secretary of State for Eoreio- n Affairs considered the matter to be of sufficient importance to justifv the withdrawal of a vessel from the blockade and the navigational risks which would be incurred. At the same time they pointed out that the island was reported to be deserted, and there seemed no advantasre in sending a 'unboat there, and suggested as preferable that the # Naval Commander-in-Chief, who was then in the Gulf, should be informed of the objects it was desired to attain and that the action to be t^ken should be left to his discretion. On the 22nd December, the Secretary of State addressed an enquiry to the Government of India as to what local action the latter suggested in connection with the pro posed visit to Zakhnuniyeh island and a naval demonstration at the head of the Gulf. Colonel Cox, who was asked to give his views, telegraphed on the 25th December that he had consulted His Excellency the Naval Commander-in- Chief, and the latter informed him that, when called upon, he would be in a position to send two ships to do what was necessary, subject to the exigencies of the arms traffic blockade, and provided that, a passage could be^ found through unsurveyed approaches to the island. He would propose then to visit f all the ports where the Turks have pretensions and would conclude with the55 Shat-el-Aral) wliorp lie would take tliroe or four ships. ITis Exoollpuoy con- templated cnrrying out the above programme at the end of March or b Q g , in- ring of April 1911. This was reported to the Secretary of State on the 28th December, with the support of the Government of India. The whole question, including recent piracies in the Shat-el-Arab on a Kuwait boat, the perpetrators of which had escaped into Turkish territory and whose surrender was unobtainable, was considered by the Secretary of State, and, in the India Office letter, dated the 30th December, he observed that the possible presence of a few Turkish soldiers on Zakhnuniveh island was not in itself of such consequence as to justify the running of any risk, particularly the risk of the less of prestige that would ensue, if, for example, one of His Majesty's ships ran aground in the enterprise, but on the other hand if the piracy and Zakhnuniyeh episodes are taken not by themselves, but as part of the whole policy of the Turkish Government, which is so da magi rig to British interests and prestige, it warrants the strongest possible measures on the part of His Majesty's Government. He suggested in this connection and with reference to the wider question raised by Colonel Cox {iride page 11) that the time had now come when it was not only desirable but necesrary for His Majesty's Government to explain clearly and comprehensively to the Forte what their interests in the region of the Persian Gulf were and what was the policy that they deliberately intended pursuing, and if possible to come to some such general settlement as was advocated by Colonel Cox and the Government of India. His Lordship thought that Great Britain was at present incurring all the odium, without derivinir any benefit, of an active policy at the head of the Gulf, and that in t ! ese circumstances no harm could, and some good might, be done by entering into an explanation as suggested above. It this explana tion was received in a friendly spirit and with a manifest desire to arrive at an accommodation, which His Lordship thought unlikely, the object of His Majesty's Government would so far have been achieved. If not, it would probably be necessary to strengthen the naval squadron in the Gulf, and, by summarily removing all signs of Turkish authority from places where we do not admit their rights and by affording the Shaikhs of Kuwait and Mohammerah material as well as moral support in their disputes with the Turkish Govern ment, to convince the latter that we w r ere in earnest. But if on general grounds this course was not practicable—the two cases immediately in ques tion not being woHi pursuing separately—he could only suggest, although he would favour a cruise such as the Naval Commander-in-Chief proposed, short of the proposed visit to Zakhnuniyeh island, that His Majesty's Govern ment should wait until a stronger case arose, such as the arrival of Mudirs at 'Wakra, &amp;c., and then take the necessary action locally, viz. % the removal of the Mudirs from their posts. In January the Poreiirn OfTice held, however, that it was unlikely that in. its present disposition the Turkish Government would approach a settlement in a reasonable spirit and as His Majesty's Government would have difficulty in finding a quid pro quo, the Turks would not make the concessions proposed by Colonel Cox in his telegram* of the Fide page 2nd November 1910. In view of the certainty of failure of negotiations, and of the serious steps which His Majesty 's Government might consequently be forced to take, the Foreign Office deprecated discussion with the Turkish Government regarding Persian Gulf affairs unless the Turks themselves opened it. The best moment for such ne ^otatior.s would come when the urkish Government next sought the assent of His Majesty's Government to the 4 per cent increase of customs duties. It would then be necessary to + Vide pag-a 38-46. discuss the quesiiou of Kuwaitf in connection with the Baghdad Railway, and by usinz the customs increase as a lever, it might be possible to obtain a satisfactory an-angement about Kuwait] including other Persian Gulf questhns. His Majesty's Government could withholdtheir consent to the increase of customs duties until these points had been secured, and if a breach w r itli Turkev must come, it would be better that it should come on this ground rather'than on the grounds of the proposed negotiations in regard to Persian56 Gulf questions only. As to removing by force signs of Turkish authority from places where their rights were not admitted, it muit be considered how the Turks could be prevented from replacing them once they had been removed. There would be no difficulty in the case of an island, but it would be useless expelling a small Turkish force on the mainland from a place wliicli the Turks could re-occupy with a larger force subsequently. Such action might lead to a situation of which the only solution would be a war with Turkey, and the question should be considered as to what should be done in such a case, and what complications in Egypt or India might be involved thereby. In any case it would not be safe to press matters so far, until the naval and military authorities were known to be agreed upon some plan of campaign and prepared to carry it out in the last resort. For these reasons His Majesty's Foreign Office, while appreciating the inconvenience of the present unsettled and undefined state of affairs, considered that, unle3s extreme provocation was forthcoming, it would be better to wait the renewal this year by the Turks of their request for the increase of customs dues, and then to open the question ot* all the points in dispute, and to endeavour to secure a reasonable settlement. The India Office recognised that circumstances were not so favourable now for approaching the Turkish Govern ment as in October last, when His Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople was instructed to make a communication to the Porte {vide page 54), and agreed to the postponement of the proposed communication to Turkey, assuming that the latter would at no very distant date approach His Majesty's Govern ment on the question of the proposed increase of the customs duties, but they strongly urged, in view of the present situation, that the question of the action to be taken in certain eventualities, both generally and locally in the Persian Gulf, should at the earliest possible date be considered and decided, either in the Committee of Imperial Defence or otherwise, in order that the Government of India may know what, if anything, was expected of them, and also that the diplomacy of His Majesty's Government may not be hindered when a decisive opportunity is offered. Subsequently in April* 1911 the London Foreign Office referred the • Vide Appenoix in. question of Turkish aggression in the Persian Gulf to the Committee of Imperial Defence with the remark that, except with regard to Kuwait and OJeid, Turkish aggression threatened places of little intrinsic importance, but taken cumulatively and in connection with questions arising in neighbouring parts of the Empire their action might have considerable importance and that it was desirable to consider what local action in the Persian Gulf His Majesty's Government had best take if need arises. Simultaneously with the consideration of the question noted in the preceding paragraph, negotiations are proceeding (May 1911) with Turkey for the adjustment of issues in dispute between the two Governments.CHAPTEK XI. Pearl fisheries. From the general obligation undertaken by the Britisli Government to maintain the maritime peace, flows the obligation to protect the exclusive interests and rights of the tribes in the pearl fisheries, which have attracted European and Turkish attention. In 1904, the matter was laid before the Secretary of State, who consulted the Law Officers of the Crown. The views of the Government of India, and the secret e. ( april 1904, Nos. 237-246. degree to which the Law Officers and the Secret e . May 1905, Nog. 528-530. Secretary of State concurred, are shown in Mr. Somers Cock's summary below. No. 216 in Secret e ., April 1904, Nos. 237-246. The Government of India held— 1. ' That the tribes, British and Turkish alike, have in common an exclu sive right of pearl-fishing within territorial waters. The law officers agree unreservedly. 2. ' That they have a common exclusive right to such banks as can be proved historically to have always been fished in practice by them alone. The Law Officers agree unreservedly, but their view is interpreted by the Secretary of State as not being a decided one. 3. (a) ' That these historic proofs exist in the present case ; {h) tha non- , . x . . tribal fishermen may be forcibly removed. • Annexure to enclosure 5 in Secretary of State's mi ^ , . . J , x Secret despatch, No. 8, dated the 31st May 1905. 1116 iaW OttlCerS* are UOt Certain as to («) but think there are grounds for agreeing. As to (6), they think it might be necessary to authorise such removal, but deprecatef this being done except in the tExcept m temtonal waters. ^ 4. ' Doubt was expressed by the Government of India whether anything could be done to keep out non-tribal fishermen from non-territorial waters apart from banks, but it was suggested that fishing by them might in practice be prevented by the tribes refusing supplies, &amp;c. The law officers agree. 6. ' I'he Government of India held that the enforcement of the measures indicated above might be undertaken by His Majesty's Government on behalf of the tribes. The law officers concur. 6. ' The law officers and the India Office deprecate raising the question of the banks and of the deep-sea non-territorial waters internationally by forcible action. On that point no direct reference was made to the Secretarv of State 7. This question of pearl fisheries has not been considered since 1905 until quite recently when it has again come to the fore, owing to Messrs. Rosenthal Freres of Paris, who have been purchasing pearls for the last five years in Bahrain, at considerable profit, endeavouring to obtain a concession to enable them to undertake the fishing. In this connection Colonel Cox has suggested (April 1911) the conclusion of secret agreements with the local Chiefs prohibiting them from granting pearling concessions. The Government of India considered such agreements unnecessary, and authorised the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, after consulting the Secretary of State, to warn the Chiefs how greatly the granting of concessions to foreigners would be opposed to their own interests. The Chiefs were also to be warned against entering into any such transactions, and the Resident was instructed to obtain assurances in writing from them that they will not do so. His attention was also invited to the distinction drawn by the Law Officers between territorial and deeper waters.APPENDIX 1. Draft of a proposed letter referred to on page 51. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—M ajor P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1 am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 331 of IGtb July and your telegram of 2nd August, on the subject of Bahrain affairs. 2. I am to convey to you the satisfaction of the Government of India at the surrender of Shaikh All. it is hoped that this event will remove a disturbing factor from the counsels of Shaikh Esa. 3. As regards the question of our future relations with Bahrain, you submit certain proposals by Captain Pridcaux, which may be summarised as follows:— («) That it would be better that, until the Political Agent has acquired adequate influence over the Shaikh, no steps whatever should be taken to press on Shaikh Esa the proposals recommended originally in your letter No. 123 f Confidential) of 11th JVlarch last and referred to in this Department letter No. 1873 E.-B. of 17th May. f^) That the Political Agent should be authorised to intervene with direct instructions to the Chief in the following matters, namely,— {i) the oppression exercised by the A1 Khalifa family, the Magisterial and Llevenue officials, and the Kazis; (n) the extravagant entertainment of Bedouins; {in) reform of land revenue administration ; {in) legal disputes between the Shaikh and his subjects. Captain Prideaux appears to hopo that, by consistently adopting this policy, the Political Agent will gradually be furnished with a status in the island independent of the Shaikh ; that the Shaikh will thus be cowed into an attitude ol general amenability to reasonable suggestions; and that the termi nation of the present system of exactions will result in so much loss of revenue to the Shaikh that he will, in his own interest, desire the reform of his customs. 4. 1 ou concur in the advisability of adopting Captain Prideaux's first suggestion ; but before submitting any definite opinion on his other proposals, you invite a pronouncement ot the Government of India on the proposition that there is no middle course between the two policies of treating Bahrain (1) as a full British Protectorate; (2) as an independent principality. It is clear to the Government of India that such a middle course does exi«t; but before replying to your enquiry, 1 am to point out, with reference to your interpretation ol a full British Protectorate as involving the right to intervene in the internal administration of Bahrain to the extent contemplated by Captain Prideaux, that there is no authority for the supposition that Great Britain would necessarily possess such a right, even were she formally to notify a Brit'sh Protectorate over Bahrain to Foreign Powers. This mis conception is due to the assumption,jw^ich has been made, that the alternative to regarding the Shaikh of Bahrain as an independent Sovereign is to treat him like a petty Indian Raja. The analogy here introduced, although not without its uses as indicating the methods which, in the light of Indian experience, may successfully be employed in dealing with the Chief, must be regarded as misleading in several important respects. For, even assuming that the measure oi interference ^advocated by the Political Agent would be legitimate in an Indian Native k5t:ite (a proposition which needs some reservations in the instance of such Chieis as enjoy a full measure of internal autonomv), it must be borne in mind that in the case of Native States in India, the British Power is the sovereign, and not merely the Protecting Power, and tiiat, in the same degree as they have lost the majority of the attributes of sovereignty as well as of independence, reciprocal rights and obligations have been created between them and the Government of India, which as yet have no exact counterpart in the relations of Great Britain to Bahrain.5. The exact interpretation of a Protectorate is a general question of international law into which the Government of India see no necessity to enter on the present occasion. But, as regards the case of Bahrain, the facts appear to them to be sufficient to establish the following conclusions. They are of opinion that Great Britain is the Protectins: Power of Bahrain, and that Bahrain is, therefore, in the present state of affairs, under the Protectorate of Great Britain in the following sense :— (?') The British Government, and they alone, as distinct from Turkey, Persia, or any other Power, control the foreign relations of Bahrain. The Shaikh has bound himself not to enter into relations with any other Power. The British Government therefore undertake the protection of foreigners in Bahrain. {ii) The reciprocal aspect of this obligation is that Great Britain is bound to protect the island from any external aggression or assault. (Hi) Prom these circumstances it results that British influence and autho rity are and must be in the ascendant in Bahrain. Primarily this influence is political both in character and origin : and it gives Great Britain the right to claim that, in any matter to which she attaches high importance, her advice must be followed. The acceptance of British advice in such circumstances is the return paid by the State for the advantages which British protection confers. British rights in this respect were explicitly stated in the recent ultimatum which was presented by you to the Shaikh on the 24th February ]905 in com pliance with instructions. Further, if British advice must he accepted, it follows that action in contravention of it, whether it takes the form of vacil lation, of bad faith, or of open contumacy, cannot be tolerated, the Protecting Power being the judge of the manner in which it will prohibit, reprimand, or punish such action. {iv) The British paramountcy in Bahrain is commercial as well as political in character. This follows partly as a consequence of political predominance, but still more, in the case of Bahrain, from the undisputed commercial predomi nance of Great Britain in the islands and ports of the Persian Gulf. («) The political position of Great Britain in Bahrain has given her not merely an interest, but a recognised right of interference in the succession. It was at the instance of the Shaikh himself that she recognised his eldi st son. She holds herself at liberty to withdraw that recognition whenever—for pood reasons—she may think it desirable, and to nominate another successor in his place The exercise of this right is of course inconsistent with independent sovereignty ; and it may be said to involve in a sense direct interference with the internal affairs of the State. It is understood that no such right is claimed in the case of any of the Trucial States on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and its frank admission by the Chief of Bahrain is the most explicit evidence yet supplied of the dimensions which the Protectorate has already assumed. (m) The case of the customs may be brought within the prerogative of the Protecting Power, under more than one of the above-named heads, according to the point of view from which it is regarded. Originally the appointment of a British Customs officer was advocated by British Eesidents in the Gulf as a mark of British authority. Then it was recommended in the interests of the Shaikh ana the equilibrium of his tinances. Finally, it was urged in the interests of Shaikh Hamed, his son, whose future position our recognition of his claims to the succession required us to safeguard. Whichever of these views be adopted, the insistence of Great Britain upon the measure may be regarded as an illustration of the advice which, in virtue of her general controlling authority, she deems it necessary to give, and which the Shaikh is not at liberty permanently to disregard. 6. The above are, in the opinion of the Government of India, approxi mately the limits of our Protectorate, so far as it has as yet been developed. It follows from th'.s that for none of the claims put forward by the Political Agent is there any justitication, and that he should not attempt to apply inter ference or pressure in the various forms which ho suggests with a view to forc ing the Shaikh to adopt premature relorms, but that he should devote himself to the business of acquiring the confidence of the ruler. Instructions in this sense60 should be given to Captain Prideaux, with a view to his building up a position which will enable him to tender advice for the gradual amelioration of the internal administration. The one point upon which the Government of India are compelled at the present stage to offer authoritative advice is that of customs reform, which, after the previous declarations made to Shaikh Esa on the subject, is not a matter which can be allowed to rest until the Chief chooses to take action. On this matter they are prepared to await your advice as to the manner in which, and the moment when, a communication should be made to Shaikh Esa, and it will be for you to consider whether the best course would not be to have a frank explanation with the Chief, and to let him know that his dependence upon the British Government is not consist ent with the permanent disregard of the advice so frequently tendered to him in this matter; advice which, when thus seriously repeated, must be regarded as possessing the authoritative character referred to in the ultimatum presented to him in February last.APPENDIX II. Datod India Office, London, the 7th (received 23rd) April 1911 (Secret). From—F. A. Hirtzel , Esq., C.B., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London, To —The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel Sir A. H. McMahon , K .C .I E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I enclose, for the Viceroy's information, memorandum of the termfl which it is now pro posed to put to the Turks for a settlement of Baghdad Railway and the Gulf (c) will perhaps be amended thus: 'the number of members on the Board [i.e., of the new Company] shall be in proportion to the amount of tne British capital and the Chairman shall in alteruate years be British The question of a British director on the Baghdad Railway itself will perhaps be taken up with the Germans. (r) Kuwaitis abroad. This will probably be held in reserve. (0 Foreign Office mean to get the Turks out of El Bidaa. We have suggested that the door should be left open to us to conclude agreements with the Katr people, if necessary. {u) Probably the words and to consult together if the status quo is threatened by another Power ^ will be added, or (perhaps) a stronger formula. (a 1 ) A reference to the Shat-el-Arab will be inserted, but whether it will be possible to require the Turks to let us restore our buoys which they have replaced is doubtful. 'We have suggested to Foreifrn Office that something should, if possible, be put in that would prevent a Turkish or German monopoly of navigation between Baghdad and the Gulf and would make a freight war impossible. These terms being less unfavourable to us than those mentioned in Secretary of State's private telegram of 31st March, he did not think it necessary to telegiaph a&lt;rain to the Viceroy. By the time you get this it may all be ancient history, but the Viceroy will no doubt telegraph if he wishes to comment. His private telegram of 6th April has gone to Foreign Office. Foreign Office to India Office. Foreign Office, 3rd April 1911, I send you, by Sir E. Grey's desire, a copy of a memorandum, prepared after our conference of 30th March, setting forth the conditions on which His Majesty's Government might agree to the increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent to 16 per cent for a limited period. Sir E. Grey feels that whether the terminus is at Kuwait or at Basrah it would be inexpedient for His Majesty's Government to agree to the customs increase unless the status of Kuwait had first been agreed upon by us and the Turks. If we are sure of maintaining British control at Kuwait, then 'prima, facie it would seem advantageous that the terminus should be there : and, if such control is to be secured, there are serious drawbacks to admitting German participation, as it would involve the presence of German officials at Kuwait and would give Germany a voice in the concerns of the Gulf. The port would, however, be administered in the interests of the railway and of international trade. If we cannot secure control at Kuwait, then we must reconsider our attitude towards British participation in the railway with its terminus at Basrah : but, in any case, as stated above, we could not assent to the customs increase, or favour such participation, unless the status of Kuwait had first been regularised. There is an article by Lovat Fraser in the April number of the ' National Review ' contending that it is to our interest on strategic grounds, that the terminus should be at Basrah and not at Kuwait. Sir E. Grey is inclined to think that if we had real control at Kuwait we could prevent the establishment of a naval arsenal there if it should ever be attempted, and that we could, in any case, render su«h an arsenal useless by barring the entrance to the Gulf (see report by the Inter-Departmental Committee which sat here in the autumn of 1907): but he proposes to consult the Admiralty and the War Office on the point. With regard to the collection of customs at Kuwait, Sir E. Grey would be glad to learn the views of the India Office. Louis M allet.62 MEMORANDUM. At the meetino' which took place this TnarniDg- it was decided that the reply to the Turkish proposals should be drafted on the following- lines : — The assent of His Majesty's Government to the customs increase shall be gfiven for a fxed period subject to the following conditions ;— (a) The assent of all other Powers, and especially France and Russia, must be secured to the increase.

Alwyn ^ (w) (*)63 I pat up a letter from Mr. Hirtzel and its enclosures for Your Excellency's information as desired by him. J It might perhaps have been better if the India Office had telegraphed the terms of the proposed agreement, but as we have not yet heard of its completion there may be yet time to send home any comments that Your Excellency may think necessary. The aoreement is curiously and satisfactorily in accord with the terms proposed in Your Ofe ^ 8 priVate tele &amp; rarn of tlie 6th A P riI J which bad not then yet reached the Foreign Taking the articles seriatim the following only seem to call for remark—the remainder appear eminently satisfactory :— (4) The reason for restricting the remainder of the capital to Germany or Turco- Germany is not quite obvious. (t) Our proposal was ' we should retain in our hands the policing of the port.' If the Shaikh employs British Agents, the result is perhaps the same: but why leave it open to doubt. 0 ) We s aid ' no troops other than those of the Shaikh and ourselves to be located and no fortifications to be built at Kuwait without our consent '. We might suggest addition of words 'nor shall troops other than those of the Shaikh or Great Britain be located there without their consent. [1) and frc) 'We proposed 'ourselves and Shaikh jointly to administer the port customs subject, in the case of transit duties, to scrutiny by Turkish representative and to repayment/' It might be laid down in both [I) and [n) that we and Shaikh jointly administer the customs and transit duties. (o) We should couple with this our proposal that ' except where subjects of the Shaikh are alone concerned civil and criminal jurisdiction of the port should rest with British officials'. (#) Is there any necessity for this self-denying ordinance ? In as far as it affects the 1 ersian side of the Gulf it would appear to be beyond the scope of an Anglo- Turkish Agreement. 1 presume that we could hereafter claim that the Musandim peninsula and Kishm an ^ Ilormuz Islands are outside the Gulf, but if this supposition is incorrect this injunction may some day be very harmful to us. {x) Is carelessly drafted. It can read—' There shall be no interference by British Agency with existing buoys and beacons, or with the erection of beacons, fixed lights, &amp;c. It should read—' There shall be no interference with existing British buoys or with, &amp;c , by British agency To this article it seems important also to add to words on the coasts of the Gulf' the words ' or the approaches to the Shat-el-Arab.' (j/) It is important to add to this the ' Shat-el-Arab.' The article should read 'The Persian Gulf and Shat-el-Arab shall be open to the navigation of all countries.' This, I presume, would obviate pilotage and other restrictions. The agreement would appear to be a highly satisfactory one, but I venture to think that its terms should, as suggested above, be made clearer in the matter of the agency for the policing, customs, the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the port, and the non-location of foreio-n troops. Also that we should not debar ourselves from future action in the Musandim peninsula and islands opposite, if these can be claimed to be within the Gulf. A. H. M c M ahon ,—26-4.-11.

Should it not be—'There shall be no inter ference with existing British buoys or with, &amp;c , by British agency ?' It seems also important to add after the words 'coasts of the Gulf'' the following sentence—' or the approaches of the Shat-el-Arab' Paragraph fy) should read—' The Persian Gulf and Shat-el-Arab shall be open to the navigation of all countries/' This is a counsel of perfection, but to obtain these points, if possible, would, I think, be wise.APPENDIX III.

Foreign Office, 6th March 1911. Memorandum concerning Turkish aggression in the Persian Gulp. 1. Kuwaif.— lhz only act of aggression taken by the Turks as regards Kuwait is in con nection with the Shaikh's Fedhagia property. This is a large estate on the Shat-el-Arab purchased by the Shaikh about two years ago for JST^OOO. On previous occasions when the Shaikh has bought land in Turkey he has had no difficulty in registering the transactions in the local land office. In the present case the office has refused registration unless the Shaikh enters himself as an Ottoman subject. This, acting on the advice of the British Agent at Kuwait, he has hitherto declined to do. There is, however, a constant possibility that Turkish aggression on Kuwait might take a more direct form than this. Um Kasr Fort, at the head of Khor Abdullah, has been occupied by a detachment of Turkish soldiers, but it cannot be said with confidence that Um Kasr should really be regarded as within the ill-defined limits of the Shaikh's territories. There has also been a small post on Warba and Bubiyan islands, which are considered as being undoubted!v Kuwait territory. But if the Turks really wished to encroach on Kuwait they would probably have very little difficulty in finding a plausible pretext. The embroilments which the Shaikh occasionally has with neighbouring tribes, such as that with tLe Muntafik Arabs in 191U, might furnish the Turks with specious grounds for active interveutiun; and with the levelling tendencies which the present regime has displayed in various parts of the Empire, it can hardly be doubted that the Turks would welcome a pretext for action if other conditions were favourable to them. In such an eventuality we might fiud Turkish soldiers at Kuwait itself. 2. Zakhnuniyeh. —This is a small sandy island about ten miles south-east of Ujair (the southernmost point to which His Majesty's Government regard Turkish sovereignty as extending) and close to the mainland. It has been occupied by Turkish soldiers or gendarmes in 19U9 and 19iU. On each occasion the Porte has been informed that the island is claimed by the Shaikh of Bahrain, by whose subjects it has been used for fishiug purposes, and that t&amp;e presence of the Turkish flag constitutes an infringement of the atatas quo. On each occasion, in one manner or another, the island has been evacuated.66 3. El Odeid, Wnkra, Zohara and HI Bidaa, —These places are all situated on tKe coast of the Katr Peninsula, and are therefore re^irded by His Majesty's Government as bein^ outside Turkish jurisdiction. At El Ridaa, however, the Turks have had a small military post since 1H7*2, and thouorh His Majesty's Government have tolerated its existence for many years, they have never actually acquiesced in it. To the other three places the Turkish authorities, at one time or other during the past few years, have appointed Mudirs, but the officials have seldom proceeded to their posts. In 1895 His Majesty's Government forcibly dispersed a settlement of Bahrain malcontents, who had settled at Zobara under the Turkish flag. In 1903 and 1904 there was an attempt to appoint a Mudir to Wakra, and a British warship was sent to prevent his landingr. In 1910 the Vali of Basrah appointed a Mudir to El Odeid, but so far as is known he has not attempted to proceed thither. Except with regard to Kuwait and El Odeid which is in the territory of the Tracial Chiefs, Turkish aggression threatens places of little intrinsic importance. But taken cumulatively and in connection with questions arising in neighbouring parts of the Empire their action might hive considerable importance, and His Majesty's Government might be forced to take local retaliatory measures. It is not possible to say beforehand what 'acts of aggression would call for such measures, as this would largely depend on the circumstances of the moment.^ But it is desirable now to consider what form local action in the Persian Gulf by His Majesty's Government had best take, what measures would be required of the Indian and Imperial naval and military forces, and what effect such action would be likely to have on Great Britain s position in Egypt and India, and on her prestige in other Muhammadan countries. I have submitted to the Secretary of State your letter of 11th instant enclosing copy of Sir A. Nicolson's memorandum to the Committee of Imperial Defence regardino- Turkish aggression in the Persian Gulf. In bir R. Ritchie s letter of Gth April it was stated that in Lord Morley's opinion 'it is urgently necessary that His Majesty's Government should be in possession of the views of the naval and military authorities with the least possible delay', and Lord Crewe had expressed a similar opinion as long ago as 26th January. Lord Morley cannot but regret that no more expeditious way has been found of dealing with the situation than a request that the Defence Committee may consider it ' early next month ', and he ventures to hope that in the meantime the views of the naval and military authorities may be communicated to Foreio-U' Oilice and India Office, quite independently of the Defence Committee, so that we may^at least know how we stand and be ready for any emergency that may arise during the slumber of the Committee.

Persian Gulf Precis, Part II. The previous precis relating to the Baghdad Railway question and the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the Persian Gulf summa rised the correspondence up to April 1911. The proposals which it was then decided to ask the Turkish Government to accept are ^iven in detail in Mr. Parker's memorandum* of 30th March 1911. Briefly the most important of these were—(a) construction of the Baghdad Gulf section of the railway to be undertaken by a company nominally Turkish, but in fact half German, half British, British participation being 50^ ; (6) terminus to be Kuwait; (c) Turkish suzerainty over Kuwait to be recognised, but Shaikh's autonomy guaranteed; (d) adjustment of all Turkish claims in the Gulf to form part of the settlement. The Government of India expressed general approval of these proposals. In doing so they urged that the strength of our position at Kuwait and in the Gulf should be steadily kept in view when dealing with the adjustment of all Turkish claims in the Gulf, so that no opening should be allowed for Turkey or any other Power to encroach on its shores,^that complete autonomy should be claimed for the Shaikh with whom we should share the absolute control of the harbour and port ashore and afloat: that the pilotage and buoyage of the Gulf and the Shatt-el-Arab should be in British hands; that none but British and local troops should be stationed at Kuwait which was not to be fortified except with British consent and that the duration of the enhanced Turkish customs should be contingent on the non-infringement of British rights in the (iulf and on the absence of preferential rates on the Baghdad and branch railway lines. 2. Up to this point the policy of His Majesty's Government had been based on the assumption that Kuwait was Cbange of policy. the only port where it was possible for the railway to debouch and that, consequently, the line could find no exit on the Gulf except at a port under British control. A survey of the Shatt-el-Arab, however, disclosed the fact that a deep channel existed into the river which could without difficulty be made navigable by any ships which could reach and use the harbour at Kuwait. The Government of India were the first to recognize that the position was thus entirely changed. Kuwait lost at once much of its importance as a bargaining factor and the chances of Basrah being eventually chosen as the terminal port for thrt railway greatly increased. Moreover, during 1911 various incidents indicated that the Germans and Turks were alive to the possibilities of the situation. The latter demanded the removal of British buoys and marks, asserting that Turkey alone is responsible for the navigation of the river where, for over fifty years, the work of surveying and lighting had been carried out by British Agency to the general satisfaction of all concerned. The impression prevailed ^that the Turks intended shortly to levy _ dues on steamers. The obvious intention was to challenge the British position and eliminate Persian co-operation by appeal to the treaty of Erzeroum and the explanatory note under which Turkey claims to control the entire river while guaranteeing free access to Mohammerah. From a British point of view the outlook was serious for 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping was British owned. It was obviously imperative to take steps at once to safeguard British interests and rights in the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. llis Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed to the Secretary of State, on the 8th June 1911, pointing out that it would be a mistake to continue to press for Kuwait as the terminus of the railway, for the Basrah -Kuwait section would never pay but fall into disuse as Basrah developed. His Excellency urged that '* in the event of Basrah becoming the terminus, our policy should be to endeavour to obtain • Persiau Gulf Precas, July 1911, page 62,tis larsje a participation as possible in the building and control of the Baghdad- Easrah section and the construction of the port at Basrah ; as large a share as possible in the control of the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, as representing the riparian interests of Persia and the predominant and independent position to which our prevailing share of tonnage and trade and our long-established position on the river give us a claim; the maintenance at all costs of the status quo at Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf; and the construction of a railway from Mohammerah or Ahwaz to Khoremabad and the north of Persia as rapidly as possible.' This telegram formed the starting point of an entirely new policy leading to the satisfactory results detailed in the succeeding paragraphs. The necessity of this change of policy was further emphasised by the conclusion of a Convention between the Ottoman Government and the Anatolian Railway Company (German Government) whereby the latter agreed to relinquish its concession between Baghdad and the Gulf, provided it received in a new company to be formed, a share not less than that of any other non- Turkish Power, and subject to a claim to be indemnified for loss arising oat of construction expenses guaranteed on that section. As the Turkish Government was not likely to consent to reduce her share in such a company below 40 ppr cent., it was clear that, unless France were to be practically excluded, it would be impossible for Great Britain to obtain more than 25 per cent. His Majesty's Government, accordingly, decided to re-examine the position on the assumption that Basrah would be the terminal port. 3. In July, the proposals were entirely recast on the following basis :— Revised pronosiiis W An International Company to be '1 formed, for the Baghdad-Basrah section comprising Turkey, Germany, France, Bussia and England, each with 20 per cent. (2) The terminus to be at Basrah, but in the event of the railway being ever extended to the Gulf, it must be brought to Kuwait under conditions to be settled between ourselves and Turkey. (3) A Turco- British Kiverain Commission consisting of two members with engineer to be mutually agreed upon, to superintend navigation and surveys of the Shatt-el- Arab. (4) Kuwait to be recognised as an enclave within and forming part of the Turkish Empire with ownership of Bubiyan and Warba. Turkish inter ference with the internal administration of Kuwait to be excluded. (5) Turkey to renounce definitely claims to Bahrain, the adjacent islands and the Katar peninsula. His Excellency the Viceroy, while agreeing generally that these proposals constituted a great advance on those hitherto made, considered that acceptance of the first involved a large surrender of our privileged position and former demands, and should be accepted only if the rest were granted in full. He suggested that the opportunity should be taken to recommend recognition by Turkey of British right to police, and conduct quarantine arrangements in, the Gulf, to the lighting, buoyage and pilotage of the waters outside the jurisdiction of the Biverain Commission and to the recognition by Turkey of the adminis trative frontier of Persia west of Mohammerah which still remained in dispute. 4. Excluding the last-mentioned recommendation, a detailed memorandum EritiBb memotandum of 29Lh July 1911—Katar, OU the above basis Was presented to the Porte on the 29th July 1911. This memo- randum remained unanswered till the 15th April 1912. Early in that year, however, informal discussions commenced with the Porte. The Turks anxious to consolidate their position in Katar pleaded the extreme difficulty of recon ciling parliamentary opinion to the abandonment of territory which had never been renounced. The Secretary of State was disposed to admit the force of the Turkish contention and enquired the views of the Government of India. His Excellency the Viceroy strongly opposed any concession and urged that it would be disastrous by specific recognition of Turkish suzerainty in Katar to allow the Turks to get a foothold in the Gulf for the first time and thus con solidate their position both in the hinterland from the limits of Kuwait down to Odeid, and on the coast.5. Ultimately the Porte replied to the British memorandum on the 15th April 1912. The British proposals and the Porte's reply, which was wholly unsatisfactory except as regards Bahrain, are compared below : British Memorandum, dated 29th Forte's reply, dated 15th April 1912. July 1911, I—Baghdad Railway. (а) Division of share capital in the Baghdad-Basrah section. Distribution should be 20 per cent, each to Turkey, Prance, Germany, England and Russia. (б) Proposed international con- veuiion providing for the exclusion of differential rates on any railways in Asiatic Turkey; for the align ment of the railway south of Baghdad, and the conditions under which it is to be constructed ; and for guarantee ing that the interest in the enterprise of the several parties concerned shall be of lasting duration and not subject to termination on the expiry of the Baghdad Railway Company's conces sion. Practical rejection. Distribution to be 25 % each to Turkey, Prance, Germany and Great Britain to the exclusion of Russia. (5) No specific mention is made in the Porte's reply of the international convention. As to the exclusion of differential treatment, the Porte declares itself ready to assure to British Commerce all facilities compatible with the agreements already concluded by it with the Baghdad Railway Com pany.* As to alignment and financial arrangements, Turkey is ready to meet wishes of His Majesty's Government subject to arrangement of details. As to period, the Turkish Government are not prepared to agree to the arrange ment to be arrived at for the Baghdad- Basrah section being of lasting duration instead of subject to termination on expiry of the Baghdad Railway conces sion. (c) Pecuniary indemnity to be (c) The charge must be borne by the paid to the Baghdad Railway Com- proposed new company for the railway pany in respect of its renunciation of south of Baghdad, the right to construct the section of the railway between Baghdad and the Persian Gulf. (d) Prolongation of the railway from Basrah to the Persian Gulf. His Majesty's Government proposed Basrah as terminus, and, if prolonged to Kuwait it must be by arrange ment and that a clause to this effect be inserted now in the Convention. (e) Proposed construction and con trol of the port at Basrah by the new railway company in the interests of the unrestricted commerce of all nations. {d) Basrah agreed to as terminus. No present cause contemplated for a continuation of railway beyond Basrah. Turkey prepared to give all necessary assurances to remove doubt concerning conditions of continuation in question. (&lt;?) Point as to construction and control of the terminal port at Basrah ignored in reply. II—P olitical and Territorial Questions. (a) Turkey to have no claims south of Ojeir in the district of El Katif. • This limitation referred mainly to the Cahxer det charges or specification attached to the Baghdad Railway Courentiou of 1^03.4 Bntish Memorandum, dated 29tli July 1911. (5) Turkey must therefore re nounce all claim to the whole penin sula of Katar including El Bida. (c) Definite renunciation of Turkish claims to Bahrain and adja cent islands. (d) Kuwait. Complete autonomy but recogni tion of Turkish suzerainty. Recog nition by the Porte of validity of certain agreements between Great Britain and Kuwait, inclusion of Warba and Bubiyan within Kuwait limits and withdrawal of Turkish military posts. (e) Riverain commission for Shatt- el-Arab. Turco-British Commission. Porte's reply, dated loth April 1912. (a) &amp; {h) Absolute claim to Katar. (c) Admits British claim to Bahrain subject to condition as to Consular protection. (d) Forte evades a direct answer, but claims Kuwait as part of the Ottoman Empire more or less conditionally. (e) Ottoman Commission with British Engineer on it in the service of Turkish Government, object being to avoid appearance of internationalisa- tion. (/) Porte desires to undertake pilotage, &amp;c., in Turkish waters and is silent as to the Gulf. (g) Claim with Great Britain to joint policing of the Gulf. (/) Pilotage, &amp;c., in Gulf. Turkish recognition of British right to control, surveying, lighting, buoyage, pilotage and quarantine. fer) Policing of the Gulf. Turkey to recognise British right to police waters of Gulf. 6. The effect of the Turkish counter-proposal to distribute the capital I. Baghdad Railway. Alternative proposals in the Baghdad-Basrah SCCtion CCjUally consequent on the Porte's reply. between Turkey, France, Germany and England, in the proportion of 25 per cent, each, the chairmanship and casting vote being reserved to Turkey, was to place control in the hands of the Turco- German group. The British proposal contemplated the inclusion of France and Russia. To Erance, Turkey made no objection, but strongly objected to the inclusion of Russia. If Russia insisted on participating in the event of Erench participation, while Turkey accepted the latter but not the former, the result would be a deadlock, of which the only solution was the elimination of both. The Turkish counter-proposal afforded an opportunity for reverting to the original idea of 50 per cent. British participation, the balance being divided between Turkey and Germany. In supporting this proposal, which it was considered would practi cally ensure against differentiation in rates. His Excellency the Viceroy urged that, while endeavouring by every means to consolidate our position and establish a lien for the future, no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our predominant position in the Gulf. Further consideration, however, proved that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to obtain Turkey's consent to a 50 per cent, participation and His Majesty's Government inclined to the opinion that in the circumstances it was preferable to stand out altogether giving Turkey a free hand on the railway and the increase in her customs duty in return for— (1) full settlement of all Gulf and river questions including the aquatic and land boundary in the region of Mohammerah; (2) convention against differential rates on the whole Baghdad Railway system; (3) continuation of railway to Gulf by arrangement with His Majesty's Government; (4) agreement to ensure that competition by river shall not be blocked by Turkish Government in favour of railway traffic. i.A- His Exoellency the Viceroy agreed that it was worth while to make the sacrifice if the proposed conditions could be secured in return. His Excellency tdded that rather than make any concession to Turkey in the Gulf he would prefer the abandonment of negotiations. Meanwhile, a point which had arisen in connection with a commission tt / v j tr . f or re-adiustment of the Turco- and (i) Katar. ^ ^ fi . om Ar:irat to Mohammerah, whifih was sitting at Constantinople, threatened to complicate the situation. The attitude of the Turkish Frontier Commissioner lent colour to the apprehension that the Turkish Government contemplated ad vancing extravagant claims which would result in the loss of a considerable slice of the Shaikh's territory and inevitably react unfavourably upon the adjustment of the respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf in view of the close relations existing between His Majesty's Government and the Shaikh of Mohammerah. The Foreign Office, apprehensive lest the matter should be referred to the Hague Tribunal, suggested that, in order to avoid this contingency, the Turks should be placated by allowing them to consolidate their position in Katar. On the 24th May 1912, His Excellency the Viceroy telegraphed strongly deprecating the inclusion of Mohammerah in the Gulf negotiations. The possible loss, under circumstances outside British control, of a small slice of territory by the Shaikh, in his opinion, w r as infinitely preferable to conces sions to Turkey in Katar. There w r as no reason, he added, to evade the obligation of a weak case going before the Hague Tribunal by sacrificing British interests in the Persian Gulf. In June, the Secretary of State enquired what concessions to Turkey would be possible in territories on the Gulf littoral supposing a successful issue of the negotiation depended upon some modification of the demands made in the British memorandum read with the Turkish reply. His Excellency the( Viceroy replied that, in consenting to allow the present nominal garrison at El Bida on the Katar Peninsula to remain conditionally, the irreducible minimum had been reached and no margin remained for further surrender. Indeed, now His Excellency felt strongly the necessity for the removal altogether from the Peninsula of the Turkish troops, having no confidence that any conditions, however rigidly defined, would be adhered to by the Turkish Government. Nowhere could any concession compatible with safety to Anglo-Indian interests be suggested and rather than make any concession it would be preferable to break off negotiations. ^In our interests', he added, 'we should strenuously oppose any step which might tend to consolidate the Turkish position on the littoral of the Persian Gulf.' The question of concessions in Katar having thus been disposed of jattention was next directed to Kuwait. The Secretary of State, on the 1st July the foilowins: conces- (d) Kuwait. 1912, sions suggested (a) Shaikh's autonomy to be recognised as proposed in the British Memorandum of July 1911, but limited to the harbour, town and immediate surroundings. {b) Maintenance of status quo in the rest of Kuwait territory, the Shaikh being entitled to British good offices in case of unpro voked aggression by Turkey. (c) Removal of Turkish garrison from Warba and Bubiyan. {d) Conclusion of Anglo-Turkish Convention confirming British agree ments with the Shaikh but admitting the right of Turkey to have an Agent at Kuwait. His Excellency the Viceroy agreed, subject to the following safeguards;— («) The status quo should be clearly defined in such a way as to place on record the existing administrative influence of the Shaikh throughout the wider limits of his territory in which Turkey should agree not to take any action, military or otherwise, without British consent. , \{b) Warba and Bubiyan should be admitted by Turkey to be witbin Kuwait limits and Ottoman garrisons withdrawn. (c) Admission of a Turkish Agent provided the Shaikh's autonomous position was recognised. As regards Turkish proposals for the Riverain Commission, Ilis Ex cellency the Viceroy expressed the (&lt;■) Riveram Commission. opinion that there was no objection to a purely Ottoman Commission with a British member in Turkish employ, provided that the Convention secured effective British control over the appointment of the British member as well as an effective voice for him on the Commission and deSnitely excluded any other foreign Power. To obviate Turkish claims to lighting and buoying in the Gulf itself the Viceroy considered that it was essential that the limit of the Commission's control of the approach to the Shatt-el-Arab should be very exactly defined. His Excellency further recommended that a British Engineer should be appointed as expert adviser to the Commission in order to ensure full consideration of British and Persian interests. 7. The second British note w r as then presented to the Porte on 18th July 1912, on the following lines:— (i) British participation in the Baghdad-Basrah Eailway was withdrawn on the following conditions :— (») At least one British Director^ British proposals of July 1912. approved by His Majesty's Government, should be admitted to the Board of the Baghdad Railway. (h) Acceptance of an arrangement for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. {c) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His- Majesty's Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of the railway from Baghdad to Basrah. (d) The terminus of the railway to be at Basrah. (e) No railway to be continued beyond Basrah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty's Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (/) A convention to be signed for the future conservancy of the Sbatt-el-Arab. (^) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Baghdad and Basrah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii) Kuwait. As in the previous memorandum. (iii) Recognition of Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost (iv) limits of Kuwait and Ojeir. Definite renunciation by the Turkish of Katar including El-Bida. Government of the whole I (v) Recognition by Porte of British right to control surveying, light ing, buoying and pilotage in the Persian Gulf; to police its waters and to conduct all quarantine arrangements. (vi) Acceptance of frontier in neighbourhood of Mohammerah. 8. Matters remained in statu quo during the rest of 1912. In ther . „ .. , . Spring of 1913, Hakki Pasha was deputed Renewal of negotiation.. Pro.,..on.l seltlemmt. to to discugs various desiderata set out in the British note of the 18th July 1912. As a result of these discussions a convention regarding the Baghdad Railway has been initialled rejerendum. As regards (i), above conditions (a), {b) } (c), (d) and {e) have been accepted with the modification that two British directors will sit on the board of the Baghdad „ . . Railway. As regards (i) (/), similarly Eiveraia Commission. • % a convention has been initialled ad referendum which secures effective British participation in the Riverain 4 -ACommission. Inter alia the conditions accepted by Hakki Pasha provide that one member of the Commission which will consist of two members shall be British and that the Chief Engineer and Inspector of Iliver Conservancy shall also be British. Provision has been made in a separate declaration that the Shaikh of Mohammerah may entrust his interest to the British Commissioner. As regards (i) (^r), the Ottoman Government has agreed to grant a concession for the navigation of the Tigris and Euphrates to a British subject. The Chairman of the Company to be a Turk, the capital to be shared equally between Great Britain and Turkey and the directors to be Turkish and British in equal proportions. The President of the Managing Council to be British. As regards (ii), Hakki Pasha produced a counter-draft which contained many objectionable features, especially a demand for a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Kuwait limits. His Excellency the Viceroy protested against the grant of this conces sion on the ground that the possession of such a right by the Turks would enable them to threaten Kuwait and put pressure on the Shaikh on the colourable pretext that troops were on their way to Central Arabia. Hakki Pasha agreed to surrender Warba and Bubiyan to Kuwait, but declined to consent to the recognition of the autonomy of the Shaikh in the wider limits of Kuwait. Eventually it was decided to make the concession recognising two kinds of Kuwait territory, but in return a rectification of the original southern boundary was secured so as to include Anta to which the Shaikh attached importance. British and Turkish views on the question of ' suzerainty ' and sovereignty being irreconcilable, it was agreed in return for satisfactory- definitions in the Convention of the actual rights secured for Kuwait and renounced by Turkey to omit either term and to describe Kuwait as a Caza autonome de 1'Empire Ottoman '. Regarding the littoral (iii), Hakki Pasha asked for an extension of Turkish jurisdiction on the main land Turkisli jurisdiction on Araliiau littoral. ^ &amp; opposite a|ld i nc l u( ] ing Zakhnuniyeh island. To this His Excellency the Viceroy agreed if certain safeguards were obtained and compensation (£1,000) paid to the Shaikh of Bahrain for waiving his claims to the island, provision has been made accord ingly in the Convention accepted by him. Katar. —As regards (iv) Katar, the Turks agreed to withdraw entirely from the Peninsula, provided it remained autonomous and was not annexed by Bahrain. To this provision His Excellency the Viceroy agreed on the understanding that the British Government were left with a free hand to come to such agree ments or understandings with the local Chiefs as might be necessary for the maintenance of the maritime peace and the suppression of the arms traffic. As regards (v), a declaration has been initialled in which the Ottoman Government agrees not to interfere Lighting aud buoying the Persian Gui . with the rights which the British Govern ment have exercised in the past in connection with— (a) surveying, lighting, buoying and pilotage. (J) policing, (c) quarantine measures, in the Persian Gulf. In the declaration regarding the frontier near Mohammerah (vi) a slight concession was made in the northern Mohammerah frontier. ^ of ^ This is immat e r ial, the marsh will still separate Persians and Turks thus preventing the latter from getting any footing on terra firma to the east of the marsh which is within the sphere of the Beni Trufs who are under the jurisdiction of the Shaikh of Mohammerah. As to the lands on the Shatt-el-Arab itself Hakki Pasha maintained contrary to the British view that the territory between Diaji and the Nahr Nazaileh to the possession of which the Shaikh8 attached much importance as pointed out by the Government of India, was in effective Turkish occupation. Finally the British line was accepted with the proviso, which His Majesty's Government consider pro forma in the light of clear evidence in favour of the British view, that if the territory in question is found by the Commissioners who will delimitate on the ground to have been in effective Turkish occupation on 1st January 1913, the line shall be rectified accordingly. 9. The draft Conventions, as initialled ad referendum, are attached together with the correspondence referred to in this precis. 10, It will be seen that the negotiations have resulted in our obtaining practically all that we have asked for in regard to Kuwait, and the Shatt-el- Arab, together with satisfactory safeguards in the matter of representation on the Baghdad-Basrah railway line, and a predominant voice in respect to any future extension of that line to the Gulf. In regard to matters in which we are interested in the Persian Gulf itself, the results of the negotiations can best be appreciated by a perusal of the statement below in which they are compared with the desiderata set forth in Sir H. McMahon's note of 28th June 1911. I.—P ersian Gulf. JPolicy of the Government of India. (a) Kenunciation by Turkey of all claim to supremacy over any point on the littoral of the Persian Gulf south of Ojeir, and to the islands of Bahrain, Muharruq, Zaknuniyeh or adjacent islands. (i) The recognition of the prescrip tive right of His Majesty's Govern ment to police the Gulf and to pursue disturbers of the maritime peace even into Turkish territorial waters. (&lt;?) The recognition of the prescrip tive right of His Majesty's Govern ment in regard to the lighting, buoy ing and pilotage of the Persian Gulf and approaches of the Shatt-el-Arab. (d) The recognition of the prescrip tive right of His Majesty's Govern ment to conduct all quarantine arrangements in the Gulf. Results of negotiations. (a) In exchange for complete renun ciation of Turkish claims to Bahrain and its islands and Katar, the island of Zaknuniyeh (for which Turkey will pay the Shaikh of Bahrain £1,000), and a small strip of coast just South of Ojeir is to be given to Turkey. The British Government undertakes not to annex Bahrain, the independence of which is recognised by Turkey. (I/) The Ottoman Government agrees not to interfere with the rights which the British Government have exercised in the Persian Gulf, outside Turkish territorial waters, in connection with police maritime. (c) Agreed to by the Ottoman Gov ernment in terms similar to above. The approaches of the Shatt-el-Arab will be under the control of the Eiverain Commission, (d) Agreed to by the Ottoman Gov ernment in terms similar to (6) above. II.—B ahrain. (e) Announcement of British protectorate over Bahrain and publication of the Protectorate Order in Council (under consideration, July 1911). (/) Recognition of British Consular protection for Bahrainis in Turkey. (e) His Majesty's Government have agreed not to annex Bahrain. This condition would not apparently preclude the declaration of a Protectorate when ever the British Government consider it desirable seeing that the Ottoman Government has renounced all claims on the island. (/) The Ottoman Government agrees, provided Bahrainis do not enjoy privileges conferred on certain Powers by the capitulations,9 III.—K atar.

From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to Admiral's letters of 24th March and 22nd April, both of which were sent to Admiralty regarding conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, and the superiority of Basrah, as compared with Kuwait for terminus of Baghdad Kailway. It is probably too late at this moment to reconsider latter question, in view of present phase of negotiations with Turkey; but apart from this, I am of opinion that it would be desirable, if possible, to induce Persia to object to Turkey's claim to assume the whole control of the river, and to let Britain act in the matter as her delegate. It is possible to read the Treaty of Erzeroum as implying Turkey's right of entire control, but in this connection, please see letter No. 39, dated 29th January 1905, from Colonel Cox, forwarded with Foreign Secretary's letter No. 8 M., dated 23rd February 1905, as to usage recognising the dividing line to be the deep water channel. Attention is also invited to Colonel Cox's telegram No. 377 of 25th April (despatched by mail of ^th ins'ant). His views as to the strength of our claim to maintain the (status quo in the conservancy, lighting, &amp;c., of the Shatt-el-Arab, have our full concurrence. Telegram P., dated the 1st (received 2nd) June 1911, From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Trivate. Baghdad Railway terminus. Your official telegram of the IGth May. As Turkey has not yet been approached on the lines dealt with in private telegrams ending with yours of 29th April, please let me have your observations on the situation created by the Admiral's view that Basrah is a more suitable terminus than Kuwait. Your reply should be sent by telegraph as soon as possible. Telegram P., No. 149, dated the 8th June 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Private, Please see your private telegram of 1st June regarding Baghdad Railway terminus. The likelihood that Kuwait will eventually become the terminus of the railway has been reduced by the Admiral's view of the value of Basrah as a port, and the fact that Sir J. {sic. ? W.) Willcocks has made a statement to the Turkish Government in the same sense. Conse quently the value of our position at Kuwait as a bargaining factor for parti cipation in, and control of, the Gulf section has fallen, and as a lever to obtain the terms we desire, we must rely almost exclusively on our consent to the additional 4 per cent. Customs duty. The force of this condition sliould not be underrated, since upon our consent is dependent that of all the other Powers, while our long-established position and trade in Mesopotamia demand recog nition by Turkey. It would be a mistake to press for Kuwait as the terminus, since if the port of Basrah were developed and the Shatt-el-Arab dredged, Basrah would probably become the port in use, and a line from Basrah to Kuwait would fall into disuse and never pay its way. In the event of Basrah becoming the terminus, our policy should be to endeavour to obtain as large a participation as possible in the building and control of the Baghdad-Basrah section and the construction of the port at Basrah ; as large a share as possible in the control of the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, as representing the riparian interests of Persia and the pre dominant and independent position to which our prevailing share of tonnage and trade and our long-established position on the river give us a claim; the maintenance at all costs of the status quo at Kuwait and in the Persian Gulf ; and the construction of a railway from Mohammerah or Ahwaz to Khoremabad and the north of Persia as rapidly as possible.11 If in the near future the project of the Trans-Persian Railway were likely to be realised, the Mohammerah-Khoremabad line would lose much of its importance as a counterpoise, but the necessity for the Mohammerah-Khor Musa-Shiraz line would proportionately increase. It is therefore important to secure, as soon as possible, the option we have asked for the Khoremabnd line with port at Khor Musa and branch line to Mohammerah. We may hereafter be compensated for what we may now lose by new situation in regard to Basrah and Shatt-el-Arab by the possession of a port at Khor Musa under our control, which would strengthen our position in the Gulf.

Please refer to your private telegram of 29th April. The proposals have now been entirely recast; the following are the most important:—(1) An International Company to be formed, comprising Turkey, Germany, France, Hussia and England, each with 20 per cent. (2) The terminus to be at Basrah, but in event of railway being ever extended to the Gulf, it must be brought to Kuwait under conditions to bo settled between ourselves and Turkey. (3) A Turco-British Riverain Commission consisting of two members with engineer mutually agreed upon, to superintend navigation and surveys of Sbatt-el-Arab. (4) Kuwait to be recognised as enclave within and forming part of the Turkish Empire with ownership of Bubiyan and Warba. Turkish interference with internal administration of Kuwait excluded. (5) Turkey to renounce definitely claims to Bahrain, the adjacent islands and the Katar peninsula, I shall be glad if you will telegraph your views with least possible delay.

I presume paragraph I does not apply to the internationalisation of the whole Baghdad Railway, but only to the Baghdad-Gulf section ? Telegram P,, dated the 14th (received 15th) July 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—Hi84£xcellency the Viceroy, Simla, Private. Baghdad Railway. The presumption in your private telegram of the 14th July is correct. Telegram P., dated the 16th July 1911, From—His Excellency the Vicer6y, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Private. Please see your private telegram of the 13th July regarding Baghdad Railway. On the whole the proposals seem satisfactory and a great advance on those hitherto made. Our views are as follows;— No. 1 proposal.—On the understanding that proposals Nos. 2, 3, ^ and 5 are granted in full, this proposal may be accepted. It would then be desirable to arrive at an agreement with France and Russia to support British interests in the Gulf section in return for our support in any other section in which they may respectively be interested. The control that we desire might be obtained in the manner indicated above.12 No. 2 proposal.—The condition proposed is a valuable one and should be obtained. No. 3 proposal—Seems quite satisfactory and should be the means of excluding any other Power. No. 4 proposal.—The situation to be desired for Kuwait is one of complete autonomy under the suzerainty of the Sultan ; and to obviate an opening for future Turkish interference or aggression, great care should be taken to avoid any ambiguity in the formula adopted. No. 5 proposal—Is quite satisfactory. If we are to agree to the additional 4 % Customs duties in return for these conditions, I would recommend that we should avail ourselves of this oppor tunity to obtain at the same time from the Turkish Government their recogni tion of our right— (1) to police the waters of the Gulf; (2) to conduct all quarantine arrangements in the Gulf; (3) to control (outside the waters controlled by the Turco-British Riverain Commission) the lighting, buoying and pilotage of the Gulf, Telegram P., dated the 21st July 1911. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Vrivate. Baghdad Railway. My private telegram of 16th July. Since it would form a useful precedent to obtain similar recognition from other Powers, I venture to attach some importance to the recognition by Turkey of the three points contained in the last paragraph of my telegram. I am not sure that at the same time we ought not to insist on the recogni tion by Turkey of the administrative frontier of Persia west of Mohammerah, which still remains under dispute, but more important are the three additional points mentioned in my telegram. Telegram P., dated the 31st July 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Private. Baghdad Railway. Your private telegram of the 11th instant. In the reply of the Foreign Office to the Porte the three points referred to in your telegram will be inserted. Foreign Office see objections to the question of the frontier west of Mohammerah being raised. Telegram P., dated the 17th (received 18tb) August 1911. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. In connection with Baghdad Railway negotiations, the Turkish Government have asked to see our agreements with Bahrain, Kuwait and the Trucial Chiefs. As regards Kuwait, apparently the Shaikh should be consulted, but in view of what is said in memorandum, dated 29th July, it seems difficult to refuse alto gether or to give only extracts. The Foreign Office, however, are doubtful if we should divulge part of the Agreement of 1907, providing for annual pay ment on account of lease of land. Presumably Colonel Meade's letter, dated 23rd January 1899, should be included. Of the Bahrain and Trucial Treaties, I propose to omit Aitchison 's 32nd and 46th. I shall be glad to receive your views as soon as possible.13 Telegram P., dated the 30tli August 1911, From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London. Request of Turkish Government to see our agreements with Bahrain, Kuwait and Trucial Chiefs. Your telegram 17th August. We have consulted Cox and he has personally interviewed the Shaikh of Kuwait. The latter, in absence of more definite knowledge as to present negotiations, is opposed to details regarding agreement of 1907, i.e., foreshore lease being disclosed; firstly, because places in regard to which he has rejected overtures from other quarters are referred to by name; secondly, because agreement contains provisions which were framed as a safeguard against possible contingencies which may never arise ; thirdly, because publication of details would in any case cause inconvenient gossip among Shaikh's own subjects and would also greatly increase hostility of Turks to him should the Anglo-Turkish negotia tions prove abortive. In my opinion, it would be very undesirable that the Porte should be furnished with any part of the text of the agreement. They are already- aware of its existence, see Sir G. Lowther's despatch No. 393 of 28th May 1909 to Foreign Office, and it would perhaps suffice to inform the Porte sponta neously that we have a lease of land at Kuwait, but see no necessity to discuss details. The publication of the agreement of 1899 is welcomed by the Shaikh, always provided that we do not intend to diverge from it. On the same under standing, I think that the agreement might be communicated to the Porte, but I deprecate furnishing any part of Colonel Meade's letter of 23rd January 1899. It is obviously undesirable that the second paragraph should be disclosed while the first paragraph only provides for ' good offices,' whereas in Decem ber 1901 and October 1902 {vide Secretary of State's telegrams to Government of India, dated 4th December 1901, and 14th October 1902) the Shaikh was informed that we would not tolerate an attack by Turkish ships or troops on Kuwait, and that we would protect Kuwait and district against attack. Would it not suffice to append a note to the copy of the agreement of 1899 that we had subsequently informed the Shaikh that as long as he and his heirs and successors acted up to their obligations under the agreement, we charged ourselves to support them and to protect Kuwait against attack by sea or land ? I presume that you will furnish copy of Shaikh's agreement to prohibit import or export of arms (our Secret despatch No. 86, dated 5th July 1900), and his undertaking not to alow the establishment of post office by any other Government than British {see your telegram of 19th February 1904 and enclosuse of our Secret despatch No. 152 (External), dated 27th October 3 910). As regards Trucial Coast and Bahrain, we have no other treaties than those in Aitchison, and this being a published work, all or any might be com municated to Porte. The omission of Nos. 32 and 46 might be misunderstood ; but I see no other reason to object to their exclusion. (Received on the 4th December 1911 with Political Secretary^ letter No. 4G, dated the 17th November 1911.) EASTERN DEPARTMENT, f24th October.] SECRET SERIES. S ection 3. 42135 No. 1. Sir Edward Grey to Tewfik Pasha. Foreign Office, 24th October 1911. Your Highness, In compliance with the request which, under instructions from your Government, you were good enough to make to me on the 16th August, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the agreements concluded byu His Majesty's Government with the Trucial Chiefs of Oman and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwait, to which reference is made in the memorandum communicated to Your Highness on the 29th July last. With respect to these agreements His Majesty's Government have the following observations to make :— As regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have informed the Shaikh of Kuwait that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obliga tions under the agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. His Majesty's Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from the Shaikh of Kuwait. As regards Xo. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government but on the custom, consent, and long-established relations between the local Chiefs and the Government of India. His Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's good-will and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum. I have, &amp;c., E. G rey. Telegram P., dated the 20th (received 21st) March 1912. From—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Private. Informal discussion with Turkish delegates regarding the Baghdad Ilailway has begun. As regards section 2 of British memorandum of July 29th, 1911, they seem to think that they can meet us except as to Katar where the withdrawal of military post would be regarded by Turkish Parlia ment as unjustifiable cession of territory. They ask whether consolidation of Turkish authority there cannot be reconciled with our interests, such as suppression of arms traffic, protection of pearl fisheries and Shaikh of Bahrain's pasturage rights and, where necessary, combined exercise of our maritime supervision. There seems to be force in their argument about Parliament, and I should like to know if you think that exclusion of Turks from Katar is worth sacrifice of any material parts of our other claims. All the ground has not yet been covered, but if agreement can be reached on all other points, would you accept this compromise, provided that the Turks bind themselves either to suppress arms traffic themselves or, failing that, to allow us to do so ? And to secure our interests above mentioned, what conditions would you suggest ? I shall be glad to have as soon as possible your reply to this telegram. Telegram P., dated the 29th March 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Viceroy's Camp, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Private, Please see your private telegram, dated the 20th instant. In my opinion, any settlement which tends to consolidate Turkey's position in the Gulf will leave much to be desired. Hitherto our refusal to recognise in Katar the locus standi of Turkey has prevented any jurisdiction being exercised and the small military post has practically been prisoners at El Bida. TheTurks will be able to consolidate their position both in the hinterland from the? limits of Kuwait down to Odeid, and on the coast by our specific recognition of their suzerainty in Katar. It will open up questions of joint intervention with us in Gulf affairs and will give Turks a foothold in the Gulf for the first time with many potential possibilities. Whether it be in the protection of pearl fisheries, suppression of arms traffic, or the combined exercise of maritime supervision, I do not see how this can be reconciled with our interests. Serious prejudice to our interests in the Gulf is all that seems likely to result from such a development. The irreducible minimum to our pledge is represented by the niemorandum of 29th July, and I am not able to find anything ' which we can with safety surrender. If the present obstacle in discussion is formed owing merely to a dislike to the withdrawal of the garrison of El Bida, it might perhaps be possible to safeguard Turkish amour propre by permitting the present nominal garrison to remain on there, on condition that we are allowed to suppress the arms traffic there and that Turkish jurisdicion is not exercised in Katar outside El Bida. Telegram P., dated the 25th (received 26tb) May 1912. From—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India 7 London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Frinate. Baghdad Railway. My Foreign-Secret telegram of the 14th instnnt and your private telegrams of the 29tb April 1911 and IGth July 1911,- I am strongly inclined to think that the Turkish counter-proposal should be used as opportunity for getting rid of Erench and Russian participation and returning to our original idea of 50 per cent, for ourselves and the remainder divided between Turkey and Germany. I have never believed that 60 per cent, divided between Erance, Russia and ourselves, even if backed by an international convention, is equivalent for the purpose of defence against differential rates, to 50 per cent, for ourselves alone, and, if we were reduced to so small a share, there would surely be great loss of prestige. Moreover,, our dependency on the two other Powers here might eventually be a source of weakness elsewhere. I should be glad to have, as soon as possible, }our definite opinion as to the relative advantages of the two proposals. Telegram, No. 98 P, dated tbe 29th May 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Trivate. Baghdad Railway. Your private telegram of 25th May. As to the relative advantages of the two proposals, there can, from an Indian point of view, be no possible doubt whatever. We infinitely prefer the proposal for a 50 per cent, participation for ourselves in tbe Gulf section, leaving the remainder for disposal as Turkey may wish. We have always felt that a 20 or 25 per cent, participation must necessarily involve a loss of prestige in regions adjoining the Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 23rd March 1911), and that some day it might possibly become necessary to give compensation to Erance and Russia elsewhere for their continued support of our interests in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share, we can make practically sure against differentiation in rates. It is advisable, in considering all questions affecting Mesopotamia, to bear in mind that the situation is a fluid one, and that it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 years' time. Careful as we should therefore be to do all in our power to consolidate our own position and to establish a lien for tbe future, we are strongly of opinion that no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf, where in maintaining it against all comers we are able, and should continue to be able, to assert ourselves.16 Telegram P., dated the 8th (received 9th) June 1912. Prom—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Private. Baghdad Railway. Your private telegram of 29th May. On assumption that 60 per cent.^ cannot be got, the opinion here now inclines to our standing out altogether, giving Turkey free hand on railway as far as Basrah and customs increase in return for (1) full settlement of all Gulf and river questions including Mohammerah, (2) convention precluding differential rates on the whole Baghdad system, (3) agreement that railway shall not be continued to Gulf except by arrangement with us, (4) such agreement as may be necessary or possible to ensure that competition by river shall not be blocked by Turkish Government in favour of railway. Please telegraph, if possible, before Tuesday, your views as to this alternative. Telegram P., No. 115, dated the 10th June 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Private^ Baghdad Railway. Your private telegram of 8th June. I tully recognise that, by standing out of participation in the railway and conceding customs increase, we give up our last card; but if we can obtain what you suggest in exchange, I think it is worth doing so, I will only add that, rather than that we should make any concession to Turkey in the Gulf, we would greatly prefer that negotiations should break down. As regards minor points, to obviate possible future contention as to whethei Klior Abdulla or other place be on Gulf or not, 1 recommend substi tuting in (3; words ' beyond Basrah ' for ' to Gulf Telegram P., dated the 14th (received 15th) May 1912.

As regards the former, the Political 'Resident in the Persian Gulf has sent you his views in his telegrams of the 29th May and 4th June 1912. We concur generally subject to such modification as may be necessary in the event of our standing out of particip ation in Baghdad-Basrah Section. As regards the control of pilotage, however, by Commission—Article 6 (f). We do not share Cox's objections. But we agree with him that the policing of the river [Article 6 (rf) ] should be left as at present to local authorities and that quarantine [Article 6 {e) ] should be excluded. As regards the control of the approach to Shatt-el-Arab, we consider it essential to obviate Turkish claims to lighting and buoyage in Gulf itself that limit of this control should be very exactly defined. Further, an article might be added empowering the British member to correspond freely with His Majesty's Government as suggested in paragraph 2 {e) of Hirtzel and Parker's joint note.

Examination of specification attached to Baghdad Railway Convention. Kefercnce your telegram l-ith May 1912 and my telegram 21st June 1912. We are of opinion that the rate tariff proposed will not prejudice Indian trade subject to the following conditions:— (a) That the total charges levied for the carriage of any article for any particular distance in the direction of Basrah and booked from Konia and via and from any port in the Mediterranean served by the Baghdad Railway shall not be less than the total charges levied for the same article and for the same particular distance booked from Basrah and via in the direction of Konia. (ft) That a month's notice be required both for reducing a rate and for increasing it as the power to reduce rates on three days' notice may lead to manipulation of rates as against Basrah. Telegram P., dated the 6th (received 7th) April 1912. From His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Navigation of Shatt-el-Arab. Under the treaty of Erzeroum, Porte claims whole of Shatt-el-Arab channel, but question has been raised, apart from Shatt- el-Arab. as to where three-mile limit should be reckoned from, for examplej. whether from low water mark on mainland or from banks which are said to form continuation of mainland. Please let me know your views. If ynu could send as quickly as possible chart showing exactly what you would recognise as territorial waters, it would be convenient. Telegram P., dated the 10th (received 11th) April 1912. From His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Please refer to your telegram of the 4th ultimo (instant ? )regarding the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab. The claim of Turkey to control the entire river, while guaranteeing free access to Mohammerah, is founded on the treaty of Erzeroum^and the explanatory note. Unless, therefore, the interpretation upon which these claims are based can be got rid of, arguments based on practical inconvenience that will follow its admission are irrelevant, please telegraph any views you may have regarding interpretation. But inconvenience cannot of course be overlooked. U nfortunately, as you are aware, the whole of the Turco-Persian Frontier question including Moham merah is under discussion at Constantinople. The question may be referred tothe Hague Tribunal and in that case it will be difficult, if not impossible, not to include Mohammerah though lEis Majesty's Government will use their best endeavours. Meanwhile, the Porte have informally proposed purely Ottoman Riverain Commission with a British Member who must be, however, in Ottoman employ. I think this proposal may be accepted provided that the Convention will secure effective British control over the appointment of the British Member as well as effective voice for him on the Commission and will definitely exclude any other foreigner. Please telegraph your views. In connection with the motive of His Majesty's Government in favouring a mixed Commission, please refer to the Defence Committee's proceedings 24th May 1911, pages 17 to 22. His Excellency the Viceroy has a copy of this. Object of ourselves and the Porte is to avoid other Powers being introduced, and it may be very difficult in practice to exclude others if Persia as well as ourselves come in. I recognise that the Shaikh of Mohammerah may have claim to dues for services rendered in his port, but with regard to jurisdiction in river can he not be persuaded on matter being explained to him to delegate any claim he may have to the British representative ? In any case if His Majesty's Government decide to admit the Turkish interpretation of the Treaty, or if the Hague decides in favour of the Porte, we could not admit that such a course would be an encroachment on the rights of the Shaikh within the meaning of assurance we have given him. Informal discussions with Turks have ended and a telegram has been despatched. Formal discussions between Secretary of State for Foreign Alfairs and the Ottoman Ambassador will commence shortly, and I shall consult you freely as points arise. Meanwhile, I shall be glad your views on the question raised above. Telegram P., dated the 13th (received 14th) April 1912. From—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy. Shatt-el-Arab. Reference is invited to my telegram, dated 10th April. Communication of views of His Majesty's Government is being made confiden tially to Russian Government to the following eifect regarding the question of frontier near Mohammerah which has been raised at Constantinople between Turkey and Persia. ' If Turkish claims of 1850 were now revived, His Majesty's Government would not be able to recognise them. A frontier has been locally observed for sixty years owing to failure of Tukey to accept line recommended by Mediating Commissioners in 1850, this line is more advant ageous to Persia than the other line, and His Majesty's Government could not admit that in arriving at final settlement, the argument of uti possidetis should be entirely ignored, though on a strictly legal interpretation it may be doubt ful whether that argument would prevail owing to reservation contained in Turco-Persian Protocol, 1869. His Majesty's Government are disposed to consider that, with reference to wording of Article 2 of Treaty of Erzeroum, nothing more than freedom ot' navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab can be claimed for Persia—while conceding such freedom Turkey took great pains in asserting her right of ownership over the entire waters of that river. ' From the sea to where the Mediating Commissioners' line strikes off from Siiatt-el-Arab, a frontier more advantageous to Persia than the Mediating Commissioners' line could not, I think, be successfully claimed against Turkey. ' But the point where the frontier, as locally observed, strikes off from Shatt-el-Arab is six and half miles to west of Mediating Commissioners' line and the intervening territory containing palace and offices of Shaikh of Mohammeiah. In 1850, Persia protested against cession to Turkey of these six miles or so, and it had been suggested by the Mediating Commissioners that the allocation of the territory in question to Turkey was not in pursuance of Treaty expresses verbis, but in order to secure safety of navigation to Basrah,19 which it was thought by them might be endangered if Persia held that particular territory. As the experience of 60 years has shown, the Commis sioners' apprehension was groundless, there seems to be no reason to disturb Shaikh, and any attempt to do so would be opposed by His Majesty's Gov ernment. ' The Mediating Commissioners* line, after leaving Shatt-el-Arab, proceeds in the direction of Hawizeh. The line as locally observed is some miles to the west of Hawizeh. On account of local inconvenience which would bo caused. His Majesty's Government would strongly deprecate the disturbance of frontier even as locally observed near Hawizeh.' Please despatch urgently a copy of map showing frontier locally recog nised which is referred to in Lieutenant Wilson's letter, paragraph 8, dated 12th March 1910, to Sir P. Cox. In that letter he speaks of frontier as being some ten miles west of Hawizeh, but in paragraph 11 of letter, dated 26th May 1909, he says six or eight farsakhs. Kindly let me know which is correct. Please treat as most confidential the views of His Maiestv's Government as stated above. Telegram P., dated (and received) the 14th April 1912. From—The First Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. The Eesident telegraphs from Kuwait under date the 13th April 1912 as follows ' Your telegrams, dated 9th and 12th April 1912. It is understood that the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty has the original hand- drawn large scale chart, March 1911, on which 20th September chart, 1235, is based, and to which the followin g observations refer ;— ' The Naval Commander-in-Chief and I have consulted and the following represents our views on the subject: ' The three-mile limit, we are of opinion, should be measured from ordinary low water mark on the mainland, and ordinary low water mark on the Turkish side must be taken as being the edge of the belt of reeds off Ras-al-Bisha point. The mud spit beyond that point only drys in patches at extraordinary low water springs and cannot therefore be fairly claimed as mainland* ' The part indicated by underlined figures, on the Persian side, uncovers at ordinary low water, and, it must, therefore, be taken as mainland, but the insulated patch just south of Khor-al-Nasar, we would strongly urge, be not considered mainland, as Commander Palinurus after years of experience considers that it only drys at extraordinary spring. ' We consider that the limits of Turkish waters measured on above premises cut the centre of the navigable channel at a point south 47 degrees 30 minutes east true 3-215 miles from triangular beacon erected last year on Persian side. Limit of the Persian waters cuts centre channel at a point south 45 degrees 30 minutes east true S'Tl miles from same beacon. ' But even if the claim of Turks to the waters of the whole of the river were made good, we consider they could only measure from their own banks and could not, by measuring from Persian bank, legitimately extend their limits to seaward, ' I have sent the chart to India by post.' At the request of the Resident, I repeat in my en aair telegram No. 393 the bearings. Telegram P., dated the 18th April 1912.

Please refer to vour telegram of the 10th April. ********* We reply now only on subject of constitution of the Commission as Cox's opinions are still awaited on other points. We are in agreement that proposal regarding British Members should be accepted subject to (a) proviso mentioned, and if possible to (i) proviso that only to members comprise Commission, namely, a Turk and the British Member in employ of Turkish Government. We are of opinion, however, that a British Engineer should, be appointed as Expert Adviser to the Commission, in order to ensure full consideration of British and Persian interests. Engineer would of course not be member, but servant of Commission, and conditions of his appointment should be same as those of British Member. Heplies to other points will be submitted as soon as possible after hearing from Cox. Telegram P., dated the 20th (received 21st) May 1912. Prom—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. It is feared by the Eoreign Office that a reference to the Hague Tribunal of the Turco-Persian Frontier question might, since the Turks are reviving Dervish Pasha's extravagant claims, result in the loss of a considerable slice of the Shaikh's territory. It is therefore proposed by the Eoreign Office to avoid the Hague by including Mohammerah in the Gulf negotiations and by offering the Turks, in return for locally recognised frontier of Mohammerah, consolida tion in Katar. The fears of the Hague award are, I am inclined to think, rather exaggerated, and that loss to Shaikh, if limited to territory west of mediating commissioner's line, is lesser evil than consolidation of Turks in Katar. I should be glad to have as soon as possible your remarks on the above considerations; your views on the latter subject are known to me. Telegram P., dated the 24th May 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Mohammerah. Please see your telegram, dated 20th instant. The inclu sion of Mohammerah in Gulf negotiations we strongly deprecate and consider that possible loss under circumstances so obviously outside our control of small slice of territory by Shaikh would be infinitely preferable to concession to Turkey in Katar. We also see no reason in order to evade the obligation of a weak case going before the Hague Tribunal for sacrificing our own interests in the Persian Gulf. Telegram P., dated the 1st (received 2nd) June 1912. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Shatt-el-Arab. Please refer to Sir P. Z. Cox's telegram M. 93 of 23rd ultimo and consider following points:— (a) If treaty of Erzeroum assigned waterway to Turkish Government as His Majesty's Government believed for reasons given on pages 40-4!3 of Parker's Memorandum, further evidence of ownership is unnecessary.21 {b) See pa^e 27 of Parker's Memorandum where text of Persian note is quoted as regards fortifying banks. It is clear that the Porte in the year 1888 admitted right of Persian Government apart from self-denying ordinance of 1818 to fortify left bank of Shatt- el-Arab, but His Majesty's Government advised that this right flows from fact that the left bank of Shatt-el-Arab belongs to Government of Persia and does not imply ownership of any part of waterway, Turkey's rights in which would not be affected by such fortifications. (c) Regarding forts at entrance of Karun river, self-denying ordinance of the year 1848 expressly excepted town of Mohammerab where such forts already existed. (4) Evidence regarding liability to Turkish dues is statement in Lord Canning's despatch No. 239 of 1st November 1844 which is quoted verbatim on page 19 of Parker's Memorandum. His Lordship adds that part of annual revenue of Baghdad Pashalie w T ere derived from such dues. Telegram P., dated the 7th June 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty^s Secretary of State for India, London (repeated to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire). Shatt-el-Arab. Eeference your telegram of the 8th ultimo. We have considered Foreign Office Memorandum; and* the views of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf expressed in his telegram of 5th May; in bis letter and enclosure of 21st May and in his two telegrams of 23rd May, all of which were sent to London direct by Sir P. Cox. We concur generally in arguments set forth by the Political Resident in respect of both the Moham- merah boundary and the rights in Shatt-el-Arab. As regards the former, it appears from Sir G. Lowther's telegram to Foreign Office, London, No. 152, dated 7th May, that Turkey merely wishes to keep Mohammerah claim for purposes of bargaining elsewhere. We consider that this claim should be contested on its merits and strongly deprecate in Indian interests any conces sion in Gulf as compensation of admission by Turkey of status quo at Moham- merah. As regards lighting and buoyage in approach of Shatt-el-Arab {see your telegram of the 14th ultimo). We will send a reply later in connection w T ith Baghdad Railway. Your telegram of 1st June, which was apparently sent before receipt of Cox's letter JSo. M. 85, dated 21st May, sent direct to Hirtzel. We have- nothing to add to Note VI appended to Sir P. Cox's letter which deals with the points raised in your telegram. Telegram P., dated the 10th (received 11th) June 1912. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Negotiations relative to the Baghdad Railway. Please consider what concessions to Turkey in territories on Gulf littoral you would be prepared to make should such prove necessary to save negotiations on the basis of memo randum to Turkish Government, dated 29th July 1911, Turkish reply and Jirtzel's and Parker's joint minute. I have told Foreign Office that our condi tions as to Katar were drafted as statement of necessary minimum and did not include stipulations to be waived by w r ay of concession in course of nego tiation. It is clear j in the event of negotiations breaking down, that His Majesty's Government must be provided with a definite alternate policy to meet the situation.22 Telegram P., dated the ISth June 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Baghdad Railway negotiations. Please see your telegram of lOth instant, lu our opinion our conditions as to Katar represent the irreducible minimum and no margin for surrender is left. We feel strongly the necessity for the removal altogether from the Peninsula of the Turkish troops, as we have no confidence that any conditions imposed, however rigidly defined, will be adhered to by the Turkish Government. Xo concession can be suggested by us that can be made with safety to the interests of India and Great Britain, and rather than make any concession in the Persian Gulf to the Turkish Govern ment we would prefer to see the negotiations broken off. In our interests we should strenuously oppose any step which might tend to consolidate the Turkish position on the littoral of the Persian Gulf. Telegram P., dated the 1st (received 2nd) July 1912. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla (repeated to Sir P. Cox). Baghdad Railway negotiations. Please refer to your telegram, dated I3th June 1912. Do you consider following concessions to Turkey practicable? Autonomy of Kuwait to be recognised as proposed in memorandum, dated 29th July 1911, but limited to harbour, town and immediate surroundings as contemplated by Lord Lansdowne. (Reference my telegram, dated ^ISth March 1911.) As regards wider limit mentioned in your telegram, dated 25th March 1911, that Turks be given to understand clearly both that in event ol' unprovoked aggression within these limits Shaikli will be entitled to our good offices, and that present status quo be maintained. Vis-a-vis of Turkey this would really be concession in appearance only but would save their fa«e as regards loss of large piece of territory. How womd Shaikh regard it ? Turkish garrison would of course be removed from Warba and Bubian. 3 As regards our agreements with Shaikh mentioned at bottom of pa^e 5 of Turkish memorandum, dated 15th April 1912, could not a conventwn with Turkey confirming them on analogy of Anglo-Chinese Treaty of 1906 get over the difficulty ? It would doubtless be difficult to bring Turkey to aaree to waive the right of sending an agent to Kuwait, but need this be insisted on if convention guarantees autonomy and provided all other powers except our selves were excluded ? I shall be glad to receive your views by telegraph urgently. Telegram P., dated the 13th July 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London. Please refer to your telegram of 1st instant regarding the Baghdad Railway negotiations. I find it difficult to reconcile the statement that the arrangement proposed is a concession in appearance only with the loss of large piece of territory by the Shaikh which is implied in the sentence immediately following. The Shaikh will naturally resent it if any real loss of territory is involved by these proposals, and the arrangement must consequently be deprecated. The necessity of carefully avoiding any concessions which Turkey may be able to transfer to Germany to our detriment or that may estrange the Shaikh and drive him into the hands of the Germans is emphasised by the news we have just received of an attempt on the part of the Germans to intrigue with Shaikh [vide my telegram of 11th instant). If, however, the present status quo is clearly defined in such a way as to place on record the existing administrative influence of the Shaikh throughout23 the wider limits attributed to Kuwait in Lorimer's Gazetteer; if Turkey admits Warba and Bubian are within Kuwait limits and withdraws their garrison, and if Turkey agrees within those wider limits not to take any action, military or otherwise without our consent, the arrangement becomes practic able and will not involve loss of territory. Full opportunity should, however, be given to us of explaining to Shaikh an arrangement contemplated concerning Kuwait and obtaining his previous concurrence. To the proposed Turkish Agent at Kuwait I see no objection, provided that Shaikh's position is recognised as autonomous and if we are given opportunity of explaining to Shaikh that the presence of an Agent is the natural result and price of autonomy and direct recognition of it as illustrated by the Khedive having a Turkish Agent at Cairo. It is understood Shaikh will, in regard to his properties in Turkish territory, be guaranteed enjoy ment {vide memorandum to Porte). To a convention with Turkey confirming our agreements with Shaikh* there would be no objection, if terms are worded so as to imply nothing more than suzerainty, but will this satisfy Turkey who desires the terms to be com patible with her sovereign rights, which are out of the question ? Throughout these negotiations I need hardly emphasise the importance of avoiding anything which in eyes of Shaikh and consequently of Mohammerah, Bahrain and Trucial Chiefs would appear want of good faith or admission of weakness on our part in a region where we are undoubtedly strong at the present moment. Telegram P., dated the 26th (received 27th) July 1912. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. I have addressed following telegram to Sir Percy Cox, Bushire :— Begins. Please telegraph any evidence showing control of the Shaikh of Kuwait over the tribes within the limits mentioned in Lorimer's Gazetteer. We have Shakespear's and Knox's reports of 1910 and 1908. Ends, Telegram P., dated (and received) the 1st August 1912. From—His Excellency the Viceroy, To—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, Please refer to my telegram of 13th ultimo regarding Kuwait. The post copy of your telegram of 1st ultimo, which has now been received, shows that full stop was misplaced in decyphering after the word ' face ' instead of after the word 'territory'. Hence we misread your telegram as implying loss of territory not to Turkish Government but to Shaikh of Kuwait. Telegram P., No. 843, dated the 16th August 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The India Office, London. My telegram 779 of Ist August and letter 1727 which will reach London 2ith. This latter and also report now received from Political Agent, Kuwait which will reach London 8th September, were written before receipt of copy of memorandum transmitted by His Majesty's Government to Turkish Ambas sador on 18th July, The boundary that Shakespear would have advocated as the result of his past enquiries and as representing the claims of the Shaikh, would have been as follows :— Starting from junction of Khor Sabiya and Khor Zobair boundary would pass along waterway of latter so as to include Soof Island opposite Umm24 Kasr in latter Khor. The line would then pass north of Umm Kasr wells and north of Safwan wells and Jabal Sanam to the llatk ridge ; thence south-west along the Batin as far as and including Hafar wells. From Hafar it turns south-east towards Safah and includes the wells ; passing thence south-south- east, for about 25 miles, it includes A1 Gara'a wells; and from thence proceeds due east passing south of Wabrah and Anta's wells and so on until it cuts coast at southern shore of Mussalamiyah Bay which with its islands is claimed by Shaikh. As regards Umm Kasr, Safwan and Mussalamiyah, Shakespear remarks that whereas Shaikh has always specifically claimed these points when mention of them has arisen, we have never informed him that we questioned his claims and he will consequently be greatly disappointed when he learns that they have been arbitrarily excluded from his territory. Basis of boundary arrived at by Shakespear is the actual control of wells by tribesmen owning allegiance to Shaikh Mubarak and this of course is the main test of territorial possession in desert countries inhabited by nomads; documentary evidence in such cases is never procurable. Following evidence or considerations are advanced in support of particular points:— As regards Umm Kasr, until present occupation of Turks, wells were habitually frequented by Kuwait Arabs and all disputes arising there were referred to Kuwait and not to Zobair, although former is three times as distant. Same remarks apply to Safwan. The line connecting Safwan with Ratk marks the northern boundary of the grazing grounds used by Kuwait Arabs. Batin is universally recognised as dividing line between adherents of Shaikh Mubarak and those of Ibn Eashid. If latter's tribesmen cross it they are regarded as raiders. As regards Hafar and its position in regard to Ibn Bashid—see paragraph 6 of my letter 1727 above mentioned. The wells of As Safah and A1 Gara'a occupy similar position vis a vis Bin-Saud. Wabrah wells are within the recognised sphere of the Umtair tribe who have always been subordinate to Shaikh Mubarak. Properly speaking their sphere also includes the Summan district to the southward. As regards Anta'a see Residency telegram 437, dated 6th June 1908, to India and enclosure to letter 1314 of 8th June 1908. The line Ilafar, Safah, A1 Gara'a, Wabrah and Anta'a forms the limit within which the Shaikh is responsible for safety of caravans. As regards Mussalamiyah. The bay is the head-quarters and main pro visioning base of the Kuwait pearling fleet. Any disputes arising there are referred to Kuwait and the locality is not used by other pearling boats. \ The islets of Qaru, Umm al Maradim and Kubar are all uninhabited and waterless, but are frequented by Kuwait boats for purposes of catching fish and turtle and gathering fuel, and are generally recognised as appertaining to Kuwait. Failakah is inhabited and governed by Shaikh Mubarak's brother. Shaikh levies ' zikat' or tithes on the following tribes roaming over tract in question, viz,:— Awazim, Umtair, Ajman and Bani Khalid with the exception of a few amimportant and distant sections.25 Telegram P., No. 844, dated the 16th August 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The India Office, London, Please refer to my telegram No. 843 and insert the following as conclud ing paragraph Begins. The above evidence holds equally good, so far as it applies, to the line adopted by His Majesty's Government, Both the line advocated in my letter No. 1727, dated 4th August, to the Government of India, and that now proposed by the Political Agent at Kuwait comprise an area smaller than that enclosed by the line adopted by His Majesty's Government. For this reason it is hoped that it may perhaps still prove practicable to substitute, in the interests of the Shaikh, during the course of negotiation, the southern boundary advocated by Captain Shakespear, or, failing that, the line advocated by me in my above letter. Ends. (Received on the 27th April 1913 with Political Secretary's letter No. 15, dated the 11th April 1913.) , ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [27th February.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [Amended Copy.] 9415 No. 1. Sir A. Hirtzel to Mr. Parker. India Office, 26th February 1913. My dear Parker, By Lord Crewe's instructions I enclose a statement of a possible basis of compromise as regards Kuwait. His Lordship hopes that it will not be used except in case of real necessity, since the Shaikh will certainly regard it with suspicion, and will (Cox anticipates) already be greatly disappointed by the loss of Um Kasar, Safwan, and Musallamiya, to say nothing of Anta'a. As to this last. Lord Crewe suggests—without pressing it—that if opportunity offers for obtaining a rectification of the southern limit so as to include Anta'a (as shown in green on the map enclosed) it should be taken. I enclose some extracts from an earlier report of Knox's which show the strength of the Shaikh's claims. It should in any case be pointed out to Hakki that all our claims are based, not on the Shaikh's unsupported statements, but on the evidence collected during the last five years by our own officers, who have personally examined the whole frontier. As regards the Turkish request for a right of way for their troops. Lord Crewe is at a loss to understand why they should want it, seeing that they apparently have easier means of access to Central Arabia (either by way of the Hedjaz, or from the Persian Gulf via Ojeir and Hofuf where they already have garrisons). He would, therefore, be disposed to refuse, unless it is strongly pressed for. If conceded it should be guarded by a strong proviso that no posts or garrisons are to be established along the line of march or elsewhere. You will have noticed that the Government of India ask that, if the compromise is adopted, they may have time and opportunity to explain the nature of it to the Shaikh before news of it can reach him from Turkish sources. Lord Crewe attaches importance to this. Yours, &amp;c., A. Hirtzel.26 Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Statement, The limits of Kuwait and of the tribes subordinate to the Shaikh are as defined in annex 4 to the British note of the 18th July 1912. That is to say— 2. From the coast at the mouth of the Khor-es-Zubair the line proceeds in a north-westerly direction up to and past the walls of the port at Safwan to Jebel Sanam and the Ar Ratk ridge. From the latter point it runs in a south-westerly direction along the Batin to, and including, the wells of Hafar, whence it turns to the south-east between the districts of Summan and Dabanah, till it reaches the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. From that point it runs north-east to the Na'airiyah till at the north-west corner of Radaif, and thence to the coast at Jebel Manifah. 3. The islands included in the limits of Kuwait are those mentioned in the annex above referred to, 4. Within the limits specified a circle shall be drawn with Kuwait town as its centre and a radius of approximately 60 English miles, including Warba Island and the mid-channel of the Khor Abdullah to the north, Qrain Hill to the south, and Kubbar Island on the south-east. Within the territory thus circumscribed the complete autonomy of the Shaikh of Kuwait shall be guaranteed, as defined in the British Note of the 29th July 1911. 5. Outside this circle and within the wider limits described in paragraph 1, the existing status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the Shaikh shall continue to levy tithes, and there shall be no direct Turkish administration, and no Turkish garrisons; and further, the Turkish Government shall agree to take no action, military or other, within those limits without previous arrangement with us. 6. Provided that there shall be a right of way for the passage of Turkish troops by the recognised caravan routes across Kuwait limits in the direction of Nejd, without, however, the right of establishing posts and garrisons as above mentioned. Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Anta'a, Extract oj letter from Major S. G. Knox^ Political Agenty Kuwaiti dated the 23rd May 1908. It does not appear, so far as my information goes, Anta'a is in any shape or form a portion of the Walayat of Basra. It was a halting place thirty-five years ago for the Turkish expeditionary force that took El Ahsa, and since then only one Turkish official has ever visited it, and he formed the solitary Turk in a raiding party of the Ajman tribe on the Umtair. The inhabitants declare themselves to be subjects of Shaikh Mubarak-as-Subah, and this is supported by the statement of the Shaikh, but it would seem that the de facto suzerain at present is Muhammad-bin-Hithlain, Shaikh of the Ajman, who was imprisoned last year by Shaikh Mubarak. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Extracts from Major Knox's report. The Political Agent was unfortunately bound by his own voluntary undertaking given to Shaikh Mubarak that he would not proceed further south than Anta'a villages, and so nothing better than a short excursion to the hill of Midr'a, which permitted of the return in one day, could be attempted, but the Wadi-al-Amya promises to repay further examination. It does not appear that the Turk has ever established any effective occu pation there and to elicit this fact alone has amply repaid the Political Agent for his journey, .27 The people of Anta'a maintained, without leading questions that their relations with Kuwait were of the most friendly and binding nature, and that they considered the Shaikh of Kuwait as their suzerain rather than the Amirs of Eiadh or the Turk at El Ahsa. Shaikh Mubarak looks upon Anta'a as within the Kuwait boundaries and the fact of the welcome received by the Political Agent and the possibility of his travelling the 150 miles to that point without the slightest molestation of any kind lends support to the view, and enables one to form an estimate of the hold that the Kuwait Shaikh has obtained over the surrounding country. Foreign visitors have, up to date, been only Turkish. The first was one A1 Fakhri, who had with him soldiers in the time of Ibrahim Pasha, who took Addir lya, probably an Egyptian. Then came a Turkish commandant with soldiers about thirty-five years ago [?] at the time of the Turks' entry into El Ahsa. After this 'visit came another, Brahim Pasha, unaccompanied by soldiers this time, and apparently raiding with the famous Ajman Chief, Eaikan, on the Umtair. This gentle man is said to have formed a project for building a fort here for the Turkish Government, but it came to nothing. Apparently, the people of Anta'a do not pay tribute to anybody, except the akhawat to the liedouins, neither to Bin S'ud, nor to Bin Subah, nor to the Turks. Shaikh's rights are one-tenth of produce of village, but no other rights whatever. Difficult cases are brought to Kuwait for shara' settlement. Enclosure 4 in No. 1. Extract of letter from Captain TV, JEL. J. Shakespear, Political Agent, dated Kuwait, the 23rd March 1910. According to Bedouin information, it would seem that my route ran for some days along what is recognised as the boundary of Shaikh Mubarak's territory. It may be of interest to note that this territory would be included b\ a line joining Jasirat-al-Amayir (or Jinna ?) on the coast with Anta'a thence to As Safa, A1 Hafar, following A1 Batin to Ar Ratk, whence east- south-east to the Khor-um-Kasr to just south of that fort, and the sea on the east. Some doubt seemed to exist as to whether Warba and Bubivan Islands could be included, but Falaikha certainly is. y Enclosure 5 in No. 1. Extract from Captain Shakespear 1 8 Diary, dated the 25th February 1910. Marched at 8-25 and struck a bit south-west to make the hi^h road between Jahara and Safwan, which runs almost perfectly straight between the two places, and not as shown on the map. Were sniped at for some time by Thukara, who refused to be convinced by the waving of cloaks that we vere peaceable travellers. Finally, had to go and threaten them with Mubarak's wrath before they would desist. Captain G. B. Brucks, 1829.—' From Granejto Khore-el-Kuffaoee aW the Arabian coast the authority of the Shaikh of Grane is partially 3 acknow ledged by the Bedouin tribe, who are mostly of the A1 Ali, and a branch of the Bern Kalid, and some wandering parties of other tribes; also some few straggling camps of the Montifie tribe, who come this way at certain seasons.'

From—The Politcal Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreig-n Secretary, Delhi. Shaikh of Kuwait writing on 11th March informs me that Ottoman Government authorities have asked representative of Shaikh of Kuwait at Basra to obtain from Shaikh of Kuwait confidentially a memorandum setting forth boundaries of territory claimed by Shaikh of Kuwait. In reply Shaikh of Kuwait says he has given his representative a memorandum to show informally to Ottoman Government authorities as desired and sends me a copy of it. Document rather crudely worded, but the following is the boundary claimed as I read it— Shaikh of Kuwait claims that Jubail-al-Bahri is his southern limit on the coast. North of that point coastwards he claims everything as far as Khor Abdullah, including Failakah, Bubiyan, Warbah and their waters. On the north he includes Um Kasr and Safwan in his limits. From Safwan boundary goes due west to Batin and thence follows Batin to include Hafar, thence to the most southerly point in the south centre which he places at Al Ilabes, said to be just south of Minaisir-al-Ghara. From thence boundary claimed by him passes south of Anta'a and thence south-eastward to the coast at Jubail at Bahri. Addressed Foreign, Delhi; repeated Secretary of State for India.

Present stage of case is that negotiations are in progress on basis of memorandum of 18th July, but difficulties about boundaries are being raised by Turks and compromise described in letter from Hirtzel to Parker enclosed in Political Secretary's letter No. 9 of 28th February may have to be put forward by Foreign Office. They will, however, try to get Anta'a for Shaikh. 2. Should you think it politic now to prepare his mind for loss of Musalamieh, Um Kasr, Safwan and possibly Anta'a. He could be assured in general terms that nothing less than firmest guarantee of his autonomy on basis of memorandum quoted above, will satisfy His Majesty's Government, but that insistance on wider limit which he claims would wreck negotiations. I leave to your decision the form that is likely to be least unpalatable to him, but details should be avoided. For fear Turks should get wind of it, it is extremely undesirable to mention the possible compromise. Becognition of autonomy may entail his receiving Turkish Agent and he had better be warned of this. It can be explained in manner you suggest in your telegram of the 13th July. Since situation in Constantinople is very uncertain and Government may fall and negotiations lapse, communication should be made to him in strictest confidence.

Kindly refer to compromise described in India Office letter, dated the 26th February, a copy of which was received with Political Secretary's letter No. 9. The following telegram has been received from Sir P. Cox :—'I would earnestly urge that right of way for Turkish troops be refused, at all events within 60 miles from seawards and from circle. The Turks, being in possession of such right, would, in practice, be able to threaten Kuwait without violating letter of the compromise with us and put pressure on Shaikh and on the colourable pretext that troops were on the way to Central Arabia.' The view of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has my support.29 Telegram P., dated the 7tli (received 8th) April 1913.

On the condition that it remains autonomous and is not ajinexed by Bahrain, the Turkish Government are willing to withdraw entirely from El Katar.

The Resident, Bushire, who has been consulted in regard to the amount of monetary compensation that might, under proviso No. 2, be necessary, su^ests one thousand pounds and says Shaikh might possibly prefer to make a gracious present to the Turks of the island, they reciprocating in return with some suitable present, as for instance, a nice motor launch valued at about the above-mentioned sum.

Instructions hare been issued to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that, unless he has stroiv reasons to the contrary, he should warn the Shaikh that, if his autonomy is recognised, it may entail reception of lurkish Agent. If the Shaikh shows signs of uneasiness and_ Cox visits Kuwait in consequence, he has been told that he may or may not, just as he thinks advisable, prepare Shaikh for loss of places named in your telegram to which reference is made. , Telegram P., No. 153, dated (and received) the 10th April 1913, From—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Foreign Office telegraphs as follows No. 179, dated 9th April. The following telegram is for the Consnl-General at Bushire: ' The following line for the Turco-Persian frontier in the neighbourhood of llohammerah Las been proposed by the Turks. The point where theShatt-i-Niasan runs into the Hor-el-Azam is the beginning of the line. The situation of this point is between Neshva (the administrative centre of the commune of the same name which is dependent on the Kaza of Kurna) and Hawiza, about nine hours west of the latter. ' The line then follows the edge of the Hor-el-Azam in a south-west direc tion, and that part of the Hor-el-Azam, which lies north of Shuaib, and by our line belongs to Persia, is left to Turkey; it then joins our line at the point where the Nahr Lawi runs into the Hor, west of Shuaib, and coincides with it, leaving all the Hor south of Shuaib, as far as point on a level with Kushk-i- Hawiza (about latitude 31 deg. 8 min.) to Persia. Then the line, leaving ours, strikes slightly south of east and passes north of some tents of the Berri Sakaiw (sic) (but presumably Beni Sakain—P. Z. C.) which are thus included in Turkey limits. It passes south of Kushk-i-Howiza and north of Kushk-i- Basra. The former place is left to Persia, while the latter goes to Turkey. The line then continues east till slightly beyond longitude 48 deg. 15 min. and then turns slightly west of south continuing thus till the Shatt-el-Arab is reached just opposite the island of Umm-al-Hassassif; Failieh being thus just left to Persia. ' It coincides with our line for the rest of the way except that the island of Bahriya is given to Turkey on the ground that it lies to the south of the Persian island of Muhalla, whereas it is marked on our maps as lying north of Muhalla and on that ground assigned to Persia. ' I do not think that any territory which is inhabited by Bani Sakain or other tribes dependent on Hawiza can be allowed to go to Turkey, nor that the line should turn south towards the Shatt-el-Arab at any point further east than our own line as the frontier would then be brought too near to Mohammerah, but in your opinion is there any objection to the contemptible part of the Hor which lies north of Shuaib and is assigned by us to Persia, being ceded to Turkey and also Kushk-i-Basra itself which apparently lies just on the Persian side of the line which we propose. The Turkish Government are anxious to obtain the latter concession. Please ascertain the true position of Banriya if practicable.' Telegram P., dated the 11th April 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—Foreign Office, No. 699 (repeated to His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. No. 200—699). With reference to your telegram, dated 9th April, which was received through His Majesty's Minister. In the remarks which follow reference is invited to the four maps which were enclosed in the memorandum to the Turkish Ambassador, dated 18th July 1912, and to the two maps which accompanied Wilson's report, dated 5th July 1912. (1) The meaning of the sentence in your telegram referring to ' Neshva' is not intelligible to me. I presume that this is another spelling of the name Neshweh,' but the latter place is situated south of Kurna on the Shatt-el- Arab. See above-mentioned map and Lorimer's gazetteer, page 98. (2) The main object to be secured in settling the precise boundary north of Shuaib is that the Turks shall not be given any footing on terra firma to the east of the marsh, as this is within the Beni Truf's sphere. The embouchure of the Shatt-i-Niasan would in any case be a dubious point to specify, as it has not been accurately fixed. I would, therefore, urge that Bisaitin be taken as our basis of calculation as this settlement has been fixed astronomically, and I would suggest (if we are to make any concession here) that instead of the line being supposed to start from the entry of the Ghor-el-Muhaisin, 18 miles west of Bisaitin, we should concur in the shifting of it nine miles to the east and that it should be supposed to start from the exit of the Ghor-el-Douvil; i e., the place which is referred to as Umm Chir in paragraph 6 of Wilson's report of oth July. Prom that point the line should be drawn south-west until it strikes our line at the soathern extremity of the small sheet of open water referred to in paragraph 5 of the said report.(3) With regard to the southern portion of the boundary. Provided that our line from Kishk-i-Basri to the Shatt-el-Arab is accepted ■without further question, I do not see any serious objection to the angle of our line at Kishk-i- Basri being shifted northwards, just sufficient to bring that place into corner of Turkish territory, and at any rate not higher than latitude 31 degrees. But I would urge the absolute necessity that no other modification of our line should be agreed to between that parallel and the Shatt-el-Arab. (4) With regard to ' Bahriya'. It would seem that the discrepancy is due merely to names having been confused. The island which the Turks refer to must be the one mentioned in Lorimer's gazetteer on page 253, i.e., the upper one of the two islands without names which are shown in our map No. 3. The island which appears as ' Bahriyeh ' (sit?) on the left bank is part of the new ground to which reference is made under the entry ' Salbuq'* in the gazetteer at page 1653. Is any further local enquiry to be made under these circum stances ? Telegram P., dated the 28th (received 29th) April 1913. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla (repeated to Bushire). The line suggested by the Eesident, Bushire, in his telegram of 11th instant, in regard to the Mohammerah frontier, has been accepted by Hakki with the proviso that line should be rectified if, on delimitation, it is found that territory on Nahr Khaiyin was in effective Turkish occupation at date of signature of Convention. Careful watch should be maintained, and any endeavour on the part of the Turks to disturb the existing status quo in the meantime should immediately be reported. Telegram R., No. 782, dated the 29th (received 30th) April 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Secretary of State's telegram of 28th April, regarding Mohammerah Frontier. As His Majesty's Government are aware lands along Khaiyin from Dialji to Ealliyeh are most valuable to Shaikh and necessity for maintaining unimpaired our influence and position with him seems to make it out of the question for us to let them go to Turks. This being the case I presume His Majesty's Government have only allowed Hakki Pasha's proviso to stand, because they consider it merely p'o/brma and fully intend that it shall be nothing more. In my judgment it is essential that in warning Shaikh we should inform him to the latter effect, and I solicit instructions to do so. According to my information there is a very strong inclination abroad among Arabs of Mesopotamia and Shatt-el-Arab to take advantage of Turkey's present weakness in order to throw off her yoke, and having regard to the all powerful influence which Mohammerah and Kuwait wield over them there can be little doubt of what would be result of any ill-advised attempt of the Porte to assail interests of Mohammerah in way suggested by Hakki Pasha's proviso, apart from this settlement is of course highly satisfactory.

Please see your telegram, 28th April. Cox telegraphs:— Begins. As His Majesty's Government are aware * * * highly satisfactory. Ends. We strongly support Cox's views and trust that he may be authorised to inform Shaikh as suggested.32 Telegram P., dated the 5th (received 6tli) May 1913. From—His Majesty's Secretary of State for India, London, To—His Excellency the Viceroy, Simla. Mohammerab. Keference your telegram, dated the 1st instant. Settle ment purports to fix frontier as recognised locally. Question at issue is, there fore, purely one of fact and this Hakki admits. His Majesty's Government obviously cannot support Shaikh's claim if Boundary Commissioners find that land between Nahr Nazaileb and Diaiji was on 1st January 'effectively occupied and administered by Ottoman authorities,' but evidence produced by Wilson and Cox is so strong that we regard proviso as mere pro jorma and intimation may be given to Shaikh as above. It will eventually be necessary to obtain an agreement from Shaikh binding him, his successors and heirs to place his interests at Shatt-el-Arab invariably in the hands of the British Member of Eiverain Commission. No action should, however, be taken at the present moment. Telegram P., No. 830, dated (and received) the 8tli May 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla. Please refer to your telegram No. 10i S., dated the 7th May 1913. In his telegram, dated the 28th April, Secretary of State speaks of lands being in occupation of Turks 'at date of signature of Convention'. And in his present telegram Secretary of State says that ' if land was on 1st January effectively occupied '. What does date 1st January signify ? The Convention indicated is, I understand, that which will contain the agreement relating to the frontier. Telegram P., No. 843, dated (and received) the llth May 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Foreign Secretary, Simla, I have received, with demi-official letter, dated 18th April, from India Office, the final Draft Agreement in connection with the Kuwait negotiations. The Political Agent has also written me a letter after seeing recent papers on return from tour. The following are his recommendations :— (а) that terms Kaimmakam and Kaza are infra dig and should be altered to Mutessarif and Sanjuak; (б) that Shaikh will object strongly as he has never dreamt of the possibility of having to receive a Turkish Agent who will become an inconvenient focus of intrisrue. o (c) that, for the reason that difference of powers in the two zones will be taken advantage of by Bedouin, full autonomy should extend to outer Zone; (rf) that the walls of A1 Habeh claimed by Shaikh (please see my telegram No. 588) have been visited and located by Political Agent, and that they are without doubt within boundary and practical control of Shaikh. The wells he places in longitude 47 degrees 5 minutes and latitude 27 degrees 15 minutes and 25 seconds; (e) that Turkish troops should be granted right of way no nearer than road passable along west of Batin from Basra to Hafar. In my opinion, (a) would help to gild the pill for the Shaikh; (5) is in accordance with views already expressed, but which have not been accepted; (&lt;?) is important and would naturally be welcome, but I apprehend is also res judicata j {d) might still be obtainable for the reason that it is within Shaikh's40 En foi de quoi, les Plenipotentiaires respectifs ont signe la pr^sente convention et y ont appose leurs cachets.

In compliance with the request which, under instructions from your Government, you were good enough to make to me on the 16th ultimo, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith copies of the agreements concluded by His Majesty's Government with the Trucial Chiefs of Oman and the Shaikhs of Bahrain and Kuwa't, to which reference is made in the memorandum com municated to Your Highness on the 29th July last. With respect to these agreements His Majesty's Government have the following observations to make :— Ag regards No. 1, His Majesty's Government have inforned the Shaikh of Kuwait that so long as he and his heirs and successors act up to their obliga tions under the agreement, His Majesty's Government undertake to support them and accord them their good offices. His Majesty's Government reserve « to themselves the right to interpret that term at their discretion. &lt;f ^ His Majesty's Government hold, moreover, a lease of land from the Shaikh of Kuwait. As regards No. 4, His Majesty's Government take occasion to remind the Sublime Porte that British rights in the Persian Gulf and on the coast rest not merely on the agreements concluded, and transmitted herewith to the Ottoman Government, but on the custom, consent and long -established relations between the local chiefs and the Government of India. Mis Majesty's Government hope that in the communication of these agreements, together with the supplementary declarations which are hereby brought to the notice of the Ottoman Government, the Sublime Porte will see proof of His Majesty's Government's good will and desire to facilitate the conclusion of the negotiations set forth in their above-mentioned memorandum.

The document is divided into two parts. Most subjects relate to Turkish claims to sovereignty in the region, including the presence of Turkish garrisons, and were chosen and prepared because of the negotiations between the British and Turkish authorities connected to the Baghdad Railway plans.Part I (folios 2-35) covers various subjects and is organised into eleven chapters, each devoted to a different topic or geographical area, as follows: Chapter I, British interests in the Persian Gulf, Extent of Arabian littoral; Chapter II, Extent of Hasa and Katif [Qatif], Claims of the Turks to the whole of Eastern Arabia, Extent to which Turkish claims on the Arabian littoral are recognised by His Majesty's government, Proposed arrangement with the Turkish Government defining their sphere of influence on the Arabian littoral; Chapter III, Turkish occupation of El Bida [Doha], Extent of the Katar [Qatar] Peninsula; Chapter IV, Turkish designs on Katar, Policy of His Majesty's Government; Chapter V, Trucial Chiefs (Pirate Coast); Chapter VI, Maskat [Muscat] and Gwadar; Chapter VII, Kuwait; Chapter VIII, Um Kasr [Umm Qasr], Bubiyan and Warba; Chapter IX, Bahrain, Zakhnuniyeh [Zahnūnīyah] and Mohammerah [Korramshahr]; Chapter X, Proposed British action consequent on Turkish aggression; Chapter XI, Pearl fisheries. There are three appendices containing further correspondence relating to the main text.Part II (folios 36-60) relates entirely to the Baghdad Railway and the negotiations between the British and Ottoman authorities that the proposal of the railway initiated. The negotiations covered several matters, including: the political statuses of Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar; the location of the railway's terminus; the ownership of the railway; and the creation of a commission for the improvement of navigation in the Chatt-el-Arab [Shaṭṭ al-‘Arab]. It opens with an introduction of the related issues (folios 37-41) followed by the relative correspondence (folios 42-53).
