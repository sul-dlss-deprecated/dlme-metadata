Sir, Conditions of Service, British Police Personnel I have.to report, for your information, the following matters concerning the Police Detachment, British personel, now present in Bahrain. The detachment travelled from Glasgow to Alexandria by sea on S.S. Batory as Second Class civilian passengers. All other civilian passengers travelled First Class, including members of Police Forces and wives of N. C. 0.s travelling to other parts of the world and a number of members of the Local Oil Company. During the voyage, it was with difficulty that I explained away matters which arose from time to time, distinguishing ourselves from the First Class passengers, e.g. difference in food, availability of certain entertainments and deck space. I would, however, take this opportunity of informing you that our detachment aquitted themselves exrtremely well in assisting in the conducting of the ship’s entertainments and the raising of money for ship's charities. With respect to the travelling and experience gained by us, I would commend to your serious consideration that future personel should travel First Class, both coming from and returning to the United Kingdom. The Sergeant, one constable and myself arrived at Bahrain on 29th August, 1945&gt; at the British Overseas Airway's Seaplane Base. I had previously des patched from Baghdad a cable and from the British Overseas Airway's radio station at Basra, information of our arrival. On arrival, we were not met by anyone and I at once coraraonicated by telephone to the residence of the British Advisor that we had arrived and also that P.C. Smith was ill and required immediate medical attention. We nevertheless waited for 1 hour and 20 minutes and still no arrangement having come to hand to deal with our removal, we took steps on our own behalf. By the courtesy of a gentleman of the local Oil Company, who happened to be there with a motor vehicle, we conveyed P.C. Smith to Hospital, where he was detained, then Sergeant Cochrane and myself proceeded to contact the British Advisor. Here arrangements had been put in hand personally by the British Advisor for meals for that day. ACCOMMODATION After breakfast, we went to our appointed quarters at Fort Bungalow, where, on our arrival, we found the premises still in the hands of the Public Works Department. They were not properly equipped, being particularly deficient in normal kitchen requirements. Drinking water on the premises amounted to something like four gallons and when finished, we discovered that no arrangements had been made for further supplies and it was, in fact, necessary to buy water until arrangements had been made by ourselves. A cook was on the premises, having been found for us and was in possession of certain rationed goods only, but nothing else whatsoever with which he could provide us with a meal. There was no refrigerator or ice boxes and but one block of ice, which, when melted away, we discovered could not be replaced until some arrangement had been made by ourselves. We were in Bahrain five days before we succeeded in being able to send out any laundry. After such a Journey, having regard to the climatical conditions, the nt had expended all clean clothing. During the period that the laundry he hands of the Dhobi, it was necessary for the men to wear soiled On the 31st August, 1945, P«C. Robinson was taken ill with some form of stomach trouble and on my return to the Fort with Sgt. Cochrane from Manama, I found that the other men had had to strain the last drop of water, from the botton of a water container, through a handkerchief, to give a drink to the man who had been taken ill. I had him removed to the State Hospital, where he was detained. We discovered, usually in the mornings, that our quarters were subject to an unpleasant stench, which, upon investigation, it was discovered came from a cesspool within the Fort compound and which was immediately outside the^rear ofour quarters ajid remained uncovered for the greater part of the day, the contents being frequently disturbed by the prisoner's, whose duty it was to empty the cesspool. I complained of this to the Superintendent and the cesspool was promptly cemented over which rectified this matter. punas There was no information available as to exactly what our duties were to be, when we were to commence and from where we were to operate. The only information available was in connection with setting up a Traffic Department. The local. Inspector was obviously unaware of the duties that we expected to be allocated to us in accordance with the Home Office circular issued at the time applications were sought in connection with our respective appointments. MOBILITY We came then up against transport difficulties between our quarters and the town and upon making enquiries concerning transport, we were informed that there were ei^it pedal cycles at our disposal, which, under no circumstances could be accepted, for the obvious reasons of the climate and the effect on local prestige. The mobility of the detachment is practically nil as there is no reasonable means of transport provided. One old motor cycle was put into working order and was provided for our use. This very soon broke down, which left us again, immobile. Taxis are not always available and I was unable to ascertain if such could be hired on Police business and charged to Police accounts. In one instance, in connection with an accident at Muharraq on the 6th September, 1945, it took two hours to get members of the detachment to the scene of the accident, which is not compatible with Police efficiency. In this accident, there were at least seven persons injured, one of whom has since died. All the members of the detachment are certificated First Aid men and what steps they may have been able to take to preserve the life of the dead man can never be assessed. This difficulty can only be overcome by a sufficiency of transport at their disposal. I have heard, locally, that there are motor cars and refrigerators loaned out to non government persons at a nominal rent by the British Advisor’s Department. It is, therefore, difficult to understand why my department should have to be devoid of any form of mobility. LAMPS The detachment was issued with eight half size hurricane lamps for use during the periods when the electricity was turned off, which is every alternate half hour after sunset. They served the purpose only of allowing one to see the way about . ' on the premises, but did not give sufficient light for reading, writing etc. The working time available, therefore, was greatly reduced and to overcome this, application was made for the supply of three ’Ga-s Lamps. This application was refused by the British Advisor on the ground that hurricane lamps were sufficient. KITCHEN ALP COOKHOUSE The kitchen and cookhouse were not properly equipped, as previously stated. The fittings were old, worn and filthily dirty. The kitchen tables required renewing. This was brought to the personal attention of the Superintendent who agreed and said that until they could be renewed, he would have the ones at present in use cleaned and planed at once. It was never done. OFFICIAL OPTICS No provisions had been made for an official office and after some debate, I agreed to use my sitting room as an office, pending some alternative arrangement. I was offered office accommodation, which was not even equipped with a fan. This I, of course, refused. I have now been promised that a fan, taken from the British Advisor's Department, will be provided. EURNISKENGS Bach room was fitted with the barest necessities of furnishings. There wasI . - &lt;s&gt; ■ y ■' an insufficiency of cutlei*y, a good deal of sundry forms of crockery which barely met the necessities of a meal. Saucers had to be used for fruit dishes, a large enamel bathroom jug for table water and frequently one would have to wait for a ciirty plate to be washed up, before a clean plate could be provided icr the next course. There were no curtains at all. Cupboards and wardrobes were not provided with locks in working order and many of the windows were deficient oi wire gauze. In no way could the premises be considered fitting accommodation lor a European detachment, whose subsequent reputation much depended on local standing. .&lt;e were assured that all the necessary furnishings etc. were on their way from India and would arrive in due course. o V £ XT' tv*' I would, however, point out that before coming to Bahrain, the detachment was assured by the India Office that premises were being built for them ana that [ there was little doubt that they would be properly air conditioned, as all new ' j buildings were being so equipped. As far as we were concerned, the only new building was one isolated bedroom at the rear of our quarters, approximately 218 X 18* in which there are twelve windows and one door, none of which are fitted with any form of sunshade shutters. This room can only be enlikened to an artificial hothouse. In another room, it is necessary to accomnodate two men. This room is approximately 21' X 15* and except for two beds and one wardrobe, it is devoid of furniture. OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE The only assistance extended to the detachment was by Group Captain Leigh, the State Engineer and who, as far as I know, had no official connection with our arrival. Nevertheless, he made our acquaintance and upon finding the conditions that existed, he set to, to do what he could to assist us in connection with arrangements for regular supplies of water and ice and also with transport and any other matter which he could be helpful. For his help, the detachment will be for ever grateful. COST OF LIVING \ Information received at the India Office, Whitehall, London, was that the cost of living was quite normal, if not cheap. That this information was incorrect was borne out by the prices existing in the bazaar of the necessary needs of life. Had it not been that we were advised by Group Captain Leigh to seek N. A. A. F. I. andE.F.1. andD.I.D. privilege, which we have been temporarily granted, the detachment, undoubtedly, could not have existed on the salary at their disposal, far less within the messing allowance granted viz:- Rs. 100 per month. It is proposed to take up this matter further with the authorities in the light of experience, when tangible figures can be used to show the true state of the cost of living. LOCAL STATUS It was quickly discovered that the status of the local Inspector was on par the British Inspector and the remainder oi the detachment likewise to the members of the local force. Immediate application was made to the British Advisor for an adjustment of this most important matter by promotion and that it be treated with the greatest urgency. The British Advisor agreed and promised results by the 7th September, 1945* On the night of the ?th September, 1945, I received a comnunication from him in writing authorising an elevation oi ohc six constables to the local rank of Sergeant. No mention was made of the Sergeant of the detachment or myself. The same evening I was in telephone communication with the Superintendent who infoimed me ohat the British Advisor had left for England that afternoon without clarifying the position as regards myself and the suggestion that the Sergeant should wear four stripes to distin guish him from and provide the necessary authority over the remainder ox the detachment. I was completely unable to understand this suggestion in connection with the Sergeant as I had never heard of any rank at all signified with four /stripesstripes. It was said that this would give him equivalent authority to a Sergeant Major in the local force. Therefore, I must point out, in the strongest possible terms, that my men are Police Officers and not soldiers and must not be confused as such. I informed the Sergeant of the suggestion. WELFARE The British Advisor, who is also Commandant of Police, on no occasion after our arrival, made any visit to our quarters to ascertain our conditions and after nine days, he left for England, some of the men never having seen him. Prom this direction, it appeared that the corrmon courtesy of . English etiquette was completely absent. A Mr. Smith, I understand is Acting British Advisor during the absence of Mr. Belgrave. No attempt was made to provide a meeting oetween myself and Mr. Smith and I was, in fact, informed by Mr. Belgrave, that the Acting British Advisor had no knowledge of Police Administration and that during the absence of Mr. Belgrave, the supervision of the British Detachment would be under the Superintendent Sheik Khalifa. This is in direct controversy of the terms of our agreement which state in Home Office Circular 35/4-5 dated 22nd February, 194-5* para. 2, Duties:- •'British Police personnel are particularly required for use in cases in which Europeans or Americans are involved, as the officers, N. C. 0. s and men of the State Police are Arabs, it is difficult for them to deal with Europeans and Americans. Additional duties of the British Police will include the supervision of the State Police, who are responsible for traffic control, which includes registration of cars. Police who are able to drive may be required to undertake the testing of applicants for driving licences. Police would also be called upon to assist in Passport Control and to give instructions in Police Duties and methods to the N.C. O.s and men of the State Police.' Under Para. 15 of the Conditions of Service it states, ''British Police Personnel will be under the control of the British Advisor to the Bahrain Govern ment who will be the disciplinary authority. They will have no right of appeal against his decisions unless the disciplinary action taken affects the terms of the contract, when Clause 14-will apply.' Clause 14- states: 'If any question arises under the contract as regards the meaning, or in any other respect, the question will be referred for decision to H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain, and his decision will be final.' IMPROVEMENTS Such improvements as have been achieved have only been the result of persistent complaints by myself, which is not the atmosphere of amenable working conditions. It is my considered opinion that it is necessary for some authority, properly qualified, and other than an authority directly interested, to enquire into the conditions that exist and have existed and therefrom draw conclusions sufficient to give direction to improve the conditions and place the detachment on a par with their conditions as Police Officers in their home country where they are held in the highest esteem. As things are at present, their whole position and prestige is in danger of collapsing beyond recovery. It has been said in form of excuse that our arrival at the time that we did was unexpected. I would point out that the arrival of this detachment was expected since February, hence, to those directly concerned, its appears inexplicable that they should be received and treated in the manner they have been and that they should be expected to serve under such conditions. If they continue as they are at present there could not be any possible guarantee of the success of their mission. For myself personally, if the matter does not receive immediate attention, I will have no alternative but to ask to be returned to the United Kingdom forthwith. As regards the other members of the detachment, such a decision, for them, must of necessity remain for each individual to decide. Signed;- C.H. Crowe. Inspector, Bahrain State Police. 10.9.45.GOtY © 19th November, 1945. Toj- The Commissioner, On 1st August, 1945, I was seconded from the Metropolitan Police for service with the Bahrain State police. On 1st November, 1945&gt; I tendered my resignation as a protest against the treatment accorded to the British Police Detachment, with its consequent loss of prestige. The matter begins with a report dated the 10th September, 1945* copy attached, which I submitted to the Political Agent and the Acting British Advisor, , complaining of the treatment the British police had been subjected too. f On 13 th September, 1945* I was interviewed by the Political Agent, who asked me to try and carry on as he wished to keep the complaint 'in the family,' meaning between himself, Sheik Khalifa, the Arab Superintendent, and the detachment/ Better conditions were promised with an immediate issue of refrigerator and a motor car. No refrigerator has been supplied up to the date of my departure. The motor car question is dealt with elsewhere in this report. On 14 th September, 1945* I was sent for by Sheik Khalifa, the Superintendent, who is also a member of the ruling house, and told I had been promoted Deputy Superintendent and Sergeant Cochrane, Inspector, both promotions dating from the 1st September, 1945* No further badges of rank were issued to me and the position was that I wore two stars on my shoulder, whilst Inspector Cochrane wore two on his shirt collar. Prom this date, Sheik Khalifa began to assume control over the British Detachment. He gave me instructions that all matters would be dealt with through him and also instructed me to salute him. Having in mind my promise to Mr.Pelly, the Political Agent, to try and make a success of my secondment, I complied with his instructions. After that, Sheik Khalifa would send for me to come to his office, where he would keep me up to fifteen minutes, sometimes standing, whilst he conversed in Arabic with one, two or three Arabic visitors. On the 20th September, 1945, the State Engineer issued me with a motor car, see letter attached, and on its arrival at the British Police Post, it was immediately taken by Sheik Khalifa, whose own car had broken down and in spite of a protest to the Political Agent and Acting British Advisor, he retained the car and was still in possession when I left. On the 4th October, 1945, Mr. Pelly, the Political Agent and Mr. Smith, the Acting British Advisor, inspected our quarters. As a result, curtains and furniture were supplied and an extra bathroom promised. On 31st October, 1945, Sheik Khalifa issued me with a memorandum, a copy of which is attached, signed by the British Advisor, Mr. Belgrave, setting out , the duties to be performed by the British Police. This memorandum was obviously I prepared before our arrival in Bahrain and clearly defines our duties. Why it I was not issued until two months after our arrival is, in my submission, because Sheik Khalifa wanted, and in fact did, assume a position to which he was not entitled, that of being in command of the British Detachment. I immediately forwarded a complaint to the political Agent and the Acting British Advisor, respecting the retention of the memorandum by Sheik Khalifa. I personally saw Mr. Smith, the Acting British Advisor respecting this matter and felt that I could only show my strongest protest, in tendering my resignation, in the hope that my action would strengthen the position of the British Police in Bahrain. Mr. Smith agreed that the position had now become intolerable and accepted my resignation, remarking that the action of Sheik Khalifa was inexplicable. During the whole time I was in Bahrain, it became a question of one complaint after another to get proper conditions of living etc. for the detachment. /MosquitoMosquito nets were not supplied until the 2nd November, 1945&gt; only after I had made a personal complaint to the State Medical Officer. The detachment have no winter uniforms or equipment and up to the time of my leaving Bahrain, were still wearing topees in the evenings, a source of amusement to Europeans. To quote an example of how the prestige of the detachment has been lowered, and I can quote many, at 3“30 a.m. on the 3rd November, 1945&gt; Mr. Price, Transport Manager of an Oil Company at Awali, an American, telephoned me to say that a motor truck had been stolen and was heading towards Manama, asking the British Police to take the necessary action. I had to apologise and tell him we were . [ unable to do anything in the matter as we had no transport. His answering remarks f K were most uncomplimentary respecting the efficiency of the British Detachment. I would like to state that in my opinion the detachment has tried to uphold the traditions of British Police prestige in spite of many difficulties. Traffic conditions, which were chaotic, have been placed on a sound footing. I I instituted card index systems for driving licences and Registration of motor cars. Traffic Signs have been placed in position in the towns, work had already commenced, on my instructions, for the erection of traffic refuges all over the Island and there has been a consideraole decrease in traffic accidents. ! I respectfully submit this report in the hope that my action in resigning my appointment be approved and that it may have no adverse effect against future advancement in the Metropolitan Police. C.H.

Yours sincerely. F.A.K. Harrison, Esq.,A OF BAHRAIN. 6734 Adviserate, Bahrain, November 25, 1945, I enclose a petition received through Shaikh Khalifah, from the British Police Detachment, State Police, for an increase in their basic pay, in view of the fact that same has been raised at home, for your consideration and instructions. I hate to worry you like this on your holiday, but you can more easily check what increases on basic pays have been given at home, and of course, as Commandant of Police, it is only natural that the matter be referred to you. His Highness and Shaikh Abdulla left this morning for Dhahran, en route to their hunting groungs, in a calm sea and perfect weather, it still a trifle warm. Helen Gunn arrived yesterday after a boring journey overland from Port Said to Basrah, she is glad to be back. Best wishes to you both, hope you are having a good time. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Hsquire, C.B.H., 1. Queens T Gate I lace, London, S.7.7.No. P/V&lt;? of 1364/X94b Office of Traffic Branch State Police, Bahrain Dated 19th Dul-Haj, 1364. 24th November, 1945. The Superintendent, State Police. Subject*- British Detachment - application for increase in basic pay. Sir, I beg to submit for the consideration of The Bahrain Crovernnent through The A/Britiah Adviser this application for the increase of basic pay for The British Detachment who are at present serving for considerably less basic pay than they received in The United Kingdom. Whilst still in The United Kingdom and after appointment to seconded service with The Bahrain Government, the scales of pay of The British Police Forces were considerably elevated,thus making the difference between basic pay in Bahrain and England considerably greater than it was when the members of this detachment applied for secondment. The Detachment however pursued their seconoment having faith that when brought to the notice of The Bahrain Government it would be suitably adjusted. The Police in The Unitod Kingdom are paid on a scale of annual increments from a minimum to a maximum. I have taken a census of the scales of pay of The British Detachment and three are already on the maximum scale and the other three are only a few shillings short. I myself was on my maximum pay before leaving The United Kingdom. Therefore to avoid a complicated scale of increments I have based this application on the flat rate of the maximum, of the rank held by the members of The Detachment in The United Kingdom. The Detachment are in receipt of Rw.200 per month Messing Allowance which ofcourse is subject to fluctuation according to cost of living. I suggest therefore that The Messing Allowance be reverted to Rs.100, which was the original allowance, and Rs.100 added to the suggested new basic pay as a compensatory amount for. Foreign Service and not to be confused with Persian Gulf Allowance. In framing this application I have taken a long outlook having particular regard to inducement te renew contracts and also to ittiuce further recruits to fill vacancies if so required. The below comparison shows the present rate and the rate r»w applied for*- pRSSSNr RATH, PER MONTH. Inspector. Sergeant. Constable. Basic salary. Rs.400. Ra.300. Rs.200 Persian Gulf Allowance.

Rs+662 The above basic pay would be subject to lS y o increase War Allowance in accordance with The (Sovvennent Scale.I am aware that there has been considerable financial strain upon the members cf The Detachment and as was stated when application was made for increased Messiqg Allowance a feeling of disatisfaction prevailed. fthen opportunity presented itself I made the matter of basic pay known to the tthoiitifts and wasxassured that the matter would receive favourable consideration when an application was made. I therefore assured The Detachment that the matter would be adjusted. Earlier application could not be made as the increase* in pay was not published in England for Inspectors until recently. The Detachment was paid by The Bahrain Doverrment from 1st.^August, 1945,1 t herefere respectfully ask that subject to this application being granted the increased payments be made retfospective from the date The Detachment was taken on the strength of The Bahrain Government, i.e,, 1st.August,1945a I napectoi*.

Yours faithfully, HOBSON Sc SONS (LONDON) LTD., Manager. ^red^r 1 6AUG1846 smmmmEarly in 194*4- it became obvious that something would have to be done to control various unruly American elements in Bahrein, in particular employees of the Berchtel-McCone-Parsons Corporation engaged in refinery construction, and American Merchant Seamen, (For exanples of the difficulties that arose see Ecfc.3168/44, Ext. 3169/44 and Ext. 4772/44)* As these men are civilians they are not subject to American military law, and could not be controlled by U.S. Provost personnel as was originally suggested (Ext.2114/44, E^t. 2768/44, Ext. 3166/44 fiuid Ext. 3502/44)* It was obviously impossible for the local Arab police to deal with them unaided (Ext.2829/44) and it was considered that though there was a great deal to be said for letting the Americans control their own 'roughs”, yet H.M.G. was responsible to some extent for law and order in Bahrein, and particularly for the control of foreigners (Ext.3905/44). Paiforce proved unable to supply military police on a permanent basis, and a suggestion that suitable men should be recruited from the National Fire Service proved unworkable (Ext.3543/44, flags X and Y). It was therefore decided that eight policemen, one inspector, one sergeant and six constables, should be recruited in this country and seconded for service under the Bahrein Government, conditions of service being based on those of the Palestine Police (Ext.4309/44, flag Z, Ext.5673/44, flag C). The Home Office were approached (Ext. 4309/44), and although rather dubious of the result, agreed to circulate Police Forces in the United Kingdom (Ext.304^/45 and flag A). In the event 173 applications were received, and that in spite of the fact that the men were told they could not take their wives and families with them. The applicants were shortlisted to 27 (flag B) who were interviewed at the India Office on March 28th and 29th. * One inspector, one sergeant and six constables were selected with an inspector, a sergeant and three constables as second choice (Ext.1306/455* One constable scratched later, and the inspector failed to pass the ffledical Board. The final choice was therefore an inspector from the Metropolitan Police, a sergeant from the Northamptonshire Constabulary, two constables from the Metropolitan Police, two from the Birmingham City Police, and one each from the Surrey Police and the Worcestershire Constabulary. Details of their qualifications will be found in the papers immediately below Ext. 2963 / 45 . Sumner and winter police uniforms, etc., have been supplied by Messrs. Hobson and Sons, Limited (Ext. 2901/45 and Ext. 3l6l/45) and the men left this country cm the 1st August for Egypt, whence they are to travel by Nairn transport to Iraq and so to Bahrein by sea (flag D). ay^u, ft*#**- ^ q /iSt- ‘V ?

For this i*eason and in view of the possibility of the men being held up on the journey, we support your proposal to press the Bahrein Government to pay salaries during the journey. To safegcad the amount of pensions, the salaries should not be less than their present pensionable pay, although deductions could be made as a messing charge while they are on board ship. /In F. A.

Under the terras of their engagement they are entitled to a second-class passage to Bahrein from the U.K. on first appointment. Would you kindly inform the men direct of detailed arrangements (including luggage) when you are in a position to do so, and also let us know in advance in order that we may inform their Police authorities in this country as far in advance as possible of the date of departure. We are dealing with their passports and exit-permits. / I enclose a list of their names and addresses.

The point about which they appeared to be chiefjy ooncerned was whether Utey would be covered by the Police Pensions Act during this interim period. They said that according to a strict inter pretation they would not be so covered. X was not in a position to controvert this and undertook to put it to the Home Office for their consideration. (Clause C of the Bahrein Governnent' a 'Conditions of Service’* is relevant. ) On the question of pay durir^ the interim period, they ^ v « r ^ satisfied about this, though they admitted that k the ftahfein Goveraaent had no obligation. I told than tlxat the matter had been tiioroughly gone into and that I understood tliat the Home Office had now replied on the point to those Police authorities who had raised it. Major Hiokinbotham said to me afterwards that he uot think the dahrein Govemment would denxir at paying the men from the date of leaving their own Polide foroe, if we put it to ui&amp;iiU He mentioned tiiat if the men were held up at B om bay (wliere they r oiiange siiip) on their outward Journey to the Persian Gulf the period of their outward journey would be increased, and this was a consideration in favour of such a concession. You may prefer to regard the matter as now closed, but if the Home Office so desire we should be preparedwould agree to pay the men basic salary from the * Six of the men asked for loans to be advanced to them on behalf of the Bahrein Government, ana we are authorising the payment of £30 in each oe»e. We are hoping to arrange passages in about a armth’s time. I will let you know the exact date when fixed. A.T.L.

The following points emerged;- * 1 1. The uniforms will be made either of Barathea or Yvhipcord - Hobson's will send ua patterns. They will be • cut like those for British officers. Mr. Ball favoured my suggestion that perhaps the Inspector and the Sargeant might wear LSam Browne belts (which would have to be second hand) to distinguish them, since it is not possible to give them a slightly better uniform as in the case of the Palestine Police. IT 2. Hobsons will also send us patterns for the shirts to be worn under this uniform. Apparently poplin, which sounded the more suitable, is hard to come by and the shirts may have to be flannel. They will also supply khaki ties to match, * 3. The question of buttons and badges then arose. Mr. Ball suggested that they might wear as rank badges the five pointed star which was considered, but apparently never adopted, for the Colonial Police (sample attached). In that case they would have to have plain white metal buttons (it is not practicable in any case to manufacture buttons with a .crest or lettering on them for 8 men only) and a cap and possibly collar and lapel badges embroidered with silver thread. We shall have to find out from Bahrein whether they have considered the question of badges. 4. Mr. Ball favours a blue peaked cap as worn by the Palestine Police. 5. The khaki shorts which are made very wide for tropical climates have 1 fro buckles in front instead of at the sides making them more ’Mdlitary lo' king'.mm - ■ 6. ] r. Ball considers Bush tunics far the most suitable ior the summer. Bush shirts 3 as sup ested by the Adviser, are now going out of fashion, Lne socks will have to be short utility ones. 6. Stocking garters are unobtainable and-the policemen w5_il just have to tie string round their calves. Cork ; • B^lt hats are also iinpossible, but t’tirdffj. topees as opposed to 8qmbay ones, which are ^made of pith, can be produced. 1-. Mr. Ball and his assistants are all against a mackintosh, or a^ trench coat lined with oil silk, which would be difficult to obtain and would perish in a hot climate. They will .send us patterns of material for a light overcoat and also for a rather heavier one which they think might.be preferable® 11. They will not promise to have the unifoims ready for another six to eight weeks. (Apparently if they are delivered in this country purchase tax must be paid, but if they are sent out afterwards they count as exnort and there is no purchase tax.) 1' . Kobsons will see the policemen any day except Saturday, preferably in the morning. I suggested Wednesday or Thursday of next weex and said we would let them know© 3dSUGOKSTEP LIST OF UNIFORM ETC, FOR BAHREIN POLICE 2 Khaki serge uniforms (Tunic and trousers) 1 Khaki (or Blue) Peaked Cap 2 pairs Khaki shorts (light weight for simmer) 4 Short-sleeved 'Bush-tunics' / * '' 2 Long-sleeved 'Bush-tunics' 3 pairs Brown leather shoes 6 pairs shoe laces 6 pairs Khaki socks 6 pairs Khaki stockings 1 pair stocking garters 1 sun helmet (Bombay Topee) 1 Khaki mackintosh (with detachable fleece lining) 1 Police whistle 1 Khaki whistle cord (To be provided by the men themselves):- Thin aertex underclothing (vests and pants) Sun glanses Bathing shorts Gym shoes.r UNIFORMS ETC, FOR BAHREIN POLICE As suggested by Major Hickiribotham 2 Khaki serge uniforms (Tunic and long trousers) (as for Palestine Police) 1 Blue (or Khaki) peaked cap As suggested by Advisor (To be provided at expense of Bahrein Government, // &amp; t A* ) 1 ' - 2 pairs Khaki shorts (light weight for summer) 2 Short sleeved 'Bush-tunics”. 2 pairs Brown leather shoes 6 Khaki shirts, with double pockets in front, shoulder straps and attached collar which can be worn open. 3 pairs Brown shoes, medium weight 6 pairs shoe laces. 6 pairs Khaki socks 6 pairs Khaki socks. 6 pairs Khaki stockings 6 pairs Khaki stockings 1 pair stocking garters. 2 broad brimmed hats (as worn by British troops in the East) 1 sun helmet (Bombay Topee) 1 Khaki mackintosh (with detachable fleece lining) 1 Police whistle 1 Khaki whistle cord To be provided by men themselves.

However, whilst I fully realise I have to submit to the findings of the Medical Board, in mitigation may I be allowed to quote the following circumstances on the day in question: (1) I had had little sleep the previous night. (Duty reasons) (2) I was on duty until 10*00 a.m. on the day in question. (3) Travelling to London in crov/ded train, in uniform. W i ' i0 lunch, and difficulty in reaching Whitehall through crowded streets. In view of the above, and conditions which prevailed at tlie time, I was somewhat handicapped. I was very much surprised at iny failure, in fact so much so that I have since taken the liberty of consulting three well known doctors in this town, and enclose herewith their reports. In view of their findings I feel convinced that if I might be permitted to undergo a further medical examination, it would be to qy advantage.

I am 47 years of age, born in Luton, Bedfordshire, on the 7th January, 1898, and was educated at Christ Church School in that town. I am married, but my wife went to the United States in 1938, and is likely to remain there. In consequence I have no family ties, there being no children of the marriage. In January, 1915, I joined the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment, and after being transferred to the Royal Sussex Regiment subsequently served in France, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, France and Belgian respectively, being demobilised in March, 1919. Upon leaving the Army I was appointed a constable in the Bedford Borough Police Force on 5th April, 1919. Promoted Sergeant 22nd November, 1930. Promoted Inspector 20th April, 1939. I serve under Police Act, 1890, and am due for retirement on 5th April, 1945, after having completed 26 years 'approved service'. I have a thorough and sound knowledge of all phases of police duty, and have on occasions been commended by my Chief Constable for alertness and devotion to duty. I have conducted prosecutions at Police Court, been in charge of ceremonial parades, have thorough clerical and administrative abilities, whilst I am also a qualified Instructor in Physical Training, Foot Drill and Musketry. At the outbreak of the present war I was entrusted with the organisation and training of Special Constables, and have since been Instructor and Lecturer at Police War Reserve Training Schools. I am a strict disciplinarian, fully realising this is the 'key note' with any uniform body of men. My height is 6 feet 3 inches, weight approximately 15 stone, and at my age of 47 years I consider myself in a perfect state of physical fitness and as such have no qualms respecting any medical examination. During my military service in the Far East, I was in close contact with Arab tribes and have good knowledge of their habits and language; in consequence I feel confident I could train Bahrein State Police into an efficient body. f Should my application prove successful, it will always be ny first duty to serve ny country well, uphold its prestige, and also the traditions of the great Service to which I belong.

In accordance with permission granted to me by The Chief Constable and The Police Authority, I beg to submit herev/ith my application for the consideration of The Under Secretary of State, Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. I was born at Forfar, Scotland,on 29th., August,1912, of British parents. I was educated at numerous schools the result of my father being a soldier and travelling a great deal. I attended Forfar Academy Infant School and then Junior Schools in Ireland and India. I returned from India to attend Primary School at Forfar Academy, Scotland and when fourteen rejoined my parents in Burma and there attended an Army School. I enlisted in the 2nd., Battalion The Queen’s Own Cameron Highlanders on 16th., August,1927, as a boy and continued to attend school in the Army until eighteen years of age. I possess an Army First Class Certificate of Education. During my Army Service I was employed in The Quartermaster’s Department and The Orderly Room. Whilst still a boy I was appointed an N.C.O. i/c of the Boys of the battalion. On attaining Army manhood (18 years), I did my recruits’ training and was appointed Lance Corporal. I was a First Class Rifle, Revolver and Lewis Gun shot. I represented my Battalion in Athletics and was once selected reserve to represent the Army. I was given the opportunity to attend The Royal Military College, Sandhurst, but declined for financial reasons. I purchased my discharge on l?th., April,1932, having obtained an appointment as a Probationer with this Constabulary. I joined The Northamptonshire Constabulary on 18th.,April, 1932. I attended a three months training course at Derbyshire Constabulary Training School on the completion of which I was posted to Kettering (town:population 30,000) where I gained my first patrol experience and subsequently C.I.D experience. After eighteen months in Kettering I was posted to Weedon Sub-section which is situated on The Watling Street. I there gained experience in dealing with heavy commercial road traffic, driving and testing vehicles of all descriptions and road accidents of a serious nature and also of rural Police Duties connected with The Contagious Diseases of Animals. I married on 16th.,June,1934, and on that date was transferred to Wellingborough (town:population 24,000) where I gained further town experience. On 8th.,May,1938,I was transferred to The County Borough of Higham Ferrers, a town of 3,000 population, where I was the only Police Constable. I there co-operated with The Borough Authorities in the organisation of all A.R.P.Services. Whilst stationed there I attended the local Gas Training Course, attended an instructional visit to The Home Office Forensic Laboratory at Nottingham and was selected for a C.I.D., course at Wakefield, which was cancelled because of the outbreak of war. I was awarded the special pay increment for efficiency. P.T.O.v 2 . I was promoted Sergeant on 8 th«, November,1939&gt;and transferred to Kettering, where I am at present stationed.

March 1906, joining the Metropolitan Police Force on the 12th, July 1926, at the age of 20 years. On leaving Peel House Training School I was posted to Thornton station t Z t Division, also serving at South Norwood and Norbury St a xons in the same Divi ion until promoted to Sergeant in June, 19553. At these stations I obtained considerable experience with the regtiilation of traffic and traffic process, as the main road from London passed through this district and was specially employed on this particular work. On promotion to Sergeant I was posted to Tower Bridge Station *M* Division. At this station I had a large amount of experience in co nection with betting, gaining, licensing offences and detection of crime. During my service at this station I was specially employed in plain clothes to detect betting and gaming offences in the East and West End districts of London. I was promoted to the rank of Station Sergeant in January, 1939 and transferred to Sutton station 1 W f Division. As a station Sergeant I again had the opportunity of furthering my experience with respect to betting, licensing and gaming offences, Traffic and Firearms Acts* At this I also was appointed to instruct^ members of the Metropolitan Police Special Constabulary in Police procedure. I received promotion to my present rank, that of Inspector on the 4th June, 1942, and have since served at Tower Bridge station r M t Division. At this Station I am in charge of crime matters generally, including lectures to Police Officers in that subject. I am 'also periodically employed as the Inspector in charge of Tower Bridge Magistrates Court which has given me considerable experience of Magistrate Court procedure.

'The .islands are low lying, the highest ground being a hill in the centre of Bahrein 400 feet high. * The ruling family, the A1 Khalifah, came originally from the neighbour hood of Kuwait and occupied Bahrein in 1762. The present Ruler, His Highness Sheikh Sir Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., (born 1895),’ became the ruling Sheikh on February 3, 1942. The Ruler is in treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, which is represented by a Political Agent. The total population is estimated at about 12.0,000 of which three-quarters are the original inhabitants of the islands of the Shia sect, the remainder, including the ruling family, being Sunnis. The Sunnis live mainly in tbe towns of Manamah and Muharraq. There is a- wealthy Indian community and a number of. well-to-do''Persian merchants. ' With regard to climate, the winter months from the beginning of November to the end of March are similar to.the climate of North Africa for the same period of the year although the humidity in Bahrein is higher. The early summer, months of April, May and June are hot and damp while the. months of July, August and September are hotter and more unpleasant with high humidity though there is a distinct improvement in the latter half of September while October is normally' pleasant. Manamah, the capital and commercial centre, extends for ij miles along the shore. There is a fine State Hospital and Dispensary. The Government of India Post Office, the installation of Messrs. Cable and Wireless, Limited, and the local branch of the Eastern Bank, Limited., are all situated in Manamh. Island while the landing ground used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation is on Muharraq Island. These two islands are connected by a wide causeway nearly two miles in length carrying a motor road to the south of which is the seaplane alighting area of the British Overseas Airways Corporation, The deep water channel between the two islands is spanned by a swing bridge completed in 1941. The population of Manamah is about 28,000 and that of Muharraq 18,000. The two towns of Manamah and Muharraq are administered by their respective Municipal Committees who are, in addition to normal municipal undertakings, responsible for the upkeep of 30^ of the roads on the islands. There is a community of some 300 Europeans and Americans, including members of the (American) Dutch Reformed Church and the staff of the Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited. Water in the two towns is supplied by artesian wells and nearly 200 fresh water springs on the various islands are used for irrigation. Motor traffic, including omnibuses, is in use and roads exist between the towns and main villages. The total nuffiber of villages is about 200. Electricity from the Government Station in Manamah'supplies light and power in Manamah and Muharraq. There are a number of shops in the town of Manamah which normally cater for a European clientele, but owing to export restrictions and shortage of shipping space it is nov/ practically impossible to purchase any European clothing or haberdashery and therefore candidates will be well advised to purchase their requirements-before leaving England. Bahrein is the centre of the famous pearl fishing industry of the Persian Gulf. About 277 boats from Bahrein are engaged in the pearl fishing during six months of the year. During the season Bahrein is visited by numerous Arab and European pearl buyers. In 1932 oil was discovered in Bahrein. Operations are being conducted by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Company registered in Canada, which has been granted a concession by the Sheikh. The Bahrein Petroleum Company is part of an organisation owned by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. Other occupations are: boat-building, manufacture of sail cloth and reed mats, date cultivation and breeding of particularly fine white donkeys. /The■■■■■■■Hi \ The greater part of the trade of the neighbouring Saudi Arabian provinces of Nejd and Rasa passes through Bahrein. The revenue of the State is in part obtained from a duty of 5 per cent ad valorem on all imports. The revenue of the State in 1943 Was Rs. 39 ,*81,000. In 1945-44 the chief imports were: idee, Rs. 9,67,870; wheat, Rs. 62,58,560; wheat flour, Rs. 17S'88,220; coffee, Rs. 11,51,820; dates Rs. 19,64,820; sugar,Rs. 11,28,170; spices, Rs. 7,05,050; cotton piece-goo ■Rs. 35,20,560; silk piece-goods, Rs. 18,350; building materials, Rs. 670; cement, Rs. 34,380.

This seems the best solution and we shall have to let the Bahrein Government know. I have asked for copies of the Act which we can forward by Air Mail. The Home Office in their letter of 18th January also make some important suggestions about Pension arrangements. 31.2°£ of basic pay and war bonus works out at rather more than the amount allowed for by the Bahrein Government under Provident Fund. It seems to me from paragraph 2 of the Political Agent’s letter of 23rd November that the Bahrein Government contemplated meeting the sum required to preserve pension rates from the Provident Fund and I should not expect that they would be willing to pay Provident Fund in addition. The figures involved by the Home c/L Office’s proposal are given below. 2J V- /oy ■(, n O' Z //■ ST r /20'S‘I i- r ?o T U’S iws I should not think that the Bahrein Government would find any difficulty about the Home Office’s suggestions in connection with sick leave and arbitration/j - . ■■ - •'*' arbitration. .

' L ^/^ q/. r / , —CLP * ( v^T-i^- /3^hhv fyc^ iTm Cfa^ Thank you for your letters of the 16th Decemher^^ and 1st January about Lhe secondnent of police from ^ / this country for Bahrein. ' ^ 1 A draft of the advertisement we are proposing to circulate to police auuhoriuies aid Chief Constables is attached for any further observations you may wish to make. In our consideration of the documents enclosed with your letters, the following points have arisen:- 1. Pensions and Disability Benefits In view of the proposal that police officers should be seconded for a limited period, it would seem that the proper arrangement to follow as regards pension is that adopted by the Metropolitan Police Force in the case of officers seconded for service overseas.' This arrangement would involve the Bahrein Government paying to the police authority x concerned 31.2 per cent of the men 1 s pensionable pay y tC*+* i \\t (including 7 / ar Bonus), together with five per cent of the resultant sum to cover departmental expenses. The usual course is that this sum should be paid to the police authority each quarter. It would be open to the Bahrein Government, if it wished, to deduct from men’s pay superannuation deductions at the rate of .five per cent. ^ The|same arrangements apply with regard to what are tented ’’disability benefits”. The men seconded f . D»-^r. Harrison, Esq. / will#_ will remain subject to the provisions of the Police Pensions Act, 1921, and will be eligible for the awards on retirement, for medical grounds provided for by this Act. Che proposal that, the difference between the sum provided by the Bahrein Government as a provident fund and the contributions towards pension should be paid to the employee on the termination of his service, is not, I am afraid, on principle acceptable. 2. Sick Leave. I am afraid the Sick Leave conditions offered by the Bahrein Government would not help to attract applicants. The British regular police are entitled to freemedical treatment on full pay until such time as the medical officer of the force certifies that they are no longer fit for police service. I suggest that the same conditions should be offered. In the case of prolonged illness, the case could be considered by a medical board and, if necessary, the man returned to this country, as provided for in paragraph 10 of the attached draft. Subject to your observations, we have amended paragraph 12 in the attached draft accordingly. 3. Uniform . j I understand that the question of the provision of winter uniform is being taken up by the Bahrein Government with the Receiver of the Metropolitan Police. / 4I 4. Furlough and Leave . \ Vv’e note that the question of furlough nox counting as active service in the reckoning of annual leave has been taken up with the Political Resident. 5. Discipline . There is no reference in the M Conditions of 'Service' 1 to a Discipline Code. Prospective recruits will wish to know who will control them, who will be their disciplinary authority, whetheris a formal disciplinary code which specifies the punishments that may be inflicted, and whether there is any right of appeal. A paragraph giving information on these points should perhaps be included in the 'Conditions of Service'. 6. Arbitration. We have recently been engaged in a wrangle with the Police Federation over the question of 'arbitratiori' and we think, therefore, that the use of this word in any document that is to have a wide circulation amongst police forces would be unwise. We have amended paragraph 16 of the draft accordingly. Yours sincerely,DRtoT ! January, 1945. Dear Sir, HOME OFFICE CIRCULAR No. /1945 Vacancies in Bahrein State Police. Applications are invited from British Regular Police for short tern appointments with the Bahrein state Police. The present vacancies are for one inspector, one sergeant and six constables. Officers selected will be seconded to the Bahrein State police for a limited period and will be subject to the conditions of service set out in detail on the attached document. A memorandum giving some particulars of the State of Bahrein is also attached. Application^ which will be subject to the approval of the police authority and the Chief Constable, should give full details of police service and should be forwarded to the Under Secretary of State, Home Office, Whitehall, S.W.1. , so as to reach him not later thanA Selection Board will subsequently be held at the India Oifice and successful candidates will be required to undergo a special medical examination. It will be noted that in the conditions of service it is stated that the pension rights of men seconded to the Bahrein State Police will be preserved. Hfe have suggested to the Bahrein G-ovemment that the men should remain subject to the provisions of the Police Pensions Act, 1921, and that the Bahrein G-ovemment should make a quarterly pension contribution to the police authority concerned at the rate of 31 . 2,0 of the men's pensionable pay (together with 5/'&lt;&gt; of the resultant sum to cover departmental expenses). This is in accordance with the arrangements which are usually made when Metropolitan police officers are seconded for short periods of service overseas. The Bahrein G-ovemment could then, if it wished, deduct from the men’s pay rateable deductions at the rate of five per cent. Yours faithfully.IH^FT Z Bi\HRKU-J oT^TE POLIOK Seconded British Police Officers. CONDITIONS gp SdRYIOS. 1. Period of Service.

About a twentieth part of its area is cultivated; dates, citrus fruits and lucerne are the chief crops, * Other islands are kuharraq, to the north-east of Bahrein, 4 miles long and 1 mile wide; Sitra, to the east, 3 miles long and 1 mile wide; Habi Saleh, about 2 miles in circumference, and several uninhabited islets. The islands are low lying, the highest ground being a hill in the centre of Bahrein 400 feet high. The ruling family, the A1 IQialifah, came originally from the neighbourhood of Kuwait and occupied Bahrein, in 1732. The present Ruler, His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., (bom 1395), became the ruling Shaikh on February 3, 1942. The Ruler is in treaty relations with His ilajesty* s Government, which is represented by a Political Agent. . e t . : t * t ~ s I t - • t The total population is estimated at about 120,000 of which three-quarters are the original inhabitants of the islands of-the Shia sect, the remainder, including the ruling family, being Sunnis. , The Sunnis live mainly in the towns of Lianamah and Muharraq. . There is a wealthy Indian corammity and a number of well-to-do Persian merchants. With regard to climate, the winter months from the beginning of November to the end of March are similar to the climate of North Africa for the same period of the year although the humidity in Bahrein is higher. The early summer months of April, May, aid June are hot aid damp while the months of July, August, and September are hotter and more unpleasant with high humidity though there is a distinct improvement in the latter half of September while October is normally pleasant. Manamah, the capital and cocmercial centre, extends for l^ miles along the shore.* There is a fine State Hospital and Dispensary. , The Government of India Post Office, the installation of Messrs. Gable and Wireless, Limited, and the local branch of the Eastern Bank, Limited, are all situated in Manamah island while the landing ground used by the British Overseas airways Corporation is on Muharraq Island. These two islands are oonnected by a wide causeway nearly two miles in length carrying a motor road to the south of which is the seaplane alighting area of the British Overseas Airways Corporation. The deep water channel between the two islands is spanned by a swing bridge completed in 1941* The population of Manamah is about 28,000 and that of Muharraq 18,000. The two towns of Manamah and Muharraq are administered by their respective Municipal Committees who are, in addition to normal municipal, undertakings, responsible for the upkeep of 30^ of the roads on the islands. There is a community of some 300 Europeans and Americans, including members of the (American) Dutch Reformed ^ Church aid the staff of the Bahrein petroleum Company Limited. Water in the two towns is supplied by artesian wells and nearly 200 fresh water springs on the various islands are used for irrigation. Motor traffic, including omnibuses, is in use and roads exist between the tov/ns and main villages. The total number of villages is about 200. Electricity from the Government Station in Manamah supplies light and power in Manamah and Muharraq. There are a number of shops in the town of Manamah which normally cater for a European clientele, but owing to export restrictions and shortage of shipping space it is now practically impossible to purchase any European clothing or haberdashery and therefore candidates will be well advised to purchase their requirements before leaving England. Bahrein is the centre of the famous pearl fishing industry of the Persian Gulf. About 277 boats from Bahrein are engaged in the pearl fishing during six months of the year. During the season Bahrein is visited by numerous Arab and European pearl buyers. In 1932 oil was discovered in Bahrein. Operations are /beingBBOBB being conducted by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, a Company registered in Canada, which has been granted a concession by the Shaikh, The Bahrein Petroleum Company is part of an organization owned by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation. . Other occupations are; boat building, manufacture of sail cloth and reed mats, date cultivation and breeding of particularly fine v/hite donkeys. The greater part of the trade of the. neighbouring Saudi Arabian provinces of Nejd and Hasa passes through Bahrein. The revenue of the State is in part obtained from a duty of 5 per cent ad valorem on ail imports. The revenue of the State in 1943 was Rs. 39,81,000. In 1943-1944 the chief imports were: rice, Rs.9,67,870; wheat, Rs.62,38,560; wheat flour, Rs.17,38,220;, coffee, Rs.11,51,820; dates, Rs.19,64,820; sugar, Rs.11,28,170; spices, Rs.7,05,050; cotton piece-goods, Rs.35,20,360 silk piece-goods, Rs.18,350; t building materials, Rs.670; cement, Rs.34,380; The chief exports were pearls, Rs.4,79,720; sugar, Rs.20,20,440; tea, Rs.2,16,080; wheat flour, Rs.14,21,810; rice, Rs.1,07,620; wheat, Rs.29,97,480; cotton piece-goods, Rs.24,94,070; silk piece-goods, Rs.7,650.

They assaulted several beggars who were annoying them and later took refuge from the crowd which had collected in a local coffee shop. The Military Police from Awali were on their way to Manama to deal with the situation when Mr. C.A.

The rates of pay already offered by the Bahrein Government (via., constable a total of^Jter'TjJo a mprfth equals^i^^a^year plus^I 27 ^a yea^War^ ATfcnmnccrf seem sufficiently generous to render it unnecessary, subject to the views of the Home Office, to make/any. alteration corresponding.to the increased rates for the Palestine Police, and we /wouldwould therefore suggest that you should go ahead with your advertisement on the basis of the figures to which the Bahrein Government have already agreed© « J. As regards disability benefits^the Bahrein Government have already indicated that they are prepared to offer no less generous terms than those laid down for the Palestine Police, and subject to confirmation by the Bahrein Government^ which we are asking the Political Agent to let us have by telegram, we should think that rates similar to those given on page 2 of Claris letter might be offered© The basic figures in the cases of the Palestine and Bahrein Police respectively */&lt;!,//*/ U/W4 a are^/not otrietly comparable/ Perhaps 'the Jtis lr+?\.c j'iavC simplest solution would be to fix it at Rs* 400 a month in all cases - i.e. for Constables, N.C^O's and Inspectors - unless you think that some differentiation ought to be made© As regards the question of /widows3 widows and childrens pensions and allowances, since the Bahrein G-ovemment prefer unmarried men^ the question 'will presumably not arise, but if it does the same arrangements as in the case of the Palestine Police might ba offered, and likewise in the case of a dependent mother the basic month• We would hope, however, that you will be able to go ahead with the issue of your advertisement pending confirmation on these detailed points. r* Watkins of your Police Division, has raised with me the query whether in ^section of the 'Terms and Conditions of the British Police Personnel' offered by the Bahrein Government, there is not a mistake in the statement that 'Furlough will not count as active service for the /purposepurpose of assessing subsequent service or annual leave”, I do not think that there is any mistake. It is not quite \ clear however, whether furlough may be accumulated and enjoyed after the conclusion of the two years* service; since this point might possibly be raised by some of the applicants we are asking the Political Agent to confirm this also.

Under Secretary Secretary of StateWill you please,refer to your fetter of the 13th Decembe r (Ext. 5673/44) abou^yt^e recruitment of a number of policemen from^his- countryLjror Bahrein. We have just introduced increases in rates of pay for other ranks of the British Section of the Palestine Police. The new rates are as follows:- Constable £132 by annual increments of £8 to £180 Second Sergeant £180 by annual increments of £8 to £204. First Sergeant £204 by annual increments of £8 to £228. These new scales will be applied with retrospective effect to serving policemen, service in the Armed Forces since the 3rd September, 1939, immediately preceding service with the Palestine Police, being taken into account for that purpose, the operative date of the new rates being the 1st October, 1944. This means that if we recruit a man from the Army for the Palestine Police with two years war service he would enter the scale at £148 a year. The two existing scales for British Inspectors have now been amalgamated into one scale of £300 to £420 with efficiency bar at £360, and the pensionable expatriation allowance originally £50 has been in creased to £100 a year with effect from the 1st October, 1944. eJ**~*~ ^ /As F.D.K. HARRISON, ESQ.mam As regards the question of compensation for men incapacitated as the result of injuries received in the course of duty, we are just revising the section of the Palestine Police Ordinance covering the grant of injurx.„^ pensions and pensions to widows. The new arrangement approved, which should be regarded as confidential at present, are briefly as follows:- Where a Constable or Non-Commissioned Officer is permanently injured a) in the actual discharge of his duty, and b^ without his own default, and c) on account of circumstances specifically attributable to the nature of his duty he may, if his retirement is thereby necessitated or materially accelerated, be granted a pension based on his actual annual pay on the date of his injury. Annual pay in the case of a Non-Cornmissioned Officer or Constable of the British Section of the Force is twice his actual annual p^r for the purpose of calculating pension. The rates of pension are as follows:- Slightly impaired Impaired Materially impaired Totally destroyed 5/60ths 10/60ths 15/60ths 20/60ths For example a Constable drawing £132 a year at the date of injury assessed as slightly impaired would be eligible for pension of £22 a year. Where a Constable or Non-Commissioned Officer dies as a result of injury received as at (a), (b) and (c) above, if he leaves a widow she is eligible for a pension at a rate not exceeding l/4th of- his annual payat the date of injury or the maximum of the salary scale for a Constable for the time being in force, whichever is the greater. Here again annual pay is twice annual pay for the purpose of calculating pension. Thus a widow of a Constable would be eligible for a minimum pension of £90 a year. ^^Provision is also made where there are children v- ‘or the grant of a pension not exceeding l/4th of the pension granted to the widow in respect of each child up to a maximum of five children. Provision is also made for the grant of a pension mother^i4 wholly or mainly dependent for 1 her support at a rate not exceeding one fourth of twice annual pay provided ohat if a pension is granted to the widow and/or child the pension to the mother should not exceed one-twelfth of twice the annual pay. »/here a widow or child does not qualify for a pension provision is made for the grant of a gratuity not exceeding one-twelfth part of the annual pay for each year of service, or not exceeding one year f s annual pay whichever is the smaller. T hope that the above gives you what you want but I am afraid it is not possible to let you have a copy of‘the Amending legislation as this has not yet been enacted. I am sending a copy of this letter to Williamson at the Home Office. Yours sincerely, T.B.0)/ ftv' &gt; /'■ CTfr- * ^ T. . illj . - v. 2 *, 1 Home Office, Taitehall, S# 7.1.

British police personnel are required for use in cases in which Europeans or Americans are in volved. As the officers, N.C.Os and men of the State Police are Arabs it is difficult for them to deal with Europeans or Americans. In addition to this work the British police will be required to supervise the State Police who are responsible for traffic control, which includes registration of cars. Should any of them be capable of doing so I would suggest that ti.e test ing of applicants for driving licenses which is now one of the duties of the State Engineer should be undertaken by the British police.^ They would also be called upon to assist in passport control and to give instruction in police duties and methods to the N.C.Os and men of the State Police. 3. I suggest that their terms and conditions of service should be according th the enclosed draft agreement. 4. Regarding uniform: tropical uniform can be provided by the Government of Bahrain. -It will be necessary to obtain winter uniform from the U.K. and I propose writing to Sir John Moylan, receiver of the Metropolitan Police, personally asking him if he can advise and assist the Bahrain Government in obtaining material or uniform from England.

Political Agency* Bahrain, 23rd:-November To in th SUBJECT: British Police for Bahrain. MEMORANDUM Reference your memorandum No.c/529 dated the 23rd November 1944. 2. The question of disability benefits has not previously been considered by the Bahrain Government in relation to their European or any other employees. Although the Bahrain Government have no information on the disability benefits granted by the Government of Palestine they are prepared to offer no less generous terms than those laid down for the Palestine police. The Bahrain Government contemplate that candidates for the Bahrain British Police will be seconded from a regular police force in the United Kingdom and they are therefore prepared to preserve the pension rights of the men engaged. Should the annual amount required for this purpose be less than the sum already provided by the Bahrain Government as a provident fund the difference will be paid to the employee on the termination of his service. 3. I enclose a brief note on Bahrain which gives some indi cation of the living conditions. With regard to climate, the winter months from the beginning of November to the end of March are similar to the climate of North Africa for the same period of the year although the humidity in Bahrain is higher. The early summer months of April, May, and June are hot and damp while the months of July, August, and September are hotter and more unpleasant with high humidity though there is a distinct improvement in the latter half of septembe while October is normally pleasant. /ThereThere are a number of shops in the town of Manama v which normally cater for a European clientele but owing to export restrictions and shortage of shipping space it is now practically impossible to purchase any European clothing or haberdashery and therefore candidates will be well advised to purchase their requirements before leaving England. Political Agent, BahrainSTATrC OF BAHRAIN. The Bahrain Islands form an archipelago in the ! Persian Gulf 20 miles off al Hasa on the Arabian Coast. Bahrain^ the largest island) is 27 miles long and 10 miles wide. About % twentieth part of its area is cultivated; dates, citrus , fruits and lucerne are the chief crops. Other islands are Muharraq, to the northeast of Bahrain, 4 miles long and 1 mile wide; Sitra, to the east, 3 miles long and 1 mile wide; Nabi Saleh, about 2 miles in circum ference, and several uninhabited islets. The islands are low lying, the highest ground being a hill in the centre of Bahrain 400 feet high. The ruling family, the Al Khalifah, came originally from the neighbourhood of Kuwait and occupied Bahrain, in 1732. The present Ruler, His Highness Shaikh Sir Salman bin Hamad al Khalifah, K.C.I.E., (born 1895), became the ruling Shaikh on February 3, 1942. The Ruler is in treaty relations with His Majesty^ Government, which is represented by a Political Agent. The total population is estimated at about 120,000, of which three-quarters are the original inhabitants of the islands of the Shia sect, the remainder, including the ruling family, being Sunnis. The Sunnis live mainly in the towns of Manamah and Muharraq. There is a wealthy Indian community and a number of well-to-do Persian merchants. Manamah, the capital and commercial centre, extends for li miles along the shore. There is a fine State Hospital and Dispensary. The Government of India Post Office, the installation of Messrs. Cable and Wireless, limited, and the local branch of the Eastern Bank, Limited, are all situated in Manamah island while the landing ground used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation is on Muharraq Island. These two islands are connected by a wide causeway nearly two miles in length carring a motor road to the south of which is the seaplane alighting area of the British Overseas Airways Corporation. The deep water channel between the two islands is spanned by a swing bridge completed in 1941. The population of Manamah is about 28,000 and that of Muharraq 18,000. The two towns of Manatoah and Muharraq are administered by their respective Municipal Committees who are, in addition to normal municipal undertakings^ responsible for the upkeep of 30/£ of the roads on the islands. There is a community of some 300 Europeans and Americans, including members of the (American) Dutch Reformed Church and the staff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. Water in the two towns is supplied by artesian wells and nearly 200 fresh water springs on the various islands are used for irrigation. Motor traffic, including omnibuses, is in use and roads exist between the towns and main villages. The total number of villages is about 200. Electricity from the Government Station in Manamah supplies light and power in Manamah and Muharraq. Bahrain is the centre of the famous pearl fishing industry of the Persian Gulf. About 277 boats from Bahrain are engaged in the pearl fishing during six months of the year. During the season Bahrain is visited by numerous Arab and European pearl buyers. In 1932 oil was discovered in Bahrain. Operations are being conducted by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, a Company registered in Canada, which. has been granted a concession by the Shaikh. The Bahrain Petroleum Company is part of an organization owned by the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Corporation.2 Other occupations ares boat-building, manufia@tti£e of; sail cloth and reed mats, date cultivation and bf~dedTfig of particularly fine white donkeys. The greater part of the trade of the neighbouring Saudi Arabian provinces of Nejd and Hasa passes through Bahrain. The revenue of the State ifc in part obtained from a duty of 5 per cent ad valorem on all imports. The revenue of the State in 1943 was Rs. 39,81,000. In 1943 - 1944 the chief imports were: rice, Rs.9,67,870; wheat, Rs.62,38,560; wheat flour, Rs. 17,88,220; coffee, Rs.ll,51,820; dates, Rs. 19,64,820; sugar, 11,28,170; spices, Rs.7,05,050; cotton piece-ggods, Rs.35,20,360; silk piece-goods, Rs. 18,350; building Materials, Rs.670; cement, Rs.34,280; The chief exports were pearls, Rs.4,79,720? sugar, Rs.20,20,440; tea, Rs.2,16,080; wheat flour, 3c.

Memorandum V' g ’ A. .1. 47 72 I forv/ard herewith the full veportf ,/]the ijicident which took place at Manama on the 11th morning at 2.00 a,m. The police night patrol of 5 policemen in the brothal area heard some shoutings and they proceeded to the place. There they found a Military 'Jeep' and one BAPCO Pickup No.X-201 with 5 occu pants. And four American soldiers trying to enter by force into the house of some prostitutes and break the outside door of the house of Fatima bint Ahmed. Immediately when the police appeared the Americans came running to them and asked them to get them some women. The N.G*0. in charge L/Naik Sayeed Habib persuaded them to return back to their homes as it was very late. They refused to do so but asked him to bring some prostitutes which he did not do. Thereupon they caught hold of him and started beating him causing him slight injury and a hard fist on his face tearing his shirt / also. So with great difficulty he made his way out and ran away with other policemen. Then they were chased by one officer running after them while the others followed in the 'Jeep' until they reached near the mosque in the centre of the town. Then the N.C.O. noticed him having a torch light and was lighting it on the house of Ibrahim Noonoo. He shouted to them to behave well as it was a respectable residential Quarter. They refused to do so, saying that there are better women here. Then again these Americans went in search of women when they met two policemen L/Naik Jamsheer and Mubarak bin Gasab who persuaded them to behave well. They both were beaten also and chased. The 'Jeep' remained chasing the police men in the streets and every one had to hide himself to a safe place till 3.00 a.m. The N.C.O. L/Naik Sayeed Habib states that one of them was an officer bearing one star on each side of shirt collar and carry ing with him a revolver. And also another officer who had stars on his shoulders and says that he can identify both of them.to Copy of memorandum No*c/1187 dated ISrfcir-Augnst 19d4. fiam the Chief Local Representative, The Bahrain petroleum CO., Ltd., (with copy to Cammander Height, for enquiry and report) from the political Agent, Bahrain. &lt; A ~ 4 ■; r — i 1 •'- / I am forwarding copy of a report made to me bjr the Superin tendent of the Bahrain Government Stato-pollce, whicii seems to show that a BAPCO or B.M.P.

After careful checking it seems probable that the military personnel mentioned were not connected with any British or American military formation in Manama or Maharrsq. It is thought that these men may have come from Awali. I am asking Commander Height to make a parallel enquiry.

Please refer to your Confidential Memorandum No.C/1187 dated 12th August 1944. Following are the results of our investigations into the incident described in the attachme nt to the above mentioned memo randum*- The Company possesses a pick-up bearing the number 1 x 201 and its use is assigned to the Bechtel-McCone Parsons corporation. I asked the Herchtel-McCone corporation to check the movements of this car. Theij, state that they have made a thorough check with Mr. William H, Hackler, their Night Superintendent, who states that this pick-up was seen by him at 2 a.m. on the morning of the 11th in front of the Mess Hall, having been parked there g by a Mr. jerry B. Romans, their Night Labour Foreman. Mr. Hackler further states that he instructed one of his employees, Mr. Budd L. Casey, to return the pickup to the Refinery where it was seen by him at various times during the balance of the shift. Tne B.M. Management state that they have no reason to doubt the authenti city of Mr. Hackler*s statements. If these statements are true then either the number of the pickup or the date is in error.B. M. state that the above enquiries were made without divulging the reason for the questions asked. We are continuing our investigations and if we are able to pick up any clues connected with this incident, such findings will be reported to you.

As of 11th August, 1944, there was only one jeep stationed in Awali coming under a non-civilian classification. This was the U.S. Navy jeep belonging to this office. As it is painted a dark blue color, with 'U.S. Navy' in white on the sides, front, and back, it is virtually impossible for it to be confused with any other jeep on the island. 3. During the night of 10-11 August, the U.S. Navy jeep was at all times within the limits of Awali. 4. As of 11th August there were three officers attached to this office: Lt. Commdr. E.F. Height Lt. (jg) M. Smolak Lt. (jg) E. Albat During the night of 10-11 August, none of these officers left the limits of Awali. 5. Although not under the jurisdiction of this office, for information the only other officers or enlisted men in the U.S. Armed Forces in Awali during the night of 10-11 August were 1st. Lieut. Doyle of the Army, stationed at Awali, and two visiting officers present with him on business, investigation shows that none of these officers left the limits of Awali during the night in question. 6. On the night of 10-11 August, the only American ship in port was the 'Richardson', which arrived at 1700 on the 10th for bunkers, and departed at 0800 on the 11th. Investigation shows that no one came ashore from this ship during the night in questlcp*7. For information, in the U.S. Armed Forces, stars are worn on th@ collar only by Generals, Admirals and Commodores. Stars are also worn on shoulder boards by other officers in the Navy only, with certain uniforms. These stars are placed above strips which are much more prominent than the stars. The shoulder boards themselves are of such prominence that the first element of description would be o M shoulder boards’*, the specific markings being a secondary descriptioh. These stars can not be detached to be worn directly on the shoulders. 8. The only ’’revolver’* in the possession of U.S.* Navy personnel at Awali is an authmatic pistol locked in this office for possible emergencies. This pistol has not left the confines of this office during the month of August 1944.(27883) Wt.26650/4642 360.000 8/44 A.&amp; E.W.Ltd.

WHITEHALL, S.W.l. 13th October, I 9 I 4 .I 4 .. Dear Harrison, With reference to your letter (Sxt. 4309/44) of the 2nd October to Russell, we shall be quite prepared, in the special circumstances you mention, to advertise amongst the larger police forces in England and Wales the vacancies you have for British police in the Bahrein State, though I should make it clear at the outset that nearly all the younger policemen under 29 to 30 are at present in the Armed Forces. (If you should want to extend the field to Scotland you will no doubt write direct to Galder in the Scottish Office). It will, of course, be necessary for the notification of vacancies to be accompanied by precise details of the terms and conditions of service which you are prepared to offer. Something ought also to be said, I think, about climatic conditions in the Bahrein State, living conditions, and the kind of duties the men would be required to undertake (police duties vary widely in range). / For your information and guidance I may say that in this country the maximum basic rate of pay of a constable is 90s. a week, \with two “additional increments'' of 2/6 a week for long and meritorious service; of a sergeant 112s.6d. a week; and of an inspector in one of the larger forces £375 a year. In addition, a pensionable war supplement, at present fixed at 19s. a week but liable to vary on the same basis as the Civil Service war bonus, is paid in each case. All are entitled to free quarters or an allowance in lieu, free medical attention, and uniform / or F. A. K. Harrison, Esq.erf*- ! or a plain-clothes allowance. There is at present no payment for extended hours of duty unless they amount to more than 12 hours at a stretch; hut the men get a 'vi/ar duty allowance” (which is in part a commuted overtime payment) at the following rates:- Constables - 3s. a week. Sergeants - 5s. a week, and Inspectors All this together means that, at the present time, the inclusive annual cost to a police authority in this country of the three ranks in question is approximately:- Constable - £410 Sergeant - £500 Inspector - £635- These figures are inclusive of pay, provision of quarters or payment of rent allowance, supply of uniform, boots and equipment, medical treatment, contribution by the police authority to the man’s pension, and general overhead charges for administration. You will also wish to consider the question of superannuation. In the United Kingdom a 5$ deduction is made from current pay during the man’s period of / serviceservice and on retirement (at 55 years of age for constables and sergeants and 60 years of age for inspectors) after 25 years’ approved service, he is eligible for a pension at the rate of thirty-sixtieths of his pay. In addition there is generous provision made for men incapacitated as a result of injuries received in the course of duty. While police from this country were on probation in the Bahrein State, it would be necessary for the Bahrein Government to safeguard their pension rights by paying to the police authorities from whom they were transferred a percentage on their annual salaries. If, later, the men were offered long-term contracts and ceased to be members of the police service here, it would presumably be necessary for the Bahrein Government to set up a special superannuation scheme on their own. One further point. Assuming that in due course applicants are forthcoming for the appointments in question - and provided the conditions of service are sufficiently attractive I think there is some prospect of this (I would not put it higher) — I presume the India Office would make arrangements for the necessary Selection Board, medical examination, etc. If you should wish to discuss any of the above matters in greater detail, I should be pleased to put you in touch with the various experts here. Yours sincerely. ENCLOSURE IN AIR MAIL LETTER No. -6 2 1 OCT 1344 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEFT., INDIA OFFICE/ 75015/3/44 10 October, 1944. Dear Harrison, Will you please refer to your letter of the 30th September (Ext.4309/44) about the recruitment of a number of policemen from this country for Bahrein. I enclose a copy of the contract ^^&lt;for British Constables engaged for the Palestine Police which gives rates of pay and conditions of service. After 6 months 1 service a constable may qualify for proficiency pay of £1 a month after passing certain examinations including language examination. As a temporary war time measure, Palestine Police Constables and N.C.^s also receive a War Compensatory allowance based on the Cost of Living Index figure which is at present about £3.5s. a month. In the case of a married man who leaves his family in this country, separation and childrens allowances are paid to the wife on the P. D. K. HARRISON, ESQ. same &lt;Tdr&gt;same scale as for the Army. (The wife gets £1. Is. 6d. a week and in the case of a wife with children £1. 4s. a week plus 12/6d. a v/eek for each child). The post of British Inspector in the Palestine Police is a pension^ie post and there are two grades. Grade 1. £300 - £12 - £ 360 - £12 to £420 and Grade 2. £300 - £12 - £360 with the addition in each case of £50 expatriation allowance. These officers also qualify for Cost of Living Allowance in Palestine. If you desire any further details, you will no doubt let me know. I am sending a copy of this letter to Russell at the Home Office. Yours sincerely. IAgt. No. e. 500/1/43. W. 4 S. Ld. M/M PALESTINE POLICE.

It is proposed to enrol the military police as special constables with jurisdiction throughout the territories of His Highness the Shaikh. (ii) On the 4th, eight ex-members of the New York police who have been enrolled by the Bahrain Petroleum Company arrived from America. They are being empowered to act as Special Constables within the area of the Bahrain Petroleum Company*s plant and wherever else they may be ordered to by the District Magistrate or the Commandant of Police, though the primary role of these policemen will be to maintain order within the Oil Company premises they can be made use of to assist at quelling disturbances in v/hich the Oil Company employees are concerned in other parts of the Island.J ■I Under Secretary of State U- Y,,..

'cr The background of this is that the American Oil employees at Bahrein oave on more than one occasion recently caused trouble with tho^-^onl pnlioe and the Bahrein State Police, who are all Bahreinees, wk© are not properly able to deal with them. PAIC has responsibility for the security of the refinery and about four British Military Police have already been posted to Bahrein by him to aid in seeing to the security of the refinery. The Foreign Office and ourselves attach importance to being able to prevent the Americans saying that security arrangements at Bahrein are inadequate and it is now proposed to enlist the further help of PAIC. Meanwhile we are going ahead with the Political Resident* s request to provide eight civil police from this country to reinforce the Bahrein State Police. The Home Office have hopes of being able to supply men but say that it will of course be impossible to get them to Bahrein for several weeks yet.

The Honourable R.M.A. Hankey, Foreign Office. 16 SEP 1944 Dear Hankey, Your letter No. £.4863/2523/91 of 2nd September. We note that the Foreign Office • • • • are not happy about asking the Americans to provide either civilian or military police for Bahrein, (incidentally, you refer to it as ny suggeestion, but in fact this was what was agreed to at the Inter-departmental meeting, at which you were present, on Ju3y 11th). We agree that there have been developments vis a vis the Americans since the proposal was first made, and as Prior has not reported aiy more /recent2 recent trouble, we may perhaps hope N that things have largely settled down which will give us more time to look round and see whether we can supply the required personnel ourselves. I am not sure that this is going to be easy. I gather that P.A.I.G. is not prepared to spare people, and the preliminary enquiries that I have made about Aol.O.C. recruitment of N.P.Oo personnel are not particularly encouraging. If we do get British civilian personnel. n • t e a. there will be a question of who is to a pay, and I think that it will hardly &lt;- be fair to expect the Bahrein Government to pay for extra police necessitated by the importation of a • ng number of Americans employed on work occasioned by the operational needs of the United Nations, However, these are points that can be considered. /and3 and as a first step vre would propose to telegraph to the Political Resident as in the attached draft* Would you let us know whether you concur* I am sending a copy of this letter, and its enclosure, to Calthorpe and Berthoud* (Sd.)

The A.I.O.C. have now altered their terms slightly, and have gone about it rather differently enlisting the aid of the Ministry of Home Security who are fairly sure of being able to find suitable candidates. I gather that the stumbling block is the length of service; the men quite naturally do not want to be out of this country when the war ends and return to it when all the good jobs have gone. The Ministry of Home Security are therefore stipulating that service should be either short term i.e. about six months, or for several years, possibly with the chance of making a career out of it.■y; T&gt;'\* IH'.'.'AaD TKLr» FILE^GOF ■ r ' ''' wia 4010 (Vv.fS P fiCRtSX i '57^ (If ) any case the of this document to any person outside British or 0 0.

It is as you know our strong conviction that we must shoulder our responsibilities in Bahrain il we are to avoid the Americans challenging our whole position there. Signs are not wanting that they are prepared to do this and they have, as you know, very recently gone to the length of asking that the Sheikh should appoint an American judge with jurisdiction over American nationals. V/e have returned a rather tart reply to this request and we hope that this will choke them off. If we now- start asking them to provide American provost personnel or civilian police, thereby admitting thatrwe are unable to carry out one.of the most essential functions of government, we feel certain that they will reopen the whole question and once again challenge our right to exercise jurisdiction over foreigners in Bahrain-. In any case we shall furnish them with an unanswerable argument to back up their main contention, namely that the maintenance of law and order and administration of justice at Bahrein is inadequate. If v/e cannot ourselves ensure tne maintenance of law and order, we can hardly object to others making a claim to do it for us and even assume our jurisdiction. While the proposal to ask for American personnel might have had some advantage when it seemed impossible for us to supply the necessary men, we feel that this point has lost a great deal of its force now that it seems likely/likely that we can, provide British personnel (see the Political Resident's telegram T/24.0 of the 9th thinking on these lines or he would not have telegraphed as he did. Of course there is, I know, the argument that, there will he less incidents if American roughs are controlled oy Americans. But this really is rather an abrogation of Government, and after all we control American roughs ourselves presumably in all the British sea-ports the world over. And the Americans are less :.umerous than Wallace Murray told us they would be (517 instead of 1,800). We are not clear as to who is to recruit the proposed American personnel and how they are to be paid. If v/e do make a request to the Americans to provide the bodies, we must have further information on these points. To sum up, as the Americans seem so unwilling to find American personnel, ana they so recently showed a tendency to challenge our jurisdiction at Bahrein, we are really very unv/illing to press them to provide personnel. As only very few men are required {did I not gather it was only 10 to 20?) v/e v/ould very greatly prefer to ask the War Office to instruct Persia and Iraq Command to be helpful and place the men at your disposal; or possibly see if the few men required could not be found here, e.g. among displaced National Fire Service men as was done in the case of Abadan. I am sending copies of this letter to Calthorpe and Berthoud. (k.M.A. Hankey)Mi IMr*Peel. I have discussed this question with the Legal Adviser* *•* ^ A C*+&lt;~ (.{ . (T^c U' u ^~ In pfiu^graphs 3 4 of his note of 24th June Major Hickinbotham deals with questiont (1) of cases caning before the fipasions nmirt and (2) (in paragraph 4) of cases dealt with in a Magistrates Co urt. As regards (l), the position seems satisfactory and there is no argument. As regards (2), you will see that the Political Agent says that, in practice, Europeans and Americans are invariably tried by a Magistrate of the same colour. Provided this rule is rigidly adhered to, and there seems no reason why it should not be, this should I would have t hought ha ve adequately covered the Americans' po sition. I find it difficult to understand why the Political-Agent should have dragged in the question of the procedure under Chapter XXXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure at all. This appears to be concerned solely, or primarily, to ensure that there should be no suggestion of unfairness where a European-British subject is tried before an Indian Magistrate and vice versa. I cannot see that the Americans are in the least concerned in this. I submit draft letters to the Political Resident and Foreign Office.CONFIDENTIAL.

T f the restraint which was displayed by tho British personnel in the face of repeated taunts from an unruly element of the B.M.P•Corpo ration^ employees* He said that there was still tension due, in part at least, to some sixteen people some of whom he considered to be agitators and all of whom he felt should oe removed from Bahrain. In addition to these sixteen there weri a further twenty whose agreements with the Company had been terminated for some reason or other and who were at present awaiting transport to the United States• Major G.R.Bartels was particularly anxious to have all the thirtysix men removed as quickly as possible and said that he had heard that delay was occurring in regard to the twenty men aforementioned as it required three weeks to obtain a visa from the American Consul in Basrah and also because U.S.A.T.C. transport was not immediately forthcoming. I made it clear to Major. G.R.Bartels that wo can and do issue visa facilities for all Americans from here to the United States and that the Company were perfectly aware of those facts. I suggested that possibly what they meant was that they had sent certain passports to be renewed in Basrah and that the delay was due to circumstances outside our control. Major G.R.Bartels said that he would look into this point and would also see what ho could do to accelerate the provision of U.S.A.T.C* transport. He enquired whether I had the power of deportation and I explained carefully to him the contents of Sections 21 and 22 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council. I pointed out to him that they were very wide but that my powers had in recent years been restricted by an executive order from the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf which necessitated my not carrying into effect ordersof de ,or ‘ ta&lt;tion such time as the Resident had himself had an opportunity of examining the proceedings and confirming the cyder. I said that should the American authorities make a speci fic request for the deportation of certain countrymen of their own from Bahrain and be prepared to put forward a sworn testimony which would fulfil the provisions of Section 21 of the Bahrain Order-in-Council, I felt it most probable that the Political Resident would be prepared to restore in part at least the Politica Agent’s powers and authorise him to deport, without prior reference t 0 Bushire, American Subjects whose presence in the Islands was no longer considered desirable by the American Military Authorities* V I advised Major G.R.Bartels to represent the matter to his own v Authorities and said that should he desire me to take action im mediately with regard to t he sixteen individuals he had mentioned then I was prepared to communicate with the Resident by telegram pending a more formal settlement of the question. 3* I explained to Major G.R. Bartels that the special privi leges to which American citizens would be entitled, as far as the Sessions Court was concerned, was contained in paragraph 2 o?r Section 284-A of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code which granted certain special considerations with regard to the nationality of assessors. I further informed him of the prodedure by which a case could be tried by jury in Bahrain and explained that it would require border from the Chief Court, and that the same privilege with regard to assessors could be exercised with regard to a jury under paragraph 2 of Section 275 of the Criminal Procedure Code. 4. With regard to cases dealt with in a Magistrate's Court, which were in themselves not sufficiently serious to warrant trial in the Court of Sessions I explained that as far as the procedure of the Court was concerned there was no fundamental difference between British Subjects, Europeans, and Americans, and as far as Bahrain wav concerned it has been the practice of the Agency Courts ✓ to ensure that Europeans and Americans were invtu iably tried by a Magistrate of the same colour. With regard to cases in which one of the parties was a local subject and the other party or parties /was4 \ } / was a fiuropaan or an American I explained the special procedure which was contained in Chapter XXXIII of the Criminal Procedure Code and which except for certain interesting commentaries would appwur to be exclusively for the trial of mixed cases between European British Subjects and Indian British Subjects. I made it clear that this procedure would normally be brought into e/fect if the parties or one of them desired it. With regard to the question whether Chapter XXXIII should be applied only in the case of European British Subjects or whether in certain circum stances Americans could bo considered subject to the provisions thereof I said that I proposed to moke a reference to the Chief Court as I considered it a debatable point but that in the mean time I should hold that Americans would be subject to the provi~ sions of Chapter XXXIII. I pointed out to Major Q.R.Bartels that should it eventually be decided that such a view was not the correct one then no harm could have been done because Section Offi 528-Cj made it clear that judicial proceedings would not bo in validated merely by reason of the fact that a complainant or accused person who was not entitled to b e considered as a European British Subject had been so considered. Major G.R.Bartels stated that he was communicating telegraphically with General Connolly and General Osborne in the near future and that he proposed to c ompose a report which he would show to me before he despatched it. \ i / Received under Bahrain Printed Letter Bo.

I suppose we roust accept the Foreign Office view about arrangements for American seamen on Sitrah Island. Meanwhile it appears that the seamen will not be allowed to land on Sitrah. I have told Mr. Hankey that v/e are waiting to hear what they have done on your letter of the 9th August, and that we consider thab the position in the matter has not been changed by ary subsequent developments. 2. Please see P.Ail.G^ telegram 0/29457** and the Political Resident* s ?/294* This Special Oivil Police Force is of course the one concerned with checking passes of j&gt;.l ( I.P.en$)loyees at the refinery over which all the trouble has arisen. A short summary of their responsibilities is given on page 3 of the report at ^ 3xt.7129/41 in Collection ^0/192 attached. The that Bahrain is^a colony, in 4th of P.A.1.0*3 telegram, does not seem very apt. In the first place Bahrain is not a colony but we have obligations to the Shaikh for its defence, and in the second place it is not so much the defence of Bahrain that is ;ion but protection to the oil field and refinei^ lAMXU&amp;fir is an essential requirement to Ii.li.G-. from the military point of view. Although the, Bahrain Government could no aoubt well afford to pa^I do not think that they should be asked to do so. The question arises ,however, whether the cost should be oome by P.A*I.C. (i.e. H.M.G.) or the Government of India or should be shared by both. Perhaps the best solution would be that it should be regarded as one of the special items for settlement between H.M.G. and the Government of India after the war. We shall have to ootain the Government of India* s views on t’ojflt- subject/subject, hov/ever, and they have not yet had copies of the telegrams. The Political Resident, however, will no doubt telegraph further and we may perhaps wait until he does so before taking ary further action. 3. Please see paragraph 4 of the Political Resident’s telegram T/312 reporting an assaul£ on the Bahrain Police by 4 Ajoerican Service personnel* 'Jhis seems to be a matter which P.A.I.C. could well settle on the spot with General Connolly or whoever is the appropriate U.S. militaiy authority.

'V*- After much consideration of the question we have come to the conclusion that we should suspend action on this matter until we have settled the much more difficult question of the American special constables and assessors at Bahrain. The Sitrah problem is a minor aspect of the other question and we have just sent a pretty sharp reply to the Americans about that. As our proposed letter to the Americans about their seamen on Sitrah can only be unhelpful from their point of view (because they cannot allow their naval pickets jurisdiction over civilian seamen or oil men ashore), it would merely serve to make the problem worse in American eyes and tend to confirm their view that our arrangements in Bahrain are inadequate.

Agree essential for War Effort that Special Civil Police Force be maintained for protection Bahrein Oil Installations. Note that discharge on time expiry of police and lack of new recruits has forced Bahrein Govt to introduce new system of yearly contract which involves additional pay amounting to 12900 rupees per annum.in order to keep force up to strength. Second. Agree this solution is cheaper than police duties being undertaken r by Garrison Troops provision of v/hich would be difficult* Third. Note Bahrein Govt considers War Office should ^ pay and have asked to be relieved of this additional expenditure on grounds that these special police are only to cover war time emergency. Fourth. Question of principle arises. Understand principle is that when expenditure is incurred in the protection l of a colony to which Bahrein may be considered Analagous Colony is expected to pay cost up to its ability. In view of receipts from oil royalties Bahrein Govt should be able to pay extra cost and may reasonably be expected to do so. /Fifth a J r h VCi.N.uy559 16th Aucust, MW£!'

The Porei 'Office and ourselves think that it is most desirable in view of our position generally vio-a^via the Americans in Bahrein that the matter should be settled with the m nimun delay.General Molesworth Please see Raor Office letter below and the minutes of the meeting of 11th July, The important telegrams to which you may wish to refer are The Political Resident’s No, 12+48, Secretary of State's 14451, Political Resident’s 1497 and 8, Secretary of ate's 14777 and the Political Resident's 1566 . The incident may have been only a 'local fracas' but the question whether we should have American or British Provost Personnel to control these ill-behaved Americans is a delicate one, with considerable political implications. It is a matter of policy which it is not for P.A. I.C. to decide, nor can the Political Resident give him instructions in the matter. The instructions must come from Whitehall and since it is for P.A.I.C. to act it seems appropriate that they should come to the latter from the War Office, The feeling at the meeting, particularly that of the Foreign Office, was that unless a directive comes from higher authority the matter will only be delayed by argument and discussion at the Persian Gulf end. There would seem no reason why the War Office should not make their instructions to P.A.I.C. 'subject to any ccnments which you may have to offer'. If however we must accept,!he suggestion now proposed by the War Office we could I suppose a*nd to P. A. I.

It appears that the problem is to secure that the , merchant seamen landed on Sitrah Island do not leave that Island and enter the towns of Manama and Muharraq, rather than to provide the necessary measures of police control to enable seamen to wander at will on Bahrein Island, entering the towns if they so desire. The latter would be a much more difficuHT problem and would gypbably involve the posting of numerous Europe^n^special constables if we a^ to avoid clashes between the seamen and the Arab police. On this interpretation the problem is pore simple than that discussed at the meeting here on /“July 11th (see note fl agqe^) ji^P^rding the px&amp;tff provision of/personnel in* ^linr^tTlwwy special police ^ to control tne American oil employees on Bahrein Island. The best solution would seem to be for the Foreign Office to take up the matter with the U.S. Government on the basis of the U.S. naval authorities providing the necessary measures of control to ensure that the U.S. merchant seamen landed on Sitrah Island (where they can have a canteen and other facilities), do not leave that Island and create disturbances in the towns. A draft letter on this basis to the Foreign Office is submitted. 2o/j .'^7* ■ I DRAFT LETTER To - The Hon. R.M.A. Hankey, Foreign Office. ( f-tluii) NO Dear Hankey, wmmm &gt;ul wu You will reraeraber thaiT at the interdepartmental meeting which we held on July 11th to discuss the question of the control of the American civilian oil employees erecting ^ new refinery at Bahrein, we did not discuss, except in passing, the somewhat similar question raised in the Political Resident’s telegram No.1504 of the 26th June, as to the control of United States merchant seamen if landed on Sitrah Island for recreational purposes. The Political Resident will no doubt be expecting an expression of our views on this question. .Further reference to the /subjects subject is contained in the papers forwarded with the Political ^ Residents printed letter of 27th June, No.643-3 of which I enclose a copy. We take it in the first place that the problem is to secure that adequate arrangements are made to ensure that the seamen do not leave Sitrah Island and that the question of providing the necessary measures of police control to allow them to visit Manama and Muharraq (which would be a much more difficult business) does not arise. On this assumption, tt.^ '^uoat-ion is a much more simple one than the other and it should be quite unnecessary to make elaborate arrangements for special constables to deal with the seamen. *All that t &amp; /isis required is for adequate measures of control to be taken by the American naval authorities to ensure that parties allowed to land w * ; on Sitrah Island do not attempt to enter the towns of Manama and Muharraq. We should have thought it would be a simple matter for them to send their own pickets to accompany each party (from the fourth sentence of paragraph 7 of Major nickinbothara*s letter of 17th June it appears that U.S. naval personnel are carried in eaoh merchant ship), and that it should not be difficult to get over their jurisdictional difficulties. We would therefore suggest, if you agree, that the Foreign Office should take the matter up with the U.S. Embassy on this basis, explaining that we and the Sheikh /off J&gt; o Oc ^ a^£syyc&gt;&lt;i &lt;K/^.

T jy.n HikbC:. JI - a ..-i 0 In April 1944 I wa&amp; informed by the naval Cflicer in Jharge Bahrain that the question of facilities for personnel in l .a. I ereliant ^hips visiting Bahrain, proceeding ashore had been raised in view of the local restrictions imposed by His Highness the oha ikh of Bahrain. 2. It was reported tome that the iolitical Agent, Bahrain# advised by you, had ruled that this was a matter entirely for the Boyal Havy. 5. ^t the time 1 felt, with respect, that I could not suoscribe to this view. 4*. On further reflection it has seemed to me that the under lying reason for your ruling lay- in the fact that the orders prohibiting civilian personnel of all merchant ships visiting Hanamah were issued over the signabure of the Laval efficer in Jharge, Bahrain. But in fact, such orders are only issued to confirm to the expressed wishes of the Bahrain Government and hence the governing decision is a political one and not an initial responsibility of the Boyal Havy. 5. ' ou will be aware that Jommander . .Benkart, U.5.1 .B., Beni or United States naval observer at Basra recently visited Bahrain and that he raised the question with the lolitical ^gent. % 6 . Shortly after his return from Bahrain he dined with me and in talking of his visit mentioned certain problems at Bahrain which gave him cause for concern. He clearly felt unhappy about the position ir which the matter of united states personnel landing at Bahrain was left, and inferred that he felt he should bring it to the notice of his super id' authorities in v/ashingt on. 7. 1 feel that whether one likes it or not, this is a problem that has come to stay and which may most probably develop vdth increasing insistence# 8 . To the best of’ my knowledge there is no united states Governmental responsible official residing at Bahrain and it is not a development that we should wish to encourage. 9. It serins desirable to settle the problem locally if possible, rather than officially, via v/ashington, thence presumably through the United states Minister at Baghdad and thence through your good seIf . 10. Being essentially a political matter, no solution of the problem can rest with me, but in my wisdom I felt that 1 could at least be of some help if I acted as a medium for Jommander Benkart f s problems t o be represented to the'proper political au thor itie s • Hence the enclosed correspondence which is self explanatory, and a copy of which the aval Officer in Jharge, ;ahraii. is showing to the Political -igent, there# ^d . &lt;1 ... • .« * ./JO. 00: L mCGK.(Enclosure to Persian Gulf letter 'o.P.G. 501 dated 13/6/1944). ap 13-7 aerial 9 June 1914. t&gt; i S I De ar Jomrnod ore Howson : Thi&amp; wi 11 a cknow 1 edge your 1 e 11 ei’ _ .... . . our conversation on the evening of June 6 which had reference to two matters in particular that were encountered during my recent trip to Bahrain.

Goddin is not responsible for liaison work but his office, in the absence of any other U.B. 'aval representative, has erdeavoured to perform such duties. This has brought up the question as to whether or not at least one ad itional naval ofi icer should be attached to this office and assigned to Bahrain with additional duties on the mainland for contact of armed guard and merchant crews of . Vessels as well as other liaison work. On Bahrain Island no shore leave is permitted to the armed guard or merchant crews of any 7 U._&gt;. vessels, either tankers or cargo ships, although in the past, Lieut Godiin has arranged, with the cooperation of oil company officials, boxi.ig bouts v/hereby both the merchant and armed guard crev/s of a particular vessel wer-e brought to the oil company club and were participants as well as spectators. ihis worked very well but is not a regular thing and the entire crew was otherwise restricted to the vessel. This question of shore leave was discussed with j.r. Hickinbotham, British lolitical ^gent, as v/ell as with Japtain Jampbell and squadron Leader .^cott of the latter just happening t o be in Bahrain at the time of my visit, ir. Hickinbotham mentioned the fact that the only police protection on the island was a comparatively small native force headed by ahaikh Khalifa bin 1, ohara ed (the old Bha inn’ &amp; son'^, wnich was wholly inadequate to deal with 30 or 40 sailors who were out to do the town and he had no suggestions to offer as to how The situation could be remedied. Japtain Jampbell advised that he only had a small staff of Sergeants primarily concerned with counter-espionage work; that they were assigned to specific jobs and could not be used as military police. The fLfP and .f;j are on the island in quite large numbers, the latter having recently established | an air station there but what, if any, arrangements they have [ for militar. police are not known. Due to the remoteness of ^astanura from any native towrp the fact that there is little or no hard liquor for sale and that about the only things to do ashore are to swim and fish, the granting of shore leave there does not seem to present any particular problem; it is believed that when the construction ships start coming in satisfactory arrangements can be made with the Arabian .mmerican petroleum company. However, the situation at Bahrain is somewhat different and it is felt that some law-enforcement agency in addition to the local police should be established enabling the crews of all vessels to go ashore. The ships taking cargo for Bahrain are sometimesthere for several weeks and it is unfair, if not inhuman, to restrict men to their ship in the extreme heat especially after a long voyage of 6 or 7 weeks* In the case of the tankers it is true that they are in port for a comparatively short while but mar^y of them are on a shuttle run but the crew does not get much diversion ashore at best and it may be that similar restrictions are imposed at the port on the other end, resulting in their being aboard ship for weeks on end. In the case of our own naval gun crews it is felt that sufficient discipline could be maintained ashore .^hereby it v/ould not cause the local ‘authorities any great amount of concern. -here could also be sent from each ship two ratings designated as shore patrol but according to their regulations they would have no jurisdiction over the merchant crews. However, Lieut. Groddin and myself are of the opinion that the armed guard crew should not be allowed ashore if the merchant crew is restricted as this would make for bad blood and lowered morale. ns to pilferage, it seems to be rife on all cargo ships calling at Bahrain, and Gray HacKenzie apparently do not have the means of correcting the situation. Enclosure (3) is a report from Lieut. God -in T s of ice with regard to the wholesale pilferage on one particular ship, the 33 george -I. lendleton which you will-note contains a recommendation that armed guard crews of U.o. vessels be made to stand a cargo security watch, although contrary to writ fen regulations wherein they are only ii instructed to stand such a watch in the case of the discharge of ammunition, I have already authorized Lieut. 'Godwin to order the armed guard officers to detail^ such a watch on all ships going into Bahrain. This should not, however, relieve j .Gray HacHenzie of the responsibility of endeavouring to check this large scale pilferage. It is understood they do not send ^ any Europeans out to the ship but only a gang of coolies with . a native foreman who could very well be in league with such X activities. while I was in Bahrain the police apprehended a native with some stolen cargo and traced the source to a Gray HacKenzie clerk whose quarters were found to be piled high with cargo pilfered from r.B. and British ships including, 1 under staj the Be sang. I am fully av/are of the handicap under which Gray- Ha c' r enzie are required to w ork and fully appreciate that we cannot let crews of merchant ships go ashore and tear the town apar t but, as I mentioned to you, these two things were brought v to ray attention and it is possiole that something can be done to remedy both situations. hesp ectfully (3igned j .bBT'HB : Enelos urea : (a) Copy of report by Lieut.

Although up to aate this offic has been able to spare uen for liaison activities, an expanded prograi.; of Bavy petroleum liftings during the latter part of 1944 map sever fly limit the time which can be devoted to this work • Further, tlx is office is somewhat handicapped due to the fact that it is not officially designated or. organized to function as a Liaison Office. jue to the increasing number of ^jaerican . tankers calling at Bahrain and considering the xtrojected construction of a 50, 000 bbl/day refinery across the channel at has fanura, 3audi -scab ia, which will necessitate a large number of American vessels calling to discharge construction materials at has fanura, (star'ting in .Tune 1944), and then upon completion of the con struction, a further steady flow of tankers to lift the refined products, it is recommended that consideration be given to place ment of I'.o. aval Liaison representatives in this area. ~t both Bahrain and has Tanura the lack of facilities ashore including adequate law enforcement agencies, and the limitations on conduct imposed by the strong Eoslem attitude against use of liquor or loose relationships with women, impose unusual diffi culties in arrangeing shore leaves for ^rmed Guard and Ferchant Karine person'.el. To maintain morale, particularly during the intense heat of summer, it is essential that ahip T s person el be represented ashore and that special arrangements, in cooper ation with the oil company and local government representatives, be made to ensure shore leaves. In addition to handling shore leave problems, it is desirable that a u.^. haval liaison Officer be present to handle ship’s mail, voyage reports, medical and disciplinary cases, ship’s security, issuance of supplies, e tc • &gt; Ihe most pressing need for a Liaison man is at has 'fanura, where at the present time, there is no naval representative what soever.

They enquired with regard to the arrangements for the custody of convicted persons and the procedural with regard to appeals* I explained that we were not v/el'l equipped as far as jail accommodation v/as concerned but that there was provision for the imprisonment in India of persons convicted by the Agency courts and that in the case of anything but very short sentences I would request that the confii ement was carried out in India. ,/ith regard to appeals I explained that an appeal’lay to the Chief Court at Bushire.

The refinery project on which they vrere employed was likely to be completed by the end of the year. J T ' danki.y (Foreign Office; considered that it was desirable for H.M.G. to take the initiative themselves in the matter of providing the necessary- police protection at Bahrain. The Foreign Office would not see any great objection as a temporary measure to the posting of U.S. ^rovost Personnel/as special constables under the Political Agent. He suggested however that as a long term measure it was necessary to maintain the arrangements in our hands and that it would oe desirable to consider sending back to Bahrain the European police personnel which were there before 194-3 (see paragraph 1 of the Political Resident's telegram No*_g 1 1457). ^ The general feeling of the meeting was that the balance of advantage lay in the provision of U.S. rather than British Provost Personnel, since it would be easier for the former to deal with refractory U. S. civilians without ccc^licati-oiia - and difficulties arising. It was pointed out that the additional Provost Personnel wOuTdncmn al ly he held in reserve at ] uharraq and would only be called upon to act at the Refinery in the event of further trouble arising. In the event of the U. S. Authorities proving unwilling to supply personnel on these conditions then Paiforce might be asked to supply British personnel instead. The repre sent ative did not think that there would be any great difficulty in Paiforce making available a small number of such personnel. i* The Air ministry representati ve said that they were not clear as to the position of the R.

His Directive did not include any instructions about VVC- responsibility for anti-sabot | sasures at the Refinery, / It was agree d that the Far Office should draft a telegram (which should he sent in draft foim to the other departments concerned) to Paiforce, asking them to approach General Connollywith a view tp the necessary U, S. Provost Personnel being supplied on these conditions. General Connolly would presumably refer the matter to Washington and if as a result it was found that objection was seen in Washington to this proposal then Paiforce should take steps to provide the necessary British personnel themselves, ihe War Office telegram would be repeated to the r.

'Ncarchus' on the 17th of March. 0 tfaywkr offered to accommodate both the Minister and Mr. Fletcher, the American Consul from Basrah who accompanied him, at the Agency, but owing to a previous arrangement with Mr. Anderson General Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited they declined the invitation and stayed at the Bahrain Petroleum Company's settlement at Awali. , . 2. In company with the Assistant Political Agent, Mr. Lloyd N. Hamilton, and Mr. Ward Anderson, I mot the Minister on his arrival. Tho same evening I gave a dinner party at the Agency at Awali in his honour to which were invited his hosts^and the leading members of the British and American community in Manama. 3. On the 18th I took Mr. Henderson to call on the Shaikh at the ^adabiyah House and His Highness returned the call at the Agency the same morning. After His Highness* return call I had an opportunity for private conversation with Mr. Henderson and Mr. Fletcher. 4. Mr. Henderson said that he was worried about the attitude of the Berchtel-McCone-Pursons Corporation employees. Ho enquired what the machinery was for the trial and punishment of persons who were not subject to the authority of the Bahrain courts. This was explained to him clearly and concisely and he was informed that persons sentenced by the Agency courts could be transferred to India to serve their term. It was obvious to the Minister that although the machinery was present and in theory the procedure was simple in practice there would be many difficulties to overcome and much time would have to be spent before an American citizen found himself in Karachi serving a sentence of imprisonment at the expense of the Government of India. I informed the Minister that it was hoped that American Army Provost Personnel would shortly arrive and that they wpuld /deal2. deal adequately with any bickering that might take place. Mr. Henderson said that it was wrong that American citizens should be ablo to commit crimes and go not only unpunished but he given distinct advantages over their more industrious and well-behaved fellows by being flown to the United States. C ^ The Company's policy at present is to saying nothing and fly bad characters out as quickly as possible. 6 . The Minister enquired what my reaction would be if it were possible to make the employees of the B.M.P. Corporation subject to American Military Law. He explained that this has been done in various parts of the world and in particular in Iraq and that it would then be possibxe to arrest and try by American Courts Martial anyone committing a crime. The advantate 5 of the system swrs that firstly bad hats do not go Scot-free, secondly the local police and the Political autho rities were not called upon to spend valuable time in prosecutirig and trying American offenders, and thirdly should an individual be convicted he could be 'taken care of' in the American prison at Khorramshahr or in one of the State penitentiaries in the United States and would be removed to these establishments without any inconvenience to the Bahrain Government or the Political Agency and at the expense of the United States Govern ment. &gt; ^ b- t ^ kJr •(- ^ t. ^ 5 ^ ^ uLU^ MS (*~s- AcA . I informed the Minister that I could give no official answer without consulting the Hon'ble the Political Resident and he replied to the effect that he was not asking nn official question and had no power so to do, for he susppcted that the American Governments agreement with the B.M.P. Corporation would be so worded as to preclude any attempt to place their employees under military law but that he would like to know my private reaction. I said that my private opinion was that x an arrangement such as he had suggested would appear to solve what might prove to be a serious problem. /Hr TMr. Henderson informed me that he had suggested to Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Anderson that they ehould discuss the matter informally with General Connolly on their forthcoming visit to Tehran and obtain tils views. If there was any intention of proceeding with the matter Mr.Andarson would raise the question with me and then It could be carefully gone into. 6. Mr. Henderson left for Dhahran on the afternoon of the 18th and returned on the afternoon of the 20th after having visited the Arabian American Oil Company installations both at til Khobar and Has Tanurah. On the afternoon of the 20th shortly after he had visited the American Arabian Mission Hospital he had tea with me. The convvsrsation during tea was quite informal and on this occasion Colonel Converse U.S. Military Attache* at Baghdad and Mr. Fletcher were also present. Colonel Converse flew r down to Bahrain on the 16th to be present on the Minister*s arrival.

As the American Consul’s ICxc^quatur to the Saudi Government will according to internetiomd practice specify his district, i. e. Dham?an I am not clear how fai’ we can formally recognise his jurisdiction in Bahrain* er State foreign to Saudi Arabia, without the concurrence of Saudi Government to whose territory he is specifically appointed., Diplifnatic Missions often cover more than one territory but I do not recall similar instances V? consular jurisdiction. *3* .In our discussions with Persia we have rigidly refrained from public examination and discussion of our position in the islands. If proposed appointment is formally recognised we &amp;iay sooner or later have to race such examination and discussion if requests for similar facilities\for their Consuls at Jedda or elsewhere are made by Iraq or Persia or cny other power. An addsd complication in such an event would be that we would either have to admit that exclusive agreement of 1892 is a dead letter or take a stand on this agreement and declare Bahrain a protectorate. Taking all this into consideration I suggest our best course would be to endeavour to avoid formally recognising jurisdiction of U.S. Consul at Dhahran and allow him to enter Bahrain on the same fop-ting as his colleagues at Bagdad or Basra. This should satisfy Americans v/ho have been informed of our difficulties but in last/^esort the Kings 5 Bxeq&amp;ater should suffice. The Sheikh is a small or man than Sultan of Zanzibar and there are gravest objections to giving him any international position* ^ Incidentally, Political Agent reports that Sheikh’s attitude toward. Americans has recently undergone a change owing largely to behaviour of Bahrain Petroleum Company employees and ho would now be disturbed and not repeat not’ flattered by presence of American Consulate.

Foliation anomaly: 1b.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file concerns the secondment of eight serving British police officers (one inspector, one sergeant, and six constables) to serve with the Bahrain State Police. The issue arose in 1944 following incidents at Bahrain involving United States (US) citizens employed in refinery construction (particularly those employed by the Bechtel-McCone-Parsons Corporation) and US merchant seamen. It was considered that the local Arab police were unable to deal with the situation unaided. Various proposals were discussed, including the use of US Provost personnel, and the supply of British military police. In view of the fact that the British Government exercised limited jurisdiction in Bahrain (particularly control over foreigners), the decision was taken to recruit British policemen.The papers include: Bahrain State Police conditions of service (folios 484-502); miscellaneous papers concerned with the individuals recruited (folios 412-483); discussion of the possible use of US Provost personnel, March-September 1944 (including correspondence from the India Office, the Foreign Office, the War Office, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf); discussion of the possible use of British military police and National Fire Service personnel, August-October 1944; papers concerning the recruitment of British police officers from the United Kingdom (including correspondence from the Home Office, and the various constabularies involved); their terms and conditions; lists of applicants and interview papers; papers concerning the British policemen's uniform, pay, and passage to Bahrain; and papers concerning conditions in Bahrain, and the resignation of Inspector Charles H Crowe, October-December 1945.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Recruitment of staff for work overseas</topic></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain State Police</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Police personnel</topic></subject><subject><topic>Uniforms</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000209#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
