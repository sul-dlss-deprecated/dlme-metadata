It has been decided by the Government of India that the work relating to the Government of India Insurance Agent Licence Fee Stamps under rule 9(l)(c) of the Government of India 'Rules for the Supply and Distribution of Stamps' should be centralised in the Office of the Controller of Stamps,Nasik Road,to whom Treasury Officers should here after send direct their quarterly indents for Government of India Insurance Agent Licence Fee Stamps for scrutiny and supply. 2. ^ These stamps are meant for payment of fees by Insurance Agents for licence to act as Insurance Agents and they are the property of the Central Government. Separate quarterly indents should therefore be prepared and submitted to the undersigned, whether a supply is required or not. The indent should show (1) the balance on the 1st of the month in which the indent is prepared, (2) the quantity sold during the pieced- ing quarter including issues to branch depots,(3)the quantity due if any from the Central Stamp Store against previous indent and (4) the quantity required for the quarter which should include reserve equal to three months’ requirements on the basis of treasury quarterly issues. 3. It may be noted that the procedure to be followed for the custody, distribution etc. of these stamps is governed by the Govern ment of India 'Rules for the Supply and Distribution of Stamps' which are reproduced in the Central Government compilation of the Treasury Rules Vol II C.A.C. as appendix 9. 4. There are two denominations, viz. Re. I/- and Rs. 1-8-0 of Government of India Insurance Agent Licence? Fee Stamps, and these are printed in sheets of 128 stamps each. Demands should be made in full sheets as far as possible and if less than a sheet is required, in multiples of l/l6th of a sheet which is the minimum quantity issued from 'this Store. . The Rs, 1-8-0 stamp is meant for Licence Fee and Re. 1/- Stamp for payment of penalty fee and duplicate licence fee. N 5. The sale proceeds of these stamps should be credited to the Central Government Account under the head 'XXXVI-Miscellaneous depart ments - Miscellaneous -Fee realised under the Insurance Act 1938' . It may be noted that these stamps should not be confused v\^Lth other stamps overprinted with the word'INSURANCE'which cannot be used for the purpose of payment of fee .for licence to act as Insurance Agent. 7. As the Government of India Insurance Agent Licence Fee Stamps are meant for sale to the public (without any restriction),especially to the Insurance Companies, their Chief Agents or employees, these stamps should be so3.d to any member of the public or any firm or any Company. 8. Preliminary supply of Government of India Insurance Agent Licence Fee Stamps was made to 114 treasuries as per the distribution list received from the Superintendent of Insurance,Government of India, Simla in November 1944 but all the remaining treasuries ( other than 114 treasuries referred to above) having demands for these stamps from the prospective Insurance. Agents should hereafter prepare and forward indents to the undersigned for scrutiny and supply as per para 2 above. 99. Your indent for January - March 1947 quarter should please be prepared and submitted direct to me urgently for scrutiny and suddIv. ii not already sent. ’ 10. Sub-treasuries should obtain their requirements of these stamps from their respective district treasuries. 11. Treasury Officers should maintain adequate stocks of these stamps especially where the Head Offices and-branch offices of Insur- ance Companies are situated with a- view to avoid complaints from them and their agents, emergent indents being sent whenever necessary.

According to information supplied by your office to mine, although Consular stomps are being used for the grant of new passports Indian Court Fee stamps are still b*ing used for visas, endorsements and renewals. The revenue from Indian Court Fee stamps goes to the Government of India and as the whole cost of the Bahrain Agency Is now b*ing borne by His Majesty’s Government British Consular stamps should now be used wherever possible. If you do not possess a sufficient supply of the stamps you will no doubt let me know. 2. Would you kindly report what stamps are being used for notarial work. There are separate British notarial stamps but in Muscat Consular stamps are being used for notarial as well as Consular purposes and it will save trouble in the way of accounting if this can be done, at Bahrain.

Stamps were not cancelled against money collected for certain services such as Registration, the prescribed fee for which is laid down as Rel/-. Instead of cancelling stamps the usual practice was to impress the round seal and inscribe * fee paid Re 1/-% with the result that stamps on hand always showed an excess. 2. The smaller denominations, specially the Ish and 6 ds, were mostly out of stock and the same practice of impressing the round seal was followed even for certain visas granted. 3. There was hardly any proper check on stamps on hand and axxisng axxiKBXExwa: in the absence of any proper slejexk check on stocks it was easy to submit accounts to the F.0. This _ surplus, I am inclined to think, is thex accumulationx of r yearr* In this connection I would like to pglxtxg mention that soon after I took over I pointed out the absence of any prpper accounts for Consular fee stamps.

Jjiad, London, N.l. ~ ^ .. —t ♦ I Ho.F- f^-17/4 Dear Finance Department, Mr. Jakins* letter F-102 of 27th October regarding fee stamps. 2 . I find that it is impossible to reconcile the stamp records and the accounts before 1st October 1949; any attempt at reconstruction in order to complete the H Forms by calculation, would be inaccurate and misleading. In place of H Forms therefore I attach a statement showing details of fee stamps received from the Foreign Office since April 1948 and of stamps sent to other posts since that date. The balance on hand at 1st October 1949 was £1,045-16-6. This should indicate that fees to the value of £8,838-1-0 had been collected between 1-4-48 and 30-9-49. 3. In fact the accounts for these seven quarters show quite different figures and it seems clear that more money was collected thatl stamps were cancelled. The main causes of this discrepancy appear to be a)that stocks were frequently running out, particularly in the smaller denominations; when this happened, the fee was collected and the amount of the fee written in pen on the document concerned, and b) that consider able confusion was caused by the need to convert from one currency to another, particularly after instructions were received to use a rate of exchange different from that used by the bank. As a result curious figures such as £1.2.10 appear in the fee book; moreover the mysteries of exchange equalisation had never been revealed to the accountant who in his quarterly account converted the currency received in respect of fees into sterling at the bank rate. It must be remembered that the Indian staff had no experience of Foreign Office practice when they started to use Consular fee stamps, and they were accustomed to work exclusively in rupees; nor did they have anyone with more experience to guide them. I do not consider that there are any grounds to fear that the discrepancy might indicate any improprieties or irregularities in the handling of official funds, nor that any individual is especially' to blame. 4 . it is also impossible to draw up any statement of the Indian Fee Stamps that could be reconciled with the accounts. After the transfer of responsibility, these stamps were only used from 1st April until 7th June 1948 after which only consular stamps v/ere used. A statement drawn up at 1st April showed a stock as follows:- Agency Hs«60,288- 8- 0 Residency 254- 2- 0 Sharjah 427- 0- 0 — Ks.60, 969-10- 0 Political Agency, * Bahrain, November 27, 1949 The figures for' the Residency and Sharjah had however been the same for a considerable time and clearly represented an advance made some time earlier and not the actual position at those posts on that date. On 7th June the fee stamps were all collected together and a final stocktaking showed:- • v/ v Agency Residency The Finance Department, Sharjah Foreign Office. London S.W.l Rs.39,828- 3- 0 254- 2- 0 420- 2- 0 Es.40,502- 7- 0V * f / -2- This whole stock has been held here until a few days ago, when on receipt of instructions from the Government of India, I destroyed them. The balance of stamps used in the Agency between 1st April and 7th June cannot be reconciled with the account for the June Quarter 1948, since the stamps were used partly for court work and partly for passport work, and fees for the latter appear in the accounts as one lump sum for the complete quarter, together with fees collected after 7th June. 5* With reference to your letter of 8th August 1949, I am afraid that it has not been possible to trace your letter of 9th April, 1949 to which it refers. I can r ind no record of the Agency having received stamps to the value of £293-18-0, but I should be grateful if you would send details of when they were sent so that further investigations may be made.

Dear hesiuency, With reference to your letter 85/91/49 dated the 24th December 19^9 it is requested that the registration fees referred to be dealt with on the basis of affixing a stamp for Is. 6d. and collecting a fee of 1 rupee. This means, oi course, that for this particular fee you will be collecting at the rate ol tfs.13.3 = xl instead of .ts.15 = £1 indic ated in Foreign Office letter XF08/9K1/49) dated the 4th February, 1949* eud used for collecting Consular Fees in general. But there should still be a slight gain by exchange. 2. These registration fees should be shown in the agencies accounts as separate entries, together with separate supporting schedules, the rate of exchange quoted being us.lj.3 = xl. 3 , forms H anu I, being quoted in sterling, will not be affected. Yours ever CODoLLLh.ii Dxji-'aRTMnhT Political Residency Bahrain.Minutes. &amp;&gt; Nothing to be Written in this Margin. 'tvi ■ H.M. Political Agent Bahrain, The consular fee stamps held by the Agency have been checked and the balances in hand on the 8th March found correct according to the last quarterly return and the fee cash book. 2. It is observed, however, that the main stock of stamps, amounting at present to £2,933.14s. is in the custody of Mr Viswanathan. This is irregular and these stamps should be transferred to the charge of aU.K.-based officer who should also keep the necessary records of issues and receipts. I should be glad if you would make arrangements accordingly. 3. In view of the very considerable number of visas srd certificates of identity granted and registration fees collected I see no objection to the practice under which records of these are kept in a separate book, the daily totals being carried to the fee cash book, provided that the records show the names of the persons concerned and the amount of each individual fee. Similarly in the case of shipping fees the name of the vessel should be shown and, as these are few in number, it would be preferable that they should be entered individually in the fee cash (A. S. Paterson) March 8, 1950Minnies. m H.M. Political Agent Bahrain, I wish to confirm the verbal recommendations I have made to you, your accountant and your passport office clerk regarding the manner in which the fee cash book records should be kept. 2. At present it is the practica only to enter in the fee cash book the sterling amount of the fees, which should of course be the sane as the fee stamps affixed and cancelled. The actual cash collected in rupees is paid by the passport office to the accountant at irregular intervals, generally not less than a fortnight, during which considerable amounts accumulate in the hands of the passport office though I understand that much of this accumulation is in the form of fees payable by the British American petroleum Company in respect of registration and passport services for their employees and actually settled by cheque or out of a deposit maintained by tham with the Agency. The rupee amounts of these fees, corresponding to the sterling fee stamps used,is not however entered in the fee cash book although this is required by the Instructions and a column, headed 'currency* is provided for the purpose, with the result that there afe discrepancies between the currency fees credited in the Foreign Office quarterly account and the sterling fee stamps used as shown in Form H, a discrepancy which is accentuated when, as occurred both at the end of the September and December quarters, some of the cash collected during the last week or fortnight of the quarter was not handed over to the accountant until sometime after the beginning of the following quarter. 3. To obviate these discrepancies in future the fee cash book should be kept strictly- in accordance with the form shown in Annex 7 to Chapter VI of the General Instructions for H.M. Foreign Service 1949, the currency amount of each fee collected being duly entered in the currency column. This applies of course to the subsidiary fee cash records kept in respect of visa, passport and registration transactions, the totals from which are carried ^nto the master fee cash book. Although /Minutes. Although, as a matter of convenience, the a.,iOunts collected may be paid in at intervals, and not necessarily daily, these intervals should be regular and not haphazard - certainly not exceedirg a week at a time - and a final settlement must (repeat must) be made at the close of business on the 3ast day of the quarter, regardless of whether that day is the end of a week or not, so that the amount of cash in currency fees paid into the accountant shall correspond exactly to the sterling fees entered in the cash book and fee stamps used during the same period. 4. I realise that a very considerable part of the fees are not paid in cash over the passport office counters but collectively by BAPCO and the other oil companies in respect otf services for their employees. Provided these concerns maintain deposits with the Agency sufficient to cover their liabilities in respect of such fees, so that the requirement contained in Regulation 3 of the Consular and Marriage Fees Regulations 1949, as to the payment in advance of fees, is not infringed, I see no objection to the collective settlement of such fees out of the deposits, but no departure must be made from the rule that the currency amount of each individual fee must be entered. If desired, fees to be recovered from a deposit can be indicated in some suitable manner in the fee book. (A. S. Paterson) March 13, 1950mam -- British Agency, Doha, 3rd July, 1930.

The P.R. has asked us to discontinue use of Indian Court fee stamps. We have already intimated our requirements of stamps to the Residency;vide S.No.43. It is therefore not understood what indent of stamps- Indian or British- is now required by the Residency, and whether they mean that Indian Court fee stamps should be used for r ourt work and British Consular stamps for uassnort and other consular work. It may^ also be confirmed that the Residency require specimens of Indian Court fee stamps only and not British Consular stamps.

The present practice with certain alterations warran ted by needs of convenience,acud efficiency and security is suggested in regard to the custody and distribution Ox the new consular stamps, viz., (a) The whole stock to be kept in C•9. who should keep a stock book as at present. (b) C.O. will issue to the Passport office small stocks periodically making necessary entries in a stock book kept by the Passport Office. This is now being done for the consular stamps used for the issue of new passports. (c.f. Account book below). This same book may be used as the old stock of stamps will have v to be included in the new stock of stamps. (c) The passport office (who alone can make the detailed ^ entries called for in the Red Book (Fee cash book;) will maintain a detailed account of the stamps used j showing the relevant fee table iiuaber. The same Red\ . Book used by the Passport Office may continue to be used. Registration fees will be credited under the head ’’Other Fees”, Rush fees under ?art III and Marriage fees under Part I. The sale proceeds of the stamps may be KZRdxtKct turned in to the Accountant fi*om time to time after obtaining his initials in the Red Book. A Monetary limit may be fixed of the amount the Passport Clerk may keep as cash with him. (d) • Tile cash handed over to the Accountant, together with the small stock of stamps with the Passport Clerk and the balance stock as shown in the Passport Cler^. stock book will give easy check of the stock of stamps in hand at any time. As the main stock is with the C.O, and lump amounts of sale proceeds of stamps are kept with the Accountant there will be&gt;vp fear of want of security. (e) The stamps needed for registration v. r ork and marriage fees are only occasionally required} these also can be obtained from the Passport Office. (f) When Court fee stamps arrive the same procedure may be followed, the Court Clerk taking small stocks from the C.O., maintaining his own Red Book giving details of judicial fees collected, and periodically paying in sale proceeds of stamps to the Accountant against his initials in the Fee Cash Book. Suggest that the new stamps may be used from 1st June 1948, uP .jry . ’ 'AJ He ? .. Hi Para 2. We have been in fact using Indian Coui*t Fee Stamps for Court cases, but this practice was stopped in May last; as the ^ Indian Court Fee stamps were to be replaced by F.O.Stamps for which we asked them to supply. Since then the Court has been ^ collecting feew without putting on stamps on applications $nd the fee so collected is subesequently credited into F.O.Account. Hence the balance of F.O. C.F.stamps is nil. The same is the 6ase with Sharjah Office, but the Passport Office has been supplying them with Consular Stamps of which a record is perhaps „ kept by that office from which we can find oift what balance they should have with them. , &gt; nara 3. I understand a quarterly return of Consular Stamps is being sent reguarly by the Passport Office, giving the balance in hand and value of stamps etc. used during the quarter. '7z- Para 4.

I have introduced the two forms placed below ( one for Sharjah and one for Passport office here. I hatfe told the passport clerk that whenever he wants to deposit mohe# on account, of sale of stamps he should fill in the form, sign it and then $£nd* it to me with cash. At‘the end of each quarter while sending his Stamp Return to F.O.London he should also give me one copy of his return and these chalans we will attach to this return and send to London with our quarterly Mfc Account. - r t r t We may also forward the chalan to Sharjah and ask them to complete it at the end of each quarter and send it to us here.'
