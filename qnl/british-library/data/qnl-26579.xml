The meeting (draft minutes of which are attached) generally accepted the view: (a) that the idea of the desert zone should be abandoned; (b) that the brown line shoula be extended as far East as Meridian 53. The War Office were in some aoubt as to whether we could not afford to go much farther East and the Foreign Office gladly took this opportunity to urge that we should make a still more extensive concession. I resisted this and saia that we were not prepared to make any concession beyond Meridian 53, if only because Meridian 53 was well to the East of the area within which any effective jurisdiction or authority was exercised by Ibn Saud. The meeting generally accepted this view. (c) that certain slight territorial adjustments shoula be made in favour of the Saudis in the north and south between Meridian 52 and 53. These dia not seem to be of any special importance and I concurred in them; (d) that no concession could be made to Ibn Saud in the region of Banaiyan, in the Khor-al-Odeia, or on the southern boundary of Qatar; (e) that the simplest course would be to lay aowntbefrontier in a single comprehensive instrument as being 'between Saudi Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, aou Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate on the other', thus avoiding any question of defining the/ 2956 6000 7 34 r3/ the boundaries inter se of the various Arab States or Rulers. It would, of course, be understood tnat so far as Abu Dhabi and Qatar were concerned the matter would be handled entirely by H.M.G. and there would oe no reference to the obtaining of a power from them in virtue of their complete control of the foreign relations of the sheikhdoms. I suggested further: (f) that, desirable as it was to meet Ibn Saud over this question so long as we could oo so without compromising our own position, and unimportant as concessions in the Central Desert might be, the settlement of international validity of his territorial position in the Desert was not entirely without risk in view of the uncertainty of the Saudi regime once Ibn Saud himself died. In these circumstances our view here would, I thought, be that if no agreement could be reached on the basis of a further extension of the brown line in full sovereignty such as was now under discussion, it might oe better to let negotiations break down. This should ! be made clear to sir A.

Foreign Office. S.W.l. 18th April, 1935. CM ir ) With reference to the meeting of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee which was held on the 15th April to discuss the question of the south eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you herewith to be laid before Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare the draft of a telegram to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda, containing revised instructions, based upon the conclusions reached by the Sub-Committee, for his guidance in negotiation with the Saudi Government. 2. It will be observed that the instructions in the second sentence of paragraph five of the draft depart slightly from the conclusion reached at the meeting in regard to the Northern boundary of the next territorial concession to be offered to King Ibn Saud. On further consideration of the matter in the Foreign Office it was felt that the exact position of Banaiyan, which it is essential to maintain within the dominions of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, was too uncertain to permit of parallel 23 N. being safely used to define the limit of the proposed concession. It appeared preferable to describe the boundary line as '’running from a point on the green line ”to the south of and distant at least five miles from Banaiyan ’’to the intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 22 o 30 0 ’’, and Sir John Simon suggests that this definition safeguards the rights of Abu Dha,bi to Banaiyan, even if the position of the wells as shown on the map illustrating Mr. Bertram Thomas’ journey should have to be revised in the light of a The Under Secretary of State, future/ India Office.future survey. It would appear convenient to allow the northern boundary of the possible further concession to run along parallel 22°30 0 between meridians 52° and 53°. 3. It will further be noted that Sir Andrew Ryan would be instructed by paragraphs 5 and 6 of the draft telegram to offer the proposed further territorial concessions to Ibn Saud 'in full sovereignty and without any servitudes', although in the original Instructions sent to him in Foreign Office telegram No, 8 of the 16th January it was laid down that any concession in full sovereignty of part of the then proposed desert zone would be 'subject, however, to the 'servitude that no concessions would be granted therein by ”Ibn Saud except after consultation with His Majesty f s 'Majesty*g Government and by the Saudi Government'. This question was not specifically raised during the meeting of the Sub-Committee on the 15th April, but it has since been considered in the Foreign Office and discussed semi-officially with the India Office, with the result that Sir John Simon has come to the conclusion that It would no longer be appropriate or practicable to retain the Idea of attaching servitudes of any nature to the territory to be offered to the King In full sovereignty. It will be recalled that it was originally proiaosed to make the offer of sovereignty over the area to the West of meridian 52 bounded by the so-called 'brown line' as the last stage in the negotiations and subsequent to the offer of the desert zone, and since under this arrangement the concession of the 'brown line' area assumed the form of a derogation from the desert zone (of which it originally formed a part) it appeared suitable at 'Government and to concessionnaires approved both by Histhat time to retain in its case a part at least of the servitudes applying to the desert zone itself. Now that the idea of the desert zone has been abandoned it would, I in Sir John Simon f s opinion, be difficult to justify the imposition of any servitude on territory ceded to Ibn Saud in otherwise full sovereignty and he fears tnat to attempt to impose a condition of this nature would impede and possibly even prevent a successful outcome of the negotiations. He trusts that Sir Samuel Hoare will share this view and be able to concur in the instructions sent to Sir Andrew Ryan on the point. 4. Sir John Simon will be glad to learn at an early date whether Sir Samuel Hoare concurs in the terms of the draft telegram. 5. A similar letter is being addressed to the other Departments represented on the Sub-Committee, with the exception of the Treasury, to which Department a copy of the draft telegram is being forwarded for information.

They think that it will he tetter not to attempt possibly difficult task of working out its details and of imposing is on Ihn Baud and to abandon the whole idea of desert zones or of special servitudes in this area, proceeding direct to offers of further limited concessions in full sovereignty by one or possibly two stages. 5. First and second stages contemplated in my telegram No. 8 /of January 167 i* e. defini tion of Ibn Baud’s claims and ofier of our opening concession have now been concluded and next stage will presumably open with Saudi reply to your offer of so-called 'green line' (see your telegram No,84 /of April 6/ paragraph 6), If, as you anticipate, this offer is re- rejected as entirely insufficient, you are now authorised to offer Ibn Baud in full sovereignty and without any servitudes further area enclosed by line running from a point on the green line to the south of, and distant at least 5 miles from Banaiyan to the intersection of meri dian 52 and parallel 22 3o, thence due south • • • *4. south along meridian 52 to its intersection with parallel 19 and thence in a straight line go the intersection of parallel 18 with the violet line. This can he referred to as the ’’brown line” concession. 6. If this also proves insufficient you may, as a last resort and if you think there is any hope of it leading to agreement, make a further olier in full sovereignty and without servitudes, of area bounded by a line running from the intersection of parallel 22°50 and meridian 52 due east to meridian 55, thence due south to the intersection of meridian 55 with the pro longation in a straight line of the southern boundary of the (brown line) concession des cribed in the preceding paragraph. His Majesty's Government are not prepared to make any con cession to Ibn Sand to the east of meridian 55. There is no evidence of his having any rights or permanent influence to the east of this line greater or as great as that of any of the7./ 5, other rulers concerned, and there are other serious objections to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire such rights or influence there,, You should not however allow yourself to be drawn into argument on this point and if this third offer fails to satisfy the King it will probably be necessary to suspend the negotia tions. Consequently, while appreciating the point in paragraph one of your telegram ho. 89 /of April 10th7 s I consider that, unless agreement is in sight, this concession should only be offered very cautiously. In possible event of negotiations not leading to early result their subsequent resumption vrould be on basis of position reached at end of present discussions, and if the con cession to meridian 55 is offered now without result, we shall have lost our last concession for purposes of future bargaining.) \ 8./ 6 . 7o As you are av/are and have yourself advised, there are strongest objections to allowing Ibn Saud to acquire access to the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula or to establish a position for himself as one of the Trucial Coast rulers* Moreover territory claimed to east of ,f green line” in this region has already been recognised by His Majesty’s Government as belonging to the Sheikhs of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, latter having been officially informed that His u. £-1 A !/Ur~ (s (fa Majesty’s Government regard his territory as ^ 7 (far extending all round Khor-al-Odeid. There can accordingly be no question of any con cession to Ibn Saud in this region. You should make this clear to the Saudi Govern ment and explain that you are unable to discuss any further concession East of Green line north of Banaiyan*7. 8 a Sub Committee also agreed that, in view of legal and practical difficulties likely to arise, it will be best not to attempt to define Saudi frontier in a purely negative sense as against a vacuum in the east (e e g 0 by mere recognition by His Majesty's Government that S.B. frontiers of Saudi Arabia are so and so) nor to secure purely negative renunciation by Ibn Saud (even if it 7 1 | could be obtained) of all rights or claims beyond those frontiers on lines of article 18 of Treaty of Lausanne. They consider best course will be to specify frontier, in a single comprehensive instrument, as being 'between Saudi-Arabia on the one hand and Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and Aden Protectorate on the other', without specifying the boundaries dividing the four latter terri tories from each other, and to regard full sovereignty/8 . i 4 sovereignty of ether states concerned as extending right up to boundary line.

RLhD'EL explained that in the absence of the Chairman on leave he had been ashed to take the Chair. He said that the papers which had been circulated fully explained the scope of to-day’s meeting^ but it might be advantageous if he briefly recapitulated the whole position. Saudi-Arabian boundaries were last discussed at the 37th meeting of the Middle Fast Official Sub-Committee in connection with his letter to Mr. Laithwaite dated 7th November 3 1934 (circulated as Paper No. M.E.(O) 162). Following on this discussion^ instructions had been issued to Sir Andrew Ryan in January 1935 9 the substance of which vi/as briefly as follows: in the first place to get a clear definition of Ibn Baud’s desiderata; secondly to offer Ibn Baud in full sovereignty the territory up to what was now known as the ’’green line” as shown on the sketch map circulated at the meeting. If this offer v^ere not acceptable 9 to offer the creation of a special '’desert zone” ? which would be bounded on the west by the ’’green line” and on the north and east by the ’’brown ’ 1 and'^yellow lines shown on the sketch map 9 the eastern limit running due south from the intersection of parallel 22° and meridian 55° to parallel 20. . 1were still The southern limits of the 'desert zone' subject to discussion 3 but would approximately follow the southern limit of the Great Sands. In the last resort 3 and in order to secure their desiderata in other directions^ His Majesty’s Government were prepared to concede a part of this desert zone as far east as meridian 52 E. which was shown on the map by a brown line: Ibn Saud to have full sovereignty in this area 3 subject to very limited servitudes® After these instructions had been issued 3 further consultation had tahen place with the authorities at Aden regarding the southern boundaries of the 'desert zone' or of any concession to be offered to Ibn Saud 9 and it now seemed clear that the tribes of the Hadramaut (in the Aden Protectorate) extended at the western end of the line at least as far north as parallel 18. On the assumption that the south-east corner of the 'desert zone' would be the intersection of parallel 20 with meridian 55 3 the Aden authorities had suggested that the best line for the southern limit of the concessions to be offered to Ibn Saud would be a straight line run ning from the intersection of parallel 18 with the so-call violet line to the intersection of parallel 20 with meridian 55. The effect of all this vms to reduce the 'desert zone' to a very smarl area 3 more especially in the certain event of its proving necessary to offer Ibn Saud the con cession up to meridian 52 east referred to above. In these circumstances the Foreign Office were wondering whet.uer ic was still really worth while embarking on the complicated procedure of the 'desert zone' which Ibn Saud-3- was unlikely to welcome and which would certainly be cumbersome and full of difficulties 3 for so very small an area. He understood that the India Office were inclined to share this view and it was therefore for consideration whether it would not now be better to abandon the whole idea of the desert zone and the system of servitudes and to proceed by offering Ibn Saud as the next step the territory up to meridian 52 (i.e. what v/as originally intended as the final concession referred to above ) 3 adding to this any further concession in full sovereignty that might be practical. When this line had originally been aiscussed 9 the India Office had been prepared to agree to its being taken as far east as meridian 53. If the idea of the desert zone were now to be dropped perhaps it might be possible to agree to this line being taken at least to that meridian. The first point for the Committee to consider was whether or not we should abandon the desert zone and give Ibn Saud a complete concession^ involving full sovereignty as far east as possible. The first two stages in the instructions to Sir Andrew^ i.e . 3 the statement of Ibn Saud T s desiderata and the offer in full sovereignty to Ibn Saud of the territory up to the green line? had been realised. The next stage would be to offer Ibn Saud the territory up to the brown line? as shown on the map? or preferably up to meridian 53. He understood that the India Office were on tile whole in favour of offering these concessions step by step and negotiating by a process of bargaining? not granting the maximum concession at the outset. It would be for the India Office to develop this view? but it seemed open to*0 A LaltatvaiW said tii&amp;t toe Inala Oillc« 'Vi) views proceeded on tos&gt; uesuapUon tuat there couiu be no Question ol any further concession to Ibc saua in the North beyond that shown by the green ana toe brown lines X . ariuian 52 respectively, subject to this they agreed with the procedure now suggested by toe Foreign Office, vis. that the iaea of the oeeert tone ahoula be abandoned ana that in dealing with Xbn a&amp;uu we ehouia negotiate in torse stages: (1) up to the green line; (2) brown line to Meridian 52; ana (3) if necessary, an extension of toe brown line up to Meridian 53, on the understanding that tois wouia be the ultimate concession. the offset would 5s that «« «hauiu 'an laying oown a fixed assert frontier shown on toe map between aauai ^ - ..rabia and our proteges . He wouia liKe in tois connection to refer to one or too other points. In toe first place, as regards the southern boundary of Qatar, which was a Question of considerable interest to the Defence Departments, toe India Office were of opinion tout toe boundary which hud been agreed last year between toe Department a and which ran in a 3 autht£astern direction from toe head of Dohat-as-3ulwa Bay south of salwu and sakatc to toe North of tne Khor-al- . aeid ahould be maintained. secondly, it had throughout been aseuaed that there could be no question of allowing Ibn Suud to obtain any outlet on toe const in tne vicinity of Uus hhor-ai-odeid. la any case H.W “ W recognised the duel a district ae i‘question whether this y^&amp;s really the wisest policy. If concessions were extracted from us one by one after much bargaining they might well acquire a greater value, and our eventual agreement to them might well be represented as more of a defeat than if we made our offers more easily and more completely in the first instance and stuck to them more firmly. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office based their views on the assumption that no further concessions would be given to Ibn Saud in the north. Their views regarding the green line at Banaiyan and the brown line at meridian 53 still held good. He agreed with the procedure suggested by Mr. Rendel, i.e., to discontinue the offer of the desert zone and to negotiate the concessions in three stages - (l) up to the green lins, (2) the brown lins to meridian 52, and (3) if necessary up to msridian 53 , on the understanding that this would be the ultimate concession. He would like to refer to one or two other points. Regarding the southern boundary of Qatar - which he thought was more the concern of the Defence Departments - he said he considered that the existing boundary running a south-eastern direction from the head of the Dohat- -Salwa Bay south of Salwa and Sakah to the north of the jr-al-Odeid, should be maintained. He could not con- iplate any possibility of Ibn Saud gaining any coastal -ritory in vicinity of the hhor-al-Odeid. Agal Longed to Abu Dhabi, who had a good historical claim that area.

If we told Ibn lines 9 he was not sure that we had tried to bluff must be remembered that some concessions beyond these that Ibn Saud would not think him in the earlier stage.

In that event they would be resumed at the |tage at which they had been left and if our maximum concession had been offered from the outset it would be much mo negotiations with any hope of re difficult to re-open success. THL CHAIRtvLAh agreed generally with the India Office view as regards the northern end of the line. It was clear ly impossible to give Ibn baud any part of the coast to the east of the Qatar Peninsula^. In the first place we were already committed to regarding the portion of the coast which Ibn Saud had asked for as belonging to Abu Dhabi. Secondly 9 if Ibn Saud were to establish himself on tne Irucial Coast he would become closely mixed up with fruciai Coast politics? with very inconvenient consequences. Sir A. Ryan had himself always attached the greatest importance to Ibn Saud not being ailowed to reach tne coast east of Qatar. In any case it was agreed chat the whole of the Khor-al-Odeid and the land immediately behind it? and the whole of the area as far as Banaiyan (which was an essential key point)in the south-west belonged to Abu Dhabi and could not under any circumstances be the more firmly we took our given to Ibn baud. But stand in regard to this northern area the more desirable it seemed that we should be as generous as possible in the east. MR. BLAXTLR said that the Colonial Office view was very similar to that expressed by the Foreign Office and India Office?. He agreed that we should abandon proposals for the. creation of a desert zone. The Coloniaj. Office were mainly concerned with the delineation of the southern boundary 9 referred to in Aden telegram Ho. 19 (circulated as Paper Ho. M.B*(0) 182 )9 and shown on the map as a yellow dotted line. He understood that it was not proposed to grant any concessions south of this line. WING GOMMAHDBR PIRIB said that the Air Ministry were only concerned in this question in so far as it affected Qatar ? and they had already expressed their views on this subject to the Foreign Office.

LAITHWAITE pointed out that it would be better to keep this line, as far as possible from the coast. In reply to a question from Wing Commander Pirie ? referring to co-terminous frontiers* THE CHAIRMAN said that the fact that the frontier originally proposed would be between Saudi-Arabia and a no-man’s land constituted the great weakness in our case. If we could claim the aria on the other side of the frontier for tribes under our protection we should be in a far stronger position* but as the Legal Advisers to the Foreign Office had explained last autumn* it was impossible for us to take a really firm line about frontiers against a vacuum* and it was clear that Ibn Saud realised this point. fie then referred to the question of how the pro posed frontier should be defined in any agreement with Ibn Saud. He pointed out that it might be possible to lay down in the eventual instrument such and such a line as being that which His Majesty’s Government recognised as the frontier of Saudi-Arabia* and Ibn Saud might then be persuaded to agree to renounce all rights beyond that frontier in much tne same way as the Turks had renounced ail rights outside thep ESM&amp;Jk* mla um% h®' aka m% taini^ &lt;3 Ui^X uie ladla office waulu odjact to a definition o' x&gt;m frontier m being a frontier Mtmma :$xmi Arabia an tne one side and the ■.’heiknooiiia etc* in geographical order on the other* This would t however, be on the clear understanding that there could be no question of or adu Dhabi being formally inent ioneu as .parties or foxmiiy assoc la tea -#ibh the n egotli^tions* Their foreign relations were in the hanus ol h*k*G* ana it was moat important not to compromise tills position in any way* Muscat was in a a liferent position endt subject 'to the views ox the resident ana •a./e Government of In hi a« ha thought that the India viflee woula not see objection to its beiits party to uis negotiations or at any rate a signatory of axy treaty* The ideal, if Muscat hah to to brought in, would be that toe sultan should be per suae eu to appoint Oir A* Ay an or mm other British officer as his representative ana not to produce a reprasontrtive Himself* The actual bouna/tiy to be apptnaea to any treaty coulu he base a on coordinates*'newly defined frontier of Turkey by Article XVI of -8- unci Treaty of Lausanne. This was not a very satisfactory method and left much uncertainty about the ar^a outside the frontier^ but it might at least avoid awkward questions about the status of the territory on the other side of the frontier and avoid the necessity of our having to negotiate with I bn Laud on behalf of Muscat. MR. LAITHWAITE said that not object so long as there w the boundary. He could not the Trucial Sheikhs had power Ibn baud. Muscat was in rat and he would be prepared to s the India Office would es a formula defining £ gree 9 however* that to negotiate with ier a different position ie them a party to the negotiations. It might be possible to agree to certain co-ordinates and to Vi ork out a definition of the boundary on a map. MR. SEAL was not sure wny we were proceeding with these negotiations. When the boundary question had been considered originally it had been part of a general settlement with a view to getting a quid pro quo . We now seemed to be giving more- territory away and to be getting nothing in return.-9- THE CxIAIKi;IAiSr ex PGained in reply that when this Question had originally arisen it had done so in an acute form (in connectron with the American oil concession in Hasa) and it had been clear that an early settlement was necessary. We had 'been prepared to take our stand on the so-called blue and violet lines, and it had looked as though we might he making an important concession to Ibn Saud and getting nothing in return, with consequent loss of prestige. The sugges tion that the matter should he dealt with as part of a g^nercil comprehensive settlement had been intended to make it easier for us to make this concession, as we should then he obtaining advantages elsewhere which' could he set off against it, it was now clear that ibn Saud was not likely to regard our concessions to him in this area as at all generous. In fact we should have great difficulty in getting him to accept them. The question of a quid pro qu o in return for these concessions had therefore'lost its reality and there was no reason why this frontier question should not he dealt with independently and on its merits, since we should certainly not he regarded as having been over generous to Ihn Saud in any concessions that w^e might make. But the question was still one of great urgency. We now knew that our legal position was wreak and unless some settlement were reached there might he great difficulty with foreign oil concessionnaires, etc., in Ihn saud’s dominions. Moreover, if no limits w/ere agreed upon as hounding Ihn Baud's authority, he w/ould certainly continue to extend that authority and, might well establish claims w/hich it would he much more difficult for us to resist later on. it seemed clear therefore that the best v/ay of setting a limit to Ihn Baud’s expansion tow/ards the Trucial Coast and generally in eastern Arabia was to agree as soon as possible , 1 on some definite boundary line.A After line 3, ada; * PP” 1 ®* GosfiKxuier pirie as to ho* we could justify refusing to make any concession to ibn S-ua to the ^.&amp;.st Oa aerialan 53 , ha said that the short answer to 'Uiig was tiuit «a fur ae could ha Judged from the explorations of Mr. Bertram ihoiwts, Ibn saud'a writ aid not run to the saet of the green line, and that lb fl ' uscat couia 1D theory put up as good &amp; claim as g&amp;udi f /a * al&gt;1&amp; ^ J«ri«licUon in that area.

LAITEWAITE said that the Secretary of State for India would certainly not agree to any concession further east than that'already suggested, i.e. meridian 53 . /A THE CHAIRMAN, in reply to a further question, explained that the position as regards the authority of the Crucial Sheikhs in the hinterland was uncertain. Ihn Saud had extended his influence very considerably and had within the last few years greatly strengthened his claims by establish ing colonies of Akhwan in areas 'diere his rights had not previously existed but were not now contested. It was not possible to disregard the claims he had thus established, but if a boundary were now agreed upon we should know how we stood and be in a stronger position for contesting any claims he had tried to establish beyond that boundary. MR. SEAL did not agree. He was of opinion that we could take effective action against any of Ibn Baud’s tribes men who penetrated into our territory; also that as Ibn Saud was not a member of the League of Nations he coulci not force us to recognise his position. THE CHAIRMAN explained that Ibn Saud might well have a strong case against us if the boundaries were not defined, and that it would be necessary in such an event for us to be able to produce some answer. Ibn Sand's advisers w ere quite clever enough to realise that if they could produce an unanswerable case it would, be worth Ibn Saud. s while to demand arbitration. In any case Ministers had already decided in favour of trying to reach an agreement with Ibn Saud about these south-eastern frontiers, and it would be unfortunate if this major question oi principle had no i to be reopened, unless it were clear that no agreement with ibn Saud could be reached. He suggested that the meeting should proceed on the basis that an agreement about the frontiers wss desirable and should be aimed at.MAJOR OSBQPjJE asked why it was not possible to grant lion Sand territory up to meridian 56. The War Office had always been of opinion that in our settlement with Ibn Saud we should be as generous as possible. We could hardly exnect Ibn Saud to renounce any claims in the north where there was a possibility of discovering oil. He enquired whether the north and south lines could not run along meridian 56 E. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Foreign Office entirely agreed with the War Office that we ought to be as generous as possible to Ibn Saud over these frontiers, and, in view of the fact that it was necessary for us to take up an attitude of firm opposition towarc's his claims in the north, he felt that it would be good policy to be as generous as we could in the extreme east. The northern and southern limits of the proposed concessions were now agreed upon and could not be extended, but, speaking personally, he would like to see the concessions between those limios carried as far 00 the east as possible. On the other hand he did not see how Ibn Saud could reasonably put forward any kind of claim as far east as meridian 56, and there would be consideratile dangers in giving him in full sovereignty stretches of terri tory over which he exercised no effective control. Mr. Thomas, travelling along meridian 51, had indeed hardly come within Ibn Saud f s authority. But, speaking personally, he would have liked to see the limit carried at least as far east as meridian 54. In view of the India Office attitude, however, he did not wish at present to press for any concession further east than meridian 55. WING COMMANDER FIEIE asked how we were prepared to meet 11,11 Baud's arguments that this territory did not oelong to Muscat. 11 - 1 IV -i iiiij CiiAIRf.tAN though l it would, 'bo posoihlo to inforni I 'bn Sand that we considered meridian 53 to he a reasonable line. It was of course an entirely artificial line 9 since no-one exercised any effective control in this area. But it represented a reasonable division between the areas over which Ibn Baud might extend his authority and those which would naturally fall within the authority of Muscat. Neither this line nor any of the others would of course be frontiers in the European sense ? but they would represent ultimate limits beyond which no claims would be recognised. It was clearly necessary to have some such limits somewhere 9 particularly now that mineral concessions 9 etc . 9 were being granted. MR. BRIDGES said that as the green line appeared, to be the effective limit of Ibn Saud’s sovereignty it was much harder to justify demarcation of the boundary along meriddan 53 or 54 E. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the meeting should agree to the issue of revised, instructions to Sir A. Ryan. These could be to the effect that His Majesty’s Government had now decided to abandon the whole idea of the desert zone and the system of servitudes 9 and to offer the so-called, brown line concession (i.e. up to meridian 52) as the next step. The northern and southern limits of this would have to be defined. Sir A. Ryan could be authorised then to offer Ibn Saud . 9 in case of necessity,, a further concession up to meridian 53 9 but he could make it clear that His Majesty’s Government would not recognise Ibn Sand's claims further east than this. MR. LAITHWA.ITE said, that the India Office were only ore oared to agree to instructions which did. not concemrlace any negotia tion of the boundaries east of meridian 53 9 which they considered should be the limit of Ibn Saud. s sovereignty. .'-he situation might change very considerably in a few years’ time, in the event of Ibn Sand’s death. mm -12--13- -,,1^ CiiAiiiMAjI, referring to the question of the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and 0rnan ’ SaiGl that it would be very useful if, within the next iew weeks, information could be obtained from the Aden Protectorate indicating how far east this boundary could be LcUs_en * 1x1 a recent tele gram from Aden it had been stated that the boundary ran north-eastwards from the sea at Pas Dharbat A.ii. -his migho mean 'chat the whole of the southern boundary of the proposed concession to Saudi-Arabia would be co terminous with the Aden Protectorate, which would be satisfactorv. After further discussion it was agreed that the northern limic 01 the brown line should be a line running from the green line, five miles south of Banaiyan due east to meridian 52 E. ior the first stage, and for the second stage, a continuation of this line running to meridian 53 E; the southern limits of the brown line to be from the intersection of parallel 18 and the violet line to the intersection of parallel 19 and meridian 52 for the first stage; this line to be prolonged to meridian 53 for the second stage. CONCLUSION. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed:- That the foreign Office should draft new instructions to Sir Andrew Ryan, which should be concurred in by the Admiralty, War Office, Air Ministry, India Office and Colonial Office before despatch, and should include the following points (a) that the proposal for a special desert zone and system of servitudes should be abandoned; (b) that the next stage should be to offer Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a concession up to the brown line, i.e. the area bounded on the west by the green line, the north by a line from the green line five miles south of Banaiyan due east to meridian 52, thence due south to parallel 19, thence to the intersection of parallel 18 with the violet line;c (c) if agreement with Ihn Saud on this area could not he reached ? then this concession should he extended to the easterly limits of meridian 53 E; (d) these instructions should include the question of the method of describing the frontier, i.e., the frontier between Saudi-Arabia, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, Muscat and the Aden Protectorate (e) that Sir A. Ryan should be informed that an effort will be made if necessary to persuade the Sultan of Muscat to authorise Sir A. Ryan to represent him in any negotiations with Ibn Saud. 2, Whitehall Gardens, S.W.l. 15th April, 1935. -14-* CWP/DIAa D E C Y P H £ B OP T E L S Q. .R.UL* Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India, Bahrein, 15th April, 1935, 15th April, 1935, 3*»50 p»m» XXX Jft 1 M- '''ft T.II5 .

Previous Papers 1140 1000 8.32political Department Minute Paper, 2956 6000 7 34 could/ There are two new developments in connection with the Blue Line discussions with Ton Saud: (a) the Foreign OTfice propose a modification in the instructions to the Minister; ^&lt;i^JL&lt;r^{&gt;z zsir/j/- (h) we have received a list of the Saudi desiderata.— 2h As regards the first of these points, the position is that the Minister was instructed last January to press for an indication of Saudi desiderata and in his negotiations to aim first at a settlement on the Basis of the cession in full sovereignty of a small strip of territory immediately to the Fast of the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention^ Bounded on the East By the green line on the map attached. 3. Failing this, as a second stage he was to suggest, In addition to the cession of the green line area the estaB1ishment of a desert zoneroughly within the area indicated on the map attached, within which Both H.M.G. on Behalf of their AraB proteges and IBn Saud would agree not to exercise any rights which they might have and Beyond which IBn Saud would formally aBandon any claims. 4. If this also failed, the Ministehwas to offer to cede in full sovereignty the area shown By a Brown line on the map attached. 5. Further information from Aden has shown that any desert zone would have to Be very suBstantially smaller than was at first tnought possible and the maximum limits within which one2 ' could be constituted are shown by the yellow line on the map. The Minister continues very pessimistic as to the prospects of any compromise with Ibn Saua save on the basis of a fairly substantial territorial concession. The Foreign Office in these circumstances now suggest that we should abandon the desert zone solution altogether said that if we cannot satisfy one Saudis by giving them (a) the green line; or (ft) tfte ftrown line shown on the map, we should extend the eastern limit of the ftrown line to 53 (this fteing the eastern limit originally I suggested for it fty the India Office in our letter of 12th January last on P.Z.245/35). They have ashed that the question should he discussed in the Middle East Committee on Monday afternoon with a view to early instructions to the Minister. 6. On the whole, I think that the case for this modification is a good one* It means that there will no longer he any question of a buffer area between us and our proteges and Ibn saud and that we shall in effect be laying down in the desert a fixed frontier shown on a map mstead of reaching a solution on the basis of allocation of tribes, etc* But we have already decided that a solution on a basis of allocation of tribes would be much too dangerous from | our point of view. The latest Indications are that th^ Saudis themselves are prepared to accept a frontier based on coordinates. I suggest that I might be authorised generally to accept the Foreign Office view Saudi Desiderata. ^ ^hdrew Ry an * s telegrain No *84 of 6th April attached gives the Saudi desiderata. These are shown by a red line on tiie map attached. As a basis for bargaining/3 Minute Paper Department bargaining they are perhaps not entirely unsatisiactoiy though they are very extensive indeed and go much farther than we could possibly accept, particularly in the south. (a) The southern frontier proposed for Qatar, so far as it can be identified, runs rather north of the line claimed by the Sheikh and gives the Sauuis trie Jebel Naksh, which is a hill to the South of the Jebel Dukhan on the west flank of Qatar and in an area of potential oil interest; (b) The Saudis claim the Khor al Odeid, apparently part of Aqal, and the Wells of B&amp;naiyan; and seemingly propose a frontier line which runs far nearer to the coast in the Sabakhat ivhtti and the west of the Qufat Liwa than is acceptable to us; (c) In the interior desert the Saudi claim goes to P?traH~el 56, whereas we did not wish to go beyond Parahful in any cession of sovereignty, though we would have been prepared to go to Paralloh rr on the basis of a desert zone; (d) In the South, extensive but vague claims are made in the Hadramaut and in areas which may be the property of the sultan of Muscat* 9. I think that we must stand fast about point (a). The sheikh himself claims the Jebel Naksh and even if we lose Salwa we ought to insist on the boundary line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa; (b) We cannot either^ive the Saudis the access to the sea which they claim at the Khor al Odeid or relinquish the Khor al Gdeid and AQal to 8 The important points of difference are: theni/ 2956 6000 7 344 them. We have repeatedly formally recognised ooJa as the property of Abu Dhabi in the last 60 years and the sheikh still maintains a claim to both. We are on strong grouna historically in dealing with the Saudis on this point. Equally we should insist on holding on to the Wells of Banaiyan, w hich are an important key point in this area^ subject to this, the line on the North is not so bacf^ndit is satisfactory that in the eastern portion thei , e~~i-s no suggestion of a Saudi claim to Baraimi or to any of the minor Trncial She ikiihoms in the Mus^and im peninsula. * Oc hd’ JO *-1 hi*%. / /3i—^ ^ -SnUy.

(i) On this the Saudis themselves admit that they have opened their mouths rather wide and we are in a strong position (our information being probably much better than theirs) to contest their claims. 10 « I might be authorised to take the above line in any discussions and to suggest that the Mnister should continue to play a close game with the Saudis. The Foreign Office suggestion that we should make our full concessions in an open-handed manner and at once aoes not, I suggest, really represent the right tactics in this area. We are making very suostantial concessions to ibn saud by giving him a line bounded on the East even by Parallel 53; we should be formally recognising his sovereignty over an area In which, so far as we know, he exercises little, If any, real control. Ana it frit ^ A-J A vMinute Paper Department l. Aj- j- will not be overlooked that any concession given now and embodied in a formal treaty will stand against us until it is modified by agreement. On the other hand, it is, of course, well worth while making some concession in order to get a formal settlement of this vexed and difficult questionT' But the arguments in favour of limiting that concession to the brown line area as shown on the map, extended eastward to Parallel 53, still seem very strong indeed. 11* I suggest on the whole that conclusions on the point dealt with in paragraphs 5-6 above can be taken without prior consultation with either the Government of India or the Resident. All that, in effect, we are proposing to ao is to revert to the eastern limit for the cession of sovereignty in the Central Desert which was recommended by this Office, after consideration of the views of the Government of India ana the Resident, last January. The line then suggested by us was, it is true, much more generous than either India or Bushire thought desirable, but they have made no protest and I think we may take it that they would be prepared to accept, even if somewhat reluctantly, a reversion in the circumstances discussed in the Foreign office letter to the line in question. Copies of the Foreign Office letter are being sent to India and Bushire by Saturday's air mail. The telegraphic corresponuence has already been repeated to them.

But if this fails, as it well may, to attract Ibn Saud, we should be on our guard against the F.O. proposing still farther concessions. ‘Though the balance of advantage is in favour of a settlement with him on this question, it must always be remembered that the Saudi regime may very likely collanse on his death, but that any commitments which we may now enter into will survive, and that if Saudi Arabia presently falls into chaos, a fluid situation in regard to frontiers might be found to suit us better th^n a rifdd one. It would not, therefore, be worth our while to give up any of our essential requirements mere -^v 1 g/ r IMinute Paper. Department. -in. the sake of a settlement, though, if a settlement can be reached without any such sacrifice, it will be desirable to have one, both for the sake of friendship with Ibn Baud and for the sake of eliminating any nebulous claims he may entertain in the direction of the Trucial Coast. If at a later stage it is found desirable to bring the Sultan of Muscat into the negotiations, it may be found necessary, in view of his international status, to make him a signatory of the treaty instead of signing on his behalf. /1 A'C'Uir fi faJz/' 7y ^ k ^ aAh/k**/ ‘ /I, U 7r i u 2956 6000 7/34(E 2237/77/91) | Important . 1.935 COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL pz p^c.2 COPY SENT 8Y AIR MAIL My dear Gillperttipf fc» I am writing with reference to the correspondence, ending with Jedda telegram No«_ 77 of the 2nd April (a copy of which was enclosed in our official letter No. E 2165/77/91 of the 5th April), regarding the problem of the boundaries of eastern and south-eastern Arabia. The latest telegram from Aden to the Colonial Office (No. 19 of the 29th March) and the note of anxiety sounded by Ryan in the first paragraph of his telegram under reference, have led me to examine once more the 3^ instructions which we sent to Jedda in our telegram No.8 of the 17th January. I now write to put before you as clearly as I can the ideas which I outlined to you at our talk here on the 6th April. 2. It may be convenient if I recapitulate the substance of those instructions. It was briefly as follows: Stage One : to get a clear statement of Ibn Saud f s claims; Stage Two : to offer Ibn Saud in full — , j sovereignty/ G. Laithwaite, Esq., C.I.E.(0 f ^ r-o ^ 4- ( c sovereignty, a narrow strip of territory running north and. south immediately east of the Blue Line up to what we are now calling the green line; Stage Three : to offer Ihn Saud the creation of a desert zone, well removed from the coast and following roughly the edge of the sands of the great Ruh’al Khali desert. Into the detailed constitution of this zone, which was to he somewhat complicated, I need not enter here hut for convenience we are marking it on our maps, in its latest form, as hounded hy a yellow line; Stage Four : H in the 'last resort, and in order to secure their desiderata 'in other directions', His Majesty’s Government were prepared to concede a part of this desert zone adjoining the area ceded under Stage Two. The limits of this zone have not yet heen officially communicated to Ryan, hut we have since reached agreement that it should extend at least as far east as Meridem 52°. We have shown this possible concession in our maps with a hrown line. We had also agreed that it should he subject to servitudes as regards the granting of concessions.3 • We were of course quite aware that there was little chance that Ihn Saud would he content with the concession under Stage Two (i.e. up to the green line). The principal feature therefore of our proposed settlement with him would consequently have been the 'desert zone'. This, too, we realised at the time was unlikely to make an immediate appeal to him. But seeing the nature of the territory in question - its apparently vast area, our imperfect knowledge of its natural limits and the uncertain allegiance of the tribes which wander in its interior - this scheme for a desert zone did appear to offer the most satisfactory solution of the problem. 4. Since, however, I first put the idea forward in my letter to you of the 7th November last things have changed a good deal. In the first place, although we shall not now be bartering our concessions in this area for desiderata elsewhere, we have, I think, become reconciled to the idea that we shall in practice certainly have to make the 'last resort' concession under Stage Pour/55. 5./ Pour (i.e. the brown line). The desert zone would thus in fact lie only to the east of Meridian 52°, In the second place, the information contained in Aden despatch No. 42 of the 12th February to the Colonial Office has led us further to reduce the area of the desert zone (and hence of the brown line area in so far as its southern limit is concerned) by shifting its southern boundary considerably to the north of the edge of the sands (see Foreign Office telegram to Jedda No. 55 of the 22nd March). In the third place, Reilly’s telegram No. 19 of the 29th March, with whose recommendations I fully agree in the light of our present knowledge, and which is supported by the Colonial Office and concurred in by Ryan and the Government of India, will mean a still further substantial reduction in the area of any eventual desert zone and of the concession under Stage Four. The area dealt with in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our telegram No. 8 of the 16th January to Jedda has in fact dwindled from the whole vast expanse of the Rub’al Khali to something like a quarter of it, and the desert zone itself would now be no more than a small trapezoid enclosure between Merid&amp;ns 52 and5 I propose to leave aside for the moment the desert zone and consider now the concession under Stage Pour (i.e. the ’’brown line” concession)* This, under Ryan’s present instructions, is only to be offered to Ibn Saud after the proposal of the desert zone has failed to give satisfaction. Reilly’s latest telegram has however detached from it an area (i.e. the area to the south of a line running from approximately 48° 30’ East and 18° North to 52° East and 19° North) which, so far as one can ^udge, is even larger in proportion than that which has been detached by the same stroke from the desert zone. * Ryan, as you will have seen from his telegram No. 77, is evidently worried lest we whittle away too much of the concessions which we were prepared to offer, and I must say that I am very much inclined to share his misgivings. In the circumstances I think that some alteration of tactics has become necessary, and I would suggest that, as a first step in that direction, we; should now make Stage Pour into Stage Three, that is, that the ’’brown line” concession at Stage Pour should precede . instead of following, the proposal of a desert zone.If we were oo do fiiis — and flie alteration of substance is really nothing at all — I believe we should go some way towards avoiding that appearance of niggardliness which I am convinced would render any settlement a great deal harder to achieve, 6. I gather you think such an alteration of tactics would probably be acceptable to the India Office, and that you would moreover be prepared to consider increasing the area in question by extending it eastwards, for * example, as far as Meridian 55°. I am sure that this would make it much easier to reach a settlement and that we should not lose anything material by making this small additional concession. This would mean that the 'brown line' concession, which would now become Stage Three, would go from just south-west of Banaiyan on the 'green line', following the direction of a line running straight towards the intersection of;20° North and 55° East, up to Meridian 53; thence due south to the new southern limit of the desert zone (i.e, a straight line beginning from the intersection of 20° North and 55° East) to the intersection of the 'violet line' and parallel/M parallel 180. 7* If these two suggestions were adopted, we should, I think, no longer have enough incentive for clinging to the establishment of a desert zone in the remaining fragment of the Ruh'al Khali. As Inlaid above, and as I think you will not deny, the proposal was a complicated one such as would at hest have heen strange and perhaps incomprehensible to Ibn Saud but which would have been justified had the area been large and important. Now, in view of the shrinkage which the desert zone has undergone, it seems to me altogether disproportionate to the purpose in view. The idea was mine originally, but if some five-sixths of its raison d'etre were to vanish (as they will have done if the suggestions which I have made in the preceding paragraph are accepted) I should myself be only too willing to drop it for good. In that event, we should, I think, press Ibn Saud simply to renounce all claims whatever outside the new frontier, and inform him that we should not regard him as entitled to send patrols or Zakat collectors to any place beyond it. Such a policy would have the additional advantage of/„ -of leaving the difficult question of an eventual Saudi-Muscati frontier in abeyance. 8. In general my own view is that we shall do well in negotiating with Ibn Saud to he as generous both in substance and in manner as we can. I believe myself that if we can convince him that we are genuinely doing our best to reach a settlement which will give him as much satisfaction as possible, we are far less likely to find him obstinate and uncompromising over the secondary problems which will have to be settled one way or another before this general frontier problem can be got out of the way, than if we only yield reluctantly inch by inch. Incidentally, since the idea of a general settlement has been abandoned, we now have no direct reason to make our concessions piecemeal, since we shall no longer be bartering them bit by bit for advantages in other spheres or other areas. To fight a stubborn rearguard action knov/ing in advance the limits to which we are really quite ready to retreat would, it seems to me, give Ibn Saud grounds for claiming that each step of our retreat had/had been forced upon us against our will, and our ultimate concessions to him will he much more of a victory for him than if we had given them rather more lightly. His claim to have defeated us might he untrue hut it could he made to appear very plausible and very damaging to our prestige in the Gulf. Prom this point of view therefore I feel that it may well he to our interest in the long run to make our concessions generously and without more haggling than is absolutely necessary. But this is a question of tactics which need not he discussed at length in this letter. 9. As you know, Ryan expects at any time now to receive a statement of Ihn Saud’s claims. I would suggest therefore that as soon as you have had time to consider the proposals contained in this letter the matter should again he discussed by the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee. 10. I am sending a copy of this letter to Webb of the Middle East (Official) Sub-Committee who will no doubtr This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be '. returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.j From SAUDI ARABIA, f Decinoher.

Dimran and Beni Hajir tribes and certain sections of Manasii, uo tne exclusion of all other tribes. Memorandum expressly defines proposed frontier as being between Saudi Arabia and Qa-ar, Trucial Sheikhdoms, Sultanate of Muscat, ilacihramaat, and other Sheikhdoms etc. in east-southeast and south Arabia. Following is summary, omitting less important place names. Boundary with Qatar starts from coast of Dohat es Salwa, between Jebel Naksh and Jebel Dukhan, leaving former to Saudi Arabia and latter to Qatar. Proceeds south and south-east along line of eastern Qalail to Ariq Mashash Ibn Shafi, and thence to Aqal as far as coast, where the Naqiyan are left to Qatar and Khor A1 Odeid is claimed for Saudi Arabia. Line re-starts from point on coast h5 milomeures from hho± and follows line of Majann, Sabakhat Matti and Ruiat Liwa to intersection of meridian 56 and parallel 22, leaving last named area to Sheikhdoms. Continues along meridian 56 to parallel 19, thence in a straight line to intersection of meridian 52 and parallel 17, thence along parallel 17 to its intersection with violet line. Fuad5uaa anticipated objection to claim to Khor A1 Odeid by saving it nas necessary lor control of smuggling by Murra. when we discussed the subject further on April 5th he insisted that an honest effort had been made to include only tribes named above, and said that if experts discovered flaws they could be ie^ti±ieu. ? as nadhramaut tribes may extend further north than Saudi Government had supposed, I offered line suggested in your telegram No. 8 as modified by paragraph 2 of your telegram No. 45.

In which ease a situation sight arise in respect of that territory similar to that which has arisen in regard to t.atar. 3* The- future has to be envisaged at present with reference to the three alternatives which would result frosa an agreement with Ihn Baud on one or other of the bases contemplated in your telegram No.8 of J anuary 17th, as elucidated in further correspondence* These are as followss~ (a) A boundary running from the head of Dohat aa-' : alwa past Sfikak, leaving that place in ? audi territory then striking south past Benaiyan, leaving that place outside Saudi territory# to r'-^rnllel SO degree® north and thence converging diagonally towards t- • iolet Line. n (b) The interposition of a desert jseme bounded on the west as described in Mr. Rends! * s letter to Hr.

E 934/318/25 of February £lst. (c) A boundary as suggested# subject to a reservation regarding further instructions# which X have not yet received, in paragraph 10 of your telegram To.8 of January 17th. 4. X considered last year that it would be best to make .'au&amp;i Arabia# whatever its boundaries# conterminous with a tar and the T racial Iheykhdoa® and that for this /purpose'll purpose it might be necessary to admit Xbn saud^ sovereignty much further east and south-east than the blue and violet lines. This is still my fundamental opinion, though I modified it last Kovembei* in two way®. x recognised that an attempt might be made to secure the solution at (b) above. I recognised also that, if Xbn baud’s territorial sovereignty ere admitted far to the east and south—of the blue and violet lines, an attempt should be made to impose servitudes in respect of economic concessions and .perhaps flying in the territory which would be assured to him beyond the blue and violet lines. 5. His Majesty *s Government now admit what I may call the principle of eonterminousness to &lt;i limited extent. They admit it in regard to Qatar and Saudi Arabia, w at any rate from the head of the f -ohat as-S&amp;lwa as far as Gakuk. * I understand that they would admit it in alternative (b) above, in the sense that they would regard the boundaries of the desert *sone as being also the boundaries of the various rulers. It seems to me that if it were fully admitted in alternative (a) -md admitted also in alternative (c) the position would be healthier from the point of view of the Air Ministry than if there war© any intervening res nulljus . It might be doubtful whether particular territory belonged to Qatar or Abu Dhabi but this presumably need not prevent His Majesty 1 a Government from having an intelligence organisation and from employing aircraft in the area generally east of the 3alwa-Banaiyan line, that is to say an area which, except -.t dalwa itself, would extend wall beyond the proposed protection limit of v&amp;tor. 8. It must not be supposed that, beex. x- : ' * i i l \ ■ j; examined the above alternatives with some care, I think /anyany of them likely to appeal to Ibn Baud* The first wiM give him too little. The other two, even if they should attract him otherwise, are likely to be wrecked on the insistence of Mis Majesty*a Government on his formally renouncing all claims beyond any of the suggested boundaries and their reluctance to meet him over the question of Arab sentiment except to the extent indicated in the second sentence of paragraph 5 of your telegram ■'o.36_of Febiniary fSth. I do not deal with my own tentative suggest ion In paragraph 10 of iiy telegrfiMa Bo. 23 of jbbruary 9th as I have not yet had any expression of your views regarding it. ?. X now come to the right of pursuit. X agree that this right should be claimed in the ©vent of Ibn Gaud’s confessing hie Inability to control his tribes but I doubt whether that contingency will ever arise and X do not see that it need- be provided for by treaty. The letter from the Air Ministry of January 83rd, enclosed in your despatch under reference, seems to me, however, to go very much further. It represents your Department '-s having recognised that 4S in the event of an emergency arising, it would be necessary to allow aircraft to take action against raiders whilst in Saudi territory. w It would be impossible to claim a right so extensive and ao indefinite as against Ibn laud without admitting in his favour similar right. I can only say that he might in certain ei reumet a- nee a be much more likely to abuse it than His M dJesty’s Government and that His Majesty 9 e Government accepted a very different principle in Article 10 of the Hadda Agreement and Article 8 of the Bahru Agreement. I should very much prefer in the present /casecase to avoid* if possible, any attempt to define the position by treaty* 8. In the last paragraph of your despatch tinder reference you referred to the poualMHty of a ”bon voisinage*' agreement between His Majesty’s Government, on behalf of the Bheykh or Qatar, and the Baud! Government* 3o far as the object of this would be to secure the right of pursuit, X have already expressed ay view* For the rest, I think it would be far better to aim at a general agreement regarding the position between Xhn Baud and the whole of the coastal principalities, into which some '’bon voisinage“ clauses might be introduced, than to contemplate a separate agreement in regard to Saudi Arabia and Qatar* Hone of the rulers has a more intimate direct connexion with Xbn Baud than the Sheykh of star, who visited him in 1935 and ia believed to have corresponded with him since about boundaries. Ibn Saud would be all the sore likely for this reason to resist the suggestion that he could not treat in any my with the Sheykh* He might take either of two lines. He might say:- ff You yourselves have pressed me to treat informally with Kuwait and Bahrain in the first instance* by should I not have a preliminary chat in the same way with my old friend a tar and see whether you can consent to what m agree upon? *• Or he might say, n You insisted on my negotiating direct ith the Amir of Trans-Jordan and refused to be a party to our treaty, though you gave certain guarantees* -hy do you take so different ® line in the case of Tatar?” I could myself devise an answer to the first of these suggestions. I have no doubt that legal experts could devise an answer to the second, which would turn on the difference between a mandated /state* tmte Hnd ^ieimndent state in special relations with Hie ..a^esty f s Ooverment. I should, however, anticipate great difficulty in getting Ibn sand to see the force of the replies, if he made the suggestions and I feel strongly that it would be better not to give him the opportunity of making them* I have, etc*, Airtmuw St YAH.T B 12 b Communications on this subject •should be addressed to— The Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— .•? f*l« wmMnsumtr™** ■ ■&lt;- wn - . © V &gt; ' &lt;od Letter Reference to previous correspondence: the ChfmiiToffice of the ZS~^-OrnS^- from &lt;\f Transmitted by direction of the Secretary of State for the Colonies.

I W m British Legation, J edda. 26th February 1935, My dear G-eorge, Many thanks for your letters E 394/318/25 of January 24th and 31st about the distinction between personal and territorial sovereignty, with special reference to the suggested desert zone. I have read the letters and Beckett’s minute of January 23rd with great interest. I appreciate the force of the 'short answer' in paragraph 1 of his minute and very much hope that if the desert zone becomes practical politics we shall be able to eschew the word 'sovereignty' in connexion with our own position.. I am indeed greatly alarmed by the application of the word 'sovereignty' to our position in regard to the Trucial Sheykhs and Qatar. It appears to me to be mainly a matter of words, because it is obvious that, even for international purposes, King George's position in regard to those states cannot be precisely the same as his position in regard to the United Kingdom, either as regards his rights or his responsibilities. But 'sovereignty' is a very potent word and Ibn Saud is not a lawyer. Any assertion by us that we had 'sovereignty' over the Trucial Sheykhdoms and Qatar, would cause him to throw a thousand fits. And if he were a lawyer, might he not ask how we came to speak of his maintaining 'relations' with them and with Bahrain and Kuwait in Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda? 3./ Rendel Sso, C.M.G., foreign Office.7 ? &gt;&gt; o. I interrupt myself to comment on the third sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter of January 24th. I see some force in the analogy you draw betv/een the case of Asir and the other cases hut it appears to me that in the Saudi Idrisi Treaty of 1926 the Idrisi accepted a much more complete protectorate over Asir than the control we have established over the Persian Gulf rulers. I purposely use the word ’’control” because we have refused to call it a ’’protectorate” and have insisted that the states of these rulers are ’’independent”. I was not aware that we had been increasingly inclined to assert ’’sovereignty” over Kuwait and Bahrain for international purp-oses. I fl should have said that the indications were rather to the \ contrary during the last five years. I need not, however, overload this ietter with a discussion of so elusive a question.. 4. To Return to the desert zone. His Majesty’s Government have not yet, I think, decided what are the present limits of the effective rule of the Sheykhs but I take it that they would not in any case be held to extend beyond the proposed ring-fence of the zone on its easterly side. If so, the position would appear to be that, on the res nullius doctrine, Ibn Baud may possibly have acquired sovereign rights in parts of the potential desert zone but that His Majesty’s Government cannot have done so (a) because they have never themselves performed any act of acquisition there and (b) because their clients exercise no such rights there as might be held to have become our rights for international purposes. 5. Looking at it from a political point of view. I agree generally with paragraph 4 of your letter of January 31st. Unless there should be such economic developments as to make it worth somebody’s while to pacify/pacify the area at all costs, I cannot think that the theoretical difficulties are at all likely to arise in practice in so remote an area in the course of the next twenty years, the longest period for which we have thought of making an agreement. It may he useful to recall that at one phase of the dispute regarding hajran, Ibn Saud himself seemed willing to leave the political status of that region indeterminate. 6. My main preoccupations are at present, however, (a) the insistence of His Majesty's Government on Ibn Saud's categorically renouncing all rights beyond an agreed frontier or a ring-fence as the case may be; (b) my own difficulty in answering the question 'In whose favour?' and (c) my belief that some account must be taken of the Arab brethren factor, if we are to get any agreed settlement. It was with these preoccupations in mind that I threw out the very tentative suggestion in paragraph 10 of my telegram ho.23 of February 9th. It will be difficult to get Ibn Saud to renounce the rights, which he claims to possess up to the effective boundaries of the coastal rulers; and, in my opinion, quite impossible, if the answer to the question at (b) is, 'In favour of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom'. 7. Meanwhile I have your telegram ho.33 of February 22nd to work on. I may say that I am all in favour of now easing the pace in regard to this question and trying to get the Kuwait blockade out of the way; but without formally connecting them, for the reason given in paragraph 1 of my telegram ho.38 of February 21st. The instructions are all I need for the immediate future, except as regards one point, namely that raised in paragraph 2 of my despatch ho.28 of January 29th. I do not know that it matters much, as I fear that, even with the chance of oil mentioned in your letter E 541/77/91 of February 6th received yesterday, Ibn Saud/Saud will not be content with the moderate accession of territory contemplated in Stage 2 of the programme. All the same, I feel that in discussing a possible frontier on that basis, it would be better not to refer to uncertain geographical features. What, by the way, is the special importance of Banaiyan? o. I need not anticipate the later stages in detail, I find myself thinking more and more that, unless we can obtain a solution on the desert zone basis, yours or mine, we shall be driven either to stalemate or to the position, which I considered inevitable last July, of having to recognise that Saudi Arabia is co-terminous with the Sheykhdoms along the best line of hinterland frontiers that we can claim for them.

After many enquiries and with some delays we engaged camels to take us to Ba Rutaeldan, the seat of Tannaf, chief of one of the four divisions of the Sei’ar. The contract was that we should arrive there in days,that the caravan would stop there four days to enable us to reach ^iwa and the edge of the desert and that we should then return by another route* After four nights on the road we found we had still another full day and a half march ahead of us to get to Ba Rumeidan. We had been joined on the way by Tannaf f s son and his son-in-law so I did not think I was justified in spending the extra time on the way as we were told that Eiwa was now three days away, the borders of the desert four days, and real desert six days. We travelled up the Wadi Sar and having visited the reputed tomb of the patriarch Salih in the Wadi &lt;honab proceeded past the Bents* final camp in this direction, identified by a large stone with a Himyaritic inscription and shortly after turned into the Wadi Sodaf which ire followed to its source op on an extensive plateau. It has beenI have many name® of Place© belong ing to these tribes, but It is not worth while reciting them in this note. been supposed that the Hadhramaut tributary wadis run out into the sand* but this is not so. There is another watershed In between and after a distance of perhaps twenty mixes across this plateau, similar to* but more desolate than, the plateau between the coast and the Hadhramaut, a further scries of wadis run down into the desert. fe camped on this plateau at a height of about 3500 feet above sea level at a spot named Qa'a Fudhul. From this place the two chiefs pointed out to m the directions in which their settlements and borders lay. I am preparing a report as full as all the details obtained from this source and others permit and a map to illustrate it, but in the meantime it will perhaps suffice to say that on the west the Sel’ar are bounded by the / tribes of Dahara, f Abide, MaradI*, Hamam, Bal Obeid and Kurab, while running round from east to northeast and north their neighbours are the tribes of Kathirl ms Suflan, Harlzi (a small tribe), Mahra, Zabeni, Rashldi, Murra and Yam. Hext day we marched a little to the north and then east crossing the boiindary between Sei’ar and Kathlri as we went. v@ camped that night in Kathlri territory at Sih Biyeidat al Kaihir and next day commenced the descent of the Wadi qubhudh which is the terrain of the Harisi. From the town of oubhudh we went straight along the main wadi to Tarim. From enquiries made in Shibam and Tarim I came to the conclusion that the following* tribes inhabiting the steppe lands to the north of the main wadi should geogra. hically and economically speaking oe considered British. The Safer . The sei^r have their principal settlements in the wadis and on the steppes to the north of the mainmain wadi* Of the wadis we saw or journeyed through the following depending on the main wadi 'belong to them: 3&amp;r» Latak, and Oodaf. They have settlements such as Qa*a el Fudhil, Bhurul al Ha tar, Ba Iteeidan (which is really only Tannaf f 8 family home) and Qa'a on the steppe and the wadi liwa (with a wsterhole) which runs into the desert* They hunt and raid in the desert hut are not real desert dwellers and seem to know very little shout it* They depend economically on Shiblm which is the market where they purchase their foodstuffs and where they sell wood, charcoal and sif leaves for aiaklng mats which are their sole products* During the annual fair at Meshed, which though an autonomous town, is under eu'&amp;iti influence, they visit the place to sell their camels* The Harizi * A small tribe practically confined to the wadi Quhhudh, which as indicated above runs out into the plateau to the north* Apart from the town of Qubhudh and a few neighbouring hamlets they are troglodytes and live with their animals in caves in the walls of the wadi wandering up and down it in a precarious search for water and pasture* Some of them do a carrying trade and they are, as they have to be, friendly with their neighbours. The Rathlri * It is not necessary to say much here about this well known tribe. The Kathirl beduins, who acknowledge no sort of control by the KathXri sultan, extend up to the desert* The *Aw&amp;mir * This pwcrful tribe, some sections of which have villages in the main valley, belongs to the ; harm fir confederation and is therefore under, to a nominal extent, K a thirl influence. The wadi Makhiya running from the steppe to the sands belongs to them. They extend up t) the desert* The Manahll * This ia the tribe whose territory, so to speak.apeak, forms the corner of the Ka&amp;hranaut proper as oistinguished from the Mahra* They are a fairly rons tx l*-r &lt;3 &amp;u£i under Qu aiti influence* Those of them who live In the northern steppe© raid well into the desert* They occupy a large stretch of territory and m passed their southern houndary some days journey south of c 4 ahr Hud* Their chief settlement© are An Held, Fughma and as 30 m. Beyond the ianlhil eastward are the Mahras. Their northern sections living on the fringe of the desert are the Bin Bahai, Bin &amp;afcnut, the Bin Tuwfr, the Bin Asab «» ^ and the Bin’Am&amp;r Jid* fe left Tarim on December 6th and proceeded down the sain wadi to the sea passing the tomb of the prophet Hud (equated with, the patriarch aber). on the afternoon of the 11th m passed a spot near a junction with the Wadi Hadhuf which marked the end of that part of the main wadi occupied by the Manlhil, whose territory was now on the right bank, the Mahras being on the left. as the Mamthil are at feud with the feahras, our Mlnh&amp;li cam©! men now became Tamiml*. The next day (18th) we passed Mahri settlement© and at night took a siyara of the Bln Bahai section exchanging him for a Bin Zuwoidi sly era at Bussun on the Ibth* On the 17th we arrived near the sea at Dhubeiah* Here some suwei&amp;is loaded up to ©hoot u© and in view of their hostile attitude z did not think it practicable to go on to Qishn. After © night at Barfut we were allowed, on aufference, into Seihut and made arrangement© for a dhow to sail thence that day. I had however a long interview with the relation of the oultan who represented him thex^e in which I learnt he had no influence beyond his own front door.In the lest few years the uweidis have encroached right Into the town and terrorise the inhabitants. Sultan Baud had however travelled in the eastern part of the country and knew the way inland from Has Dharbat * ah. He told me that Jibal Jadib t in a north easterly direction from that point, narked the limit of Mahra territory and that the easternmost sections of the tribe were, from the sea to the desert, the following: Bin Ufrid, Bin f Ali Muqaddam, Bin Fansukh, Bln Vizab, Bin Khurahid, Bin Muqfik, Bin Suleimi, Bin Kiddah and Bin Jidahih. The Qu’aiti authorities told me that they had two classes of engagements with the tribes in and around their territory. ( (1) Engagements containing an undertaking to respond to the call of the Sultan In any matter and at any time. (2) Engagements of bon vole inage and friendship containing an undertaking to co-operat© in matters of mutual interest* The engagement with the H&amp;nahil la of the former class and those with the others of the latter. x ; , ^ (Sgd.} W«H» ingraraa 1st Political Officer.QQHrlDiJ In anj further communication on this subject, please quote N&lt; &gt;- anA &amp;Mvess—not to any person by'name,\m\, to — “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S»W. 1.

Paragraphs 1 and 2. His Majesty's Government agree to tactics proposed. 2. Paragraph 3. See my telegram No.33 (of 22nd February). 3. First necessity is to elicit some concrete- proposal from Ibn Baud which will indicate extent of his claims. Hafiz Wahba's remarks suggest that he may endeavour to press for a settlement entirely on a basis of allocation of tribes. His Majesty's Govern ment would not be able to agree to this - not least because they might find great difficulty in rebutting extensive claims based by Ibn Baud on payment of zakat at one time or other by individual tribes or sections of tribes. On the other hand, if detailed proposals for allocation of tribes are unde His Majesty's Government cannot of course refuse even to consider them. In that event you should intimate that you will refer them for instructions, but add that in view of migratory character of certain of the tribes you are aware that His Majesty's Government regard a settlement on a. territorial basis as the only one likely to be really satisfactory, although they would have no returned to the Foreign offlnfi if nnt i&gt;p.miirAd fnir- nffinfai-TrKfrl Cypher telegram to Sir A.Kyan (Jedda) 0 objection, 0(*TA&gt; 2 \ objection to a subsidiary agreement; if necessary, to pi 0 vide for the allocation of any doubtful tribal elements* 4. Paragraphs 6 and 7, I approve your language. I assume however, that you mentioned only Qatar and tne Trucial Sheikhdoms because they will be mainly affected by proposed frontier settlement, but your observations regarding their foreign relations apply of course equally to Koweit and Bahrain. 5. No encouragement can be given to Saudi government to hope that His Ms.jesty’s Government will allow direct participation of Arab rulers in frontier negotiations. If therefore question in paragraph 2 of your telegram No.25 (of 9th February) is pressed , reply should be that eventual frontier agreement will be between His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and Saudi Government, but that views of Arab rulers affected by it both have been and will continue to be taken into account by His Majesty's Government who are responsible for their foreign relations. This does not necessarily apply in the case of Muscat but I nope that question of a coterminous frontier with Muscat will not arise, at any rate for the present. 6.

I am afraid that the pressure of more urgent work has prevented my answering it sooner. So far as the exact legal status of the proposed Desert Zone is concerned, we feel here that the best course is still to leave this point well alone, so long as it is possible for us to do so. The alternative course suggested in the last sentence of paragraph 3 of your letter will certainly be borne in mind if it becomes necessary to deal with this question in detail, but the position seems to be that any claims by any of the parties concerned to any rights in the Ruba al Khali would be /utterly J.G.

As regards the independence of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf in international law, you now know all about our view on the strictly legal position. This being so, I don’t think anything will be gained by pursuing this point any further at the present stage, hut I know you will realize that yjg must, so to speak, reserve our rights on this point, even if we agree to leave it in the background. Incidentally, beckett has pointed out that the argument at the bottom of page 3 of your letter would apply, mutatis mutandis , to the Malay States or Zanzibar, which are also referred to as independent, but are recognised as part of the British Empire for international purposes. He goes on to suggest moreover that your arguments to a certain extent lack practical reality, since the Arab sheikh presumably understands or cares little of the exact /meaning! IV meaning of 'sovereignty' or 'suzerainty 1 ' in international law and probably only understands by 'independence' the power to govern his own people, which he has in any case, further he thinks that even an Arab sheikh must be presumed to have understood that in signing treaties with His Majesty's government giving His Majesty's Government control over his foreign relations in return for protection, he was signing something not devoid of importance.

March 14th to us enclosing a despatch and a telegram from the Resident at Aden about the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. I have also been looking at a sketch map which I understand it is proposed to complete in the near future and circulate to the various departments concerned showing the different proposals which have been made. It appears from Reilly’s despatch and telegram that there is a very strong case for fixing the northern limit of the Aden Protectorate^ to the east of the violet line (i*e* the hinterland frontier of the Hadramaut between the violet line and the inland terminal point of the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman)^no further south than parallel 18 north, at any rate in the neighbourhood of the violet line. Reilly also seems to me to make a strong case for including in the Protectorate a strip^at least 20 miles in width of the Great Desert on the Hadramaut side of any future i i J.G. Laithwaite, Esq., C. I.E. , frontier v India Office. &amp;&amp; 5*830 ST/^/Vvfrontier between the Protectorate and Saudi Arabia. 2* I see from the sketch map referred to above that the southern ’’edge of the sands” runs slightly (clearly more than 20 miles) to the south of parallel 18 north, and it therefore occurs to me, in the light of Reilly’s telegram and despatc^ that it might be better to fix parallel 18 definitely as the southern limit of any concession to be made to Ibn Saud in this area^rather^ than the edge of the sands, as we originally contemplated. I fully realise the objections of principle,on which I have often myself insisted, to boundary lines based solely on geographical co-ordinates. But in the present case where the natural features are either non-existent (as in the desert itself) or extremely uncertain, it seems to me that there may be a strong case for making an exception and basing ourselves on geographical co-ordinates after all. This would mean that the line would come inside the sands and not follow the edge of them, but this might have the great advantage of giving us a belt of sand on the inland side of territory which we may have to protect, which would act as a kind of neutral ground and possibly enable us in case of necessity-—3— necessity to establish advance frontier patrols or pursue fugitive raiders. 3. If we were to adopt these principles it would be necessary somewhat to modify the definitions which we have suggested to Andrew Ryan in paragraphs 9 and 10 of our telegram No. 8 of January 16th ^o provide that the new frontier should run due south along meridian 52 until its intersection with parallel 18 } and thence due west along parallel 18 until its intersection with the violet line. 4. If this principle were adopted in regard to this line it v/ould I think greatly simplify matters to adopt it also for the definition of the proposed desert zone, the eastern and southern boundary of which would then be as follows: Prom the intersection of meridian 55 east and parallel 22 north to the intersection of meridian 55 east and parallel 20 north, thence in a straight line to the intersection of meridian 52 east with parallel 18 north,and thence due west along parallel 18 to its intersection with the violet line as above. 5. If this were done I think it would be well to try to fix the northern terminal of the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and Oman (the southerly terminal of which is a t.....&gt;'( I I-4- at Has Dharbat All) also at the intersection of meridian 52 east and parallel 18 north. The frontier need not of course follow a straight line between these two points? but this can be discussed later. 6. Would you let me know as soon as possible what you think about this suggestion? If you think it worth pursuing I should like to take it up at once with the Colonial Office and Air Ministry in order that we may instruct Andrew Ryan as to the line he should take as a result of Reilly’s telegram No. 11 of March 13th to the Colonial Office enclosed in Colonial Office letter referred to above.

We are very unlikely, (as their draft points out), to get much farther on this basis, given both the migratory character of the tribes concerned and the possibility that Ibn Baud might put forward claims which we should have difficulty in disposing of on the strength of payment of zakat by individual tribes at one time or other. We ought therefore to do what we can to head the Saudis off it. 3.

We quite agree that if positive and detailed proposals for settlement on a tribal basis are put up by Ibn saud tteiigh we think that even in that case Ryan, while indicating that he would refer them home for examination | should intimate that in the view of H.M.G. a definite territorial settle ment would be much more satisfactory. We should on the whole like to redraft the paragraphs to run as follows:- *&amp;i First necessity is to elicit some concrete proposal from Ibn Saud which will indicate extent of his claims. Hafiz wahba f s remarks suggest that he may endeavour to concentrate on settlement on a tribal we cannot refuse to consider them, 1|We flketttt loe most reluctant tasis to agree to this irair-in anr way- I he-avoided* - not least because ®ey might find great difficulty in rehutting extensive claims based by Ibn saud on payment of zaicat at one time or other by Individual tribes.

There can, I think, be little question that the answer must be in the affirmative. It would have been preferable from our point of view that all outstanding points shoula have been settled simultaneously, since in that event we shoula have been able to offset our concessions to Ion Saud over the Blue Line against the concessions we wish to secure from him in respect of the Koweit Blockade. But since it seems clear that there is no hope of such a settlement and since it would suit us well to reach an agreement about the Blue Line on the basis of any of the three alternatives which have been approved by H.M.G. and which are set out in Foreign Office telegram No.8 on P.Z.380/35, we may, I submit, concur in the proposal to inform sir A. Fyan that we are prepared to make the concessions in question, even though all idea of a simultaneous general settlement has now been abandoned. The effect will be that the Minister will concentrate in the first instance, if possible, on the Koweit Blockade, proceeding thence to Bahrein Transit Dues (which he has Sir Andrew By an asked in paragraph 8 of his now/now invited the Saudis to discuss at Baiarein at the end of February or the beginning of March) and then to the Blue Line, each question being dealt with on its merits.. February on P.z.1019/35, sir A. Hyan is rather disposed to go to our maximum concession over the Blue Line without delay. I have suggested to the Foreign Office that we might impress on him the desirability of going rather more slowly. He may well be right in thinking that neither the first nor the second of the three stages in which H.M.G. desire the Blue Lina question dealt with will really satisfy the Saudis. But as a matter of tactics it seems desirable not to give way too easily. Apart from this, the area round the head of the Bohat-as-Salwa, the cession of which is to he offered as part of the first stage, has now assumed a greater importance from the oil standpoint. There is reason to believe that the Saudis are fully aware of this and it is an additional argument for availing any suggestion that we do not regard the concession which its formal abandonment will represent as of real importance. 4.

It is ? I supposej possible that Ton Saud may be allowing Fuad his head in order to see how much he can extract from His Majesty’s Government but that if His Majesty’s Government react violently Ibn Saud will tighten rein. In any case it must be made clear to Saudi Government once for all that His Majesty’s Government will not abandon their established policy in the Persian Gulf in order that Ibn Saud may play with greater effect to the pan-Arab gallery* of whose intelligence they hold the same estimate as Fuad.

I regret that you should have received from my last letter the impression that I regarded the question of the boundaries with coldness and hesitation; such was not the case, but it appeared to me the moment had not arrived when they could be profitably discussed. ?! I have realised, however, from your last letter, that you regard this question as one of vital and urgent importance. I have therefore lost no time in informing the Government of Great Britain of the contents of your letter; and it is with great pleasure that I communicate to you on their behalf ‘ohe following statement which, I am confident, you will receive ^ith satisfaction:- 'The districts cf Hersins and ^lexandretta and the portions of Hyria lying to the west of the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo cannot be said to be purely Arab, and should be excluded from, the proposed limits and boundaries. ‘ ith the above modification, and. witnout prejudice to our exis tin, , treaties with Ara b chic is we accept these limits and boundaries, and in regard to these portions of the territories therein in which Great Britain is free to act without detriment to the interests of her ally, France, I as empowered in the name of tne Government of Great Britain to give the following assurancesand make the following reply to your letter:- 'Subject to the above modifications.

The Shaikhs of the Manasir and Mazari tribes went from Dhafrah to Hasa and offered presents of camels to the Amir, ’Abdunlah bin Jiluv/i, and asked for his protection. They were given presents of clothes and money in return for theii presents and were taken under the protection of Bin Sa’ud. Many of Manasir and some of the Mazari stayed in Hasa. g. The Bani Yas sections, Hawamil, Qubaisat, A 1 Maharibah and Al Marar left their camels in the south of Dhafrah and Baraimi and went to Abu Dhabi. Shaikh Hamdan bin .Zaid of Abu Dhabi then went to Bara&amp;mi and brought about a reconciliation. The Bani Yas tribes returned to Dhafrah and repaired their houses and date groves. The Mazari returned from Hasa with ' their camels and did likewise. Some of the ^anasir returned to Dhafrah with their cattle, but some settled in Hasa, but come and go between Hasa and Dhafrah. Shaikh Rashid bin Mani 1 , the paramount Shaikh of the Manasir, remained in Hasa and became a close friend of ’Abdullah bin Jiluwi. 5. After the reconciliation brought about by Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid the Shaikhs of the A 1 bu Shamis, A1 1 Awa air and A 1 Daru also sent presents to ’Abdullah bin Jiluwi and were taken under the protection of Bin Sa’ud. 4. It will be noted that during this tribal warfare first one side and then the other side sent presents to ’Abdullah bin Jiiuwi, and that both sides accepted the arbitration of the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi. 5. Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid, who had apparently been on friendly terms with Bin Sa’ud and ’Abdullah bin Jiluwi, was murdered by his brother, Sultan bin Zaid, who thus incurred the enmity of Bin Sa’ud. and ^anl las tribes on one side and the Al ’ Aw amir, AJL bu Shamiso.-i-ne Z&amp;k&amp;t Collectors of Bln Sa*ud arrived at Bainunah and collected zakat from tfie Manasir, Muzari and other tribes of the Lhairah cxiea* ^naiich Bultan bin Zaid tried to prevent thi Q payment of zakat but he was not successful* 7. In this year the A1 Hurrah, the least settled of all area moved to t^akak and Aabak« They have always been subject to ^in £a f ud and pay zakat regularly though they attempt to evade payment by hiding their camels. In the event of ^In oa^ad going to war they send recruits to his forces. They pay no taxes or dues to Abu Dhabi. 8. Sacar bin Zaid murdered his brother, Shaikh Sultan bin naid, and became Buler of Abu Dhabi. He was careful to be on friendly terms with the Amir of Hasa and Bin Sa»ud as ne was afraid that without their support he would be overthrown by the sons of Shaikh Sultan. He himself tried to collect and pay to Hasa the annual zakat from the tribes In Dhafrah and Baraimi. He was eventually killed by the Manasir and was succeeded by the present shaikh of Abu Dhabi, Shakhbut bin Sultan bin Zaid. 3. In this or in the previous year zakat was paid for the last time to Bin Sa f ud by the A1 D&amp;ru, A1 *Awaair and A1 bu Shamis tribes. 10. In the early days of Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan the collection of zakat slowed down and tne Manasir at Bainunah and in Liwa and the Ban! fas and Mazari in Liwa used to hide their camels and refuse to pay zakat. Tie zakat collectors did not try to enforce payment. Only the A1 bu Mundhir section of the Manasir of Liwa, whose Shaikh, Rashid bin Mani f , lives in Hasa, paid zakat. 11. Fighting broke out between the Hawamii section of the O J Ban! fas and the Hasa officials, including Muhammad &amp;1 Sahali. The ^ani fas complained to Shaikh Shakhbut of Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh wrote to the Amir of Hasa and in reply was told that the /fightings. fighting arose from is misunderstanding between the officials and the subjects of the Shaikh. The B anl ?as had always oonsld ered themselves as subjects of Abu Dhabi and in this letter the Amir ol Ha a a appears to have admitted the claim. Though Shaikh Shakhbut complained that zakat had been taken from the B a ni Yas during the last nine years it seemed more probable that zakat was only taken intermittently. It is stated that since the fracas mentioned above no zakat has been levied. iiote. (i). The Ifenasir apparently wish to remain under tnt: protection of Bin Sa'ud as his power has been increasing whilst that of Abu Dhabi has decreased. Their paramount Shaikh, Rashid bin &amp;ani', himself lives in Hasa, and those sections of the tribe which acknowledge his control pay zakat, the sections who live in Lhafrah hide their camels and for the most part avoid payment. {±i) .

The questions for settlement are: (a) the line to be taken as regards the Saudi pan-Arab aspirations referred to by Fuad in the discussion; (h) whether we are to continue, in the light ol the discussion, to aim at a general settlement in which concessions would he made to lhn Saud over the Blue Line in return ior concessions on his part over the Koweit Blockade; (c) whether, if we agree to abandon general negotiations, the Minister should he authorised at once to press on with the Questions of Koweitiand Bahrein^^ P*~*&gt; in that order. As regards the first of these questions, reference is invited to the very interesting despatches of 17th and 29th January recounting the Minister's conversations with Fuad Hamza. It is difficult to he sure to what extent Fuad must he taken seriously. He may well he playing his own hand, though it is, of course, quite possible either that he is acting on the instructions of the King or that he is merely putting forward a policy which His Majesty would he only too glad to see adopted. But whatever the position, there can he no question of any compromise on our side as regards the King's pan-Arab ideals. We cannot in any way relax our control over the foreign relations of the Persian Gulf sheikhdoms or admit that Ihn saud has any right to interfere between them and us and on general grounds it seems definitely desirable to take a stiff line without 2956 6000 7 34 delay/delay on this point with Fuad if he reverts to the subject and to leave him under no misapprehension about it. The draft telegram which the Foreign Office have prepared is, I think, generally suitable, but the Department would suggest that paragraph 3 should be omitted. Its whole tone is apologetic; it suggests that our position is one which calls for justification (which is not the case),and particularly with Fuad, who is a clever negotiator and a strong personality, it might well be taken as a sign that we felt by no means sure where we stood. It is, perhaps, the more desirable to omit paragraph 3 that Sir Andrew Ryan, tfiile realising the dangers of pan-Arabism in the present connection, does not seem to appreciate fully the strength of our objections to any compromise on this question (compare e*g. the arrangement suggested by him in paragraph 10 of his telegram). Point (b) . sir Andrew Ryan's present j instructions are to aim at a general settlement of all outstanding questions if possible. But he was given discretion, if, after discussion at Jedda, he thought there was no real prospect of this, to revert to the disposal of questions on merits. The main disadvantage I of the latter course from our point of view is that it reduces the prospects of a satisfactory solution of the agree with them* We cannot force the Minister's hand over this and if in the light of his discussions he Has formed the conclusion that no advance is likely to he made if we insist on a general settlement, it is hfi+.+.o-n +~ i-* have his way. koweit Blockade, for wel^ta5e &gt; |no longer/any quid pro quo to give to Ibn Baud.

In a further conversation on February 7th Fuad conveyed in studiously disarming language King's view that it would be preferable not to make outstanding questions the subject of general negotiations but to deal with each on its merits as in the past. V/hen the con versations from which the present proposal had emerged weie begun last June the King's objective was a co-ordination of genexal policy. His Majesty's Government had diverted the course to the settlement 01 outstanding questions. His Majesty feared that if such questions were dealt with by way of general negotiations and these failed their result would be dangerously misinterpreted. 2. After some discussion of this communication in which I took no strong line but was mildly critical Fuad turned to the question of the Eastern frontiers. He asked what form settlement of it would take. Would local Arab rulers be in any way parties to the dis- cussion of it? He assured me that Ibn Saud had no desire to interfere a between His Majesty's Government and those rulers but said that the King must consider Moslem and Arab opinion and must avoid any / appearance of disregarding their position as Arabs. 3. I replied that His Majesty's Government had never approached the matter otherwise than as a question of determining the boundaries oetween Saudi Arabia and the area wit which they and the local rulers were alone concerned. I stressed the fact that the latter had J placed themselves in our hands as regards foreign relations.r 3- 4 4o Fuad said that opinion which the King had in mind was very ill informed 0 He suggested that settlement would he easiei if the rulers could be represented in some way e.g. by experts or if they would affirm their desire to be represented by His Majesty's Government. 5. In view of the new turn given to the whole matter by Fuad's coimiiunication I refrained from pressing him for a precise statement regarding Ibn Sand’s desiderata for which I had asked on January 21st. 6 . I promised Fuad a conmunica.tion about no we it but deferred it until I oould study your telegram ho . 25 g in the light of the previous correspondence. I said that I v/as awaiting ins inue cions about the agenda for the- proposed local conference at Bahrein. Me touched on other questions including that of Transjordan frontier but only incidentally. 7 . My own view is that the proposal regarding the general negotiations cannot usefully be pursued any further. I do not consider now that any of the concessions contemplated in paragraphs S to 10 of your telegram To . 8 w ould atcracc Ion Sauo. mriiiciencl^ to induce him to give us satisfaction on the rinst cues cion fox tme sake of such concessions.

This may facilicace ^independent settlement in regard to Koweit and possibly other matceis. 8 . The concessions contemplated in your telegram To. 6 v/e±e intended to form part of a comprehensive sbttlemenr of ouls banning questions. If these are to be dealt with separately queoC^on aiiseo whether His Majesty’s Government are still prepared to oner bnem. There can be no settlement if they simply fall back on An glo-Turkisn conventions. The difficulty of set clement on any bans .matever isTu,f jrf. d- 5 , is greatly increa^€d by the introduction of the Arab national factor 0 I iWe explained the importance of this in my despatches Nos. 17 and 28 which should reach you about February 11 th and 10th. Its significance is enhanced by moderation of Fuad’s langua under the Sing's instructions on February 7th as compared with his private expression of his own sentiments on January 20 th. 9. You may prefer to shelve the question for the present. If so I can play for stalemate but this presents the disadvantage that Ibn Saud will be left with a sense of grievance and dissatis faction as to the future attitude of His Majesty s Government. The alternative is in my opinion to follow out- piogramme in your telegram No. 8 and to work simultaneously but independently for me termination of Koweit blockade which is the next most important outstanding question. 10. We must however be prepared for rejection ox all the proposed concessions not merely because of tne greatness of Ibn Baud's pretensions but because of his acceptance of the principle that he must base his public action to some extent on Arab nationalist view. i have been speculating very tentatively to the possibility of a scheme based on that of Mr. Mendel i.e. that His Majesty's Government should promote an agreement, aetween Ibn Saud, Sultan of Muscat and Oman and themselves xepiesentmg all rulers from Mokalla to gatar witn tne exaro-.. conse . 1 those rulers on the following general lineu. A. All parties to recognise each other's claim. B. All parties to recognise for a fixed period the existence of a desert zone in which none would exercise any ii 0 nr of territorial sovereignty. H. This solution may be completely impossible. I cannot ;that it would he acceptable to Ton Sand, In any case it would obviously require long preparation and oossibly some sort of an eventual conference to define the desert zone and to elaborate other details. Nevertheless I think it is worth examining. 12 . I am sending a full record of the conversation by nag.

I am reluctant to elaborate agenda of the conference beyond the two items stated in India Office telegram No. 274 (of January 26th) to Bush ire since to do so may invite inconvenient and premature discussion with Saudi government. Moreover any material change in agenda would necessitate further reference to Sheikh, who has approved programme already suggested. This it is desirable to avoid. Unless therefore you see strong objection I should prefer that you should first frame invitation to Saudi government on basis of agenda given in India Office telegram No. 274. If they insist on mrther details you should refer to me for instructions* 2. For your information it would of course be possible to elaborate agenda as follows:~ (a) treatment of vessels which call at Bahrain and carry goods on to Saudi ports without trans shipment (Ahmedi case). Concession on this point will of course be inevitable, but should be made at Bahrain ;nd not before conferenceof India No. 16 and Bushire No 0 9. — mafmmmmmmmmmm ue 2 (Id) subsequent treatment which carry goods direct using Bahrain 0 at Bahrain of vessels to Saudi ports without (c) rate of transit dues* (d) extent of exemptions to he accorded to Ton Saudis personal supplies, hut for reasons given above I am anxious to avoid this if possible and in any case I fear that if (d) or even perhaps (c) above, was proposed for discussion Saudi government might take fright.

We agree, I think, generally with the comments on Beckett’s minute which are contained in Hendel’s letters to By an of 34th ana 31st January, subject^ however to trie following observations. 3. In the first place, as regards We quite agree that it nas not been our understanding that the Desert Zone suggested by Beckett wMrdx'are involved in regarding it as res nullius and while we also agree with the discounting those dangers and do not dispute that the simplest course may be to leave the point alone, we would the status of the Desert Zone itself. ENCLOSURE IN WE C 'LY LETTER No . - 8 1935 FROM SECRETARY, fdumuAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE should be under any kind of joint territorial sovereignty. On the other hand, we see the dangers arguments advanced by Bendel in his letter of 31st January in favour of sugge st/suggest that it might he cohside red whether we might not alternatively deal with the position of this area on the basis that within it nsithor party recognises the rights of the other or | abdicates his own rights (or those of his proteges) such as they may he. 4, The second point which we would like to ddrscush is Beckett*s point that in as much as we control the fore.ign relations of certain of tne Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf (and of the Hadramaut and the Aden protectorate) we have acquired territorial sovereignty over them. 5. We are, of course, now familiar with the strict legal view to which the that a State whose foreign relations are under the control of another State is not, in international law, a fully independent State. But (particularly public statements as to the '*independence ,, of Bahrein and to the unreality of a suggestion that, e.g., the Trucial Sheikhs or c^itar, where our influence by land is so small, are not independent States), we are very reluctant to take this argument too seriously on paper. We feel that it might have a confusing effect, both on Ryan and on the authorities in the Gulf, if an argument which, while it Foreign Office recently drew our attention, having regard to our frequent and recent may/- vV* % 1 \ Draft Paper. Department. may be sound legally, is certainly one which, politically, because of its international as well as^Local reactions, it would be most dangerous for us formal, iccept, received more tnan a minimum of emphasis in official communications from H.M.G. As you will appreciate, it would be impossible to suggest that the Persian Gulf sheikhs (and the same is probably true of the rulers of the Aden Protectorate), whe they relinquished control of their foreign relations to H.M.G., imagined or were given to understand that they were surrendering, sovereignty over their 1 territories. And it would be equally impossible to substantiate any suggestion that in securing the pledges in question H.M.G. aimed at or thought that they were securing sovereignty or suzerainty over the territories concerned. It &amp;&amp; quite clear/ fraav that we cannot press this doctrine, except at tne expense of the repeated public declarations referred to above ; which we have made in regard to Bahrein, i etc., and there is tne risk, too, of facing quite serious issues with the Rulers of the Gulf Sheikhdoms, who would in taeir view be entitled to complain that, they had been trapped into signing a declaration/declaration of fundamental importance so far as they were concerned, without any warning on the part of H.M.G* that any such importance attached to it* Any decision that we^must a-Pirf^yCthe strict legal view raise very serious issues and setn clearly only be approved | by the highest authorities* 4. On a minor point arising out of the correspondence, I do not think: that we would go quite so far as the suggestion made in Bechett's minute that migratory persons and tribes not recognised as who nationals of Ibn Saud, but/might be said to belong to the Desert Zone itself, 11 if they can be said to belong anywhere, will, while the agreement lasts, be subjected to the personal sovereignty of Saudi Arabia, so that Ibn Saud will exercise jurisdiction over them to the extent that it is necessary and he thinks fit to do so”. I think all we had contemplated about people such as this has been that in so far as Ibn Saud was in a position to collect or had in the past collected zakat he would remain at liberty to do so, H.M.G. turning a blind eye'! * Lj&amp;1 % T *H YY. 065'.

A copy of this telegram was enclosed in our official letter No. A 294/318/25 of the 19th January to the India office. 2. I now enclose copies of two letters from Rendel to Ryan giving the gist of the discussion of this point here. May we have your views on the corres pondence?pir Andrew Ryan, C.M.G. COPY. (E 1594/318/25) FOREIGN (S'PICK, S.W.l. £4th January, 19^5. My dear Andrew, Following on paragraph 3 of our telegram IJo* 9 of January £lst, and with reference to heading (c) of your telegram No » 6 of January 18th, I enclose for your information a copy of a minute by Beckett on the question of the distinction between personal and territorial sovereignty which may arise in connection with the proposed creation of a special desert zone. 2. As a matter of fact, Beckett has, I think, been working on rather insufficient data in one or two parts of his minute. In the first place, I do not think we have ever contemplated that the so-called desert zone should be under any kind of joint territorial sovereignty. My idea was that it should be a complete vacuum as far as territorial sovereignty goes, and if it corresponds to anything, correspond rather to the high seas than to any kind of known territorial area. 3. Secondly, I do not think the India Office would agree to the suggestion that the territory to the north, east and south of the 'ring fence' in the desert area should be regarded as under British sovereignty. It is true that from the point of vie?/ of international law it is arguable that if a country controls the foreign relations of another country, it has thereby acquired sovereignty over that country for international purposes. You will remember that this was the line we took about Ibn Saud f s original protectorate over iisir, and it is a line which we are increasingly/increasingly inclined to take in regard to our own position in Bahrein and Koweit. But it is rather a large order to say that His Majesty’s Government possess international sovereignty over the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and I feel sure that the India Office would intensely 4. As regards the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, there is of course no question of our exercising sovereignty, hut as we have a perfectly good independent sovereign in the person of the Sultan of Muscat - whose independence for that matter we and the French have hy the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862 specifically undertaken to respect, - the point is not of great importance, since we need only substitute the Sultan of Muscat for His Majesty’s Government in the relevant part of Beckett’s minute. 5. As regards the Hadramaut, which is now of course an integral part of the Aden Protectorate, the case for regarding His Majesty’s Government as holding sovereignty is of course very much stronger. But the main point is of course 'that such territories to the north, east and south of the 'ring fence' will be definitely foreign territory so far as Ibn Sand is concerned, while the territory inside the 'ring fence” will belong to no-one. 6. Personally I should prefer as regards the proposed desert zone the analogy of the Arctic regions or the high seas. Ibn Saud will have complete sovereignty over the tribes wandering over this area which are recognised c*s looking to him rather than to any of the coastal rulers. But he will have no territorial rights of any kind. His dislike such an implication authority/authority over his tribes will however he greater, since there will he no-one else in this area to contest it. On the other nanQ f if a subject of a frucial Sheikh or of Muscat or of the Hadrazoaut gets into the desert area he will he no more under Ihn Baud's authority than would a foreign ship on the high seas* 7* I have dictated this note very hurriedly in the hope of catching today's hag, as you may like to have Beckett's minute with my preliminary comments thereon with the least possible delay* There has not been time to show the draft of this letter to Beckett before the bag goes. But if he has any further comments, I will have them sent to you as soon as possible. Yours ever, ( Sgd. ) Gr.W. KENDEL.mmmmmmrnmm Sir A. Hyan says 'I appreciate the effects of distinction 'drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty hut I am not clear as to now distinction should be defined juridically 'if necessity arises'. He is referring, if I understand it, to the outline of a scheme for the regime to be adopted in a | certain portion of the desert in South Eastern Arabia which is set out in paragraphs 3-9 of Mr. Renders letter to Mr. laithwaite in E 6769* The short answer to Sir A. Ryan would be that it would not defeat the efforts of a draftsman to define the regime if the draftsman was quite sure what was intended, but he would probably have to do it in a number of articles and in doing so might not in fact choose to use the expression 'personal sovereignty' at all. But to stop there jurisdiction which a State possesses over individuals which are its nationals, irrespective of where those nationals may be. Territorial sovereignty consists in the rights and powers which a State possesses by virtue of its possession of territory. Where the nationals of State A are in the territory of State A, personal and territorial sovereignty \iinterest only to State A and of no concern to any other State* alien the nationals of State A are in the territory of State you have a position where the two sovereignties exist simultaneously 'with regard to the same object, and international law has, so to speak., to draw the boundary t be tYi/een them* It has drawn it in such a v/ay a$, in general, to make the personal sovereignty give way to the territorial sovereignty to the extent that territorial sovereignty is held to include the jurisdiction over all things and persons within the territory irrespective of the nationality of the persons* But this does not mean that personal sovereignty. liberty of the territorial sovereign as regards foreigners within his territory is limited by certain general principles tions, and any infringement of them gives rights of objection and claims to the personal sovereign, i*e* all the rights associated with diplomatic protection* Further, though unable to exercise jurisdiction over his nationals directly while in the foreign territory, the personal sovereign may make certain demands upon them while they are there and enforce those demands upon them when he can find them within his own jurisdiction - demands which he would not be entitled to make in respect of foreigners in foreign territory* provisions, personal sovereignty is increased at the expense of territorial sovereignty by the creation of exterritorial jurisdiction - a system under which, to a greater or a lesser extent, the personal sovereign exercises jurisdiction over even in these cases, has been reduced to nothing. The of international law and possibly particular treaty oblige' In certain cases, as a result of special treatyhis own nationals, even in the territory of another State* kigratory tribes always create to a certain extent particular problems, but nevertheless, speaking generally, the respective rights of the personal and territorial ( sovereigns are regulated according to the ordinary principles in the case of migratory tribes which regularly pass from the territory of one State to that of another in the course of their seasonal moves. If the territorial boundaries are fixed and if, (which Is not always the case with regard to migratory tribes but is more usually the case) the tribes are recognised definitely as being the nationals of State A, these tribes during their migration in the territory of State B will be subject. In accordance with the ordinary rules, to the personal sovereignty of State A and the territorial sovereignty of State B. This is, for instance, the case of the tribes that cross the border between British Somaliland and Ethiopia, though In this case the territorial sovereignty of Ethiopia is in any case less than the normal because of exterritorial jurisdiction (incidentally the nationality of some tribal sections Is not determined)* In some cases individuals may find themselves in a place where there is no territorial sovereignty, viz* when they are in territory which is under the territorial sovereignty of no State. These areas are relatively scarce now, but there are still, I think, portions of Polar terri tories over Y/hich no State claims territorial sovereignty, and in this case, there being no competition from any terri torial sovereign, they remain solely subject to their personal sovereign and are under such jurisdiction as he chooses to exercise over them.I come now down to Mr. Rondel's scheme, of which I understand the main lines to he as follows. An enclave is to he created in South East Arabia whose boundaries are to be fixed between His Majesty's Government, as suzerain of the Arab sheikdoms on the east, and the King of Saudi Arabia, lo the west of the western boundary of the enclave the territory is recognised as being under the territorial sovereignty of Saudi Arabia, and to the north, east and soutn of uhe northern, eastern and southern boundary the territory is unde r the territorial sovereignty of His Majesty's Government as the suzerain of the sheikdoms, and the normal division between territorial and personal sovereignty applies. The enclave itself is to be recognised as an area over ?/hich neither His Majesty's Government nor A Saudi Arabia will claim to exercise territorial sovereignty and the rights flowing therefrom, though they will also agree that the territory belongs to one or the other of them and is not simply 'res nullius' and open to appropri ation by a third power. In this area they agree upon a regime which they think will be convenient and suitable in the circumstances. Within the enclave, tribes or individuals who are undoubtedly nationals of Saudi Arabia (viz. to take the extreme case, persons who live at Mecca) or tribes and persons who are recognised as nationals of a trucial sheikdom will be solely under the jurisdiction of their respective personal sovereigns. Other persons and tribes who are not recognised as being nationals of Ibn Baud and, though migratory, may be said to belong to the enclave itself, if they can be said to belong anywhere, will, while the agree ment lasts, be subjected to the personal sovereignty of Saudi Arabia,/Arabia, so that Ibn 3aud will exercise jurisdiction over them to the extent that it is necessary and he thinks fit to do so* 3\ii this is only a temporary arrangement; this attribution of personal sovereignty to Ibn Saud is not a recognition that they are \his nationals so that he would nave any claim arising out of the agreement to regard them as such when tne agreement with regard to the enclave came to an end. Finally, as each party has agreed to refrain from claiming or exercising territorial sovereignty over the enclave, neither party must do things which only a territorial sovereign can do, such as grant concessions for oil exploitation within the area. (Query, if the question of the grant of any such concession within the area arises, the two parties must consult together and, if it is thought expedient to make a grant, it will be given jointly.) Renclel T s scheme, I can see no legal reason why it should not be adopted or why it should be impossible to express it in appropriate language. There may be other points in connexion with it which may require to be settled and defined in the agreement which have not occurred to anybody yet, but which will reveal themselves. One point which, it seems to me, will require to be settled is the manner in quarrels and disputes arising in the enclave betvtfeen British nationals (i.e. nationals of the Sheiks) and persons v/ho within the enclave are to be under the personal sovereignty of Ibn Saud are to be settled. Some machinery may be required for this. If I have appreciated correctly the nature of Mr (Sgd.) W.E. BECKETT January 2-3, 1935.a j -1st January, 19,;.5. duar Andrew, ith r^ferenow to my lettur numb-.r^d as a'bovu. )/ of the 24th January, on the question of th , distinction tout oen p-raonal and territorial sovereignty, I send you for your information, the following summary of further m nutes by Beckett and ayself* 2. With reference to paragraph 4 of my letter Beckett agr.. ea that tue sultanate of Muscat and Oman is in a different posit on from all the other hi ab sheikhdoms on the Feraian Gulf and in the Hadramaut, and that there is no question in the case of this ruler’s territories of His Majesty’s Government being the Sultan’s suzerain or of their possessing, in the int rnational sanse, sovereignty over his territories. If, theiafore, part of the proposed n desert sons might be held to fall, if boundaries wee a drawn, within the Sultan’s Sir Andrew fcyan, K.B.K., C.M.G.fnltan's territories, this would Introduce another factor into situation* it not for this possible complication, Boekatt would without hesitation maintain that it would be bettor to draft our agreement with a bn. Sand in such a way as to place on record that the territory within the 'desert soae* belonged either to :,a tdi Arabia or to the Sheikhs of the Tracial coast, or of the Hadramaut area of the Aden Protectorate, but that it was not settled to which of the parties it belonged or where the boundary lay, and that during the. period, of the agreement both parties agreed to refrain from exorcising territorial right© in the gone without prejudice to their claims. As it is, the possibility of a claim (howewor re otu) by the Sultan of Muscat to some portion of the desert zone* rather complicates any attempt at an ax xangement on these lines, because, at any rate theoretically, in order to make the reheme work properly, the Sultan would have to become a party to the agreement bet - can ourselves ana King Ibn Sand, and this (though you will r^me bor that it was contemplatedeonfcii&amp;pl&amp;'i&amp;d Is ist t-^ptimber) w«s T&gt;i*obably siiould prefer not to hav^ to arrange* On the other hand, Beckett does not foci sure that the 'dac.ert zone” scheme will really work if we proceed on the Basis that the territory comprised in it is completely res nulUafe . For if ttus zone territory is tieated in this way, it will, in theory at least, r he open to occupation by ; ome thiid Power and neither we nor Ihn taaa will bo able legally to prevent, for Instance, an American or Italian company (if they can get there either through Muscat or by air) from starting to drill for oil there without any obligation to seek prior permission to do so, just as anyone can exploit mineral rammrmm in an unappropriated area in the olar regions without having to obtain a concession from any itsto. 4* X think my elf that the answer to Beckett’s point above is that, although in theory, Ujl danger to which he draws attention may exist, in practice we are really perfectly safe, since the proposed special zone would bo quite una op roaenable except through territory whichwbioh tttfeft* Mb BMI or W MNMdMl &amp;r« in a position t&gt;o eont: oX« Xn pr?A©tio^^. t^ii a sppXi#^ «'v , @n to wi^rts wt.- should certainly in a position, through our predominant influoiisa, to pi uvont any ror^ignars f*ro® passing to and fro across Muscat! territory for the purpose of cany lug out any operations In th£# sono.

Beckett states that ho quits appreciates that for political 7 .aeons we ox : the India Office may not wish to state in public documents that His Majesty’s Government, as suzerain of the Arab sheikhdoms on the Per.ian Gulf, possess sovereignty over those territories. I^varthel ss, although v# may all be agreed that it is undesirable to publish this fact in an international document, and most of all in an agreement with I bn Saud, w« must be Quite clear in our&gt;Q mn own minds that in law His Majesty*s Oowarnmant nndoaTt?tedl^ pos®t,8S this sovereignty by virtue of their treatise with these Bfceikkdoms* Bsekett tells me that a useful case on this point is a certain arbitral sward, of which 1 can’t for the moment get fall particulars: which was given in relation to some native rulers under ruteh sovereignty, in which the arbitrator explained the situation under international law in this s«nsa* ?. I am soriy to send you our views in this piecemeal fashion, but until the whole matter has been considered in consultation with the India Office I can:? ot send you any final answer to you) question* But these letters will, I hope, serve to show you the direction In which our minds are working and will ma' e it easier for us eventually to telegraph our final views, if the point should become one of sufficient urgent importance to make this necas ary. eanwhile, of course, we shall be glad of any observations which you may care to send us* Tours ever, C'3dJ S3. . . ..2956 6000 7/?4 treaties/ Minute Paper. Department. t t mad Hamza was at pains to say on 21st January that what he had said on the previous cky about the promise to King .Hussein was personal and unofficial, and Sir A. Ryan does not consider that his talk need be taken too seriously. The 1 McMahon 'pledge' is such a thorny subject that I should have thought that any fresh and hasty attempt to interpret it was to be deprecated. The Saudis may not refer to the matter again in their conversations with Sir A. Ryan. Would it not, tRerefore, be better to instruct him that if they say anything official on the subject, he should report it for specific instructions before replying? This would seernbetter than to give him instructions now as to the reply to be returned to any official representations before such representations are made, and before we know what form they may take. The draft despatch seems to me a somewhat slapdash method of dealing with a very difficult subject. Apart from other considerations, the G.O. are, of course, deeply concerned qua Palestine, and if the F.O. want to send instructions now they will presumably first consult the G.O. The draft gives a very half-hearted interpretation of the alleged pledge, and if it were passed on in this form to the Saudis it would inevitably give the impression that H.M.G. do not know their own | minds which, though it may be true, would be unfortunate. So far as the Arab Sheikhdoms are concerned, the i meaning of the pledge seems plain - viz ., that we recognise their independence subject to our existingtreaties with them. It seems important tnat in padic we should normally stick to thiis-aescriptioi^, a^id especially when we are talking to Ibn Saud. The ..J. qualiiication of our doctrine has some substance in it, ou,. dere seems no reason why should go out of tttxr way to pUv; it on record. The draft in more than one place suggests that doubt kiiv own view about the independence 01 tliese Sheikhdoms, and this would surely have an unfortunate eifecb on Ibn Saud. If therefore, the F.0• want to. sexid .uhis despatcn giving an interpretation (apparently unnecessary at this stage) of the Ll^cMahon pledge, I suggest that we should press for further alterations, e.g. (1) Any interpretation given to the Saudis should not be qualified by the word n perhaps n , repeaueci twice in the last sentence of para. 4. It would seem preieraDi.e iirsc to make up our minds what interpretation we are prepaied to give and adhere to, though this of course may oe a lengthy process, -involving consultation with other Depts (2) In para. 5, line 5, the doubting words “must surely be” might be replaced by a definite statement tha- this is the construction, if we are satisfied that it is so. (3) The whole of para. 6 seems superfluous, as it covers much the same ground as para. 5. It is objectionable because it-introduces doubts as to the meaning of the word “independence' 1 . This para, might be omitted. ) Para. 7 might also be omitted. The argument, in this weak and qualified form, is not one which should be used to the Saudis, and it seems merely confusing to use it to Sir A. Ryan. What is left by thei qualifications does not add anything material to what hasMr. Walton, Please see the Foreign Office instructions to sir A.^Ryan as to the line to he taken in the event oj. tne Huaai» pledge being pressed against us by ouaa Hamza in the forthcoming negotiations. I think the general line proposed by them is all right, but suggest that, if you agree, we should enter a caveat against the doctrine in paragraph 7. It is the. more important to safeguard ourselves against full acceptance of the strict legal view that there are signs that the Foreign Office are likely to bring it up when it suits them in connection with Koweit, etc.(E 496/518/25) foreign office, S.W.l. / / 2nd February, 1935. 81 n I s* 1 /ft I*- ^3^ • loa have, I think, already received, m our official letter of this number dated the 3ord January, a copy of Ryan's telegram No. 7 of the 22nd January, in which he reports two conversations with Fuad Hamza. first ol these conversations, you will remember, Fuad unexpectedly dragged into the discussion of the 'blue line' question some general remarks on Arab independence, with particular reference to the undertakings given by His Majesty’s Government to the late Xing Hussein during the War.

February 1936 £ir t S'? 2 - In your telegram No* 7 of the 22nd January regarding the proposed general negotiations between Hie ; aieety* a Government in the United Kingdom and the Cauc 1 Government, you reported a reference by the Deputy Laudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affaire to a promise to recognise Arab independence which, he alleged, Hie Majeaty* e Government in the United Kingdom had given to the late King HuE^ein. I understand that Fuad ley Hamza attempted to argue that the attitude at present adopted by His majesty’s Government with regard to the eastern and south-eastern bournaries of Ssuci Arabia was inconsistent with that promise* g. I assume that the undertaking to which Fuad Bey Hamee was referring ie that contained in the correspondence which took m A /y) piece in the yeere 1916 and 1916 between ,,ir/ir Henry Mc v ahon and King Hussein, and more particularly to King Hussein’s letter or the 14th July, 1915 to Sir Henry McMahon, and Sir Henry cahon’s reply of the 24th October 1915. A summary of the first and a cony of the text of. the second of these letters are enclosed in this despatch for convenience of reference. 3. I gather from paragraph 8 of your telegram under rerly that you do not consider that Fuad Hamza’s remarks on this Point need be taken too seriously at present. It is certainly to be honed that King Ibn Baud will not allow himself to be influenced in his attitude towards the proposed negotiations in general, and the frontier quest on in particular, by impractical pan-Arab aspirations, I have nevertheless been considering what reply should be returned to any official representations on the lines of Fuad Bey Hamza’s remarks, and I am advised that the Position of His Majesty’s Government in this aatter may be defined as iollows. 4. In the first place, whatever may be the exact meaning of the undertaking given to King Hussein JHussein, it was certainly not a promi ids majesty 1 * Oovefna^nt would support tlu.- clfeia of King Hiiis®in and, nisi success. m to include within their territories the entire eree covered by that undertaking. it aey Arabs within that area should be allowed independence to govern theasilves and pr th&amp;pB to settle freely amongst themselves their nothing in it which si fords any support for the argument that e given niece of territory should Arab ruler, such &amp;b for instance, the Sultan of --uscat. S. Secondly, Sir Henry ' c ahon’s letter of the 34th October to King Hussein expressly introduces the word© w without prejudice to our ’’existing treaties with Ar&amp;b-chief fr’. This phrase .mvt sur ly be construed &amp;e meaning that His Mejeety 1 ® Government, being Bound under their treaty relations with certain Arab Sheikhs, including the Sheikh.® of the Truclal Coast and the Hadramaut, to protect their territories, perhaps be interpreted as a promise that thd mfure allegiance, but th&lt; re is certainly belong to King Ibn Baud rather Urn to any other expressly/I ©xT&gt;rr 5 * placed it on record th&amp;t nothing in the promise given to King Hussein was to inter!ere with their duty to those Sheikhs or with their obligation to see that the Sheikhs retained possession over their territories. Tire its in lact the line which hi© ’ ; ^jeety f 8 i Oovem^ent are taking in the proposal© which it is intended to make to King Ibn Baud with regard to the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of his Kingdom, for an essential feature of those proposals is the contention that any righta of sovereignty which any exist over the territory on the seaward side of the suggested M desert aone' belong to the Sheikhdoms in question. 6. Thirdly, whatever may be the meaning of the word 'independence'*, as used in the undertaking, and even on the assumption that the sheikhs in qu- stion are not independent within the meaning of that promise, it could not be held that, in claiming territory on the ©©award side of the proposed 'desert son#** on behalf of those Sheikhs or of the Arabs who live/live in that territory as subjects of the &lt;J ’-.V 1 J . ,jV%* ^aaa .f vV ^ Sheikhs« His ?#sjesty*s Govei’n^ient were violating their undertaking to King Hussein, since they purport to be making this claim in virtue of thfir existing treaties with the Sheikhs, which the promise made to King Hussein expressly safeguards. v * Fourthly, although the Sheikhs, other than the Sultan of * uscat and Oman, may not be fully independent in the sense of being fully independent states under international law, and although under international law the position say be that His Majesty 1 s Government have suzerainty over those Sheikhs and consequently sovereignty over their territories, the Sheikhs have practically full internal independence and v govern their own people in their own way.

Tbe Saudis have been rather more forthcoming than we anticipated about Bahrein transit dues (on which they now seem aisposeu to agree to a local conierence at Bahrein to discuss the difficulties which have arisen - a proposal to which they did not react very favourably in the past) and about the Koweit blockade (on which they are apparently prepared to envisage discussions and in connection with which they have not raised the question of the Sheikh’s claims, which have hitherto been an obstacle to the initiation of such discussions). Their general attitude on the question/ M a* “ question whether the negotiations shall oe comprehensive or piecemeal is not perhaps of much importance. They ao not seem to feel strongly either way* g' As regards the Blue Line, Sir A* i^ysn has warned Fuad that H.M.G. ^contemplated only moderate concessions”. There is nothing in the suggestion put forward by iudci, no doubt for debating reasons, that H.li.G., by undertaking to keep—a ~sane recognition of Arab independence, can in any way be regarded as compromising themselves in regard to the States in Arabia with which they are in special treaty relations over the areas to the east of the Blue Line, and this was made clear by the Minister. But we must carefully watch any disposition on the part of the Saudis (there were hints of this during Fuad's discussions here in the summer) to make important concessions to “their Arab brethren' in ^ ' H direct correspondence. Save in the case of Muscat, which is not likely to be materially affected by the conversations now in progress, we control the foreign relations of these Arab sheikhs and it is important to interpret their obligations to us in this respect strictly if we wish to keep them from being drawn into the orbit of Ibn Saud. 3. on the whole, the opening conversations have passed off fairly well, but it remains to be seen whether this relatively smooth progress will be maintained. The invitation to Riyadh seems to have dropped into the background. i*This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Decypher, Sir A.

Ncu7„ “0 —O'-'O ''O “O —o —o My telegram No. 6 , I had long conversations with Fuad January 20th and January 21st. In the first, which was informal and discursive, we discussed (a) proposal for comprehensive negotiations; (To) Bahrein transit; (c) Koweit Blockade; (d) Eastern and South Eastern Boundaries of Saudi AraBia. As regards (B) and (c) see my separate telegrams 8 and 9 a As regards (a) I understood Fuad to say that Saudi Government would do anything we liked. He disconcerted me By approaching (d) from the standpoint that His Majesty f Government were Bound under promise to King Hussein to recognise AraB independenceo At one moment he said precis© statement of King’s desiderata would Be produced But he seemed to suggest that while Saudi Government might Be willing to make important concessions to 'their AraB Brethen' vie should not come in Between them. I naturally scouted this and repeated on January 21st my warning against danger of taking such a line officially. On this occasion Fuad told me that all he had said on the previous day except about (B) and (c) above was personal and unofficial.•2~ — ^ lh*MA 2. I gave a definite official turn to the second conversation# I asked whetner the Saudi Government as such were ready to accept proposal which His Majesty's Government had indeed approved for comprehensive negotiation on the lines suggested in London last September and whether they would produce precise statement of Ibn Saud's desiderata regarding boundaries. I added that if com prehensive negotiations produced no result the parties could only return to their positions in regard to legal question and expressed the hope that any statement of desiderata would be such as to provide for reasonable b^eder discussion as His Majesty's Government contemplated only moderate concessions 0 I said that I was making these observations under instructions. Fuad inconveniently postponed his replyo Nothing was said about invitation to Riadh* My general impression is that Saudi Government attach little importance to distinction between comprehensive negotiations and alternative of dealing with every question on its merits. My present object is to tie them down to the former in the first instance but I proposed to play for time until I have your instructions on all points and then to suggest definite agenda if in the meantime Saudi Government agree to comprehensive negotiationso Fuad's talk about Arab independence may be important if the King is allowing himself to be swayed by the ideas of^Pan-Arabism* e.g. in form of Federation of Arab States which he might hope to dominate., It need not be taken more seriously than that at this stages Conversations and further comments follow by bag* Addressed to Foreign Office No.7, repeated to Government of India No.5, Bushire telegram No 0 6 &amp;^XKXXXXXXXXXX Your telegram No.6 (of the 18th January; Anglc-l Saudi negotiations) 0 Sub-paragraph A.

Apart from reasons practical inconvenience which have some weight hut are not imperative I see increasing political ohjecuions to a., early visit. I do not expect Fuad to pursue his impossxhla suggestion that'gyriugr negotiations should take place a u Riadh hut impression is widespread that such negotiations are impending especially in view of position as regards Treaty of Jedda. This being so my return without having come to any definite agreement might be misinterpreted locally and In Arab and Egyptian press. Moreover King feels so strongly over blue line question that io would b- better to confine myself to conversations with Fuad as long as possible* I propose therefore unless you see strong objection to side-track .*»side-track any invitation if I can do so without risk of offence 'but to intimate that invitation next summer would be welcome e I shall of course see the King here in the interval, B. What maps are you using and what maps should I use in discussion with Fuad? Map Department of the Foreign Office has, I think, list of maps available here. Further supply by bag of those to be used would be useful, C a I appreciate effects of distinction drawn between personal and territorial sovereignty but I am not clear as to how distinction should be defined juridically if necessity arises 0 May I have information on this subject not necessarily by telegraph if explanation is lengthy?

After con sideration of views of political authorities in the Persian Gulf and Government of India His Majesty’s Government suggest following Programme for negotiations with Saudi Government. Concessions in each case are intended to form part of general settlement. 6. First stage. Request for clearer indication of King ion baud’s desiderata. If the King merely repeats his claim to the whole of- the desert except for the coastal belt, he might bo told that so vague and extensive a claim to so vast an area, to which His Majesty’s Government do not recognise him as possessingto levy zakat 'but would not possess territorial sovereignty and would thereioie not oe able to grant concessions.. The desert zone and special regime would 'be defined by a separate agreement. lu. If you are eventually convinced that no satisfactory directions s to concede to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty a part at least of the desert area referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, subject however to the servitude that no concessions would be granted therein by Ibn Saud except after approved both by His Majesty’s G-overnment and by the Saudi Government. Precise limits to be suggested for this additional area are still under consideration and further instructions on this point will reach you as soon as possible. Idea at present being explored is that the part of the proposed desert zone lying to the west of Meridian 52 might possibly be thus conceded to Ibn Saud. South end of this line would appear to join 'ring fence” line approximately at the northern end of the boundary between the Aden Protectorate and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, assuming latter to run inland from Has Dharbat All at4. angles 'to biie coaslo 11. In any case however it will be important to obtain from Ibn Sand a categorical renunciation of any rights, or claim to any kind of sovereignty outside the frontier line suggested in paragraphs JSTW^^or outside the ’’ring fence' of the desert zone (see paragraph 5 of Mr. Rendel’s letter to Mr. maitnvaiue). It would also be desirable for His Majesty’s Government to retain ftying, rights not only over the desert zone but also over any area which might eventually be conceded to Ibn Sana under ' 0 . paragraph S\ 12. You vail no doubt in any negotiations make suen use as vou can of fact that any of these concessions would involve acquisition by Ibn Sand of rights over very large areas to whren he has at present no legal claim, and would r^l^^o^ him fion obligations of existing 'Blue Line' frontier, from which he could not otherwise escape without the greatest dixficulty. 15. If you see any objection to any part of above programme I shall be glad to consider any observations you wish to offer.

Out own main desidera ta are (e) to prevent Ibn Baud from encroaching on, or unduly extending his influence in the Trucial Sheikhdoms, , Ibv-iHAv inViy'ejAsJ (h.) to secure for 7nmm§ iwo,,/the right to any oil or fflinerals there may be in those sheikhdoms, (c) not to draw too herd and fast a frontier in this region, in order not to tie our hands toe closely in the event of a collapse of the Saudi regime. 3 must admii that, although there are no doubt reasons, mainly administrative, against drawing a definite frontier line in the desert, the reason given above for not doing so does not strike me as a very strong one, I find it hard to believe that even if Ibn Baud’s regime did collapse, His Majesty's Government would themselves be tempted (as they aiiv ht in the case of Brans Jordan and Bowel t) to extend their commitments or to ^sst-their proteges ss? extending their territories one mile further into the desert. Nor would they be directly concerned with extending, or helpinghelping their prot&lt;5g6s to extend their influence over the tribes which had hitherto been recognised as Saudi. All i'is ^sjesty's dovenment would require would bs^^Heal with such tribes if they became troublesome within the British sphere, and this they could take with impunity in the circumstances imagined, on the ground that the Saudi Government were failing to control them. 5. It has, I think, been accepted as desirable that fis majesty’s Government should in any cose reserve as their own special sphere a broad bond of territory forming the hinterland of the frucial boast of the Sultanate of .Piscat and Oman mid/the %dhramaut. it it— -n fmk seeaS highly probable that 'is Majesty's government will have in any case to define the territorial limits of their interest in this region, if they insist on Ibn Gaud defining his or on their eefining it for him; and this applies even if it is agreed that there shall be an unowned desert area between Saudi Arabia and the British sphere, for it is, I suggest, unlikely that Ibn Saud will agree to the precise limitation of his dominions while One limits of the British sphere of influence are left vague. The dimensions suggested at the piddle Kast Official Sub-Committee meeting for the band of territory referred above were a depth of ICO miles from the sea along the Trucial Coast and a depth of 20 miles elsewhere. The establish® ?iit of such an area as under British influence would certainly fulfil our requirements both territorially and from the point of view of # prestige: V.

If,then,we advance that claim on behalf of our protSg&amp;s, we shall probably be unable to produce any proof in support of it and we may very well be let down by the reluctance of our protdg^s themselves to support our efforts on their behalf: our experience with the Sheikh of Tatar has shown the danger of this. It is quite true that Ibn Saud will also in all probability be unable to produce any claim to the area in Question. Nevertheless, even if this is so, it does not make our [claim any stronger and would indeed only strengthen his case if he were to demand the inclusion in any neutral ’’desert area” which lis Majesty’s Government may propose to set up of the larger part of the territory which it is desired to claim for British influence and certainly of as much of it as could not definitely be proved to belong to one or other of the rulers under British protection. This latter area would be unlikely to amount to more than a very small coastal strip, so small in fact that its acceptance by His Majesty’s c-wu u Government/migm even lessen their prestige among the local population. From this point of view it might not be enough merely to have denied Baud! sovereignty over the area immediately outside this narrow strip. Kven if a M desert area” is established, it will have to be bounded on three of its sides by territory admittedly under British influence. The extent of this territory will naturally be regarded locally as Indicating the extent,of that influence: its reduction in comparison with a larger original claim might4 might well be interpreted to our discredit. 4. f the territorial claims of ih&amp; Rulers themselves cannot be extended to cover the whole of the area which f !is Majesty's Government wish to claim, neither can any reasons which His Majesty's Government are able to advance in connexion with their obligations to protect the Rulers of this region, except conceivably in regard to the Hadhramaut. They are under no coual tment to protect the Sultan of iiiuscat at all and they are only bound to protect the Traci&amp;l Sheikhs from aggression by sea. At the same time, His Majesty's Government might in practice, I imagine, feel obligee to come to thew assistance^ if they were attacked by tribes recognised as Saudi or by other tribes under Saudi instigation, end from this point of view as well as from that of the protection of any future oil concessions in this region, it would be desirable to have a band of territory beyond the coastal strip effectively occupied by the Rulers in quest io ich the Royal Air Force would, for instance, have t to manoeuvre if the need arose. This is an added argument in favour of the 100-aile band, but not of course in support of any claim to it vis-a-vis of Ibn Baud. 5. It may be that His Majesty's Government carry so much weight with Ibn Baud that a firm statement of their territorial demand [would meet with no serious opposition on his part, provided that he were himself fairly generously treated in the matter of territory. If so, there is of course no more to be said: we shell have gained our objective without striking a blow. But, subject to more exnert opinion, I submit that it might be as well to consider what second5. second spring we hf^ve to our bow, if this one fails: and as I have attempted to show above, if once we are obliged to descend from authority to argument, our claim may irove diificult to establish* In these circumstances, would it not be possible to change our ground and, if it is decided that a bare statement of our claim is not likely to secure us what we want, abandon any attempt to prove a political title to it (which neither we nor our proteges possess) and tackle the point on economic grounds, if this were done, we could make the oil question the main basis of our approach to Ibn S&amp;ucu In point of fact he is almost certainly as well aware as we that this factor is at the bottom of the necessity which we now feel for a more definite territorial settlement in ( eastern and south-eastern Arabia: nor do J see anything discreditable in this fact or the admission of it. he might, for instance, explain that, had it not been for the rapid development which has recently begun to take place in the oil-bearing regions of Arabia, it might have been possible, and indeed desirable, to C#wVi*wu,C, sasedsoss the former vague but satisfactory position in the south-eastern deserts* 1-ow it is impossible and it is imperative that if future friction is to be avoided we should look well ahead and, if possible, reach a definite understanding. As Ibn Baud is aware, T fis Majesty’s Government are in special treaty relations with certain Rulers of the Arab Coast and the Hadhreaaut. We regard the territories of these Rulers as our particular sphere of Influence and mean to ensure that, if Arabia is indeed to become a centre of oil production, they7 * * * » they and we stolid have a just share in it. T'e do not say that m necessarily mmn to either seek: or to encourage the grant of concessions in the Traolal Sheikhdoms, Inecat or the lladtomut in the mearorable future, but if it is a question of making % lasting and definite settlement with Saudi Arabia we have to take these considerations into account* - e therefore claim m our particular ecoiKHaie s^iare the broad coastal band of territory referred to in paragraph 5 above* Subject to the acccptaiKJe of certain arrange ments outlined below. His Hajesty’s Government do not propose that there should be anything in the nature of a hard and fast adminis trative frontier in this amt (given the conditions of the Great Desert, such a frontier would be an anomaly); nor do they wish in any way to hamper the free isigration of the local tribes* At the same time they are not prepared to admit any form of Saudi terri torial sovereignty within this belt. C. It is quite true that, whether we rmt forward our claim on political or on economic grounds, in the last resort we can only rely on the authority of His d&amp;b sty's Government with Pjh Baud to enforce acceptance of it, if he is unwilling to accept it out- rational .ground for our claim, the political arguments in support of it are either such as it might be difficult to avow to Vm Baud or else easily refutable: the economic basis of the claim, though entailing equally in the last resort a bare assertion of our intention not to allow any Saudi interference witii the territory in question, has this merit, that it appeals stral#tfonrardly to a real interest of His Ha^esty’s (Averment of the existence of which Xbn Baud is perfectly aware and which he knows that we shall insist cn his respecting*7, Subject to the acceptance of this premiss, we might then propose a settlement on the following lines: the details are of course subject to any variation that may be found desirable. (a) recognition of. certain tribes as Saudi subjects, wherever found. /~ As suggested in paragraph 2 above, this tie will normally dissolve itself, if the Saudi regime crumbles.J7 (b) Recognition of full Saudi sovereignty west of a line running due south from hohat as Salwa to the British sphere as defined above. /■This would represent quite a substantial derogation from the blue and violet lines. Minor modifications might be made to allow for the inclusion of Saudi tribal areas.J 7 (c) Recognition of predominant Saudi interest or, if possible, establishment of a Desert Area in the territory lying east of the above line and outside the British sphere. do mt really see strong objection to allowing Saudi sovereignty over this sphere too, but subject to conditions regarding the granting of concessions on the lines proposed at the Middle East Official Sub-Committee's meeting. If Sir Ryan thought that he could obtain the. major desideratum, so much the better# t the same time it may be well to consider what line we should adopt if Ibn Baud cannot be persuaded to agree to the establishment of a Desert Area. A no m.y indeed protest that it is unnecessary to interpose a vacuum between our frontiers and his in the south-east, when we have not attempted to do so in the deserts of Iraq or Transjordan* If he were to show strong opposition, the abandonment of some square miles of desert to conditional Saudi sovereignty might be impressive enough, on the map at least, to warrant our demanding some equally impressive compensation, not necessarily territorial, in some other sphere, without in any way endangering our own interests or the safety of our protdgds, 7(R9720) Wt 18117/2750 10,000(2) 12/31 H &amp; SP Gp 112 ■ B \» secret Communications on this subject should be addressed to— The Under Secretary op State, Colonial Office, London, S.W.l, and the following number quoted :— ??fS~AW ;• ^ A Reference to previous correspondence: ijifRECONNAISSANCE NORTH OP THE MHERmUT on 20,11o34, On 20,11.34 tv/o aircraft carii ed out a reconnaissance of -the area North of the Hadhrarnaut ? to try to find out the extent and nature of the country between it and the Great Desert 5 the Southern edge of which was believed to lie about 60 miles from Shibam and about 20 from Tarim, Starting from Shibam the aircraft flew for 65 miles on a track of 330° True ? then for 70 miles on 90° and finally for 50 miles on 180°.

H.M.G./^decided that they would be prepared to make some concession to the King in respect of it as part of a satisfactory general settlement. 2 J# The two questions for settlement now are (a) what, if any, territorial concessions can we-make to ion Saud as part of a general settlement? (t) the tactics to he followed In negotiation with him, and the basis on which shouldtake their stand. As regards the first of these points, we have so far been unable to ascertain in any detail the precise extent of Ibn Baud’s claims. 'The farthest we have got is that he claims in the north that his territory runs up to a line running across the base of the Qatar Peninsula. Elsewhere in the desert he has merely claimed in general terms the desert as opposed to the coastal tracts. As a result of enquiries which have been made by Colonel Loch on behalf of the Resident in the norVat and by Sir Bernard Aeilly operating from Aden in the | south^ we are now in a position to decide what is the maximum concession that can safely be made to Ibn Saud/2 Saud as part of a satisfactory general settlement, From tne information attained it appears that Qatar and the Trucial Sheiichdoms cover the whole coast from Salwa eastward; secondly, that the sheikh of Ahu Dhahi (which is the first sheikhdom to the east of Qatar) claims (and to some extent exercises) jurisdiction over an area which runs due south down to the sands of the Central Arabian Desert; thirdly that between the Blue Line and the western limits of the sheikhdom of Abu Ehabi Saudi influence is important; fourthly that in the south of the desert the Resident at Aden maintains that H.M.G. should make no concession save in respect of the desert proper, 3 # The second question - that of the tactics to be adopted, and the basis on which H.M.G. are to take their stand»is more difficult. The main possible bases of compromise are two; (a) tribal, i,e. a settlement on a basis of tribal allegiances; (b) territorial - a settlement represented by lines drawn more or less arbitrarily on the map, though corresponding as closely as possible to the de facto influence of the Contracting Parties at the time of the settlement. 4 * Prima facie , there is a great deal to be said Tor the first of these solutions. Colonel Fowls is in favour of it and it is supported by colonel Dickson,' with his great knowledge of Northern Arabia. The criticisms which can be directed against fixing boundaries in a waterless desert, sparsely populated by nomad bribes, in which little, if any, effective jurisdiction is exercised by any power, are obvious. On the other hand, it is doubtful in the first place, for/ S’Minute Paper. Department. tZTjiZ- Jcxl Pz -ji^Li yj' 2956 6000 7/94 for the reasons given hy the Government of India in * their telegram of 27th December, whether a settlement on a tribal basis would at all achieve the two objectives referred to in that telegram; secondly, the information collected by Colonel Loch clearly shows that Ibn Saud, if we adopted a tribal basis, might be able to put forward far-flung claims of a nature which we should find it difficult to refute, based on the payment of zakat by tribes in Eastern and Northern Arabia in the course of the last few years 5. On the assumption that a tribal settlement, however desirable, is not a practicable one in present conditions, we are then driven back on settlement on the basis of an arbitrary line drawn in the desert, fhe principal alternative suggestions for such a settlement are:- (a) a relatively small territorial concession immediately to the east of the Blue Line, either up to a line running due south to the 20th parallel of Latitude from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa, or to a line which would give the Saudis Sakak and frabak, and thence run along the western boundary of Abu Dhabi » and west of Banaiyan to the 20th parallel; (b) the 11 Desert Zone' solution on the general lines put forward in the Middle East Committee by Mr. Rendell The effect would be that Ibn Saud would be granted in full sovereignty a small area (on the lines of (a) above) immediately East of the Blue Line: and that a Desert Zone would be constituted in the Central Desert within which neither Ibn ^auo nor H.M.G would claim territorial rights or grant concessions. H.M.G. would make no territorial claims West of the Desert/r or Desert Zone; and Ibn saud none to the North, South or East of it. We should thus secure a forml recognition by him of the position of our Arab proteges, exclude him from their coasts, and secure a deep strip in the hinterland of their territories in which the R.A.F. could if necessary pursue raiders.; (c) a variant of (b) under which Ibn Saud would exercise full sovereignty over the whole of the Desert Zone but subject to the servitude that he would grant concessions in respect of it only in consultation with and to companies approved by (d) a further variant of (b) under which, in addition to the territorial concessions in (a) Ibn Saud would de granted full sovereignty only over the western half of the Desert Zone referre d to m (h h and subject to the servitude in respect of such area, referred to in (c) Solution (a) . 6. If we could secure our desiderata in return for the cession of territory advocated by the Resident (i.e. up to a line running due south from the head of the Dohat as Salwa to the 20th parallel, it would be the ideal. Ihn Saud is clearly already well established In its Northern portion, and the southern portion is inhospitable desert. Unluckily there is little chance of this. Qolonel Loch*s report, as the Government of India emphasise, makes it clear that the King exercise^ de facto sovereignty up to the Sakak-Mabak line; and considerations of prestige will make it difficult fo him to abandon his Akhwan colonies at either Sakak jfiabak. cA&lt;ujua&gt; The limit of protection (and of any oil concession) laid down by us in the case of Qatar is a running across the base of the c^.tar peninsula, i just/ X C&amp;asi- Ltb~A. •-X/KJAA. a5 aT\ 4^ Minute Paper.

Subject to it I suggest however that we should in any event be prepared to sacrifice Sakak: and to agree to a cession represented by a line running from the Qatar border immediately East of Sakak via the western side of Aqal and West of Banaiyan to the 20th parallel. If Sakak, important as it is, were the only obstacle to a general settlement of boundaries it would be well worth our while to suffer some inconvenience in Qatar. We have not formally told the sheikh of our proposed limit, and he does not himself claim Sakak, which appears to lie outside the boundary of the proposed concession. We can urge on the exploiting company (who are unlikely to exploit very actively) the importance of avoiding the border tract. Solution (b) : Desert Zone . 8. fhis would on a broad view be much the most satisfactory (the Government of India agree). It is unnecessary to examine it in detail, in view of the full discussion on it in the Middle East Coiunittee and the examination of it in the draft. A principal difficulty will probably be the securing of Saudi concurrence in the proposed sterilisation of the Desert Zone. Solution (c)/ 2956 6000 7/34TrTTulI sovereign SL^ ^TTh ject to ^servitudes' 9. This is a suggestion put forward in the Middle East cosmittee to meet the probable Saudi objection to sterilisation of mineral development of the Desert Zone area. 10. The Saudi position in the Central desert is far from certain or well-established, mile we could agrete to an extensive Desert zone in which neither party made any territorial claims, we should, I venture to think, be most unwise to concede the same area in full sovereignty (even if subject to a servitude) to Xbn Saud. We might however consider giving him the Western half of the Desert zone proposed in (b) above, subject to a servitude regarding the grant of concessions, if solution (b) seems impracticable? While such a solution would be much more generous than either the Government of India or the Resident contemplate, it would be well worth while to make a sacrifice in the central desert of an area our rights to vihich would probably be most difficult to establish in return for a formal agreed limitation to Ibn saud's encroachment. 11. The tactics of the negotiation must be primarily for the Minister and the Foreign Office. But both the Foreign Office and sir a* Ryan are anxioui to go very far to meet Ibn Saud, and a little inclined to underestimate the strength of our case. We might therefore urge that the Minister should in the first place (as recommended by the Government of India and the Resident) aim at making the Saudis ££low their hand before we show ours; and not adopt too accomodating a-4-l6pfrsitj6»B; that subject to this he should first offer/7 Minute Paper.

It may take some time to reach agreement between Departments on the various details involved and we must in particular give the service Departments an opportunity to consider the matter fully and to express their views. ( have asked the Air Ministry to start on this, with particular reference to the question whether in the last resort we can give Ibn Saud the Sakak-JVhbak- Jabrin line South of cottar, and they are working on it. The decision, however, is likely to be taken on political rather than on strategic grounds) . But there seems no reason why we should not authorise the Minister, if he has to go to Riyadh or to embark on further discussions in the immediate future with Fuad Hamza, in the first place to concentrate on obtaining a clearer definition of Ibn Saud*s desiderata and if these are merely stated in such general terms as a claim to the desert as distinct from the coastal tract, to adopt the attitude (at any rate for bargaining purposes in the earlier stages) that claims so extensive and so unfounded cannot possibly be considered by H.M.G. and that if there are to be negotiations they must proceed on a more realistic basis.

The valuable report contained in Colonel Loch’s letter of 12th December, C.963-la/38, shows the present position, so far as can be ascertained, in the northern part of the area in question. Ercm that report it appears: (a) that the Sheikh of Qatar regards a line running roughly from Salwa to the head of the Khor al Odeid as his southern boundary. Such a line is practically identical with that which has been recognised in the past by His Majesty’s Government as the southern boundary of the Sheikh’s territories (ccmpare India Office memorandum P. Z. 614/34: B. 430) , and it corresponds closely (save at Sakak) with the limit/ The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.2 . limit which has been accepted by His Majesty’s Government for the guarantee of protection which they were prepared to give the Sheikh in the event of his granting an oil concession in his State to a company approved by them. The statements made by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and his uncle as to the Western limits of the territory of Abu Dhabi are also sufficiently consistent with the acceptance of this line; (b) that the coast between Qatar and the tip of the Musandim Peninsula, definitely belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikhs; (c) that east of the Blue Line, Ibn Saud is A— locally regarded as holding the territory west 01 a line running Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin and in particular as holding Sakak and Mabak, where the A1 Murra, 'who are generally regarded as under Ibn Saud', have had settlements for the last 12 years; (d) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is not prepared to commit himself as to sovereignty in the area lying between the line Sakak-Mabak-Jabrin referred to in (c) and the western boundaries of Abu Dhabi descrioed in (e) below. While Jabrin lies well to the west oi tne Blue Line, any negotiations with Ibn Saud in which His Majesty’s Government take their stand on tne Blue Line must , of course, proceed on the basis tnat all territory lying to the west of that line is in the undoubted sovereignty of Ion Saud; (e) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi himself claims not only Aqal and the Sabhakhah al Matti with ius hinterland as far as Al Rimal, but the whole of tne hinterland to the east of the Sabhakhah al Matti as fan as/as Baraimi. It may Be noted that His Majesty’s Government have in the past formally recognised both the Sabhakhah al Matti and Aqal (with the Khor-al-Odeid) as forming part of the territories of Abu Dhabi (compare the Appendix to India Office memorandum P.Z. 614/34; 3.430). Prom the note on page 2 62 of Mr.Thomas’s ’’Arabia Felix” it appears that the northern boundary of Al Rimal in the region 51° East longitude may be fixed at Banaiyan. While to the east of that point the Sands continue northwards to the shores of the Persian Gulf., this area is not, according to Mr.Thomas, regarded as Al Rimal by those best acquainted with the Sands. The Sheikh admits that within the area between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi zakat has in recent years been from time to time collected from certain tribes on behalf of Ibn Saud. But it seems clear that in the case of the Bani Yas he has acquiesced in such payment only under protest and that there are special circumstances in the case of the Manasir. It seems unnecessary to attach any special importance to payments made to some extent in special circumstances by certain sub-sections of the seven tribes living in the neighbourhood of Baraimi, and the important point is that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi not only claims, but appears effectively to exercise a degree of jurisdiction in the hinterland, particularly in the Dhafrah and Liwa areas and as far East as Baraimi. (f) that despite the activities of his zakat collectors, there is nothing to show that Ibn Saudmmf mmSm 4. has ever established prescriptive rights of suzerainty, much less of sovereignty, over any part of the Trucial Coast between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Saraimi. 3. The question of the boundary in the south western area is primarily one for the Colonial Office. The Secretary of State notes, however, from Sir Bernard Reilly’s despatches to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, ho. 263 of 3rd October and lTo.296 of 14th November 1934, that the Resident is of opinion that, subject to the result of further enquiries which are being made locally, it would be desirable to claim the edge of the Sands a,s the northern boundary of the Hadramaut and to include in the Aden Protectorate on strategic as well as on political grounds a,ll territory lying to the south of the Empty Quarter and to the west of the boundaries of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. The information which has been collected places His Majesty's Government in a position to reach certain conclusions as to the maximum concessions in the area to the east of the Blue Line of the 1913/14 Conventions which could be made to Ibn Saud in return for a satisfactory settlement of the other points outstanding between the King and Kis Majesty’s Government. The Secretary of State agrees with the Government of India that the main objectives of His Majesty’s Government are: (a) to prevent Ibn Saud from extending his authority to the coast south of 0 ; atar or acquiring further influence over the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are in special treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government;5. (b) to prevent so far as possible the desert area adjoining the territory of those Sheikhs from being exploited under the aegis of Ibn Saud by foreign companies for oil or minerals. 5. The geogiaphical limits to be set to any concession to be made are examined in greater detail below. The first question for consideration is whether His Majesty's Government should aim at a settlement on the basis of: (a) a frontier based on tribal divisions; or (b) an arrangement providing for definite territorial limits to the dominions of Ibn Saud on the one hand and of the proteges of His Majesty’s Government on the other. 6. The Secretary of State, like the Government of India, is much attracted by the suggestion of a frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by Colonel Fowle and supported both by Colonel Dickson, whose great experience of Arabia must carry weight in a connection such as the present, and by the observations recorded by Mr.Bertram Thomas. He agrees with the Resident that there is much to be said against a geographical frontier laid down in a desert, and in practice an arbitrary line in a desolate area, sparsely peopled by a nomadic and primitive population, is open to many objections. But on a review of the position as a whole and in the light of the information now available, he agrees with the Government of India, that, for the reasons given in their telegram of 27th December, such a solution w r ould not appear best calculated to achieve the main/6 * main objectives referred to in paragraph 4 above. He is apprehensive, too, that were His Majesty’s Government in discussion with Ibn Saud to aim at a frontier based on tribal divisions, they might find it difficult, in the light of the information received from Colonel Loch as to the payment of zakat to Ibn Saud by individual tribes or sub-sections of tribes, to establish the position of their Arab clients as conclusively as they would wish, or to dispose effectively of Saudi claims which they might regard as devoid of any real foundation. 7. In these circumstances the Secretary of State feels that His Majesty’s Government have no option but to aim at a settlement on the basis of territorial boundaries. The main alternative solutions on this hypothesis are: (a) a relatively small territorial concession to Ibn Saud immediately to the east of the Blue Line. This concession might or might not be subject to the 'servitude” that no mineral or other concessions would be granted within it by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty’s Government and to a group approved both by His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government; (b) in addition to (a) the establishment of a desert zone, (within which neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty’s Government would exercise any territorial sovereignty or grant any concessions) on the general lines put forward in Mr.Rendel’s letter to Mr.Laithwaite of 7th November 1934; (c) in addition to (a) the cession to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty, either personal or territorial, but subject to the servitude referred to in (a), of a further area, much more restricted in size than the desert zone referred t o in (b). 8. The Secretary of State has closely examined the alternatives/9 / 7. alternatives discussed in the preceding paragraph. He is strongly of opinion that it is desirable from all points of view to reach a reasonable settlement of the matters now in issue and he agrees with the Government of India that , given the element of uncertainty as to the legal position of the Blue Line and the unquestioned, even though somewhat vague and precarious, influence exercised in certain areas to the east of it at the present time by Ibn Saud, it would be well worth making some concession to the King in return for an agreed limitation of his encroachments and a formal and binding agreement which would delimit the spheres of influence or control of the ruler of Saudi Arabia on the one hand and of His Majesty's Government and their protege's on the other. But he considers (and he trusts that Sir John Simon will /agree with him) that His Majesty’s Government should in the negotiations make the fullest play with the general strength of their position. He notes in particular the statement made by Sir A.Ryan in the Middle Bast Committee, which has carried much weight with him, that ”Ibn Saud was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of His Majesty’s Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the Blue Line”, and in forming his conclusions he has not overlooked the indications available to His Majesty's Government that the Saudi Government, strongly as they may feel about the Blue Line, do not feel entirely certain of their position in a dispute on this question with His Majesty’s Government.8 . 9. The Secretary of State suggests in these circumstances that His Majesty’s Minister might open his negotiations on the basis of a relatively small concession to Saudi Arabia immediately to the east of the Blue Line. The Government of India would be prepared to go as far as the line Sakak-Mabak, which corresponds to the a,rea within which Ibn Saud exercises sovereignty, and possibly also (cf.their telegram of 3rd Janus,ry) to cede a strip of territory running to the 20th parallel of latitude. Subject to the views of the Service Departments the Secretary of State would be prepared to recognise Saudi sovereignty within an area east of the Blue Line, bounded on the north by a line running from the head of the Dohat-as-Salwa to a point slightly to the south-east of Sakak, but leaving Sakak to Saudi Arabia; on the east by a line running from the extremity of the northern boundary just described by the north-western extremity of Aqal (Lorimer, II; 88/9) due south via, but west of Banaiyan, to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Rub’al nali. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that this would involve the abandonment of Sakak to Saudi Arabia, the acceptance of Saudi sovereignty up to the frontier of Qatar, and the attribution to Ibn Saud of the area between the line Sakak-Mabak-Blue Line and the western limits of Abu Dhabi to which his claim is at least doubtful. The latter area appears to be desert and of little real The position is different as regards Sakak/ importance.Sakak. The Air Council have in the past made it clear that they regard it as most important tha,t this place should be regarded as falling within the dominions of Qatar, so that it should be open to His Majesty’s Government to make use of it in connection with the protection which it is proposed to give to the Sheikh of Qatar in the event of his granting an oil concession to a company approved by His Majesty’s Government, and that they should be at liberty if necessary to pursue raiders across the Qatar protection limit. The strategic considerations involved in any relinquishment of Sakak to the King of Saudi Arabia are primarily matters for the Service Departments, who will no doubt independently express their views upon them. Subject to those views the Secretary of State is at this moment content to say that, while he recognises the desirability of including Sakak in the territories of a ruler under our control or in special treaty relations with us, he feels that the confirmation now received from the Gulf that Sakak and Mabak are locally regarded as being under Saudi . control and that the A1 Murra, who are in close relation with Ibn Saud, have been established at these points for at least 12 years, coupled with the information previously received as to the existence of Ikhwan colonies there, materially alters the position. He is in these circumstances disposed to think that thepotential inconvenience to which. His Majesty’s Government may he subjected in connection with the grant of protection to Qatar were Sakak to fall outside its limits would on the whole, from the political point of view, he a relatively small price to pay were it possible in return to secure the limitation of Ibn Baud’s encroachments elsewhere in the hinterland of the Trucial Goast. This is more particularly the case as it should be possible to demand retribution from Ibn Baud in the event of raids across the Qatar boundary from territory formally recognised as appertaining to him. Within any area so conceded the Secretary of State would on the whole be disposed to a,gree to the full exercise of sovereignty, including the right to grant concessions without prior consultation with His Majesty’s Government, by Ibn Saud. 10. If there seems no prospect of any settlement in return merely for the concessions discussed in the preceding paragraph His Majesty’s Minister might then be authorised to offer a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in Mr.Rendel’s letter, E.6769/279/91 of 7th November 1934, to Mr.Laithwaite. Under such a settlement, in addition to the territorial concessions to Ibn Baud/11. Saud in the country immediately to the east of the Blue Line referred to in paragraph 9, a special Desert Zone would be created, within which rights would be personal but not territorial. Within this zone neither Ibn Saud nor His Majesty’s Government (acting on behalf of their proteges) would possess any exclusive territorial rights and His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud alike would renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions and the establishment of permanent fortifications. Both parties would further undertake not to raise objections to the passage of each other’s aircraft. The Desert Zone would be subject to a special Desert re'gime to last in the first instance for a period of say, 10-20 years, subject to reconsideration at the end of that time at the instance of either of the High Contracting Parties. The regime would be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights at present effectively exercised by him over the nomadic tribes/tribes, such as the right to levy zakat. The Desert Zone would be established and the desert regime regulated by a formal agreement between the two High Contracting Parties. 11. The boundaries of any such Desert Zone might be defined by a line closely resembling that tentatively suggested in Mr.Rendel’s letter of 7th November 1934, referred to above. Such a line would run frcm a point immediately south of the Wells of Banaiyan east-south-east to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 22; thence due south to the intersection of Meridian 55 and Parallel 20; thence subject to the further observations of the Resident at Aden and the Secretary of State for the Colonies) along the edge of the Southern Sands to a point a given number of miles due north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramaut; from which point it would rej oin the boundary o± the territory to be recognised as belonging to Ibn Saud in full sovereignty. 12. Boundaries/12. Boundaries such as those suggested for the Desert Zone would represent a generous concession to Saudi aspirations. It will be remembered that Mr. philby, despite his special relations with the King and the fact that he was travelling under the protection of Ibn jriluwi and with guides provided by him, never penetrated east of the 52nd Meridian or south of the 19th parallel; and Mr. Bertram Thomas, in conversation, has not taken a serious view of Saudi claims or influence outside those limits. But on the assumption that the Desert regime would be merely one of renunciation of exclusive rights and that its establishment would therefore be without prejudice to the rights in it of the Sultan of Muscat Or the Trucial Sheixhs, the Secretary of State, in the interests of a friendly general settlement, and on tne understanding that the fullest play would be made with he concession represented, would be prepared to agree to he boundaries in question. A Desert Zone so defined, nd to the east, north and south of which all claims ox ,ny description were relinquished by Ibn Saud (His Majesty's Government for their part relinquishing claims ,n behalf of their proteges to the area lying to the ,est of it), would have the effect of keeping Saudi jretensions well away from the coast. The belt of territory between the boundary of the Desert Zone and the 3 ea coast would moreover be sufficiently deep to make it possible for His Majesty’s Government, should any question arise in future of granting oil concessions m the Trucial Sheikhdoms or in Muscat, to fix a limit such concessions which would leave between that limit and the border of the Desert Zone an area withm whichthe Royal Air Rorce, in discharge of any obligations for protection undertaken to the local ruler, would be at liberty, should occasion arise, to pursue and punish of this solution would involve sterilisation of mineral development in the wide area covered by the Desert Zone for a considerable time to come, and that sterilisation is not only likely to be unpalatable to Ibn Saud but may even in some ways be unsatisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government. So far, however, as His Majesty’s Government are concerned, the Secretary of State feels that they have more to gain than to lose by sterilisation. The political problems involved in any development of this area might be expected to be considerable; the difficulty, given the climatic and the local tribal conditions, of satisfactory or successful exploitation of such mineral wealth as it may contain is concerned, the Secretary of State .recognises that some difficulty may be experienced but hopes that it would act be beyond the power of His Majesty's Minister to persuade His Majesty to agree te such a solution. 14. If the Saudi Government are not prepared to accept the Desert Zone solution, which, on a broad view, appears to be much the most satisfactory from the point of view of His Majesty's Government, the Secretary of State, subject to the views of the interested Departments, would then beready, as a compromise, to concede m full territorial or personal sovereignty to Ibn Saud not only the area referred to in paragraph 9 above, but, m addition,, a further area, subject to the 'servitude' that (within that area no concessions would he granted hy Ihn Saud, save after consultation with His Majesty’s Government, and to a group approved hoth hy His Majesty’s Government and the Saudi Arabian Government. The further area in question might roughly he contained in a rectangle running from a point due south of Banaiyan to the 20th Parallel of Latitude; thence due east to the point marked as Gardam on Mr. Bertram Thomas’s map; thence due north to meet a line running due east from Banaiyan. Having regard to the uncertainty as to the Saudi position in the Central Desert and to the facts stated in paragraph 12 above, he does not consider uhat if there is to he any question of conceding territorial sovereignty to Ihn Saud any more extensive concession could he justified. The concessions suggested in this letter, and that now suggested in particular, are in fact substantially more generous than that recommended either hy the political Resident or the Government of India, and the Secretary of State feels justified in suggesting them only because of the great difficulties likely to he experienced in any exploitation Ox this area a nd the desirability of a general settlement. 15. in conclusion, I am to say that while the Secretary of State’s views as to the maximum concessions which could he made hy His Majesty's Government and the order of priority in which they should he considered are as set out above, he, like the Government of India, entirely agrees with Colonel Powle that 'before making any definite proposals to Ihn Saud', His Majesty s Government should 'extract from him a detailed statement of his claim east of present Blue Line and thus get hiB16. to put his cards on the table before we do”. As Sir John Simon is aware, incidental information goes to suggest that the Saudi Government are in considerable doubt as to the limits within which they should claim jurisdiction to the east of the Blue Line. His Majesty* s Government, in the Secretary of State’s view, are in a strong bargaining position and he things it desirable, given the importance of the issues under consideration, that the. fullest possible use should be made of this. 16. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that detailed consideration of the matters now under examination may take some little time and he is aware that His Majesty’s Minister, in view of the possibility that he may in the near future have to interview Ibn Saud personally, is f pressing for instructions. He would suggest in these circumstances that if it is impossible in the course of the next few days to reach agreement as to the detailed instructions to be sent to the Minister, Sir A* Kyan should be informed that instructions will be sent at the earliest possible date and advised for the moment to concentrate, in any discussions into which he may be obliged to enter, on obtaining a clearer indication than has hitherto been afforded of Ibn Baud's desiderata. If the King repeats that he lays claim to the desert as distinct from the coastal tracts, it would, in Sir Samuel Hoare's view, be desirable, at any rate as a urst move, to take the line that His Majesty's Government could not consider anything so extensive or so vaguely expressed and that while they are prepared, in the interests of friendly relations, to make some concession to Ibn Saud, they must insist that it shall be on It would, in his view, go far to prejudice/ reasonable lines.r* 17. prejudice the position of His Majesty’s Govermnent in any detailed negotiations that may follow if the Saudis, after the conversations which have passed, in which no hope has been held out to them of any extensive territorial concessions, were to conceive the idea that His majesty’s Government were in fact prepared to make very extensive concessions, even though in an uninhabited desert, in the interests of meeting them. 17.

Tne valuable report contained in Col. Loch*s letter of 12th December, C.963-l&lt;a£/38, shows the present fr. * * G/I. OOP'* S&amp;'' 4 '* tSoV-O V'O- -3 \tt a7 v ^ • V - “ * 0 G- 4 &gt; t’iOL position, so far as can be ascertained, in the northern part of thi^ area, From that report it appears: (a) that the sheikh of Qitar regards a line running roughly from Salwa to the head of the Khor al Odeid as his southern boundary, such a line is practically identical with that which has been recognised in the past by H.M.G. as the Southern boundary of the sheikh’s territories (compare 1.0. memorandum X P.Z.614/34: B.430), and it corresponds closely (save at Sakak) with the limit which has been accepted by H.M.G. for the guarantee of protection which they were, prepared to give the sheikh in the event of his granting an oil concession in his State to a company approved by them. The statements made by the sheikh of/a. of A'ou DHabi and his uncle as to the Western limits of the territory of Abu Qhahi are also^onsistent with the acceptance of this line; (b) that the coast between Qatar and the tip of the Musandim Peninsula definitely belongs to one or other of the Trucial Sheikhs;, (c) that east of the Blue Line, Ibn letJl) _____ Saud is, regarded Dhahi as holding the territory west of a line running sakak-lvabak-Jabrin and in particular as holding Sakak and iwabak, where the Al Mirra, 'who are generally regarded as under Ibn Saua”, have had settlements for the last 12 years; (d) that the sheikh of Abu Bbahi is not prepared to commit himself as to sovereignty in the area lying between the line sakak-iwabak-Jabrin referred to in (c) and the Western boundaries of Abu Bhabi described in (e) below. While Jabrin lies well to the West of the Blue Line, any negotiations with Ton Saud in which H.M.G. take their stand on the Blue Line must, of course, proceed on the basis that all territory lying to the West of that line is in the undoubted sovereignty of Ibn Saud; (e) that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi himself claims not only Aqal and the Sabhakhah al matti with its hinterland as far as Al Rimal, but the whole of the hinterland to the Bast of the Sabhakhah al Matti as far as Baraimi. It may be noted that H.M.G. have inin the past formally recognised doth the Sadhakhah al Matti and Aqal (with the Khor-al-Odeid) as forming part of the territories of Ahu Dhabi (compare the Appendix to I.O. memorandum, p.z.614/34; B.430). Prom the note on page 262 of Mr. Thomas's H Arabia Felix rt it appears that the Northern boundary of Al Rimal in the region 51° East longitude may be fixed at Banalyan. While to the East of that point the Sands continue northwards to the shores of the Persian Gulf, this area is not, according to Mr. Thomas, regarded as Al Rimal by those best acquainted with the Sands. The Sheikh admits that within the area between the Sabhakhah al Matti and Baraimi zakat has in recent years been from time to time collected from certain tribes on behalf of Ibn Saud. But it seems clear that in the case of the Bani Yas he has acquiesced in such payment only under protest and that there are special circumstances in the case of the Man&amp;sir. It seems unnecessary to attach any special importance to payments made to some extent in special circumstances by certain sub-sections of the seven tribes living in the neightbourhood of Baraimi, and the important point is that the Sheikh of Abu Ehabi not only claims, but appears effectively to exercise a degree of jurisdiction in the hinterland, particularly in the Dhafrah and Liwa areas and as far East as Baraimi. (f)/f 4. (f) that despite the activities of his zakat collectors, there is nothing to show that Ihn 3aud has ever established prescriptive rights of suzerainty, much less of sovereignty, over any part of the Trucial Coast between the Sabhakhah al Katti and Baraimi. 3. The question of the* SoiJith -Western portlnrr-^f^fchis area is primarily one for the Colonial Office* The Secretary of State notes, however, from sir Bernard Reilly's despatches to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, No.263 of 3rd October and No.296 te of 14th November 1934, that the Resident is of opinion that, subject to the result of further enquiries which are being made locally, it would be desirable to claim the edge a, tL of the Sanas as the^ boundary in-^fre-serath ana to include In the Aden Protectorate on strategic as well as on political grounds all territory lying to the .south of the Empty Quarter and to the/tfest of the boundaries of the sultan of Muscat. 4. The information which has been collected places H.M.G. in a position to reach ^conclusions as to the maximum concessions in the area to the fast of the It Blue Line of^ 1913/14 Conventions which coula be made to Ibn Baud in return for a satisfactory settlement of the other points outstanding between the King and H.M.G. The secretary of state agrees with/with the G-ovaraiient of India that the main objectives of H.M.G. are; (a) to prevent Ibn 3aud from extending his authority to the coast ^outh of Qatar or acquiring further influence over the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Trucial Coast, who are in special treaty relations with adjoining the territory of those sheikhs from being exploited under the aegis of Ibn saud by foreign companies for oil or to any concession to be made are examined in greater detail below. The first question for consideration is whether H.M.G. should aim at a settlement on the basis of; divisions; or (b) an arrangement providing for definite territorial limits to the dominions of Ibn Saud on the one hand and of the proteges of H.M.G. on the other. Government of India, is much attracted by the suggestion of a frontier based on tribal divisions such as is recommended by Col.Fowle and supported both by Col. Dickson, whose great experience of Arabia must carry weight in a connection such as the present, and by the observations recorded by Mr* Bertram Thomas. He agrees with the Resident that there is6. muck to be said against a geographical frontier laid down in a desert, and in practice an arbitrary line on-tho map in a desolate area,, sparsely peopled by a nomadic and primitive population, is open to many objections. But on a review of the position as a whole and in the light of the inf ormat ion fa va liable, he agrees with tne Government of India, that, for the reasons given in their telegram of 27th December, such a solution would not appear best calculated to achieve the main objectives referred to in para.4 above. He is apprehensive, too, that were H.M.G. in discussion with Ibn send to aim at a frontier based on tribal divisions, they might find it difficult, in the light of the information received from colonel Loch as to the payment of zakat to Ibn Baud by individual tribes or sub-sections of tribes, to establish the position of their Arab clients as conclusively asthey would wishjOr to dispose effectively of Saudi claims which they might regard as devoid of any real foundation. 7. In these circumstances the Secretary of State feels that H.M.G. have no option but to aim at a settlement on the basis of territorial boundaries. The main alternative solutions on this hypothesis are: (a)/7 , are: (a) a relatively sniall territorial concession to Itin 3aud immediately to the east of the Blue Line. This concession might or might not he subject to the servitude' that no^coneessions would he granted within it by ibn 3aua, save after consultation with H.M.G. and to a group approved both by and the Sauai Arabian Government; (t a-oolution rongblji 1 on bhe—geawal jrnres--ftf thu ouegystion-gej- a desert zone.

Subject to those views the secy, of State is at this moment content to say that, while he recognises the desirability of including Sakak in the territories of a ruler under our control or in special treaty relations with us, he feels that the confirmation a now received from the Gulf that these-points are locally regarded as being under Saudi control and that/11 . that the Al Murra, who are In close relation with Ibn 3aud, have been established at them for at least 12 years, coupled with the information previously received as to tiie existence of Ikhwan colonies &amp;L Sak^ik and Mhak, materially alters the position. He is in these circumstances disposed to think that the potential inconvenience to which H.M.G, may be subjected in connection with the grant of protection to Qatar were Sakak to fall outside ^ ttis limits of—Qatar would on the whole, from the political point of view, be a relatively small price to pay were it possible in return to secure the limitation of Ibn saud’s encroachments elsewhere in the hinterland of the Trueial Coast. This is more particularly the cast,as it should be possible to demand retribution from Ibn 3aud in the event of raids across the cottar boundary from territory formally recognised as appertaining to him. Within any area so conceded the Secretary of state would on the whole be disposed to agree to the full exercise of sovereignty, including the right to grant concessions without prior consultation with by Ibn Saud. 10. If there seems no prospect of any settlement in return merely for the concessions discussed in thepreceding paragraph H.M.Minister might then he authorised to offer a settlement on the hroad general lines suggested in November 1934, to Mr. Laithwaite. Uader such a settlement, territorial concessions to Ibn 5aud in the country immediately to the east of the created, within which rights would be personal but not territorial.

If the Saudi Government are not prepared to accept the Desert zone solution, which, on a broad view, appears to be much the most satisfactory from the point of view of H.M.G., the Secretary of State/State! would/be reaay, as a compromise, to concede in full territorial or personal sovereignty to Ibn saud not only the area : f cMtk referred to/r^ut, in addition, a further area, subject to the ^servitude' that within that area no concessions would be granted by Ibn Saud, save after consultation with and to a group approved both by and the Saudi Arabian Government, 'fhe further area in question might roughly be contained in a rectangle running from a point due south of Banaiyan to the 20th Parallel of Latitude; thence due east to the point marked as Gardam on Mr. Bertram Thomas r s map; thence aue north to meet a line running due east from Banaiyan. Having regard to the uncertainty as to the Saudi position in the Central Desert and to the facts stated in th-e-procoding - paragraph^Hie does not consider that if there is to be any question of conceding territorial sovereignty to Ibn saud any more extensive concession could be justified. The concession*new suggested is in fact i * substantially more generous than that recommended either by the Political Resident ‘dcm. the Government of India; and the Secretary of State feels justified in suggesting it only because of the great difficulties likely to be experienced in any exploitation of this area and the desirability of .ement. In/15 . In conclusion, I am to say that while the secretary of State's views as to the maximum concessions which coula he made hy and the order of priority in which they should he considered are as set out above, he, like the Government of India, entirely agrees with Colonel Fowls that '•before making any definite proposals to Ihn 3aud rt H.M.G. should “extract from him a detailed statement of his claim east of present Blue Line ana thus get him to put his cards on the table before we do”• As Sir John Simon is aware, incidental information goes to suggest that the Saudi Government are nert'-only in considerable aoubt as to the limits within which they oan with any pess-ibility-Qi—justifleatixm claim jurisdiction to the east of the Blue Line, but. also thaL the-^ing appre-eiatps the shock to his influence whiciL-sr^ definite territorial seirtTement^with H.M.G. in regard to^^tolnfcdr^Arabia may represent and tlmt-fie may well be by no means anxious H.M.G., in the Secretary of State’s view, are in a strong bargaining position and he thinks it desirable, given the importance of the issues under consideration, that the fullest possible use should be made of this. 16. Sir Samuel Hoare recognises that detailed consideration of the matters now under examination may take some little time and he is aware that H.M. Minister, in//P. in view of the possibility that he may in the near future have to interview Ibn s&amp;.ud personally, is pressing for instructions. He would suggest in these circumstances that if it is impossible in the course of the next few days to reach agreement as to the detailed instructions to be sent to the Minister, sir a« Hyan should be informed tnat instructions will be sent at the earliest ^possible me-ment and Advised for the moment to concentrate’on obtaining a clearer indication than has hitherto been afforded of Ibn Saud's desiderata. If the King repeats that he lays claim to the desert as distinct from the coastal tracts, it would, in sir Samuel Hoare’ , s view, be desirable, at any rate as a first move, to take the line that H.M.G. could not consider anything so extensive or so vaguely expressed and that while they are prepared, in the interests of friendly relations, to Giake some concession to h-su, they must insist that it shall be on reasonable lines. It would, in his view, go far to prejudice the position of H.M.G. in any detailed negotiations that may follow if the Saudis, after the conversations which have passed, in which no hope has been held out to them of any extensive territorial concessions, were to conceive the idea that H.M.G. were in fact prepared to make very extensive concessions, even though in an uninhabited desert, in the interestsof meeting them. 17/c»******^ ■ 17. copies of this letter are being sent to trie Departments represented on the Middle Dast Official Sub- Committee and to tne Secretary of tnat committee.UJS/JGS/DIA„ / /\ (X^A, IL&amp;-CJL ILH..E R Q £_£JLM,, Prom (COPIES CIRCULATED) of State for India.

Revised to 5th March 1934. India Office, P.Z. 614/34. Memo. B. 430. Tlie Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected .Problems. The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar wheie it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south m as to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer s Grazetteer m 19()5 — 0/ as running across the base of the ^ jl0r ' Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of 15 ° 6 ' Khor-al-’Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (а) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (б) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the intervening area. The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been' the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405. north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.* The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty’s Government Lor. II, 88- have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they 89 - have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-’Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. II, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of ’Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-’Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr. Lorimer’s “Persian Oulf Gazetteer.” The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running from Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer. For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al-’Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 75 9.34**r ■v 2 The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5. Discussion over the years 1911-13 between the Turkish Government and His Majesty’s Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two Conventions defining intei* alia the eastern limits of Turkish authority in Arabia. The Conventioi4| of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to it in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a blue line on the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island in the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. The text of the relevant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached to this Note. Its wording (“ une ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu’ile d’El Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ”) would justify the contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the western frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In the first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of His Majesty’s Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that they had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions in this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so far P.Z. 299/34. to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident’s telegram of 11th January 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interior of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now under consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance/ the position vis-a-vis Ibn Sand is to some extent compromised, as explained below, at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922. Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsula was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural, finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P. Cox to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes as the Eastern Limit of any Oil Concession in respect of Hasa. 6. One more incident of importance should be recorded before coming to the latest evidence as to the view held by the Sheikh of Qatar as to his southern boundary. The incident is that referred to in Colonel Dickson’s letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143, to the Political Resident, copies of which were received under the Political Resident’s express letter of_ 18th December 1933, No. 1934 S., when Sir P.Z. 180/34. Percy Cox, who was then High Commissioner for Iraq, in a discussion at Oqairin 1922 with Ibn Saud, then Sultan of Nejd, and Major Holmes, warned both the Sultan and Major Holmes that the Sultan could grant no concession, and Major Holmes receive none from him,^ in respect of the Principality of Qatar, and drew on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. Such a line, as will be seen from the map, excludes the whole Qatar Peninsula (and incidentally a substantial area lying to the west of the blue line m ^ e .^ n gta - -U Tr ld s li Convention). It also includes in Llasa an area to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. It should, however, be noted that while it constituted a definite indication of the High Commissioner’s view as to the eastern boundary of Hasa, it in no way specifically defined the boundaries of Qatar save in so far as Qatai might be regarded as marching with Hasa and Nejd, or might be i m q 1 as heen granted a western frontier bounded by the blue line of the 1913 Convention at the time when that Convention was concluded.** Buskire Memo. 9478 of 20th Dee. 1922.

Such a line would, of course, be quite inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line. It would equally give a very substantial extension to the boundaries of Qatar—an xtension of much more practical importance now than in 1922, when there was no question of active exploitation of the hinterland, and our concern was chiefly to maintain the independence of the sheikhdoms of the Arab littoral against Ibn Sand. The statement is, no doubt, an alternative version of Sir P. Cox’s warning to Ibn Saud as to the eastern boundary of any concession to be granted by him in respect of Hasa discussed in the preceding paragraph, of which an authoritative record based on personal knowledge is given in Colonel Dickson’s letter of 4th July 1933, No. 143. I.P.C. Map of February-March 1933. 8. The map compiled by the I.P.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in February-March 1933 marks a southern boundary line starting on the sea-coast immediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and 12 miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- south-east immediately south-east of Jabul-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles to Qalat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its left, through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point some 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-’Odeid inlet and not very far into the Naqiyan Sandhills, The A.P.O.C., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : “ The dotted line P.Z. 456/34. boundary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh’s version of the line. The I.P.C. report, however, is not definite about this.” The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to ope member (Haji A. F. Williamson) of the geological party which visited Qatar in February and March 1933, the southern boundary shown on their map was indicated by the Sheikh himself. If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen, will correspond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. 9. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above — (a) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-’Odeid and the district of ’Aqal; (b) that while His Majesty’s Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across the base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-’Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty’s Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Sand’s territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-al Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)), will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi ; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modifi cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below ; and it has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty’s Government may think it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh.Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to thg| north of the Khor-al-’Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turldsh Convention of 1913. Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain the blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Convention was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at the time between Turkey and His Majesty’s Government as to the limits of Turkish authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Saud as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably take our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent. The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of w^hich we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion w r ould clearly involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treaty relations with His Majesty’s Government he has formally lecognised, or of his establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to be embarrassing from our point of view. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundary of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in the present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Sand’s territory, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in the Trucial hinterland —c/. Sir P. Cox’s letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer rsome claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will be sought from the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on the part of Abu Dhabi in any area to the west of ’Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as belonging to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar ; or to regard it as a political no-man’s land. 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ibn Saud we could, if necessary, call upon him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition would not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the 1913 Convention, to the abandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to be strong, but would represent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders or Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. 14. If, on the other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatav } we should be justified in expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedouin activities within its limits. But such an attribution would not merely give to Qatar a substantial aiea which she does not m the past appear to have claimed, but would extend the limits of any liability for protection which we may undertake in connection with the grant of an oil concession. It might be necessary to claim the area (or at any late its coastal stup) for Qatar if there were serious signs of foreign interest in it or of an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it. But pending such developments it seems wiser to limit our commitments and to avoid any extension of the area recognised by us as Qatar.15. The decision to regard it as a political no-man s land would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day. As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al-Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain dlegiance to Ibn Sand, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rub-al-Khali further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler wdio could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate in ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Sand. Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area “possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning sand,” in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented “ to any considerable extent” only by “the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies ” (c/. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer’s Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 1 1' 40 7 ' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor-al-’Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a “rabia,” or guarantor, from the A1 Murra tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (?^Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, and the'third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them. 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Couvention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Sand and its beneficent results, and remarks: “ To-day peace, the peace of Bin Sand, prevails throughout the sands. The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Sand. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the_ other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason^ of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and th ev migrate thither, the tax-gatherers’ demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all cwear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime ol Riyadh, let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately and blood will flow again. ...” Mr. Thomas’s remarks may be comnared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area 1 and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced m section III of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 ' A 2 Lor. II, 892- 3. Arabia Felix, 216-7, 281. Arabia Felix, p. 245, footnote. Arabia Felix, pp. 271-2.6 The Barr-al-Qarah District. 18. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity of Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly, with the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the area lefi| to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes by Sir P. Cox in 1922 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his “ Empty Quarter ” is that the dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ikhwan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Note. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it “might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa”— in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might vmll have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. ^'Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following :— (a) Boundaries of Qatar .—To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea; on the south, a line running' across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.C, map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (b) The blue line oj the' 19.13 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, foi the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qavah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922,- referred to m paragraph 6, that His Majesty’s Government should either—’ (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded themselves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but without prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in return for a^ formal recognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this fine. Ihe attiibution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may be on other grounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of indeterminate territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without dimculty, as suggested in (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar as eginnmg at Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al-Qarah ends. WH it was thought preferable to make no concession in respect of Ue L-* ne ’ ^ ei1 ai T ue that informal discussions such as those of I9l2, which had never been confirmed in waiting or been the subject of formal agreement, had no binding effect, and that His Majesty’s. overnment took their stand on the blue line. Play might be made with ttie fact that the line drawn by Sir Percy Cox would, in fact, deprive Ibn baud of a substantial area lying between Djau-ed-Dukhan and the western side of the blue line. Gp. on this point paragraph 5 of the Note reproduced as Appendix IY to this Memorandum.7 (d) The ai ea lying between the blue line and the boundaries recognised for Qatar as in (a) above to be regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that no claim to them is made or could be substantiated west of Aqal by Abu Dhabi,_ as of indeterminate ownership. As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of the Barr al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small. If they do, on the principle that Ibn Saud has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trucial allies. (e) When once oil operations have started in Qatar, to convey a warning (if and when circumstances should make this appear advisable) through the Sheikh of Qatar to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in (d) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present enjoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using the indeterminate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until circumstances make this quite inevitable. The question of any communication in respect of Nejdi tribes (if any) using Qatar territory could equally be postponed unless and until circumstances may make it necessary to consider it. India Office, J. Gf. Laithwaite. 26th January 1934. [N.B ,—The conclusions suggested in paragraph 19 were accepted by the Government of India and the Political Resident in their telegrams Nos. 408 of 21st February and 244 of 27th February respectively. His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has suggested consideration of the desirability of leaving the boundaries of Qatar ‘‘undefined until the time comes to assert Blue Line principle” (Jedda Saving- telegram No. 8 of 14th February).] APPENDIX. Boundaries of Qatar. I—Extracts from Lorimer’s Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. fN.B. —Mr. Lorimer’s article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows :— “ On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak: thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north- east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-’Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never •clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-’Odaid, and as the Al-Thani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two8 • alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-’Odaid as belongingto Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watchp the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.” (ii) Khor-al- Odaid. In Vol. II, on page- 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-Odaid as “ an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme 'western end . it lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet. (iii) ’Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes ’Aqal as “a small littoral district at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaid on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on an average about 20 miles.” [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in ’Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland, Lor. II, 89. westward, from the foot of Khor-al-’Odaid.] “ On the landward side ’Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard ’Aqal as geographically included in Oman, wnich in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of the territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.” (iv) Abu Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under (i Abu Dhabi,' Mr. Lorimer remarks: “Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-’Odaid on the west —a distance of over 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended to the Bay of Umm-al-Ilul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved by the Government of India ; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that his jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-’Odaid, though the northern shore of that inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories. Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they may sumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba’-al-Khali.” (v) Barr-al-Qarah. Lorimer, II, 1482. “A coastal tract in Eastern Arabia which may perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa [itself, for the purposes of the Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913, included in the Ottoman Sandjak of Nejd]. It reaches from Ras-as-Sufairah on the north to the bottom of Dohat-as-Salw r a on the south, a distance of about 36 miles ; and inland it extends to a depth of about 12 miles. Upon the coast it meets Barr-al-’Oqair to the north and Qatar to the south of it; and inland, in all directions, it merges in the Jafurah desert. Some authorities would even make Barr-al-’Qarah a part of Jafurah. . . .” (vi) Jafurah. Lorimer, II, 892, describes the Jafurah desert as extending “ the whole way from the Hasa Oasis to the confines of Trucial Oman. ... In shape it is roughly triangular, with its apex on the north almost touching a line drawn between Hofuf and ’Oqair port, and its other corners (to the south-west and south-east) adjoining the Oasis of Jabrin and the southern extremity of Sabakhat Matti respectively. . . . On the east it is separated from the sea ” from north to south “ by Barr-al-’Qarah, Qatar, ’Aqal and Mijan ; on the south it is bounded by the Ruba-al-Khali. It may be added here that Jafurah encloses Jabrin upon the north and east and that, in the opinion of some,. Barr-al-’Qarah is a portion of Jafurah desert and not a separate tract.9 “ Jafurah differs from the waterless Ruba-al-Khali only in possessing a few wells of: very bitter water and a little scanty grazing; its surface consists of red and burning sand. “ The Ajman venture into the northern extremity of Jafurah, but the only tribe who Sequent it to any considerable extent are the hardy A1 Morrah and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from powerful enemies. . . . While sojourning in Jafurah the A1 Morrah as a rule drink nothing but the milk of their camels and even cook their rice in the same ; if compelled to swallow w r ater from the wells they first mix it with dried dates to make it more palatable. The Wahabis have frequently waged war upon the A1 Morrah, but Faisal alone, if local tradition is to be believed, succeeded in penetrating with his troops as far as Banaiyan, and his force was so reduced by the hardships of the desert march that he was compelled on his arrival there to grant the tribe exceedingly easy terms.” II. —Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 (unratified). El-Katr. Article 11. “ Le Sandjak Ottoman de Nedjd, dont la limite septentrionale est indiquee par la ligne de demarcation definie a I’article 7 de cette convention, se termine vers le sud au golfe faisant face a rile, de Zahnounie, qui appartient an dit Sandjak. Une ligne partant du fond extreme du dit golfe ira directement au Sud jusqu’au Ruba-al-Khali et separera le Nedjd de la presqu’ile d’El-Katr. Les limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue sur la carte annexee a la presente Convention (annexe VA). Le Gouvernement Imperial Ottoman ayant renonce a toutes ses reclamations concernant la presqu’ile d’El Katr, il est entendu entre les deux Gouvernemeuts que ladite presqu’ile sera, comme par le passe, gouvernee par le cheikh Djassim-bin-Sani et par ses successeurs. Le gouvernement de Sa Majeste Britannique declare qu il ne permettra pas au ckeikh de Bahraine de s’immiscer dans les aflaires interieures d El Katr, de porter atteinte a I’autonomie de ce pays, ou de 1’annexer.” [The blue line in question runs due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaknuniyeh Island to the 20th parallel of latitude, where it meets the line of demarcation between Turkish Arabia and the Aden Protectorate laid down under the Anglo-Turkish agreement of 3rd June 1914.] III.—Mr. Philby’s Journey of 1932. Mr. Philby in his crossing of the Ruba-al-Khali in 1932 passed through the Barr-ai-Qarah coastal belt with the assistance of Ibn Jiluwi and the Hasa authorities, turnino - south-west at Salwa and proceeding thence to the Jabiin Oasis. The following extract from his book “ The Empty Quarter ” is of interest, and supplements the evidence of Mr. Bertram Thomas as recorded in paragraphs 16-18 of the Note : — p. 28. “ Ali Jahman . . . rode far ahead gossiping about his experiences on a recent tax collecting expedition to the south-eastern districts along the frontier of Oman. ... I was interested to hear from him that Ibn Sa’ud’s influence is felt to-day in all the Dhahira country, as they call the tract westward of the Oman Massif, including, of course, Buraimi, a Wahhabi centre of long standing, and apparently even Ibn. Tnese tax collecting expeditions scarcely perhaps do more than pay the expenses involved in equipping and sending them out, but they do tend to spread the gospel of Wahhabi peace and Arabian unity. Slowly but surely the ripples of stable government broaden outwards from the centre and the Manasir may be counted to-day as subjects of Ibn Saud, who asks little of them but the acceptance of his sovereignty and the maintenance of his peace. ...” [JsJ'B. The Manasir tribe are concentrated in the Abu Dhabi area, ranging from Qatar to the Baraimi Oasis.] —Note of Discussion with Sir Percy Cox on 20th February 1934 on Question of Boundaries of Qatar. Consequent on the recent investigations into the southern boundary of Qatar r Percy Cox was good enough to come to the India Ofhce on 20th February to scuss the conversations reported in Colonej Dickson s despatch, Confidentia], No. 4th July, to have taken place between Sir Percy, Ibn Saud and Major Holmes in Dvember/December 1922.10 2. Sir Percjr Cox said that he had kept no private notes as to what passed at his meeting with Ibn Sand on the occasion in question. Anything he had reported or recorded on the subject would have been left on record at Baghdad; but to the best of his recollection and belief the facts and circumstances were as follows : — 3. The specific object with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, he §&amp; went to meet Ibn Saud at Ojair was to induce him to ratify the Mohammerah Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet Major Holmes or wmuld have occasion to express any opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar Peninsula; but learning from Major Holmes, and from the map that he produced, that he was endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Saud a concession for exploiting oil in an area which included the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes—and no doubt Ibn Saud also—that this could not be. If he had then been asked, as he doubtless must have been, w T hat he considered should be excluded, as constituting Qatar, Sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Resident in the Persian Gulf for many years, namely, that, on the east coast, Qatar’s boundary with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi’s territory was the head of the Khor-al-’Odaid, and on the west coast the head of Salwa Bay. This, in Sir Percy’s recollection, was the position recognised in the Bushire Residency and adopted hy Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy probably had the Gazetteer with him, but on the above point he would hardly have needed to consult it. In any case he is positive that the Anglo-Turkish Blue Line of 1913 was never mentioned, and is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentally and ex tempoi'e could not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Saud (December 1915) in which it figured as one of those to be “ hereafter determined.” Moreover, Sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ibn Saud and Major Holmes that His Majesty’s Government ought to be consulted before any concession was granted. 4. Sir Percy said that in these circumstances it seemed to him that Plis Majesty’s Government were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 1922 were concerned, to maintain against Ibn Saud the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as the eastern boundary of Nejd. 5. Sir Percy said he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the Sheikh of Qatar had ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of the Barr-al-Qarah coastal tract, between Zakhnuniyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that if occasion arose in the future for a compromise it wmuld be a reasonable course to assign to Ibn Saud, in view of his strong position at Ojair close .by, that length of coast line with its hinterland, up to the Blue Line. This would have the advantage of leaving no indeterminate area along the sea-coast. India Office, 27th February 1934. J. G. L.NO DISTRIBUTION , DecyDher. Sir A.

He, Shaikh Shakhbut, collects the ! ushr (one-tenth tax) on the palm trees of the Ban! Yas in Bh&amp;frah (including Liwah, where he keeps an agent for this purpose). Shaikh Shakhbut also collects a diving tax on all pearling boats, in which both Bani Yas and Manasir tribesmen are employed. (iv).

They put themselves under the aegis of B in Sa’ud in order to gain support against the Manasir and Bani Yas after hostilities in the time of Shaikh Hamdan bin Zaid of Abu Dhabi, who had previously recon ciled them.

It is stated that they do not pay zakat to Bin Sa'ud In the case of these seven tribes payment seems to depend on whether the saizakkis have penetrated as tar as ihraimi and on whether the tribes have thought it politic to pay. In about 1929 the mnzakkis were roughly handled and none have gone as far as Baraiad since that year. Shaikh Shakhbut explained that the reason why certain sub-sections of these tribes l^ld feakat was that they wished to obtain the support and countenance of Ibn Jiluwi in their feuds, so sent him presents and offered to pay zskat. sa/- G.

( ruad broached purely personal suggestion that further discussions might with advantage be conducted at Riadh some time in January but did not know ho* the King would view this. You will remember that when I saw King at Taif he himself foreshadowed inviting me to Riadh possibly after Ramadan which will end about January 6 th. s.t would be almost impossible from our point of view to conduct systematic negotiations in Riadh. I might perhaps transport essential archives but i could not easily take more than one Vice Consul besides interpreter and difficulties of telegraphic communication with London would probably be insuperable even if I could take cyphers. Cn the other hand general conversations during a short stay at Riadh might be a useful prelude to negotiations here. If they prove likely to succeed they might be completed herehere when the King comes in March for the pilgrimage. In any case I must have something definite to tell Fuad when he returns (? grp. omtd.) visit in the near future. It would help me greatly to know whether His Majesty’s Government are disposed to embark on comprehensive negotiations as recommended by me at any rate to start with, or would prefer to deal with the various (? questions) separately from the outset. I should simultaneously like to have some indication of their latest views on the principal questions in anticipation of detailed instructions and to know generally how far I can go with Fuad when we meet, If he brings firm invitation to go to Riadh I would propose subject to views of Secretary of State to accept it forthwith but to discourage any idea of systematic negotiations there on the grounds indicated above.&lt;/V^ . -,v AIR MINISTRY, A M-T 7 ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 19th December, 1934. I am sending you three copies of Bertram Thomas’ map. We could not make them the same size without considerable expense and the scale is now approximately 7 miles to the inch. If you want the exact scale I think we could get this for you. Perhaps, however, accuracy of scale is unimportant.
