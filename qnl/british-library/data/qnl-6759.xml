IN the month of June 1832 a revolt broke out at Djidda amongst a body of Albanian troops belonging to the Pasha of Egypt and under the command of Toorche Bilmer, one of his Mameluke favourites. Achmet Pasha was directed to put down the revolt, but at his approach Toorche Bilmer sailed to the south, took possessing of Mocha after a very slight resistance on the part of the adherents of the Imaum of Sennaa, and thence proceeded to invade the other parts of the Yemen, whose Sovereign, the Imaum Makdee of Sennaa had lately died leaving two brothers who were at this time contesting the Throne. Early in the year 1833 Mehemet Ali intimated to Colonel Campbell, then the British Consul- General in Egypt, that it was his desire to send an expedition to Mocha so soon as peace was finally re-established between himself and the Sultan, for the purpose of chastising Toorchd Bilmer and his rebellious followers, then in possession of a great portion of the Yemen, and preparing to march against Sennaa. The Pasha concluded by asking for the opinion of the British Government with eference to such an expedition. Colonel Campbell in communicating this request of Mehemet Ali to his own Government, stated his opinion that should the Pasha, in carrying out the objects above stated, succeed in conquering the Yemen, he would probably wish to attach it to the neighbouring Pashalick of the Hedjaz, with which pash ali ck Ibrahim Pasha had been invested by the Sultan after his conquest of the Wahabees. Mehe met Ali had already, by his possession of Egypt, possession of nearly the whole of the western shoit [121] Bof the Red Sea, and by that of the Hedjaz all the eastern coast belonged to him except the sma district round Mocha, which it therefore becam an object of importance for him to acquire and thus place both shores of the Red Sea under one power. P Tl only relations at this time existing between the Government of India and the districts of Arabia now referred to, were those of commercial inter course. The Indian Government had a native agent at Mocha, and had had concluded an agreement with the late Imaum of Sennaa,* fixing the duty to be charged upon British imports and exports as regarded his dominions, and securing protection for British subjects. If therefore the object of the Pasha was, as it professed to be, the destruction of the rebel chief and the protection of the Imaum, the position of the Indian Government as regarded this portion of Arabia remained unaltered ; but, in the event of the Pasha appropriating the territory thus brought within his power, it was not likely that he would prove less friendly to intercourse with India, than the former possessor, the Imaum of Sennaa,. had been. Colonel Campbell was accordingly instructed N ° 15i to give a favourable answer to the inquiry of Mehernet All as to the sentiments of the British Government concerning his proposed expedition. The Pasha had, however, not waited for the answer Colonel Campbell, No. 63; _ , . i l October 27, 1833. of the British Government; the expedition had proceeded ; and on Colonel Campbell communicat ing the answer he had been instructed to deliver, the Pasha excused himself by stating that he had been forced into immediate action by acts of aggres sion which the rebels had committed on the Hedjaz, and in consequence of their attacks on his commerce in the Red Sea.. He added that the Yemen was considered by the Sultan as forming a part of the pashaliek of the Hedjaz; and that he would take care that the possession of Mocha by him, Mehemet Ali, should not in any way militate against British interests, or against any agreement existing between the Government of India and the late Imaum of Sennaa; thus announcing his intention to take possession of the Yemen.

The Egyptian army, now commanded by Ibrahim Pasha the younger, a nephetv of Mehemet Ali’s, continued during the years 1835 and 18o6 its operations in the Yemen, in the course of which Ibrahim Pasha made himself master of Mocha, and of most of the sea port towns. The principal check experienced by him was from the Assir Aiabs, a Bedouin tribe inhabiting the country between Mecca and Sennaa. The Egyptian troops were frequently obliged to retire before them, and were defeated on several occasions with considerable loss, while hoAV- ever, the military operations of the Egyptian army were suspended for want of supplies, the Pasha’s troops Avere in actual possession of toe line of coast, and garrisoned the chief towns and ports on the eastern coast of the Red Sea, thus commanding the commerce of the A emeu. Information from various quarters meanwhile reached the British Government that it was the intention of Mehemet Ali, when he had achieved the subjugation of the Assir tribe, to send a force to occupy the town and fort of Aden, at that time under the rule of a marauding Sheik, who could make little or no resistance to his troops. In consequence of these reports, and of rumours of ulterior designs of Mehemet Ali’s upon Muscat and Bagdad, in the month of August 1837, Colonel Campbell was instructed to take an early opportunity to mention to the Pasha that reports had reached Her Majesty’s Government that His Highness Avas about to send a force to take possession of the shores at the entrance, and on the outside of the Red Sea ; and that movements of his troops were reported which would seem to indicate intentions on his part to extend his authority towards the Persian Gulf and the pashalick of Bagdad. Colonel Campbell was further directed to intimate to the lasha that such movements of his forces, or the execution of such intentions, would not be well looked upon in England or in India, and might give rise to dis cussions between him and the Biitish Goveinment. Colonel Campbell communicated accordingly with Boghos Bey, the Pasha’s Minister, who unequivocally4 denied the existence of any intentions on the part of his master of the nature attributed to him. It is here necessary to refer to the proceedings of the Indian authorities, with whose operations on the southern coast of Arabia the plans of the Pasha above adverted to were shortly to come into collision. In March 1837 the Government of Bombay Minute by Governor of Bombay; received information from the Superintendent of the March 1838 ' Indian Navy, from which it appeared that both the Arabian and Abyssinian coasts of the Gulf of Aden were becoming very unsafe, from the depredations committed on trading vessels, and that the Sultan of Aden had shown himself to be little better than a common marauder, permitting the plunder of ships driven on the coast, and, in some cases, sharing in the profits of these outrages. A case occurred in January 1837 which called Superintendent of Indian Navy to for immediate steps on the part of the Indian July'sT, ; Government to put a stop to this system. A Madras ship, the “Doria Dowlut,’ sailing under Colonel Campbell, No. 74 ; British colours, being wrecked on the coast of Aden, Decem ber 14, 1837. was plundered by the inhabitants of the town, and the crew shamefully ill-treated. The Government of Bombay on being made acquainted with this case, brought the facts of it to the knowledge of the Indian Government, request ing permission to call upon the Sultan of Aden for satisfaction for this outrage, and, in the event of its not being conceded, to enforce the demand for redress. The Government of Bombay subsequently followed this up by a proposal to the Court of Diiectors m Loudon, that they should be allowed immediately to take possession of the Port of Aden as a compensation for the insults offered by its Ruler to the British flag. Ofhet teasons combined with the necessity of obtaining reparation for the outrage on the “Doria Dowlut,’ to make the possession of Aden by the Indian Government at this time desirable. The establishment of a monthly communication by steam with the Red Sea, rendered it necessary to have a British station on the coast of Arabia; and the Port of Aden offered great advantages as a depot-for coals and as a naval and commercial station. The Governor-General of India, however, was of opinion that satisfaction should, in the first instance, Minute by Governor of Bombay ; August 14, 1837.

In compliance with this opinion of the Governor- General, Captain Haines of the Indian navy was directed to proceed to Aden tor the purpose of carrying out the objects desired. In consequence of a communication from Captain Haines that, in his opinion, the Sultan of Aden would willingly, and, on very favourable terms, make the place over to the British Government, the Governor of Bombay extended Captain Haines’ instructions by directing him to enter into terms with the Sultan for that purpose, subject to the confirmation of government. Captain Haines proceeded on his mission, and having completed its first object, namely, reparation in the case of the “ Doria Dowlut,” commenced a negotiation for the transfer of Aden to the British Government upon the payment of a certain sum of money. After a short delay, the Sultan made under his seal a formal cession of the town and promontory of Aden. Some difficulty arose as to the sum to be paid in compensation ; but subsequently the Sultan of Aden communicated verbally to Captain Haines that the sum was to he 8,700 dollars annually. It only remained for Captain Haines to deliver to the Sultan of Aden his bond for the performance on the part of his Government of the terms of the agieemenl, and for this purpose a meeting was arranged. Captain Haines, however, received pri vate information that it was intended to seize him and all the papers connected with his mission at the place of meeting, and therefore instead of attending the meeting wrote to the Sultan of Aden and to his son Hamed, reproaching them for their treachery, and acquainting them that he was on the point of departure for Bombay, to report these events to his Government, and reminding them that he possessed the bond, under the Sultan's seal and signature, for the transfer of the land and harbours required. Captain Haines, in order to avoid the chance of a collision with the Egyptian authorities at this time [121] Cengag ,d in operations in the Yemen, “mmunicated ^ , tohim Pasha March 20 and 22, 1838. “‘'bI*'*... « f- •' his superior officers. _ , . , by Colonel Campbell, No. 15 ; A copy of Captain Haines lettei was se J March 27 183 b A , , *i: : n a letter rn which Ibrahim Pasha to Viceroy ; Ibrahim Pasha to Mehe.net Ah m a iette ,br F a ebrmry 12 ,1838.

In com. municating these sentiments of Mehemet An to Colonel Campbell, Boghos Bey added that, in ms opinion, Aden was nnder the rule of the Imaum of Sennaa, but that, if it could he proved that it was not so dependent, the Pasha would contribute all in his newer to confirm its cession. b 1 r AToViompr Ali to Colonel Campbell, No. 21, Subsequently, a letter from Mehemet All to ^ ^ lg38 _ Boghos Bey was communicated by the latter to Dated Marc h 28, 1838. Colonel Campbell, in the course of which letter, after repeating that he had obtained the consent of the British Government to his Yemen expedition, he offered, if Aden were required by the British only as a coal depdt, to insure it to them for that purpose, after he had accomplished the subjugation of the country in which it was situated ( apies qu’on se rendra maitre de ce pays”). Mehemet All concluded this letter by stating that he would wait two months before ordering the retreat or advance of his army in the Yemen, in order to enable Colonel Campbell to receive instructions from England. It is to be observed, with reference to this letter of the Pasha, that it was not true that he had obtained the consent of the British Government to To Colonel Campbell, No. 15; . # May 12, 1838. expedition into the Yemen, prior to undertaking it,. It was true, as has been already seen, that in the year 1833 he had acquainted the British Govern ment that he wished to send a force to Mocha, notBoard of Directors Government: May 30, 1838. to Bomba y Bombay Government to Board Directors ; August 27, 1838. of Bombay Government to Governor- General ; June 5, 1838.

It was also true that Lord Palmerston had instructed Colonel Campbell to reply that the British Government saw no objection to the proposed expedition. But the Pasha did not wait for this reply, the expedition was sent off before the reply was received, and the answer of the British Government had therefore no share in causing it to be sent. The plan which had been proposed by the Govern ment of Bombay for the occupation of Aden had, in the meanwhile, been taken into consideration oy the authorities in England, and the Board of Directors in the East India Company informed the Govern ment of Bombay that it was their wish that Aden should be occupied without delay, notwithstanding the remonstrances of the Pasha of Egypt, and expressed an expectation that measures were alieady in progress to secure this important object. This was however not the case, as the Government of B 9 mbay had not felt itself at liberty to embark in this enterprise without the special sanction of the Governor-General, which his Lordship had declined to give further than by expressing an opinion as to the value of the position of Aden, and that the question was one which Her Majesty’s Government was called upon to pronounce judgment rather than the supreme Government of India. In accordance with the wishes of the Directors, the Government of Bombay, without waiting tor the previous instructions of the Governor-General, directed Captain Haines to proceed in the H. C. sloop “ Clive,” on a second mission to Aden, with a view to obtaining peaceably the fulfilment of the engagement entered into by the Sultan, but at the same time authorized him, in the event of the Sultan’s refusing to ratify the cession, to acquaint him that it was highly probable that a competent force would be immediately sent to take possession of Aden, and that the British Government would, in that case hold it without any acknowledgment or payment whatever, either to himself or family. Captain Haines was also directed, in his com munication with the neighbouring Arab tribes, not to touch on commerce or other topics that would excite8 the jealous feelings of the Pasha of Egypt, or possibly lead to embarrassing connections and obligations. In the event of Captain Haines finding Ibrahim Pasha in possession of Aden, he was informed that it would be his duty formally to declare that he, Ibrahim Pasha, was violating British territory, and that if he did not evacuate the place on that summons, knowing as he did, from the communica tion before made, that the place was ceded to the British, his remaining there would be at his peril. Captain Haines was further instructed to add that he was in possession of documents which showed that the English Ministry had declared to the Pasha of Bgypt that they would not allow his encroachments beyond the Straits of Bab-el-Mandel, and to warn Ibrahim Pasha that any act of his which might involve Egypt in hostilities with England, could not fail to draw upon him the displeasure of Mehemet All. Should this remonstrance fail of effect, Captain Haines was directed to send an officer with a copy of it, and a statement of all the circumstances, to Colonel Campbell, and to request that an immediate representation might be made to the Pasha of Egypt, and that orders which could admit of no question might be dispatched by His Highness, for the evacu ation of Aden by his troops. Captain Haines was, in the meanwhile, to avoid all communication with the Egyptian force, but to warn the Commander that all plunder or contributions levied on the town would be considered acts of aggression, and redress would be demanded accordingly. On his arrival at Aden Captain Haines found that Captain Haines to Uombay Go- town in the possession of a body of armed Bedouins, ^“er 6 and 7, 1838. commanded by Hamed, son of the Sultan of Aden ; Captain Haines to Colonel Camp- permission was refused to remove the British property November 13. 1838. recovered from the plunder of the “Dona Dowlut:” Colonel Campbell, No. 75; , j , , November 26, 1838. supplies of wood and water were denied to him, and an insulting letter was addressed to him by the son of the Sultan. Captain Haines, however, communicated with the Sultan of Aden, and endeavoured to complete the arrangements as to the amount of the annual sum to be paid for the transfer. His attempts were com pletely without success, and he was finally obliged to give notice that, if the place was not quietly transferred, agreeably to promise the Sultan and his family would not receive any compensation should9 Bombay Government to Captain Haines; December 2 and 21, 1838.

The Commander of the “ Clive ” was at the same time directed by Captain Haines to stop the entrance of provisions into the town, in retaliation for the refusal, on the part of the Sultan of Aden, to allow the ,£ Clive ” to provision herself in his terri tories. The Bombay Government, in consequence of these proceedings, determined, with the approval of the Governor-General and subsequently of the East India Directors, to support Captain Haines with a military and naval force. This force arrived on the 16th of January, 1839, at Aden, where, with the exception of a few days’ truce, a system of continued hostility and insult had been adopted by the native authorities and Bedouins towards Captain Haines and the British at Aden. Captain Haines, therefore, determined that there was no alternative left but to direct the military authorities to effect the capture of Aden, which w'as accordingly effected on the 19th of January, and Aden thus became a British Posses sion. The despatch from Colonel Campbell* communi cating the views of Mehemet Ali upon the proposed cession of Aden to the British Government, had, in * the meanwhile, been received in England, before the British Government had received intelligence of the events which bad thus been taking place at Aden. In reply to that despatch Colonel Campbell was informed that the Government bad, as yet, received no information on the subject, but that it was most probable that if the report of the cession of Aden proved to be true, the conduct of the Indian Government would be approved. With reference to the statement of Mebemet Ali that, in the event of the British Government taking possession of Aden, he must withdraw his army from the Yemen, Colonel Campbell was informed that Her Majesty’s Government were not aware that the occupation of that country by his troops, promoted any interest of Great Britain; and Colonel Campbell’s attention was particularly called to the fact that the operations of the Egyptian force in the Yemen were not, (as has been already explained!) undertaken after the * No. 15, of March 27, 1838.

And should the troops of Mehemet have occupied Aden, he was informed that the British Government expected that he would immediately withdraw them. Colonel Campbell had several communications Colonel Campbell, No. 38; with the Pasha upon this subject, in which Mehemet stated that it was his opinion that Aden formed part of the Yemen, which had formerly been attached to the Turkish Empire, and that he consequently hoped that the Indian Government would refrain from taking possession of it, repeating his promise that he would permit the use of Aden as a coal depot. The troops of Mehemet Ali had, at this period, o-ained iireat advantages over the Assir Arabs ; and Colonel Campbell referring to those advantages, Colonel Campbell, No. 39; stated that the Pasha now looked upon the affairs of Colonel Campbell, No. 43: the Yemen and Hedjaz as nearly terminated.

Colonel Campbell also ascertained from the Pasha that he had received from the Porte, about nine years back, a Pitman, authorizing him to take possession of the Yemen, which Firman had not hitherto been recalled. The army of Mehemet Ali was in the meantime making progress in the Yemen, and it soon became evident, as was suggested by the Bombay Govern ment, that, unless the progress of Mehemet Ah in the Yemen were stopped by a representation from the British Government which should have the effect of preventing his conquering Sennaa and the adjacent country, and which should thus secure for Aden a fair competition with Mocha in commercial intercourse with the interior of the Temen, the cession of Aden would he of little value to the British in a commercial point of view. Captain Haines described the country in the interior as in the possession of different independent chiefs, with whose territory neither the Egyptians or British had any right to interfere. If, however, the Egyptians had been permitted to persevere in carrying on their conquests, friendly communication with these chieftains on the part of the British, for commercial purposes, would have been out of the question, as the country would thus have fallen under the Egyptian yoke. Lord Ponsonby was therefore directed to inquire of the Porte whether the conquests which Mehemet Ali had made in Arabia and on the shores of the Persian Gulf had been made in accordance with the wishes of the Sultan, and in pursuance of any authority or instructions given by the Sultan to Mehemet Ali. Colonel Campbell was also instructed, if the reply made by the Porte to Lord Ponsonby warranted such a step, to state to Mehemet Ali, with reference to his rumoured expedition upon Bao-dad that the British Government could not pemiit him to establish his naval and military power on the shores of the Persian Gulf, and that, if he should persevere in such project, he must * With the yiew of shutting out the port of Aden from the with the interior—See letter from India Board of September 4, 1839. liiir12 expect that a British force would dispossess him from any naval station, at which he might attempt to place himself, on the Persian Gulf. With reference also to Mehemet AH’s proposed attack on the independence of the native chiefs around Aden, Colonel Campbell was directed to f^ 1 ’’ No ' 13; intimate to him, that it was the wish of Her Majesty’s Government that he should respect the independence of the native chiefs in the vicinity of Aden, and that any attempt on his part to subvert their authority would not be viewed with indifference by the British Government, and, in the month September, 1839, Colonel Campbell was also directed To Colonel Campbell, No. 32: to state to Mehemet Ah that Her Majesty s Govern ment wished him to withdraw his troops from the Yemen. Lord Palmerston, in his reply to the letter from To fndia. Board; 7 1 , September 13, 1839. the India Board communicating the suggestions of the Bombay Government before referred to, stated that, in his opinion, the Government of India need not be restrained in its dealings with the Chiefs of the Interior, or with the Imaum of Sennaa, by any consideration for xMehemet Ali, who had “ no right whatever oyer the countries governed by those rulers.” In the month of February, 1840, Captain Haines Colonel Hodges, No. 26; informed Colonel Hodges, who had succeeded I'ndia Board; Colonel Campbell as Consul-General at Alexandria, that Mehemet Ali had sent a secret mission to the Imaum of Sennaa, requesting him to drive the British out of Aden, and engaging on his side to return to him Taaz, and all the interior towns which he had taken from him in his late campaigns. In the event of the Imaum’s not complying with this request, the emissary of Mehemet Ali was instructed to invite him to surrender his dominions to Mehemet Ali, upon the latter engaging to pay him a yearly stipend. The result of this mission was that the Imaum declined to attack the English at Aden, but offered to surrender his dominions on the receipt of a very large pecuniary compensation. Ou the receipt of this intelligence, Colonel Hodges called upon the Pasha for an explanation. Mehemet Ali admitted that he had sent an emissary to the Imaum with a proposal to him to cede his dominions in return for a yearly allowance to be paid to him, but strenuously denied having made any proposition April 30, 1840.[1211 E Colonel Hodges, No. 45; May 21, 1S40.

In the course of the year 1840, the Egyptian troops evacuated Arabia: Ibrahim Pasha on leaving the country, left Mocha, and the neighbouring ports, in the possession of a person named Sheriff Hossein, on condition of his paying Mehemet Ali a yearly tribute of 90,000 German crowns This Chief has from the day of his appointment pursued a course of invariable hostility to British interests; but, as it ap pears that the Porte has recognized his appointment, the question as to his misconduct has been referred to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople.■ ( Hi ... ■ ■ rMemorandum. THREE questions of considerable importance at present depend upon the right of Sovereignty claimed by the Porte over the Yemen. These are: 1. The claim of the Porte,* under the Commercial Treaty of 1838, to a duty of 12 per cent, upon goods imported into Djidda, a Turkish Porte, from the Yemen, on the ground of the Yemen being a Turkish Province. 2. The question as to the reparation for the insults and injuries to which British interests have for some time past been subject, at the hands of the Sheriff of Mocha. 3. The right by which the British Government holds possession of Aden. If the right of Sovereignty over the Temen be conceded to the Porte, it' necessarily follows that the remen, being a Turkish Province, its produce exported by British merchants into a Turkish port, Djidda for instance, should pay the 12 per cent.; that Mocha being dejure as well as de facto a Turkish town, satisfaction for the misconduct of its Sheriff should be demanded from the Porte; and, that Aden forming a portion of the Yemen, and being consequently dependent on the Turkish Empire, is wrongly in the hands of the British Government, who have assumed possession of it in virtue of a Treaty concluded with a dependent power, which Treaty is therefore invalid. It therefore becomes important to determine the * * This is correctly stated from Sir S. Canning’s despatch But if the Yemen is Turkish, goods imported from thence into Djiddah, also Turkish, would he looked npon as articles of internal trade, and, as such, subject to such duties as would be paid by Ottoman subjects. It could only be on exportation from Djiddah that the question of 12 per cent, duty could be raised. The question appears to be whether the produce of the Yemen, exported from Djiddah, is to be considered Turkish produce or not. If the former, it would of course be liable to a 12 per cent .duty.nature and foundation of the claim of the Porte to Sovereignty over the Yemen, and the connection between the Yemen and the towns of Mocha and Aden, I.

Wahabites. ^ The account given by Malte Brun of the early Geogr., ome viii, p. 295. history of the Yemen, is as follows :—“ Soumis par Mahomet, et ensuite par Saladin, i’Yemen dependait des Sultans Mamelouks; en 1517 it fut menace 1517. d ; une invasion Ottomane, mais en 1630, le Sultan Amurath IV reconnut Sejid Khassen ib Mohammed pour Roi d’Yemen, en se reservant toutefois une suzerainty nominale.” The invasion in the year 1517, was one from Hammer, tome vi, p. 356. Hoossein, an Admiral of the Sultan Selim’s, who, when on his way to India to co-operate with the Mussulman Sovereigns of that country in the ex pulsion of the Portuguese invaders, attacked and caused the destruction of Aamer, the last Prince of the native dynasty of the Beni-Tahirs. The Sultan’s rule in the Yemen was further confirmed by Solyman Pasha, Governor of Egypt, Hammer, tome v, p. 302; vi, p. who was sent in the year 1538-39, to combine with the Cambayan forces in besieging Din which had been seized by the Portuguese. From this time the chief power in the Yemen, hough occasionally seized by usurpers, belonged to the Sultans, who appointed Governors.17 Hammer, tome vi, 1567. Ibid., vi, p. 379. 1570. 1587. Hammer, tome vii Ibid., tome ix, pp. 1633. Hammer, tome ix Geogr., tome viii, p- 366. In the year 1567 a great rebellion took place against the Ottoman rule (then represented by Hasan Pasha, Governor of Yemen), headed by Moutahker, Imaum of the Se’ids, who seized on Sennaa, Aden, Mocha, and the rest of the Yemen with the exception of Sebid. Sinan, Pasha of Egypt, was dispatched by the Porte to put down this rebellion, which he accom plished in May 1570, when he made a Treaty with Moutahker by which the Porte recovered her former . dominion in the Yemen. The Turkish rule continued in the Yemen till, in ■ the year 1587, during the reign of the Sultan ’ P- 204 - Murad III, Hasan, the then Governor of the Yemen, caused new troubles to arise by treacherously seizing, and sending to Constantinople, the Chiefs of the Se’ids. The sect of the Seids at once declared themselves independent, and tranquillity disappeared 98, 107, 202. in the Yemen. The Imaun of the Seids soon after this took the title of “Commander of the Faithful,” and attacked the Governor of the Yemen in Sennaa. At length, in the year 1633, and in the reign of Murad IV, a battle took place at Djanan between the Ottoman army under Kanssonbeg, who had been nominated Governor by the Porte, and the Imaum of the Seids. The battle ended unfavourably for the Turks; and, to conclude in the words of Hammer, ¥ “ desormais 1’Yemen fut livie sans defense h la , p. 206. domination des Seides.” It would appear from this sketch that the Turkish conquest of the Yemen, such as it was, commenced in 1517 ; that the Turkish rule was frequently disturbed by revolutions amongst the native inhabi tants of the conquered country, and amongst others by the Seids, whose hereditary chiefs are now the Imaums of Sennaa; and that that rule ended in the year 1633, since which time the Yemen has been under the rule of the Imaum of Sennaa, the Chief of p. 296. the Seids, whose Government Make Brun thus describes :—“ Le trone de PYemen est hereditaire. LTman, ou Emoi, y est independent, et ne reconnait aucun superieur ni spirituel ni temporel.” It is necessary then to inquire whether the cam paign of Ibrahim Pasha, the younger, in the Yemen, during the years 1833-40, can be regarded as establishing for the Porte a further title to the sovereignty over the Yemen. [121] FThat campaign originated, or P™' 0 ^ nate in friendly feelings on the part of the Paslra of Egypt towards the Imauro. Mehemet Ah profess^ lllmof Senl 7 , ^tl^dltC^n of the - Col-^P^ No. he aimed at uniting the Yemen to the Hedjaz to which it then appeared that the Sultan considered ,t rightfully belonged. The plans of the Pasha, however, were unsuccess- fuh and he was unable to complete the subjugation of ! the Yemen, The right of the Sultan to the possession of the Yemen was no more heard of. Mehemet AH entered into negotiations with the Imaum, offering the restitution of the places he had taken from him if he would drive the English from Aden: or. in the event of the Imaum s being unable or unwilling to effect that object, offering him a yearly stipend if he would give up his kingdom. A fair deduction from these facts is that the Porte’s right of sovereignty over the Yemen, which was the alleged justification of this attack upon the Imaum, was too untenable to be avowed at the outset, or to be maintained in the face of impedi ments such as those which induced Mehemet Ali to offer to buy for the Porte what he had maintained to be her rights. The British Government, early in the course of the expedition, expressed a disapproval of it, and See Abstract, pp. 13,47,57. treated the proceedings of Ibrahim Pasha, in the Vemen, as an occupation only. Mehemet Ali was warned that it was the wish of Her Majesty’s Government that he should respect the indepen dence of the native chiefs in the vicinity of Aden, and, in September 1839, he was told that the Ibid. p. 58. British Government wished him to withdraw his troops from the Yemen. Lord Palmerston, indeed, went so far as to state to the Board of Control that, in his opinion, the Government of India need not be restrained in its dealings with the Chiefs of the Interior, or with the Imaum of Sennaa, by any consideration for Mehemet Ali, who had “ no right whatever over the two countries governed by those Rulers.” The claim of sovereignty over the Yemen, which the Porte lias made, has, therefore, not as yet beenSee Abstract, p. 1.

See Appendices C and D to Sum mary in India Board letter of June 12, 1843. II. Sovereignty over Mocha. Mocha was in the possession of the adherents of the Imaum of Sannaa when it was seized by Toorchee Bihner, in the year 1832. It was taken in December 1833 by the Bedouins, instigated by the Pasha of Egypt. It subsequently eame into the hands of Ibrahim Pasha, by whom it was held till, on the evacuation of the Yemen by the troops of Mehemet Ah in 1840, Sheriff Hoossein was appointed to rule over it, on condition of his paying tiibute to the Pasha. This tribute has not been regularly paid.* The Imaum has since made various attempts to recover his lost territory. There seems no doubt that Mocha, and the adjacent ports of Hodeida and Zebid, did for merly belong to the Imaum. They are specially mentioned by Malte Brun as belonging to him. And that they were recognized as such by the Government of India is evident from the fact that, in the year 1820, the East India Company’s Factory at Mocha having been plundered by subjects of the local government, the Company’s ships blockaded the ports on the coast; and these hostilities Were terminated by a Treaty, dated January 15, 1821, between Captain Bruce and the Imaum of Sennaa. Mocha can therefore properly be considered only as belonging to the Imaum of Sennaa. III. Sovereignty over Aden. On Mehemet All’s being made acquainted with the British occupation of Aden, he stated to Colonel See Abstract, p. 49. Campbell that it was his opinion that Aden formed part of Yemen, and that he consequently hoped the British Government would refrain from taking possession of it. Aden certainly formed a portion of Yemen, which had formerly been subject to the Turkish rule. It is even twice mentioned as having been individually subjected to the Ottoman Dominion, namely, by * The nature of this appointment will be better understood from the fact that when EschrefF Bey was sent into the country to investigate the complaints against him, the Bey wrote to desire him to deliver up to the Government of Turkey the sea-port towns of Yemen, while Sheriff Hoossein defended his retention of them by stating that of right they belonged to the Imaum.20 Solyman Pasha, in 1539, and by Sinan Pasha, in Hammer, tome v, 302 ; vi, 360. 1569; but Aden became free from the Turkish yoke Ibiu -&gt; L ° nie V1 ’ P o76 ‘ at the same time that the Yemen emancipated itself under the guidance of the Chiefs of the Sei'ds. If, however, Aden remained under the rule of the Imaum, the arrangement for the cession of it con cluded by Captain Haines with its Sultan, without the sanction of its Sovereign, the Imaum, would not be valid. This was not the case. The Sultan of Aden was at least de facto independent of the Imaum. Aden had some time back declared itself independent. The “ Edinburgh Gazetteer ' , r i (1827) states between ! 730 and it is mentioned by Malte Brun, as one of the 1740 / “ petits Etats qui out brave la Puissance de ITman.” Tome vin, p. 301. Aden had also been treated before this by the British Government as an independent State. In the year 1802, Sir Home Popham bad made a See Colonel Campbell’s No. 21 , Convention with the Sovereign of Aden, in which be july^Ysss. 838 ’ ^ N ° 45 ' was treated as an independent ruler. In the year 1828 also, in consequence of a dispute between the See India Board letter of July 18, British Resident and the Imaum of Sennaa, it was ^38, at one time thought desirable that the Residence should be removed from Mocha out of the Imaum’s dominions. For this purpose, Colonel Hutchinson entered into a Convention with the Sovereign of Aden, arranging the terms on which the British Residency should be received at that place in the event of its being necessary to remove it from the dominions of the Imaum of Sennaa. In this Con vention the Sovereign of Aden was treated as an independent ruler, and addressed by the title of Sultan, and the Imaum of Sennaa did not contest his right to enter into such a Convention. It appears farther that, at the very time when Colonel Hn.chi„on Bombay Colonel Hutchinson was negotiating this Conven- Government, March 26, 1838. tion, the Turkish Government were also negotiating 't!‘ the Sultan of Aden for permission to erect a simdi ioit on the Eastern Bay, upon the conditions tnat they, the Lurks, should afford the Sultan of Aden assistance against his hostile neighbours, but that the possession of Aden and the exercise of civil and military authority should he reserved to him the r j urks merely having command of their fortress on the beach. On the arrival of Colonel Hutchin son, the Sultan of Aden made him a similar offer in favour of the British Government, which was, however, declined.Considering these facts, it appears that, in 1828, Aden was dealt with as being out of the do minions of the Imaum. That the Imaum did not protest against a Treaty concluded with its Ruler without his sanction, and that the Ruler of Aden then considered himself equally free to dispose of a portion of his territory to the British or to the Turkish Government. In other words, the Ruler of Aden was de facto independent of both the Imaum and the Turkish Empire. It does not appear that since the cession of Aden to the British Government any protest has been made by the Imaum against that cession ; at all events not at the time when he proposed to send a nephew of his as an Ambassador to Captain Haines, at Aden, for the purpose of negotiating a Treaty of Peace and Friendship with the British Government. The object of the above remarks has been to prove —1st, that the Turkish Sovereignty over the Yemen, if it ever existed de jure, has, at all events, fallen Into desuetude now for two centuries; 2ndly, tha£ the town of Mocha properly belongs to the Jmaum of Sennaa • and 3rdly, that at the time when Aden wa s ceded to the British Government its Sultan was de facto independent of the Imaum of Senri«a. A Treaty between the British Government and the l mau m of Sennaa, founded on these principles, would seem to offer some advantages. The Imaum should be called upon therein to recognize the cession of Aden to the British Government, and thus the chance of any future objection on the part of the Imaums of Sennaa would be obviated. The Imaum should also bind himself to secure free intercourse between Aden and the country in the interior, thus allowing to Aden, if not the exclusive traffic with the rich coffee districts of the interior, at least a fair competition with Mocha. On his side the Imaum miobt call upon the British Government to aid him i„ the recovery of Mocha and the other towns which have been taken from him by Ibrahim Pasha, and which are now in the possession of Sheriff Hoossem; and this would bring about the removal, now tor some time desired by Her Majesty’s Government, of this individual who has shown himself so hostile to British interests. [121] G22 . It may be objected to any such a * reeI ” e ' ^ g entered into by the British Government ^ Iniaum of Sennaa, that the anthontyof * Jor'e of Mocha, and its Sheriff, has been recognized by the Appeal which Sir Stratford Canning has been teeete to make to the Porte for the removal of the Shenft. That Appeal, founded upon a supposed de sovereignty of the Porte at Mocha, has completely failed as yet in producing the results desired y Her Majesty’s Government. While Sir Stratford Canning is assured at Constantinople that satisfaction shall be given for the wrongs inflicted on British subjects and British trade at Mocha, and while the Porte sends Commissioners to enforce its orders by the removal of the Sheriff, Sheriff Hoossein continues in his former course without any check or punish ment. The sovereignty of the Porte is therefore not even a ie facto sovereignty; and that being the case, the Appeal to the Porte made upon the supposition of the existence of such a sovereignty falls to the ground. It only remains then for the British Government tp have recourse to the Sovereign to whom belongs the de jure sovereignty over Mocna; and this argu ment would justify the insertion of a clause in a Treaty with the Imaum of Sennaa. of the nature above adverted to, by which the British Government should engage itself to co-operate with the Imaum in reducing Mocha, and its adjacent Ports, again under his authority.
