Later References.I showed the letter No:452 dated the 2nd Dhil Qadh 1351 (26th February 1933) to the Adviser to the Bahrain Govern ment (Mr.Beigrave) and asked if ne .Knew anything about the matter. 2. The Adviser was at first entirely puzzled oy the letier and then thought,as I did,that it was something to ao with the O previous letter dated the ^Oth Shawwal 1351 (15th Februaryi^BB) from Shaikh Abdullah ibn Jiluwi. un looking at it more closely ne said that ne knew about the case,that Abdullah Din Ahmad oin Abdul Rahman was a Bahrain subject and had cases in the Court ior some time as a Bahrain subject,but that he had recently gone across to Hasa in order to collect some divers who owed him money in connection with the settlement of nis case. It seems probable that Abdullah bin Ahmad bin Abdul Rahman put nim up to write to me on the ground that he was a foreigner. There may oe some colour in this as he haa relations in Darin. 3. The points about this letter seemed to be that,either we can take no notice of it,in which case later on Ibn Jiluwi may claim that Abdullah bin Ahamad Din Abdul Rahman was described as a loreigner (i.e.,of the people of Darin) and we aid not protest against the description; or (that we should point this out and so provoke a correspondence and cause a feud on tne subject of this man’s nationality. I thought,and the Adviser agreed,that the best thing was lor the Bahrain Government to continue to treat nim as their subject and to settle his case and that I should,lor the present, take no notice of the letter from Ibn Jiluwi. o* A copy of the letter from Ibn Jiluwi with ihe translation should be sent to the Adviser marked ’Confidential’ with the following memorandum. *\^JlsX*** - 8-3-1933.The above is from Abdulla bin Ahmed bin Abdur Bahman al Bin -ali, who brought a letter from Abdulla bin Jiluwi, Amir of Hasa.
