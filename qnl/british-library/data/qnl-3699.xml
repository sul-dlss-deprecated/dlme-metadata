Edwards informs Pelly that he replied suggesting that the cost could be debited from a surplus in the Bushire Residency funds for the previous year and asking if the accountant-general could write to Bombay as he will not be able to write to and receive a reply from Pelly in time.A postscript to the letter, dated 13 February 1870, encloses a letter for Mr Lucas in with the letter to Pelly. The letter to Mr Lucas is not enclosed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189687.0x000032#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
