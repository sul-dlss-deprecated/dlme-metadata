The file mostly consists of correspondence between the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat and the Political Residency in Bushire, which follows the Political Agent's recent discovery that the Sultan [Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd] had been planning a visit to Abu Thabi [Abu Dhabi] without his knowledge.All of the material is dated 1917, except for the final item in the file: a memorandum dated 30 September 1933, from the Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch), enclosing a copy of his recent speech to the Trucial Chiefs at Dibai [Dubai] on 23 September 1933.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Political Residency</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Foreign relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003e7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
