He said that he would go hawking in two or three days’ time, and would go straight on as he did not wish anyone to know of his intention before he had actually left. He left Kuwait during that night, and the next morning sent back for his retinue and iiafisi. At the same time he sent a message to shaikh Abdulla sallxn telling him that he had gone to Riyadh. I am told that His Highness himself proposed the visit to Bin ..aud, and that Bin ^aud sent a letter by a special messenger towards the end of Ramadhan expressing his acquiescence. 3.

His Highness has returned in good health, and more firmly believing in the Divine dight of Kings than ever before. However, there was a democratic touch for he, himself, drove the new Packard Bin naud had given him into Kuwait. Thare was a large concourse of people in the town square at the time of the Shaikh’s arrival, the most remarkable part of which was the large number of women in it. This crowd of women, veiled in blaox, baling drums and tfimbourines, waving cloaks in the air *nd hallowing was aost striking. There was also a well attended war-dance during the afternoon of the Arrival. 4. Besides the Packard, Bin Saud gave the Shaikh a Dodge and a Mercury i*&gt;rd, and it is rumoured a number of slaves also. He also gave him a wireless telephone which does not seem to work, hut it is being tinkered with. The Shaikh hopes to be able to talk to Bin Saud by means » Kon’ble Lieut-Colonel 0.0.

From the point of view of personal relations the visit seems to have gone off very well. 2. As for the business side, i fear that little was done; in fact both the Mng and the Shaikh denied that there had been any business discussions at all. Trott telegraphed to you as soon as he received them the King's latest reactions about 'musabala 11 and about a few other points on which the two sides have not yet come to terms* and nothing further can be done until your instructions on those points reach me. One result of this delay iwhich is inevitable) is that both sides seem to be putting the blame for the delay on His Majesty's Government and i fear de Gaury was made to look rather foolish though no fault of his own. The two rulers now say *JMow we are such friends we must seal our friendship by fixing up those three agreements, if only the British willlet us'. 1 hope that it may be possible to l satisfy that admirable aspiration soon. 3 # I am sending copies of this letter to Bagdad and Bushire• lours ever, sd. K.H.W.Stonehewer-Bird/ i /V Encloeure to Mr•Stonehewer-Bird*s letter Ho.72/1182/3 of January 12th, 1940. Copy of letter from Captain de Gaury dated Riyadh December 22nd.,1939, to Mr.Trott. The often deferred visit of the Shaikh of Kuwait, when, this month, it at last took place, was a long one from December 1st to the 20th. it seemed to be a great success, although at one moment, near the end of the visit, the Shaikh did complain to me that life in Riyadh was 'Prison'* - that it lacked 'society' and 'amusement'# This however may have been an attempt to draw me into criticising Riyadh, which i avoided, or to make me praise Kuwait's amenities. Everything to please the Shaikh which could be done was done. The King and Court went quite a long way out to meet the Shaikh on the day of his arrival. He was installed in the new guest quarters of the new Murabba Palane. There were dinner parties every night and several banquets, for a hundred people or more • He accompanied the King to the town Palace every day and sat v/ith him while he hfcld audiences. They spent most after- noons motoring together and went for a few days to the new agricultural development at KHARJ, south-east of Riyadh. Both the King and the Shaikh attacked me separately about the Kuwait agreements, his Majesty’s Government were very slow about these agreements. That there was no agree ment to be made public, now that they had both met on such cordial terms, would be difficult to explain away, it would be obvious that the delays came from His Majesty's Government»-2~ i was several times asked if i would like to see the Mng quite alone - without Shaikh Ahmed - or did i wish to see Shaikh Ahmed alone ? Near the end of the visit both separately informed that they had not discussed 'business^with the other J After the banquet on the i9th - as 1 was leaving the Palace - Shaikh xusuf, the King*s political secretary, drew me aside • into a deserted half-lit reception room - and asked me if, even at this eleventh hour, there was not the opportunity of speaking about the Kuwait agreements? Had i nothing to say? The responsibility was mine, if i was silent* i repeated that 1 had had no new material or instructions* The King and several of his sons accompanied Shaikh Ahmed on the day of his departure as far as Ma’aizila, about forty minutes by car from Riyadh, where there was a 'picnic* lunch for about eighty people* Shaikh Ahmed's presents from the King included a Cadillac, a Buick, a ?ord, a box Ford and a Ford lorry, arms, clothes, four young negresses and a wireless telephone* His brother Hamoud received a car and tv/o negresses, and a deadly looking automatic rifle from the Amir Saud* a! Nafisi, the Saudi Agent in Kuwait, received a car and negress lHe is about 70)* Incidentally he complained to the King, at Ma*aizila, about lack of spare parts and good tubes with his gift car. His Majesty sent for the driver and called for a rifle* He unloade&lt; the rifle, winked at those in the tent, and stalking over to the door suddenly appeared there aiming at his waiting driver* i have never seen a man run so quickly. He was back from Riyadh with new spares and tyres within an incredibly short times / TheThe King several times asked Shaikh Ahmed why he had not brought with him Shaikh Ali al Khalifa, his cousin, who plays a prominent part in the control of Kuwait, and who is doubtless more companionable to him than Shaikh -ahmed* On leaving one of the dinner parties he said to the Shaikh's servants, before the Shaikh 'There is no good in you' 'Why did you come without Ali al Khalifa*• Shaikh Ahmed looked put out. Before the visit the Mng had one day begun to at give me his opinion of Shaikh Ahmed, i-t was not^all flatter ing, and he had called him a bad politician and said he was •difficult', nevertheless v/hile here they seemed to get on remarkably well, and on first meeting the King appeared really well pleased; swinging round to me he said *1 have got him for you at last', in fact, whatever their private thoughts, the visit must be accounted a successful one.1 •£•1001/40 noXo«ur« to Ur* Xotter o.TB/XXSS/S of January X^ th 9 X940 # Copy of Xrtter from Captain d • Oaury dated Riyadh ? eoorobor nd, X929 9 to Ur. arott. fho oftan d oforrad vioit of tha Shoikh of i c%eit # when thiit mnthp it at Xaot t( ok pXaoo 9 a oji a lon^r ona froa ^aoor^ar Xot 9 to the £ 0 th« It aoemcd to he a great aucoeae, aXthough at ona Element f near the; end of tho Tiai t f the lioikh did eompX&amp;in to aa that Xifa ir.

''i ear .Sir Seoffrey, In the way that he has of mentioning on social occasions matters having official content His Highness recently spoke at a dinner party going to Iran for a holiday this suiamer* He particularly mentioned Shiraz. In reply I dwelt upon the practical difficulties of travel and the lack of facilities. J^\ / 2. He later dropped hints to Scott who, without acknowledging receipt oftfifea uo the Shaikh, discussed th*? matter with me and said that he was contemplating offering him the use of one of the Comp6ny f s planes to get him there. 3* he agreed that, on his return to Abadan, Scott should ask Pattinson'a pex-mission to offer the plane; and also that he should ask Dr. McClean, the Company’s heart specialist who attended the Hhaikh, whether the' Shaikh’s heart could safely standi flyiit'* at the height necessary to reach the Plateau. \ 4. I undertook to consult Dr. Hykerk on the same point - hoping to be able to .scotch the whole project on medical \ grounds. Dr. Hykerk, however, thought his heart could well stand the flight and Dr. EoClean confirmed this. Mr. patdlnson also agreed to provide a plane. v K 5. His Highness was not informed of these developments but yesterday he asked me more directly whether there would be any political objection to his visiting Iran, or whether \ It would be preferable for him to go elsewhere. He mentioned ,X India as an alternative. I showed no enthusiasm for his visiting Iran but said that I would refer It to you. I 6. He seemed much keener on the idee of going to Iran than to India but - euite apart from the nuisance of. having him on top of you in Shiraz - I take it such a visit would not be without political complications. ?• He has probably been put to this by some of the* young men around him - notably Izzat Jafar - to give, them an excuse for a holiday also.

Although he realised that shortages etc. would not affect him he said lie ’Miked to see people looking happy'. 3. In view of the above perhaps I might again ask him whether he would prefer an invitation this year or next.

There is no objection to your sounding the Shaikh as you proppse.

The best time^ would probably be round about the second week in July.

Shaikh Ahmed arrived here on the 30th Nay. He did not call either on the Residency or the Political Agency. On the 2nd June I wrote asking him to come and see me about important business (viz. the documents received about Kubbar etc. and issue of proclamation about the sea-bed), and received a reply that he could not interfere with the pro gramme arranged for him by Shaikh Salman. I enclose English copies of the letters exchanged. I am naturally extremely annoyed over this matter, but after due consideration have decided not to continue the correspondence with Shaikh Ahmed largely because I am not quite sure what sanctions we could impose should I threaten action in the event of his failure to make amends. It is possible that the Shaikh (bay be annoyed because no British officer met him on arrival though he has not mentioned this to anybody so far as I am aware. I understand that when he last came to Bahrain you were the Political Agent at the time and met him at the customs pier, but circum stances were different as he was just passing through and not making a long stay. Had I thought of it I might perhaps have sent Andrew to meet him on arrival but I did not think of this nor did Shaikh Salman suggest it. If you see no objection, when the Shaikh returns to Kuwait I should be grateful if you would take an early opportunity of seeing him and expressing my surprise, displeasure, annoyance or whatever you think best over his attitude. During my visit to Kuwaitjas proposed in the latter half of the month, I think I should probably confine my intercourse with him to an ex change of calls. I should be grateful for any comments or suggestions you may have to make. / G.N.

THE POLITICAL AGENCY, KUWAIT. CONFIDENTIAL Please refer to your telegram No.179 of the 24th June, 1949. 2. Before I can recommend what attitude should be adopted towards His Highness the extent of his misderrea- nour must be assessed; and we have to consider what, if anything, is behind it. 3 . He claims that his visit to Bahrain was a private friendly visit to Shaikh Sulman. He had given me to understand this and had, indeed, only mentioned casually in conversation that he was going to Bahrain at all. It is possible (because the Persian Gulf Residency was for so long in Bushire where there might have been difficulties put in their way by the Persians) that the^e are no prece dents for Gulf Rulers visiting the Resident in his head- Quarters; but there may be precedents for their visiting him while on tour in Bahrain. There is nothirg particu larly relevant on record here, although Cox’s letter No. 2578 of 1906 dated the 28th October, 1906 and its enclo sures might interest you. We have advanced a long way since then. Incidentally, Box, who must have had a lot to do with the establishment of practice in the Gulf, had his introduction to political practice in the Gujarat States, which - like Kathiawar - were at that time under the Governor of Bombay. 4. In case there is nothing on record in Bahrain, it may be well to consider what was done in India. As you know, it was the practice in certain Resi dencies in the Indian States, when a Ruler visited the Resident^ headquarters officially, for the Ruler to be met on arrival at the Railway Station by the Resident’s Secaetary or Under Secretary, who conaucted him to his house. The Ruler later called on the Resident who returned his call. Certain Rulers had claimed that they should be met on arrival by the Resident himself, and that the Resident should pay the first call on them; but this was not admitted. In some Residencies, other political officers present at headquarters were expected to call on the Ruler. I enclose relevant extracts from Webb’s ’Political Practice in Kathiawar* published in 1923. Details of the procedure had been modified by 1946 when I was there; but the essentials remained t^e same. Rulers visiting Rajkot did not Invambly call on the Resi dent - some of them had houses there and came quite often -; but it was considered ill-mannered if they did not call from time to time. 6./ H.E. Sir Rupert Hay, KCIE.,CSI., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.EXTRACT FROM WEBB*S 'POLITICAL PRACTICE IN KATHIAWAR' (published in 1923) Ceremonies to be observed on the occasion of Interchanging of visits between Chiefs of Kathiawar and the Agent to the Governor^ Kathiawar (a) Reception on arrival of Chiefs Rajkot of Classes I to IV in The formalities with which Chiefs are received in Rajkot vary according as they come in by special invi tations to attend a Darbar or a public function, etc.,/of £ their own accord. In the first case the reception will usually be given as follows: or 1st Class Chiefs (13 to 11 gun salutes) The Agent to the Governor will depute one ofhis Assistants to meet each Chief at the Railway Station, or at the usual place on road (if coming by road) and conduct him to his residence. The Officer so deputed will start from the Kothi with an escort of 8 Cavalry Sowars or 16 Police Sowars, a Guard of Honour will be drawn up at the camp of the Chief and will present arms on his arrival. NOTE. Some of the First Class Chiefs have contended that the Agent to the Governor himself should go to meet the Chief but this contention was overruled by Government (vide Government Resolution No.1896, dated the 19th March,1895). The salute to which each of the Chiefs is entitled will be fired (if guns are available) either on the arrival of the Chief at the Railway Station or as he passes the Kothi according to a special programme which will be drawn up by the Agent to the Governor on each occasion. NOTE.—Some of the First Class Chiefs have contended that the Agent to the Governor should pay a first visit to the Chief at the Head Quarters Station of the Agent to the Governor; but this is against the standing custom. Apart from this it is to be borne in mind that the Agent to the Governor represents the British Government. Courtesies to be shown by Agency Of ficers to Chiefs ..visiting Rajkot In this connection the Agent to the Governor, Kathiawar, by his Confidential letter No.C/51 dated the 14th June, 1910, expressed his wishes in the following terms t 'The Agent to the Governor desires to indicate to Political Officers that, when any Chief of the 1st or 2nd Class visits Rajkot, whether at his own Uttara or at the Residency, it would be a good thing that all Political Officers present in Rajkot should make it a practice to pay an informal call upon him. 'Some Chiefs are very punctilious and pay calls on Political Officers at once. It is a matter, however, in regard to which there Is no rule of etiQuette and the Agent to the Governor hopes that the call on the Chiefs will, in future, be regularly and promptly paid whatever the practice may have been in the past. As the/..•• -*?*• - 2 - As the terms of the above Circular were somewhat ambigious, a supplementary Circular No.C/53 dated the 16th June, 1910, was issued to the following effect! 'Doubts having been expressed as to whether the calls on Chiefs, referred in Circular No.C/51 dated the 14th instant, should be official or private, the Agent to the Governor desires to explain that thi? should depend on whether a Chiefs visit to Rajkot is ceremonial or private.

I shall probably be discussing the case while I an at home and it is possible that the foreign Office will agree with you and not with me. 3. I find it very difficult in this case to distinguish between personal and official resentment. I do not at present feel inclined to call the case settled until the Shaikh has made some amends to me personally. What I have in mind at present is to pay a visit to Kuwait soon after/my return from the United Kingdom and while you ardstill there in the hope that he will of his own accord offer me some .^kind of explanation^or apology which I can accept, whether you or anybody else can induce him to do this I do not know. I have in mind something in the nature of a personal reconciliation through a third ’-arty in Arab style. 4. Until the case is settled I do not feel inclined to lay do?m anything about procedure for the future. It is in any case likely that with the frequent change of incumbents in the Gulf any rules that may be prescribed on the subject wall be buried in the' records and forgotten.Telegram En Clair.

(141/19/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 19th July, 1949. &gt; Dear Burrows, In my despatch No.49 of the 15th June, I reported the failure of the Shaikh of Kuwait to call on me during his visit to Bahrain in May - June and his refusal to come and see me to discuss business. I asked Jackson to obtain his explana tion and I forward a copy of the report received from him. You will see that the Shaikh expected me to call on him or at least to send one of my Secretaries to call on him. The Shaikh was on a private visit and it did not even occur to me that I should send a Secretary to call on him and I expec ted to receive a visit from one of his entourage to fix up a time for him to call on me. When he failed to call, en quiries were made from both the Shaikh of 'aurain and Delgrave regarding the reason for his attitude and they said tuat they knew of no explanation but that they did not consider they could interfere. If Shaikh Ahmed had really felt him self affronted it would have been quite easy for him to have Idropped a hint to Shaikh Salman or jtelgraye and the matter i could probably have been satisfactorily settled. The grounds given for his refusal of my request to him to come and see me on business that his programme was full was frivolous as the programme could quite easily have been adjusted, uacttson thinks that he was guided in his actions by his Syrian A.D.C. Izzat Jaffar and that if his Secretary, Abdulla Mulla had been with him he would have adopted a different attitude. 2. After receiving Jackson’s letter enclosed, I asked him what attitude he recommended we should adopt to Shaikh Ahmed as a result of his behaviour in Bahrain. He has replied that the Shaikh since his return has been exceptionally co-opera tive, which is true, and he deprecates anything in the nature of reprisals. He has suggested that I should write to the Shaikh disposing of his claim to receive a call from the Poli tical Resident first and al so of hi s claim to be jne t Jayone of his Secretaries, and continuing, that I expected as oetween friends“a private call which I would have gladly returned; that it is the wish of His Majesty’s Government and my personal wish to honour him and maintain his dignity in every possible way. that I cannot but doubt that it was his wish to recip rocate in this respect; that it was publicly discourteous to His Majesty’s Government’s representative and to me personally to visit so many people in Bahrain without visiting me; that such conduct in one usually so punctilious and so well-mannered has surprised me and I consider it unworthy of him and damaging to his good name. Jackson recommends that after having done this we should regard the incident as closed. 3. The Shaikh’s attitude was due in my opinion partly to his own swollen head and partly due to bad advice, but his ar ed rudeness to His Majesty's Government’s representative has caused comment up and down the Gulf and at present I am doubtful if we can allow the incident to be closed so easily and quickly /as I B.A.B. Burrows, Esq., Foreign Office, London. 1.# - 2 - as Jackson recommends. I feel inclined mywlf to do nothin* until my next visit to Kuwait which will ^^/matter ..a'j:ir nt-lT ti iiiVl the autumn. I do not propose to bring the matter ^’mvself then, but if the Shaikh of his own accord says any th! re which can be regarded In the nature of an apology we can reK ard the matter as closed. If, however, he does nothing ^ of 8 thls sort, I think we should continue to remember the case •'palnst him until he makes amends or circumstances make 1 oolitic to forget it. I do not suggest any active reprisal but only that his behaviour should be borne in mind when he request's any favour from us. 3. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to Jackson. Vr\nT*c OirfiT* . A.D.H. BIVAR (W.R. HAY) For Political Resident in the Persian Gulfe3 COKFIDENTI (890/1/49) British Embassy, B4DMD 25th July, 1949 Dear Department, . Dr. Jamali has told the Charge ^ A £ iaire f t ^? t he is proposing that the Regent oi Iiaq should issue an invitation to the Sheikh °i Kuwait this autumn to visit Bagdad officially, Z 116 S* 16 *** 1 should be given a decoration vmile he is here. No decision has yet been taken. Since H.M.G. conduct the Sheikas xoreign relations, v.’e are not sure that he can visit Iraq oTficially, and v/e are not aware that he has ever been invited to do so in the past. If he were to make an official visit the invitation should presumably be sent to him through you or us. You may however prefer that the Regent should send the invitation to him direct and thus emphasize that we regard his visit as purely personal and private. il 1 ? Ca se we should explain the position to the Ministry of Boreign Affairs. , As an Iraqi Land Settlement Appeal Court has just deprived the sheikh of the greater part of his date gardens at Pao (about which we shall be writing separately), we are not at all sure that he would wish to come to Iraq even if he were invited. Je should however be glad to know your views on this matter as soon as possible. « x. ^ .

Have you any further suggestions to make regarding this case? I have been considering the possibility of paying you a visit for two or three days in the middle of September and would propose that if this comes off my inter course with the Shaikh should be limited to an exchange of calls unless he himself suggests that he should come and see me and offer some kind of explanation.

CL 2 w A/ frtJL { y Many thanks for your telegram 193 about my proposed visit to Kuwait and connected matters. - ^ , 5o * If I am to write to the Shaikh at^eell, the lines you suggest in para 7 of your letter C/175 of the 30th June are excellent/except that they omit to mention his refusal to come and see me on business when requested politely in writing, which I regard, if anything, as worse than his refusal to callJ but I feel averse to entering into written correspondence on the subject especially at this late stage and consider it possible that a letter might evoke a reply which would leave us worse off than we are now. On the Shaikh's return to Kuwait I asked you to obtain his verbal explanation, which you did, vide your letter No. C/l51 of the 12th June. I suggest that you should now in form him orally that I am hoping to pay a short visit to Kuwait shortly and that if he calls in the usual way I shall of course receive him and return his call. You might then add that you have reason to believe that I am not satis fied with his explanation and that I am still feeling sore about his failure to call and his refusal to come and see me in order to talk business.' It is not mv present intention to raise the subject with the Shaikh myself, but if he himself raises it either during the calls or at a subsequent interview, I am willing to hear what he has got to say and discuss the matter dispassionately. I am not proposing to ask for an interview with the Shaikh myself subsequent to the calls, but if he expresses a desire to come and see me at the Agency I shall of course accede to it. I do not wish to accept an invitation to a meal with the Shaikh or to meet him at anybody else’s house until the matter is settled and I trust you will be able to arrange this. I also hope the Shaikh will not endeavour to send presents of fruits or cakes for myself or any member of my family. If you disapprove of the line of action proposed, please telegraph accordingly, otherwise please telegraph the results of your oral approach to the Shaikh and I wil± then suggest dates for my visit if it appears desirable that I should make one. It was very good of you to offer to put me and Mary up» I doubt if I shall bring Mary, partly on grounds of expense and partly because I think it would be better not to bring any member of my family to Kuwait until my quarrel with the Shaikh has been settled.

I was the more ready to do this as not only has Jackson on more tnan one occasion pointed out to him the error of his ways but since his return from Bahrain his attitude towards us has been more than usually satisfactory. In fact I found the general atmosphere at Kuwait better than 1 have ever known it ana left the place without the feeling of depression and frus tration which 1 usually experienced on previous visits, 2« Ihe Shaikh's new Chief medical Oxfleer, harry, is an excellent man. He appears to like the job ana should prove a great success. In addition to a British matron the onaikh is trying to obtain the services of two more British doctors one to work as an anaesthetist and the other as an eye-sped all st. The new hospital has now been equipped and is a going concern. The three British police officers are settling down and are of the greatest assistance to the Political a^ent. They are however employed only for dealing with persons subject to the Grder-ln-Council and play no part in the training of the local police. a fine new thoroughfare has been completed from the Customs jetty to the main square and at numerous points in tne town traffic police deal fairly efficiently with the constant stream of motor vehicles. On the educational sloe a number of small boys of primary school age have been sent to the Victoria College at alexanoria and it has been decided to send no more boys from the secondary classes to Cairo. 4* ^ [ N * 3* Jackson during his time at Kuwait has been indefatigable in keeping in close personal touch with bhaikh Ahmad and witn the more important members of tne ruling faudly and leading merchants and the improved atmosphere which 1 found there is in my opinion largely attributable to his energy anu ability. 1 am very sorry indeed that he is leaving us so soon. 4.
