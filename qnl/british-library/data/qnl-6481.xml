NOTE ON BRITISH MISSION AT TEHERAN. 1. Up to the year 1836, our diplomatic relations with Persia were carried on by means of occasional special Missions from India. In that year, however, the superintendence of those relations was placed under the Secretary of State lor Foreign Affairs, (1) in consequence of a belief that the counsels of Great Britain would have more weight with the Persian Government if urged in the name of the Sovereign than if tendered by the East India Company, and (2) on account of the increased intercourse of Persia with European nations. 2. When the British Mission was permanently established at Teheran, India agreed to pay 12,000£. a year towards its expenses. 3. In 1858 the Mission and Consulates were transferred to the India Office, because it was found that the interest of Great Britain in Persia was “ founded on the position which she occupied in India,” and that “almost “ any matter which came under discussion between England and Persia more “ or less concerned the Britisli Government in India.” The Imperial Treasury agreed to give 5,000/. a year towards its expenses, subject to the vote being considered each vear. 4. After a year’s trial of the new system, the Mission was retransferred to the Foreign Office, as being, after all, the “ most convenient and effective “ mode of carrying on the correspondence of Her Majesty’s Government “ with the Shah,” the matters to be treated by Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran being very much mixed up with questions connected iwith France, Russia, and Turkey, who had each of them representatives at the Shah’s Court. “ The only point”—it was said by Lord John Russell (31st October 1859)—“ of actual contact between Persian politics and the administration of “ India is the policy to be pursued in regard to Afghanistan; but it must at “ all times be far easier for the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs ta “ procure from his colleague at the India Office any Indian information “ which he may require in regard to Afghanistan, than it would be for “ the Secretary of State for India to make himself master of what may “ have passed between Her Majesty’s Government and those of France, “ Russia, and Turkey, on matters which may be essential as a guide for “ instructions to be given to the British Minister and Consuls in Persia.” 5. No further question! arose in regard to the matter until 1871, in which year the Select Committee of the House of Commons on the “ Diplomatic “ and Consular Services ” submitted in their Report (18th May 1871) that they inclined on the whole to the opinion that the Teheran Mission should be placed under the authority of the Secretary of State for India. This view was supported by Sir Henry Rawlinson, Sir Bartle Frere, Sir Robert Mont gomery, Lord Lawrence, Lord Mayo, Sir John Kaye, the Earl of Derby, and opposed by Lord Hammond, Viscount Halifax, the Earl of Clarendon, and Sir Henry Bulwer. It was afterwards found that the total expenditure on account of the Mission for a period of 38 years had been 510,000/., of which India had paid 450,000/., and the Imperial Government only 60,000/. It was suggested, therefore, that if absolutely transferred to the India Office the whole cost might be paid from Indian revenues; but that, if it remained under the Foreign Office, the officers of it should be selected generally from the Indian service and the charge on Indian revenues should be diminished. 6. No action w r as taken, however, in this direction until 1874 when the Marquis of Salisbury (7th August 1874) submitted a proposal to the Indian 15328.

Or possibly your Government might consider that Indian reqiiiiements would be suffi- ciently provided for at Teheran by your appointment of an additional Secretary ot Legation, who, although subordinate to the head of the Mission, would supply the necessary information^ on all questions of Indian policy, and would further conduct the Mission’s correspondence with the various authorities in India. « x should be glad to know whether your Lordship considers that the Consulates at Teheran, Tabreez, and Resht, as well as the control of our relations with the Persian Gulf, should rest, in the event of transfer, with the British Indian Minister at Teheran, or otherwise.” 7. To this Lord Northbrook’s Goyernment replied (Kith August 1875):— “ 14. We have given the fullest consideration to the proposal that a portion of the duties connected with the British Mission at Teheran should be transferred to the supervision of the Secretary of State lor India. We are generally of opinion that it would be inexpedient to disturb the relations that now exist between the Mission and the Foreign Office. The officers who represent foreign interests at the Court of Teheran are members of the regular diplomatic service of their respective countries, and if a different practice were followed in the case of the representative of Great Britain, it is doubtful whether he would not lose in influence and prestige with the Court to which he is accredited, and with his diplomatic colleagues. There are also few important steps which could be taken with respect to Persia and the countries adjoining it, which would not ultimately demand a reference to the Foreign Office; while the progress of events in Persia and the evident wish which the Shah has displayed to be included within the circle of European Powers, afford some grounds for thinking that the purely Eastern methods of diplomacy which have been so ably advocated by Sir Henry Rawlinson may, in the course of years, become less adapted to the to the requirement of the Persian Court than in former days. But we consider, nevertheless, that the interests of India should be represented at Teheran ; and we are therefore prepared, in modi fication of the views expressed in the Despatch of the Government of India, No. 26, dated the 19th April 1872, to suggest that a Secretary of Legation and a Military Attache should be ap pointed by the Government of India. The Secretary of Legation, while subordinate to Her Majesty’s Minister, would be in possession of the views of this Government: on questions affecting Indian interests, and would be recognized as the adviser of the Minister on such matters. We also think that, in consideration of the large sum paid from Indian revenues towards the expenses of the Mission, the suggestions which have been made for furnishing presents on a more liberal scale, in accordance with oriental custom, and for entertainments in view of cultivating friendly relations with Persian nobles and gentlemen, are deserving attention.” 8. In consequence of this adverse opinion of the Government of India, Lord Salisbury did not submit his intended proposal to the Foreign Office for the transfer of the Mission to the India Office, hut pressed for the appointment hy the Government of India, without additional charge to the Indian revenues of a Secretary of Legation as well as a Military Attache. He added, how ever, “ The proposed appointment of Indian Officers to the Teheran Mission, though in itself desirable, hy no means disposes of all the considerations which appeal to him (Lord Salisbury) to recommend other and larger “ measures.^ It will still leave in existence the anomalous arrangement undei which the Mission is in the main paid for by one Government and “ directed by another.” 9. Ihe Foreign Office (25th February 1876) objected on various grounds to the appointment of an Indian Secretary of Legation, but suggested that the' &lt;, 1 ° r ' 1 “ i”* “ Ea *“ iO. The views of Lord Lytton’s Government (25th May 1876) were in entire accord with those of the Government of Lord Northbrook and of the India Office as to the expediency of appointing from the Indian Service a Secretary of Legation, as well as a Military Attach^. But they added “ 6. The representation of specially Indian interests has, for many years, been so neelected or at kast so unsnccessfully maintained, at the Court of Teheran, and the influence of Russia ^ thi Court has, during the same period, so greatly increased, and so firmly established itself that it would now be difficult to re-constitute Persia into areally effectual bulwark to this Empire without an expenditure largely exceeding any which the Indian revenues are at present able to afford For this reason, and also because, in consequence of the above-mentioned fact, the character of diplomatic relations with Persia must now be determined by considerations subject to the general foreign pohcy of Her Majesty s Government,'we think that the time is past when the entire establishment, and direct management, of the British Mission at Teheran could be advanta-eouslv undertaken by the Government of India. ° ^ ‘‘ 7 There are still, however, so many important questions in connection with which the interests ol India may be advantageously, or injuriously, affected by the couduct of the Persian Government that we deem it extremely desirable that some officer thoroughly conversant with those interests (political and commercial, as well as military) should be on the permanent staff of Her Maiestv’s Legation in Persia.” J y 11. After farther desultory correspondence between the India and Foreign Offices, the whole matter, both as to the appointment of special officers to the Mission and of the transfer of the Mission to the India Office, was dropped, and has remained dormant up to the present time. A somewhat decided* representation from the India Office in 1879 resulted, however, in the reduction of the annual charge from 12,000/. to 10,000/. At that limit it is to remain by agreement up to the year 1889, when the proportion of charo-e as between the two Treasuries is to be again considered. 12. So far as the Political Department of the India Office is concerned, it has always supported the view put forward in former years as to the advan tages of the India Office having control of our relations at Teheran. But, in existing circumstances, it is sceptical of the expediency of the step, (1) be cause experience of the past treatment of India by the Imperial Treasury affords no hope of any portion of the charge being borne by Imperial revenues once the transfer is made; (2) because the Government of India has recently increased its obligations so considerably in Afghanistan and Khelat that their consent to further financial and administrative responsibilities can hardly be anticipated; (3) because the existing system works fairly well since direct communication between Her Majesty’s Minister at Teheran and the Viceroy has been established; (4) because from the recent rapid march of events the Persian question is becoming more European than formerly, and as such requires the supervision of the Foreign Offiqe; (5) because it is believed that the Shah has a repugnance to any such change ; (6) because the whole condition of Persia appears to be now so hopeless, so entangled, so Bussainized, that India may well pause before she throws more “ good “ money after bad,” or accepts any increased responsibility in regard to that country. 13. If these objections can be got over, no administrative difficulty need stand in the way of transfer from the Foreign to the India Office of the immediate control of the Mission, provided that the Imperial Government meet all expenses connected with it over and above the 10,000/. a year now paid from Indian revenues, or grant a fixed annual sum of, say, 5,000/. a year, as promised in 1858. 25th February 1887.
