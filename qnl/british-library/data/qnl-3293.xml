They have, however, chartered one aircraft which does not possess a permit and the particulars of which are as follows:- Registered Owners . Type of Aircraft . Registration Mark . Wrightways Ltd., De Havilland G-AEdM. Croydon. 86B. At present this is the only aircraft chartered to fly along the Trucial Coast, but the Company may find it necessary to extend the scope of their charters in which case further particulars v/ill be given to you. ; Presumably for the purpose of obtaining a permit the abovementioned chartered aircraft belonging to Wrightways Limited will be regarded as in the ownership of Imperial Airways.

Dear Gibson, I mentioned to you over the telephone this morning that Imperial Airways were operating numerous supplementary services with flying boats and landplanes to cope with the additional mails during the Christmas season. The flying boats are of the normal type but the landplanes have been collected from various sources and comprise such types as Engigns, Frobishers, Hannibals, Atalantas, D.H.SG’s, Dragon Rapides and possibly Curtis Condors. Only Hannibals and Atalantas have been operating on the regular twice weekly landplane service between Alexandria and Calcutta with the result that the remaining aircraft, or at least some of them, have not the requisite permits to operate through the Persian Gulf. It was only recently that Imperial Airways completed their arrangements which, indeed, are still subject to modification from day to day. They hoped that the Royal Air Force would be able to assist them during the Christmas season, but the help v/hich is actually forthcoming is strictly limited. We regret that the Company have not had time to obtain permits for all their aircraft and hope that in the abnormal circumstances the omission will be overlooked. You may perhaps wish to acquaint the Political Resident leaving it to his discretion whether the matter should be broached to the Sheiks or not. I should mention that the additional services have now been operating for about a week and will probably continue until Christmas or a few days thereafter. J.P. Gibson, India Offic S.W.l.

Dear Laithwaite, I am sorry that there has been some delay in replying to your letter dated 8th April last, P.Z.2361/35, with which you enclosed an original Special Authorisation issued by the Sultan of Muscat in favour of Imperial Airways Limited. With regard to the small clerical errors in the Authorisation, to which you drew attention, we agree that, as the registration markings of the aircraft havebeen quoted correctly in this case, and to save the bother of sending the Authorisation back to Muscat, the errors might be ignored. We have, therefore, had photostatic copies made of the Special Authorisation for sending to Imperial Airways Limited. With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter, we think that on the whole it would have been preferable not to have sub-divided the aircraft into those making regular flights and those making emergency flights. In point of fact, three of the aircraft in the first mentioned sub-division, namely, G-ABTK, G-ABTL and G-AASP should have been included in the list of aircraft required to make emergency flights and conversely, aircraft G-AAXE is engaged on the regular service. As you will appreciate, it may at any time become J.G. Laithwaite Esq*, necessary/ India Ofii ce, S.W.l.necessary for Imperial Airways Limited to utilise aircraft listed under the second sub-division on their regular service flights. We suggest, therefore, that when the renewal of this authorisation becomes due the whole of the list oi aircraft should be shown without any sub-division. We note that you enclosed with your letter the original of a further Authorisation signed and sealed by the Sultan on the 20th March. We are not sure why this Authorisation was signed as no aircraft company is mentioned in it and we assume that it has only been forwarded for reference purposes. In this connection you will be aware that the Special Authorisation issued to Imperial Airways Limited by the Shaikh of Kuwait expired on the 22nd May 1935, and I shall be glad to know whether a renewal of the Authorisation has yet been obtained.

P.Z.7941/34. 9th January 1935. IVjy dear Fowle, I venture to bother you on one or two points which have arisen on the 'special authorisations' recently issued in favour of Imperial Airways, etc. by the sheikh of Bahrein, copies of whicn you sent us under cover of your printed despatch NO.1170-S of 10th December. In the first place the word 'British' appears to have been omitted before the word 'nationality' in paragraph 1 in all three cases. This is no ooubt merely a clerical error. limit for the validity of 'special authorisations'. It was originally intended that there should be such a time limit (as is, I think, clear from the form of the draft 'special authorisation' prepared here after consultation with you), but I am afraid that owing to an oversight we failed to suggest what the actual period of validity 'ble Lt.Col. T.C. Fowle, C.B.S., snoula/ The Residency, Bushire. 3. Secondly, paragraph a does not lay down a time2 should he. Alter informal consultation with the Air Ministry we now suggest that the period in question should he one year. This will of course mean that companies operating air services will have to apply annually through the usual channels for a renewal of their '‘special autnorisations'*. Paragrapn 2 should therefore read 'This authorisation is limited to the period from /Insert date of issue of authorisation/ to J7 inclusive and is granted...' 4. while the points referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3 above are of relatively minor importance, we think, in the light of discussion with the Air Ministry, that it would he desirable to obtain amended 'authorisations' from the ,sheikh of Bahrein and to ensure that any 'authorisations' issued by the sheikh of Roweit and the sultan of Muscat are in similar form. If you see no objection we should be grateful if the necessary steps might be taken. Meanwhile, the Air Ministry will postpone any communication to Imperial Airways. o.

After compliments. With reference to the Agreement signed by Your Excellency on the subject of the use of your aerodrome by civil aircraft, I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that His Majesty’s Government expect that military aircraft belonging to or employed in the service of His Majesty’s Government shall at all times as hitherto enjoy priority (when His Majesty’s Government considers that circumstances require it) in the use of any aerodrome which may be established dr maintained for civil aircraft, and of full facilities, without specific prior permission, and that use of such aerodrome shall be accorded free of charge. Usual ending. Translation of a Confidential Letter No. R. 4/1518, dated the \2th Safar 1353, equivalent to 2§th May 1934, from, His Excellency the Ruler of Koweit to the Political Agent, Koweit. After compliments, With the hand of pleasure 1 have received your confidential letter No. C. 193, dated the 9th inst. (23.5.34), and understood what it contained with regard to the military aeroplanes belonging to or used in the service of His Majesty’s Government. We always have pleasure in assisting in any matters that appertain to His Majesty’s Government. The said military aeroplanes have, in the past, been using the aerodrome without ever being asked for anything in the way of fees, and the benzine which is imported and stored for their use is exempt from customs duty— all this in order to assist His Majesty’s Government. We now confirm that they, the military aeroplanes, shall also enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, and without any prior permission or being charged anything. We, however, should like to draw your attention to the fact that the Bahrein Government charges on account of the said aeroplanes an annual rental of £120 apart from the customs duty which it levies on benzine. We pray therefore that His Majesty’s Government will very kindly put us on an equality with others in this respect. Usual ending. Draft Letter to His Excellency Sheikh Sir Ahmad al-Jabir as-Sabah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Ruler of Koweit. I have the honour to refer to Your Excellency’s letter No. R 4/1518 of 12th Safar 1353 (26th May 1934) to the Political Agent, Koweit, and note that Your Excellency confirms that the Royal Air Force aeroplanes shall enjoy priority in the use of any aerodrome, without prior permission, and without being charged anything. I am directed by His Majesty’s Government to thank Your Excellency for this. 2. In the same letter Your Excellency draws attention to the fact that the Bahrein State are paid an annual rental of £120 in connection with Royal Air Force aeroplanes, and asks to be put on an equality with that State. 3. His Majesty’s Government have directed me to reply as follows: It is possible that Your Excellency has not appreciated the difference between conditions at Bahrein and Koweit. At Bahrein there are two aerodromes, one on Manamah Island, for which the Boyal Air Force pay the £120 referred to, and which is a military aerodrome, established before the civil route w^as opened, and the other on Muharraq, which is used by civil and Royal Air Force aircraft, for which the same Agreement has been signed by His Excellency Sheikh Hamad as has been signed by you. 4. Moreover the £120 already referred to also includes the site for the Royal Air Force base, quarters for personnel, Rest House, &amp;c., which is situated on Manamah. 5. At Koweit there is only one civil aerodrome, and no base. His Majesty’s Government regret, therefore, that they cannot pay Your Excellency the £120 which is paid to Bahrein, and Your Excellency, in the light of the above facts, will doubtless see that conditions in the two States are materially different. * These letters are confidential and are not for publication .

April, 1934, 3 i« ^ tr With reference to your P«Z. 1872/34 of 22nd March last, and to previous correspondence to which you refer, we suggest that the relevant passage of the draft letters to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein should read as follows .that His Majesty T s Government /expect] that military aircraft 'belonging to or employed in the service oz His Majesty shall at all times as hitherto (omit 'as hitherto' in the letter to Bahrein) enjoy priority, when His Majesty’s Government consider that circumstances require it, in the use of any aerodromes which may 'be established or maintained zor ’ civil aircraft, and of all facilities, without specific prior permission, and that use of such aerodromes shall be accorded free of charge. This will not, however, affect the existing agreement under which a rental of £120 per annum is payable to Your Excellency’s Government in respect of Manamah aerodrome'. (This sentence in the case of Bahrein only). The reasons for the suggested amendments to the Political Resident’s draft as amended by the Government of India, and further by you, are as follow (i) The phrase 'military aircraft' is thought to require amplification to extend it to Dominion and Colonial aircraft. This is in accordance with para.2(a) of Air Ministry letter to you S.31992/S. 6. of 15th May, 1933. J.G.Laithwaite, Esq., a _ AI1 India Office, OOPY SENT BY AIR MAII. S.W.i.

(iii) The word 'of' has been substituted for 'have' in the third line from the bottom of your letter, and in line 6 of the Political Residents draft in order to ensure priority for military 1 aircraft in the use of facilities as well as in the use of the aerodromes, on occasions when this is considered to be necessary. This is in accordance with the wording of para.2 (a) of our official letter to you S.31992/S.6. of the 15th May, 1933. (iv) The words 'and that use of such aerodromes shall be accorded free of charge' have been substituted for 'and free of charge' in view of the fact that it is reasonable to expect that military aircraft should pay for. facilities which have been provided by and solely at the expense of Imperial Airways, though we realize that the Sheikhs are not concerned with our relations with Imperial Airways.

We note the views expressed by the Air Officer Commanding. 2* . Permission for the free use of the existing land ing ground will presumably be covered by the arrangements which the Political Resident has been instructed to endeavour to make with the Sheikh of Koweit in regard to civil and military aerodromes in his territory. 3* As regards additional facilities to meet possible future requirements, the attitude of the Koweit Oil Company is, I think, an important factor. In their conversations with us they have emphasised their desire that we shoulu, so far as possible, have selected any areas we may wish ior defence etc. purposes in aavance, axis while the suggestion made by you in connection with one Qatar xacilibies, that the phrase 'any sites wnich Wing Commander w.A. Me Claughry, DSC., MC., BFC., ^vir Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W.C. 2. may/may have been selecte(i ,, in Clause 5 of the Government Agreement should be strengthened, e.g. on the lines ''any sites which may be required', was discussed with them a few days ago, they took the line that the revised wording would place them in an impossible position. Unless, therefore, the Air Ministry see strong objection, we think it would be desirable to take immediate steps to select the actual sites which will, in the Air Officer Commanding’s opinion, be required near Jhaira and Subaihiya. Once the sites have been selected the desirability of acquiring them ana also the site described in (a) of the Air Officer Commanding’s telegram of 26th January, as an Insurance against the future, could be considered. Pending a decision on this point it will probably be desirable not to let it become generally known locally that we may be requiring certain sites in the near future, since if the areas referred to by the Air Officer Commanding are not Government land the effect may be to put up the price against us. 4* The position in regard to the points dealt with in paragraph 2 of your letter under reply is generally similar to that in regard to Qatar. An assurance has been/■been obtained from the Company as regards wireless and other methods oi communication; difficulty should not presumably arise as regards the point referred to in (b); point (c) is one for consideration, as is point (a); point (e) is a matter for local discussion and agreement of financial terms once any new landing grounds have been acquired; (f) is equally for local discussion in tne first place, as is (h); the position in regard to (g) i as stated in respect of Qatar in paragraph 5 of my letter No. p.Z.7 27/34 of 1st February. 5.

AIR MINISTRY, AD A STRAP HOTJSB, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 29th January, 1934. y dear Laithwaite, With reference to your letter P.Z.229/34 of the 9th January, 1934, on the subject of an oil concession in Koweit, and to my letter S.31084/Part II of the 13th January, 1934, under cover of which a copy of our letter to A.C.C.Iraq on the subject was sent to you, I now enclose copy of a telegram in which A.O.C. gives his views regarding landing ground facilities which may be required, in which we concur, and which are briefly ps follows:- (i) Complete freedom to use our existing landing ground outside the wall on the south-east side of Koweit town will suffice for present requirements. (ii) Additional facilities to meet possible future requirements will be as indicated in (a), (b) and (c) of attached telegram. (a) is defined precisely, but (b) and (c) are rather more indefinite. Will you please, therefore, let us know whether the information given by A.O.C. Iraq under (b) and (c) is sufficient for your purpose, or whether you wish a reconnaissance to be carried out to select actual sites which would be required near Jahra and Subaihiya. 2. Additionally, of course, we will require provision to be made similar to those already mentioned in my letters on the subject of qptar for such facilities as:- (a) W/T and prevention of interference by other stations. ib) Accomodation if required, and permission to put down stocks of fuel (in a storehouse, or in a barge if that is more convenient for flying boats), stores and possibly bombs. (c) Bntry of R.A.F.stores, etc., duty free. (d) Intelligence. (e) Safeguarding of our landing grounds and any stores put down. (f) Permission to put down moorings for float-planes or flying boats.

My dear McClaughry, Many thanks for your letter of the 29th January, ITo. S.32797, on the subject of air facilities in Q,atar. 2. Walton will write separately to you about the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 3. He asks me to say that he has noted the verbal alteration suggested in your paragraph 6. 3. As I have explained to you informally, we are taking up in the light of the telegrams of which you have load copies the question of giving the Sheikh of ha tar a guarantee of protection against landward aggression in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and an official letter consulting you with particular reference to the question of protection and the commitments which this would involve will I hope reach you tomorrow. 4. We are particularly anxious, subject, of course, to the concurrence of the interested departments, to put the Resident in a position to say something definite to the Sheikh about the grant of protection, should circumstances in his opinion make this desirable, and while we entirely agree that the two points dealt with in paragraph 4 of your letter under reply will have to be considered before any final commitment is entered into, we trust that the Air Ministry in their reply to our official letter will be prepared to agree that consideration of them need not delay progress with regard to general policy and/ Commander W.A.McClaughry,DSO.,MC.,DFC., Air Ministry, Adastral Hou se, hingsway, W *C•2.ana that the Resident should he given discretion, if he thinks fit, to give a general undertalcing (subject to consideration of at any rate the point raised in the first sub-paragraph of paragraph 4) immediately. 5. Our general view would be that the question of any reconnaissance over Qatar should be left until the question of protection has been broached.. Particularly if it is broached by the Sheikh, the Resident will be in a position to take the line that, while the matter must be referred to His Id^jesty's Government they will obviously be anxious in the first place to ascertain what difficulties are involved in the grant of protection, and for this purpose it would be possible for him to obtain the consent of the Sheikh to reconnaissance flights of the nature which you suggest. As the result of tiiese reconnaissance flights, which need not, I imagine, take very long, it would presumably be possible for the Air Ministry to reach final conclusions without delay as to the landing grounds which they would require in the event of a guarantee of protection being given. The connected question of intelligence is one for settlement between the departments concerned in consultation with the Political Resident, and is not of immediate urgency. 6. On the points to v/hich you refer in paragraph 5 of your letter, I may say that in the event of our entering into closer relations with the Sheikh of ./Qatar consequent on the grant of an oil concession by him, we should, as at present advised, proposed to aim at securing that the air procedure which h^speen agreed with the Air Ministry and the Foreign Office in the case of Bahrein, Koweit ana Muscat should equally apply to Qatar - in other words, that there should be a formal agreement with the Sheikh covering civil aviation (ana providing for the payment to him of a certain rent in respect of such civil aviation facilities as might be provided), accompanied by a binding exchange of/of letters in regard to the activities of military aircraft, inis would cover point (a) in paragraph 6 of your letter so f-r ao aeroarones were concerned, and the conuitions under which military aircraft could fly over the principality as a whole could -orned out between us and the Resident with a view to proposals to the Sheikh on this subject also being considered. 7. Point (b) in the same paragraph is closely connected with the question of protection. If zhe Sheikh is offered and accepts our protection we assume that no difficulty would arise about the provision of refuelling facilities. Detailed arrangements in regard to the provision of labour for the making or improvement of landing grounds coula be a matter for local agreerrmni. A guarantee for their safety would be covered by the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph. The question of what, ii any, payment would be necessary, is one on which we should .in due course like the Residents aavice. He would no uoudc consult Air Officer Commanding Iraq in connection with it. d. Ihe question raised in paragraph 5 (c) can be considered m due course. It is not a matter of immediate importance. 9. as regards paragraph 5 (d) of your letter, the draft Concession contains no provision for the use of independent air facilities by the oil concessionnuire. If we can secure an agreement with the Sheikh on the same lines as we propose in •3airein, Xoweit and Muscat, it will secure in practice complete control to His Majesty's Government of any air facilities, and if tne Company should ever wish to establish u landing ground of tlleir ovm ’ a condition such as you suggest could be considered as a term of approval to it. tVe think it unnecessary to take up the point now. 10 . i am sending copies of this letter to Warner at the foreign Qfiice, Seal at the Admiralty ana Starling at theDraft Paper. pol it i ^Department.

We note that the Gun Linentdl Department of the Foreign Office consiaers that even though tne Dutch Government would resent the Company’s ariving a bargain over agency fees they woula not be likely to carry their grievance into any other sphere of Anglo-butch relations This is, of course, an important point ana must materially affect our decision. 3. as regciras tne aesirability or otherwise of allowing Imperial Airways to use tnese fees as bargaining assets, we agree in the first place as to the objections to any aiscrimination between different foreign aviation companies. Geconaly, we nave consiaered tne point raises by you that the logical reply to any retaliation by the Dutch in the Netherlands East Inaies against the fixation of a particular scale of chargescharges at the Arabian aerodromes would he for Airways to raise their fees against trie Dutch services across India. The Department concerned here renarks on this that, except possibly in respect of mechanic repair services, Airways, so far as tney kno have nothing to ao with the charges made at aerodromes and landing grounds in India (Indian National Airways being incidentally their ground agents in that country). Landing charges in India are made by Government and in their opinion it would not be possible for Airways in any circumstances to use the Indian charges as an effective lever against the Dutch. They add that as any w u flights over trie Dutch ^ast Indies will presumably be under Australian auspices, if Imperial Airways are : concerned it will be as contractors for the Conmonwealth Government. 3i ' As regards tne third point raised in your letter, viz. whether action taken by the Company which i might arouse the resentment of i foreign aviation companies wishing to use the Arabian route might not bring into undue prominence tne special j position of H.LAG. vis-a-vis the Arab rulers of tyie Gulf, our attitude would be, I think, that In pursuance ox tne lacaue policy wnicn vte nave ;adopted we are anxious to reduce toDraft Paper.

On the whole, in the light of the correspondence which nas passed, and subject to your further observations, I am disposed to think that, so far as ordinary agency services are concerned^we need not press Imperial Airways to let us have immediately the charges they propose to nake for public transport aircraft at the Arabian coast aerodromes, although we should, I think, have to ask them to do so in advance of any opening of the route to the Dutch or other foreign commercial aircraft. The long delay wnich has taken place in disposing of tne point may have helped them to clear the ground. r ^ f ^ y 7 1925 5000 G.33INDIA OFFICE IS***- Secretary of state Government of India, Foreign and political Department, ^iind Decewiber 193S.

I JL. « W ^ « 7560 I (E 6301/11/91) My dear laithwaite, y With reference to your letter No. P.Z. 6191/33 of the 20th October, regarding die charges to be made by Imperial Airways in respect of agency services at the Arabian aerodromes in the Persian Gulf, I write in continuation of our recent telephone conversation on this subject. 2. On closer consideration, it appears to us that there may possibly be less to be said against allowing Imperial Airways the bargaining power they require than we hive hitherto realised. There seem really to be three headings under which the question should be considered. 3. The Foreign Office are more directly concerned in two of these; namely, (1) whether possible Dutch resentment over the treatment of their Company by Imperial Airways, reacting on His Majesty's Government as ultimately J.G. Laithwaite, Esq V &gt;PY GEMT •’TY Ah* ■ : ; I /Itj/xz£ responsible (since we are the lessees from the Sheikh) might injure Anglo-Dutch relations in other matters. (2) whether, as regards civil aviation policy in general, it is desirable or undesirable (vis-a-vis of the Dutch or French or on general grounds) that the Company should be given these fees as bargaining assets. 4. So far as the first of these questions is concerned, the opinion of our competent Department is that, although the Dutch might resent the Company’s driving a bargain over these fees, they would be unlikely to carry over their grievance into any other sphere of Anglo-Dutch relations. With regard to the second question, they suggest that, if the Dutch in retaliation for the tariff imposed at the Arabian aerodromes were to raise their scale of charges in Netherlands iiast Indies, the logical reply would be for Imperial Airways to raise their fees, not along the Arabian air route, but against the Dutch service across India, since it was in point of fact in exchange for facilities across /NetherlandsNetherlands territory to Australia that facilities across ^ India were originally granted. This suggests that, provided that they would in fact be permitted by the Government of India to raise the Indian fees, Imperial Airways would not suffer for lack of a quid pro quo , if they were to give up their claim to bargain with the Arabian fees also. In principle, we should consider it desirable to avoid any cause of friction with the Dutch or French or other foreign aviation interests so far as possible, but it is really of course for the Air Ministry to say whether on grounds of civil aviation policy it would be desirable in this case to accede to the Company's request. Incidentally you will probably have noticed the implication in the penultimate paragraph of Imperial Airways 1 letter, a copy of which was enclosed in Bertram’s letter to you of the 27th September, that they would like to be able to discriminate between different foreign aviation companies. This would we presume be inadmissible. 5. The third point in which you are, perhaps, more interested is:- /v/hetherWhether It seems possible that action taken by the Company, which roused the resentment of foreign aviation companies wishing to use the Arabian route, might bring into undue prominence the special position of His Majesty’s Coveminent vis-&amp;-vis of the Arab rulers of the Gulf. This, we understand, the India Office are in principle always anxious to avoid. 6. I am sending copies of this letter to Bertram and McClaughry.India amcz, f HXT^IiALL 20th October, 1953* P.2.6191/33. y dear Warner Would you kindly refer to my letter of 22n&amp; Aupttst, Mo.l .Z.5UK)/33 # to bertraa of the ir iiinirtry on the subject of the charges to be Bird© by Iiapensl Airwaye in respect of Agency cervices nt the A.rob Aerodromes in the Persian Gulf and Bertreffl f p reply of from Imperial Airways and enquiring whether it would not be possible in the circ m lances discussed to ort one for the present a declaration of char, es for public transport aircraft at the Arabian Coast aerodromes, of which a copy was sent by us to the foreign office at the time.

On the other hand, the whole object, I think, of the policy we hewe adopted in dealing with the Cifil eredroaea on the ; rab littoral has been to avoid precisely the ty.e of difficnlty whidi sight arise in the event of Ia,erial irways using the threat of increased charges at e.g. Behrein or oweit as a bergaini^j lever with foreign ooswrclal coapanie* in order to aecure better terns for tbesselver in sone other rection of their route to astrails, f aimed in there 01 rcumstances et recurin* that the ooeel ruler ould prescribe the tarns on which foreign aircraft might ase the aerodroaes in his -late ana that Imperial amays in charging foreign planes at a fixed rate for services render*... noula do ro within the terms of the ■’hei&lt;h's regulations and would recover charger from such planer at rater fixed by hi. ana under his authority. 1 aa rather inclined to thin* in these circumstances, subject to the views of the Foreign Office, that despitethe disadvantage at which this may to some extent place imperial Airways, it will be necessary to ask them to let as have at this stage (or at any rate in advance of any opening of the route to the Latch or other foreign commercial aircraft) the charges they propose to ma^e for public transport aircraft at the Arabian Coast Aerovixomos. 1 should, however, be grateful for your observations in the light of which we might if necessary aiscuss the matter with bertraia, to whom and to dcClaughry, I am sending a copy of this letter.

Dear Laithwaite, On receipt of your letter of the 22nd August, P.Z*5180/33, I wrote to Imperial Airways and now send you a copy of the reply from Mr. Dismore, Secretary of the Company. There is a great deal in what he says and we view with some anxiety the arrangements that Imperial Airways will.be able to make with the K.h.I.L.M. for use of the facilities in the fatherland Indies provided for the use of the Dutch Company. In these circumstances it would undoubtedly be in the interests of Imperial Airways not to declare in advance the schedule of charges at the Arabian coast aerodromes. Do you think that it will be possible to postpone for the present the declaration of charges for public transport aircraft at the Arabian coast aerodromes? Yours sincerely. J n. T + a U* r* INDIA OFFICE, S. W. 1.r: IMPERIAL AIRWAYS LTD. Airway Terminus, Victoria Station, London, S. 1. ^786/SAD/JGW. 15th September, 1933. Dear Bertram, I must apologise for the delay in replying to your letter of the 25th August, reference 260663/33/D. D.J.A., on the subject of the charges for agency facilities st Bahrein, Joweit and Gwadar. I see from Mr. Laithwaite ! s letter that the India Office wish the schedules we prepare to cover aircraft engaged in public transport, but I am writing to tell you privately that we should prefer not to be committed to any scale of fees for public transport services, because of the position which may arise vis-a-vis the Dutch and ourselves, if we are successful on the Australia route, and a Company in which we are interested operates through the Letherland Indies. I hope that the K.L.M. or rather the K.L.I.L.M* will be reasonable in the charges they make for facilities in the Letherland Indies, but we ought to allow for the fact that they may be rather sore about the failure of their plan to get their service through to Australia, and they may assess their charges for assistance to the British aircraft on the Australian route at an unduly high scale. It is very important, from our point of view, that we should not give up in advance such bargaining power as we nave. We hope it will be possible to come to an amicable arrangement with the Dutch whereby the facilities we provide for them can be set off against the facilities we hope they will provide for us in the Letherland Indies. But if the fees for the Arabian Coast Aerodromes were settled and published now our position vis-a-vis the Dutch, and of course possibly the French, would be weaker than if these fees were left for special negotiation with each public transport service as the necessity arises. /PerhapsPerhaps you oan pass on a word about this to the India Office, so that only the schedule for privately owned aircraft need be settled and published at the present time.

The regulations in the form in which they were communicated by the Air Ministry on 19th May (P.2.2938/ 33) were generally satisfactory from our point of view. Since then it has been necessary: | (a) to satisfy the doubts of the Operations side of the Air Ministry (see our letter to the Air Ministry of 9th June on P.Z.2841/33). The assurances given in that letter have been accepted and a draft of instructions to the Political Resident to govern the securing of priority for military aeroplanes, etc. has been concurred in by the Air Ministry and Poreign Office. It is now attached for issue. (b) Colonel Fowle, in the light of consultation with Colonel Dickson, made certain minor suggestions for amendment in Document 3 enclosed in the Air Ministry letter of 19th May. The only items which need consideration are those specified in paragraph 3 of his letter of 13th June on P.Z.3914 (the proposal in para .4 having been dropped). As the result of discussion with Air Ministry and Poreign Office and with Colonel Powle, it has been agreed to abandon his suggestion in para. 3 , viz. that for tti a new Clause 15A in Document B. second suggestion has been accepted, subject to certain verbal alterations,in the form set out in para .3 5000 3.33 of/ 1712bof Air Ministry letter of 24th July, on P.2.4434/ 33.

We are now in a position to issue instructions to the Resident (which should go through the Government of India) and 1 attach a draft. A draft to the Air Ministry is also attached. 4. It may be explained that one point is still outstanding, viz. the second schedule to Document C. Action on the file has been postponed for some weeks in the hope that the necessary information would be J provided by Imperial Airways, but the Air Ministry now tell me that no real progress has yet been made, Airways pleading insufficiency of staff and pressure of seasonal work; and, while they have undertaken to let us have draft schedules In the very near future, It seems undesirable any longer to postpone a communication on the general question to. the Resident and the Government of India,Draft Paper. /U U&lt;43&lt;J JJ political Department.

As will be seen from the correspondence in question, there is now general agreement, in the light of discussions with Lt.Col. Fowle, among the interested Departments of H.M.G. as to the advantage of adopting a uniform procedure in dealing with the provision of air facilities in the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulf. Agreement has also been reached as to the general basis of such a procedure. The broad features of ta*t procedureTSnT that the Arab rulers concerned should be advised to make air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted by H.M.G.; to issue a special authorisation in respect of aircraft permitted/permitted to fly over ana land in their territories; to lay down in terms to he approved hy Government conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes; and finally to enter into a» agreement^ witn H.M.G. under which H.Iw.G. shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain, as the agents of the oheikh^c*Av^^ and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations, etc. referred to above, an aerodrome or aerodromes and ancillary services within his territory, and to charge and retain fees in respect of the use of such aerodromes and such ancillary services. as will be seen, the broad principle underlying the proposed new procedure ! is that, while full control should in j fact rest in the hands of H.Jk.G., it should, so far as possible, appear to local rest with the/ruler. 3.

As regards the first, we see no objection to the addition in document B of the new Clause 15 (a) suggested by Powle. Presumably H.M.G. would take steps for the immediate recovery of any expenses assistance rendered to aircraft from the Company concerned, and since there is no question of private fliers using the air route, but only the aircraft of - presumably - considerable and reputable Companies, this snoulu present little difficulty. As regards the second amendment proposed by Powle, namely that to Clause 2 of document B, we agree with your views. COPY SENT BY.AIfl MAIL of J.G.

Dear Laithwaite, With reference to your letter of 15th July, P.Z. 3914/33 on the documents concerning the control of civil aviation on the Arab Air Route, I note that you have made the small necessary verbal amendment in Clause I of document C. 2. With regard to Fowle's proposed addition of a new clause 15(a) to document B, I am afraid that we cannot accept this. We should have to consult the Treasury, and I am perfectly certain that they would not agree to giving us a blank cheque. It is quite clear, of course, that if the Sheik was required to render any assistance the Government would have to pay expenses incurred in such assistance, but we cannot agree to including a statement to this effect in the agreement. 3. We are prepared to accept Fowle's suggestion with your amendments to Clause 2 of document B. The additional paragraph to Clause 2 will, therefore, read as follows:- r, Such agents shall exercise supervision, in respect of such aerodrome or aerodromes, necessary for the carrying out of the Air Navigation Regulations, with the exception of the Sanitary formalities which will be exercised by the Quarantine Medical Officer, and of the lich will be exercise officials, respect- J.G.

We have made the necessary amendment in clause 1 of Document c. As you vail have seen from Foreign Office letter of 30th June, No. S.3382/11/91, they concur in the various documents concerning the control of civil aviation on the Arad Air Route in the terms in which they were circulated under my letter of 19th May. In view of this we were preparing instructions to the Resident when the demi-official letter of which I now enclose an extract arrived from Fowle. • 2.

On the other hand we have, as you will remember, throughout been very anxious on general grounds to operate so far as possible behind the facade of the Sheikhs am to avoid any possibility oi friction between Airways as the agents of His majesty's Government and foreign air companies, etc. Moreover, we were anxious to reduce contacts between Airways and the local rulers to a minimum, and to keep arrangements so far as possible in the hanas of the local political authorities on the one hand, and tne Sheikh on the other, ror these reasons we should, I think, have preferred on the vhole to have left the draft as it stands on this point and see how things went in practice, our assumption being that our position in the various States would in ordinary circumstances be such as to enable us to deal effectively with obstruction on the part of minor state officials. If responsibility for the supervision of the aerodromes (save as regards customs, quarantine, police and passports) is vested in Imperial Airways as the Agents appointed for this purpose by His Majesty’s Government under the terms of an agreement with the Sheikh, the risks of friction with foreign companies the responsibility for which will fall upon His Majesty’s Government, seem likely to be greater. On the other/other hand certain ot the supervisory functions under Document A (checking of licences, logbooks, etc., compliance with requirements of certificate of airworthiness, compliance with rules &amp; s to lights and signals and rules for air traffic) can clearly most satisfactorily be discharged only by a relatively expert agency. 4. On the whole, then, m the light of the above considerations and of the views of the Resident and Dickson, we should be prepared, subject to any views expressed by Foreign Office or Air Ministry, to accept lowle's proposal, subject possibly to the insertion in the draft addition proposed oy him after the word '’supervision* 1 of the words ’’in respect of such aerodrome or aerodromes,' (on the understanding, of course, that, as suggested by him, passport, customs and medical arrangements should remain wholly in the hands ol the Sheikh's passport and customs officials and 01 the Quarantine Medical Officer respectively and that police responsibility would equally vest wholly with the State). u) * As regards Fowle's note on clause 10, we have, I think, always recognised that there must be slight variation* in the form of these agreements to meet local circumstances. But/But by way of maintaining the principle, if not the practice of quarantine control, it would, I think, be better to retain the Quarantine Clause in the Agreement with Muscat in respect of Gwadur, even if in present conditions clause 10 is a de&amp;a letter so far as Gwadur is concerned. 6. I am sending a copy of this letter to Warner and to Peirse. We should be most grateful if you could let us have vour views as early as possible, (I fear pressure of other work here has already involved some delay in dealing with Fowls's points), since it is now becoming quite urgent to dispose of these questions of procedure, wnich are to some extent holding up action on the Dutch request for facilities on the Arab route. Could you in this connection let me have the particulars to be printed as the first Schedule to Document C? We should also be glad to have (at any rate in the case of Bahrein and possibly Gwadur, which are alone of immediate importance) the particulars for insertion in the Second schedule to the same document, so that comprehensive instructions can be sent to the Resident.

I concur and suggest as an alternative for Bahrain that a lump sum might be paid for customs exemption, and that the Shaikh and His Majesty’s Government shall split up the landing fees on some equitable basis. This will certainly make easier my negotiations with the other Shaikhs* If any particular aerodrome, other than Bahrain, is of importance enough to merit a customs exemption subsidy, this subsidy can be paid on the basis of what the Company’s actual imports may be, plus the same division of the landing fees as for Bahrain. If, however, at an intermediate station, such as Kuwait, it is contemplated that the imports will be very little, if any, no subsidy will be paid, and only the landing fees will be shared. If the Company intend to treat any aerodrome merely as an emergency landing ground, and little or no expense is incurred in its upkeep or manage ment, (i. e .

It was thought preferable to deal with this question independently of the Agreements and Regulations for civil aerodromes and by means of a separate exchange of letters, to which it would &amp;Department. be unnecessary to give publicity, between the Resident and the ruler concerned. 2. The Secretary of State trusts that no difficulty need be anticipated in securing an undertaking of the i nature suggested above from the Arab rulers affected. He would be glad, i if no objection is seen, if the Political Resident could be instructed to take the necessary action in the matter, and to endeavour to ensure that the exchange of letters to cover the requirements in question shall take place simultaneously with the signature by the individual rulers concerned of the Agreements, etc. referred to in my letter No. dated .

As regards points (b) and (d), the Council assume that any instructions which Sir Samuel Hoare may consider to be necessary in this connection will be issued to the Political Resident. As regards the excepted point referred to above, the Council agree that it should form the subject of an exchange of letters between the Political Resident and the The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office.Sheikhs, and that the actual terms of the communication to he made to the rulers in question should he discussed informally between the interested Departments, I am also to refer to clause 14 of the Draft Air Navigation Regulations and to state that, as regards the Trucial Coast, the Air Council understand that the * • question of the issue of an Order in Council regarding the jurisdiction of the political authority will receive the separate consideration of the Secretary of State. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, * i *Secretary of State, v The question of the procedure to govern the provision, leasing and maintaining of civil aerodromes on the Arab Air Aoute has been under discussion for a considerable time interdepartmentally ana v/as examined in some aetail curing Colonel Fowle* s recent visit. As a result, provisional agreement has been reached as oetween the Foreign Office, India Office and ^ir Ministry as to the outlines of a new procedure. that the Arab rulers concerned shall be advised to make air navigation regulations of their own in terms drafted oy us; to issue a special authorisation in respect of all aircraft permitted to fly over and land in their territories; to lay down in terms approved by us conditions to govern the use of their aerodromes, and finally to enter into an agreement with H.M.C. under Alien n.lvi.G, shall have exclusive rights, subject to certain conditions, to establish and maintain as the agents of the Sheikh and subject to the terms of the air navigation regulations etc. referred to above, an aerodrome^and ancillary services within his territory nuT/r eta in/in respect of the use of such aerodrome and such ancillary services. The broad principle is that we should operate behind the facade of the local ruler concerned, ensuring, however, that full control in fact bii^ll rest with H.k.G. it will, of course, be incumbent on us at the same time to watch the financial interests of the ruler who, under the procedure contemplated, would receive an annual rent of £500 per The broad features of the new procedure are annum In respect of a civil aerodrome, the amount to he open/2 open 1'or reconsideration at the end oi four years. It seems probable that a rent of this figure will adequately meet tbe case in present circumstances. For the first couple of years it will, indeed, be if anything rather unduly favourable to the aneikh. which nave been worked out as the result of inter departmental discussion are provisionally as in the drafts attached on P.Z.2938/33. They will be submitted for approval in aue course. 4. While the Operations Side of the Air Ministry are, broadly speaking, satisfied with the arrangements which have been reached, they are anxious to be sure that strategic requirements on the route are adequately safeguarded before they conrnit themselves. The drnft- Air Ministry letter of 15th May on P.Z.2841 below and the draft reply now submitted for approval have both been composed in close consultation between the Operations side of the Ministry and the Political Department here. For the reasons given in the draft the Department thinks that it should be possible fully to meet any apprehensions which the Air staff may entertain. Once this has been done and approval given here to the air regulations, etc., tnose regulations will be sent officially for concurrence to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 3.

In the Secretary of State’s view the only point which it should he necessary to cover in an exchange of letters sucn as is suggested in the preceding paragraph is that set out in paragraph 2(e) of the Air Council letter under reply. 4. As regards the point discussed in para.2(h) of that letter, the Air Navigation Regulations and + r connected documentsrlh tne form in the which they emerged from/recent interdepartmental discussion will, in the first place, preclude any air craft, whether British or foreign, from flying over or landing in the territory of the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf save under a special authorisation issued hy the ruler of the territory concerned.

Subject to the views of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Sir Samuel Hoare ’ considers that this question should continue to be dealt with on the same lines ana that H.In.G., in view of their special treaty relations with the Arab rulers of the Gulf, their political position in the Gulf area, and the indirect liability which they assume ,for protection, etc. of aircraft permitted to fly the Arab Route should continue to stipulatio a corresp onding In the case of British a-i-reraft 7 air/ ^ —M*?

It seems in any case unnecessary to cover this point in any specific agreement with Arab rulers since, as pointed out above, no ruler can in fact exercise any influence on the route to be followed save over his own State or territorial waters. But the fact tnat the special authorisations of the Sheikhs concerned and facilities at the various aerodromes can be withheld on future occasions from offending aircraft seems a sufficient deterrent against serious contravention of prescriptions ;iven in regard to route. p. The question referred to in para, ^(d) of your letter was discussed in considerable detail at the meeting at the Air Lin is try on 5th Lay, at which the Secretary of State notes that ^t.Col, i?owle, whose advice must necessarily carry great weight, was of ^ opinion that it would be preferable to make no speciiic provision for the point. The Secretary of State entirely shares this view. In his opinion it would oe better to regard tne liability for protection as a duty automatically falling on the loca1/ rlocal ruler concerned (subject, possibly, if for any reason protection ^as at present in the case of 3hargah# were likely to involve the provision of special police or the like, to a readiness to nake some financial contribution .to cover unusual expenditure by the ruler). If and when public aerodromes are opened at places such as Shinas or Kalba, where the problem of protection may be thought to present special features, special provision can, if necessary, be made in the agreement with the tj sneikh, if tne circumstances at the time are thought to render this ‘desirable. But it will not be over looked that a specific demand for such an assurance is far from unlikely to h| proauc^a counter demand for an additional subsidy or, (as was recently exemplified in the case of the Sheikh of ^atar) for a political assurance of a kind which it might be most undesirable to give, and in Sir Samuel Hoare's viev|it will be test not to raise the question specifically, but to let it be Known (as has already been done both in the ■ &amp; case of ^tar and Kalba) that the local rulers will be expected to give j good treatment to aeroplanes which may be obliged to land in tneir territories and that any failure on their part to secure the safety and interests/Interests of aircraft will result in the application of sanctions by H.L.G 7.

I am commanded by the Air Council to refer to the two meetings held at Gwydyr House on the 25th April and 5th May, 1933, respectively, to discuss the best means of safe guarding the interests of His Majesty’s Government on the Arabian Coast air route, and to state that the Council note that in the view of the political departments it would be preferable to omit reference to strategic requirements from the agreement to be concluded between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh concerned. The Council are prepared to accept this view, provided that the strategic f requirements which, in their opinion, are of first importance, can be shewn to be fully covered, either under existing Treaties between His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh, or by some exchange of notes to be made at the time when the agreement in regard to the provision of air facilities in the Sheikh's territory is concluded. The Under Secretary of State India Office, S.W.l. . ^QOPY SENT ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER •No. 20 18 MAY. 1S35 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT.

The Council are aware that it is the view of the political departments that certain of the above strategical requirements are already sufficiently provided for in the existing treaties between His Majesty*s Government and the Sheikhs concerned. They would, however, like to be reassured as to the precise manner in which these requirements are covered by existing treaties or other means. They would also be glad to see * the form of the note which it is proposed to exchange with the Sheikhs concerned relating to any of the above strategical requirements not already covered. 4.

Mr. .Valiran, Under Secretary of state, Please see previous submission on P.Z.2273/33 below about the procedure in connection with the provision ol civil aerodromes etc. on the Arab Air Route. d. since the date ol* that submission there have been two meetings with the Air Ministry, at which the Foreign Cilice, Colonel Fowle (and in one case Captain Prior) were present, at wnich the whole subject has been exhaustively aiscussed. As a result it is for practical purposes now agreed (a) that our proposal tor a standardised procedure in respect of civil aerodromes in the Persian Gulf shall be accepted; (b) tfrut we shall operate, so far as possible, behind the facade of the local ruler concerned, ensuring, however, that full control In fact rests with H.L.G.; (c) that the terms of the agreement between H.1..G. ^.nu the ruler, the terms of the Air Navigation Regulations to be made by the ruler, the form of the authorisation to oe issued by the ruler, and the conaitions to govern the use ol the aerodrome to be drawn up with the approval of the ruler, shall be a s stated in the^ Mpendij? to the minutes of the meeting of 5th lay on P.Z. t3«^3-below. In their present xorm they are, I think, quite satisfactory from our point oi view, it will be noted that (with some difficulty) me Air Ministry have been persuaded to agree to an annual rent of £500 for a period of four years, retaining on the otner hand all landing fees and receiving a monopoly of the right to supply fuel and duty-free entry for fuel, me concession is a valuable one, and while £500 Bay be slightly m favour of the sheikh in the early period,it is very unlikely/unlikely to 'be so later. It is to be hoped, therefore, that we shall he able to pin them to this. At the meeting of btn lay the Air Ministry endeavoured to secure an extension of the period of four years to six and I offered to accept this in return for an increase to £750 a year for the whole period. That was more than they were prepared to accept. £500 for four years is a very satisfactory compromise. 3. Ivlilitary aircraft . It has been generally agreed that the Arab Air Houte being primarily a strategic route strategic requirements must have priority, and further that military aircraft should be uispensed from landing fees or from compliance with ordinary civil regulations. The Operations side of the Air Ministry were anxious to specify these points in the regulations, etc. to be made by the Sheikh. The general sense of the meeting o£ 5th lay was definitely against this, and Colonel Fowle suggested that so far as any separate specific agreement in respect of military aircraft might be necessary it would most satisfactorily be secured by an exchange of letters between the Political Resident and the ruler concerned. It was agreed that the draft of such letter should be prepared here in consultation with the Air Ministry. I-«.ttuuQh e^pie^ uf prnl iminMuj uui 1 bMdlianggj ULli Lhcim— 4. Once official agreement has been reached as to the content of the Civil Air Regulations etc. to be made by the Sheikhs and as to the form of the letter referred to in the preceding paragraph, it would be for us to send the correspondence officially to the Political Resident, asking him, if he sees no objection on any point, to take the necessary action in regard to the Arab governments concerned. The/The Shargah Agreement, which is for a term of 11 years, H.A.F. and the State of Bahrein in respect of the military aerodrome in Bahrein, which will remain in force until the expiry of its term. The State, ouring the currency of the Air Agreement will continue to receive an annual rent of £120 in addition to the rent of £500 which will he admissible to them under the Civil Air Regulations. will not be affected.

On the question of quarantine, Gapt» tTfor said, that State regulations at Bahrein were very strict® When there was an outbreak of Plague at Basrah, 3rd-class passengers on steamers were not allowed to land at Bahrein at all. Gclonel Fowle said that he did not see why there should be any difficulty so far as n through” passengers on aircraft were concerned, if they were not allowed outside the aerodrome or rest house. He said he would mention the question of quarantine when at Bahrein, and no difficulty need by anticipated in fixing things up satisfactorily* Regulations raised the question of the legal iDosition of the political agents. Under an Order in Council, all foreigners at Bahrain were under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent and, as all fliers would be foreigners, it would he for tae Political Agent, and not the Sheikh, to deal with contraventions of the regulations. Under an Order in Council in conteiaplation for Kcweit, the position there would be the same. *£here is not at present an Order in Council applicable to Sharjah. ‘She position of Sharjah might require further consideration. One method of dealing with the ITrucial area would be an Order in Council for the Trueial Coast, but it seemed probable that there might he some difficulty about this. The matter* would be taken up separately by the India Office* So far as Muscat territory is concerned the Political Agent has power only over British subjects. Infringements of the regulations in Muscat territory^would be a matter for the Sultan. Capt. Pr^or raised the question of Accident regulations and mentioned the responsibilities of the Political Agent in the case of shipping. After discussion it was agreed to omit reference to accidents as the regulations were to be confined to matters concerning the Sheikh. ' If an accident to a British aircraft occurred in the Sheikh r s territory, the Air Ministry would arrange for it to be investigated if necessary (probably by the Government of Indlai on Air Ministry behalf as in the case of an accident to an Imperial Airways 1 aircraft at Jask s 0:20 tine ago). in the Heading, Clauses 1, 6, 15 (ili) and 16, the omission of Clauses 15 and 14, and the insertion after Clause 11 of a new clause relating to passports. forward some proposed amendments affecting Clauses 1 to 7, and also proposed an additional clause (No*20). substantial criticism of the Air Ministry draft on the matters of substance ; but the India Office fooling (as expressed on orevious occasions and he thought shared by the Foreign Office) was''that it was desirable to (Emphasise the importance of the Sheikhas position, and so fax* as possible, while retaining the real control ourselves on all points of importance, to operate behind the facade of the Mr. Laithwaite said that Clause 15 of the Draft The Draft Regulations were agreed, subject to amendments The revised regulations are set out in attachment ’’A' hereto 2.

Delete and read:- In reply to Mr. laithwaite, Mr. Rendel said that in principle he saw no objection to a series of direct agreements between the various local Bulers and H.M.O. The international aspect of such agreements would depend entirely on their terms If these agreements were made, it might be even more difficult for H.M.O. to shelter themselves behind the Mulers as they had done in the past, but that arrangement* had never worked satisfactorily as no foreign Power would ever believe that • i.G. could not in practice influence the Rulers in whatever way they desired, on the other hand, if any difficulties arose between Imperial Airways and the Rulers, H.M.G. would have a better locus standi then they would have if the aerodromes were merely State aerodromes and leased to Imperial Airways direct. Page 4 (first paragraph) . After 'had not been consulted” add:- There was t however, one point of view from which It was desirable that the Sheilch should be at any rate formally associated with the giving of consent or refusal in such oases. H.M.G. did not wish to be involved in difficulties similar to those which had arisen over the Xoweit oil concession. On that occasion we had laid great stress on the Sheikh having a completely free hand, we had thus been precluded from influencing him effectively and at the same time the Sheikh was able to attribute his decision to pressure from H.M.G., if it proved unpalatable. thus had the disadvantages, but none of the advantages, of the position of official advisers to the Sheikh.-vti-.,.

His views which had only been received since the circulation of the draft regulations made it necessary again to reconsider the position and a further alternative suggestion would be put to the meeting 0 Colonel Shelmerdine said that it had already been agreed that it was desirable to introduce a uniform procedure in respect of aerodromes along the Arabian coast and Gwadur - ioe 0 to establish uniformity along the whole route between Basrah and Karachi, A o 0 o C o Iraq had proposed certain fundamental conditions (i) (i) Imperial Airways and foreign aircraft must be under sufficient control to ensure that if necessary they can be prevented from using the route, or such portion of it as it may be thought necessary to close at any time for military or political reasons.2 (ii) Civil companies and private individuals must be prevented from having any direct dealings with Sheikhs 0 (iii) Our agreements with Sheikhs must he so worded that we have a monopoly as regards air facilities and they must be prevented from negotiating with foreigners for similar rights. jt 0 To meet these views the Air Ministry now put forward the following proposals:« (1) There should be a uniform procedure at all the aerodromes used by the civil air route on the Arabian coast at Crwadur,, (2) An agreement should be made between H D MoGro and the Sheikh:- (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (3) All be s - (a) (b) The Sheikh to allow H 0 M 0 Gr 0 to establish and maintain an aerodrome and ancillary services on the Sheikh 5 s territory 0 The Sheikh to permit Imperial Airways Ltd 0 to operate an air service over the Sheikh ? s territory and to use the aerodrome,;' The Sheikh to permit RoA 0 F 0 aircraft to use the aerodrome 0 The Sheikh to permit British private aircraft to use the aerodrome if HoMoGr 0 has given permissiono The Sheikh to undertake not to grant to anyone other than EoM^Cos either facilities for the operation of a service or permission to establish and maintain an aerodrome.

(o) this clause should stand, {d^ this clause should be omitted on account of tbe decision to exclude for the present private flyers from the Trucial coast. (e) this clause should be omitted as being unnecessary since rulers are precluded from dealing direct with foreign governments. (f) this clause should stand (It might possibly have to be invoked against a Russian or 'Persian air service ) 0 / (s&gt;(g) this olauae should stand subject to the deletion of the word 'private” a It was agreed that permits (from the sheikh) for aircraft to fly in and over his territory should be issued for convenient periods in the case of regular air lines which alone will be concerned for the present 0 Single permits will be required for private flyers when this route is open to them 0 No permit will be necessary for R.A.Po aircraft 0 Permits to use the aerodrome would be granted by K„M 0 Government with the consent of the sheikh under (f) of the agreement 0 The question of the rent to be paid to the sheikh for the aerodrome was then discussed* Mr 0 laithwaite said that the India Office must definitely press for a fairly high figure and desire^standardisations of rent for these aerodromes 0 Ee suggested a payment of £500 a year for two years covering Imperial Airways landing fees,, exemption from customs duties on petrol and oil, aircraft, aircraft spares, aero engines and aei*o engine spares, W/T apparatus and W/T spares, and the sole right to resell fuel and oil to civil aircraft; but be finally consented that the Air Ministry should consider the following alternatives:- ^ a) A rent of £500 a year for four years covering all landing fees Imperial Airways and others), exemption from customs duties as above, and the sole right to resell fuel and oil. This alternative will unduly favour the sheikh at first but in the event of regular French and Dutch landings later on, might become favourable to HcM 0 Government) Q b) A rent of £400 a year for four years covering landing fees of Imperial Airways, exemption from customs duties as above, and the sole right to resell fuel and oil; in addition the Sheikh to receive l/3rd of the amount of the landing fees from foreign aircraft at the rates in force for the use of R„A«,F a aerodromes 0 ' , Nothing to be paid in respect of R fc A 0 F 0 landings in either case; the R*A*F* normally to provide their own supply of fuel and oil* * J o Colonel Fowie said that he thought it would suffice for Through passengers on the air service to shew their passports at the Trucial coast aerodromes (this would also suffice in the case of the night stop at Sharjah) c -rn-h-P.. ■ f| .. | --| Tr -^ rrn - |r | 1 i&gt; inn i ^ W /T along the Arabian coast .

My dear Ken, V.e have gone very rapidly through the draft Air rfegulations produced hy Bertruik for discussion at t;.is afternoon's meeting, of which I understand copies have been sent to the Foreign Office, ana the note which I enclose (of which I have sent copies to him and to Peirse) represents our provisional views. As you will see, we are not quite sure as regards procedure that there may not be something to be said for proceeding on the basis of a modification of the Jhargah arrangements. Prima facie I am inclined to think tnut a procedure of the nature suggested in this note would adequately safeguard us so far as dealings with foreigners were concerned. Everything would be in the name of the oheikh and, while the agreement would be with H.L.G., it would be subject to the existence of antecedently made regulations, etc. in respect of use by foreigners ana the like. K.rt. Johnstone, Ssq Foreign office. » We/NOTES ON PROCEIURE IN CONNECTION WITH AIR AGREEIffilTTS. 1. in the case of Shargah, the Sheikh's agreement is with His Majesty's Government, Imperial Airways being appointed as their agent. The position is different from that at Bahrein etc, in that foreigners are not at present admitted to the Shargah resthouse. But, especially in the light of the Air Officer Commanding's views, it might he possible as a compromise to adopt elsewhere a modification of the Shargah procedure; the general effect to be that the local ruler would make general air regulations and would prescribe the terms on which foreign aircraft might use the aerodrome in his State. Subject to the terms of such regulations etc. he would enter into an agreement with His Majesty's Government to lease the aerodrome in question for a period of years with power to appoint Imperial Airways as their managers within the terms of the regulations (both general and as affecting foreign and private flyers). Airways in recovering landing dues from foreign planes, in charging such planes at a fixed rate for services rendered, etc. would do so indirectly as the agent of the Sheikh and within the terms of his regulations, and in recovering charges etc. from foreign planes would do so at rates fixed by him and under his authority. All correspondence would, of course, go through the political channel. 3 . Imperial Airways - Customs exemption . (i) We remain of our previous opinion that in view of the financial position of these States, any customs exemption granted should be in respect of fuel and lubricant imported for refuelling only (and preferably in returnreturn for some financial composition )• This view was previously accepted by the Foreign Office in connection with the Bahrein agreement. (ii) Spare parts specially sent to Bahrein or elsewhere or kept in stock there to remedy defects might be covered by a composition, as suggested by Colonel Burchall• (iii) Other material for use by the service should p&amp;y duty. (This represents our previous view which the Foreign Office shared)• (iv) Imperial Airways mentioned an annual grant of £250 to cover rent and exemption from fuel duty and duty on spare parts. The Resident is in favour of a composition rather of this nature. The question of rent is referred to below. A sum of, say, £130 or £150 might be fixed as the composition in respect of exemption from fuel duty and duty on spare parts. Rent for Aerodrome . The India Office remain of their previous opinion that (particularly as this is a concession the value of which will increase) it would be preferable that the annual rent, which we agreed might be a minimum of £120, shall be on the basis of a landing fee of Rs.5 per Imperial Airways plane, subject to a minimum of £120 in any year. In the case of foreign planes a similar fee of Rs.5 might be fixed. In both cases the rents should be open for reconsideration not later than 5 years from the date of the Sheikh’s licence. So far as Airways are concerned, they would be able to recoup themselves to what may be not a negligible extent for expenditure on maintenance etc. by the profit of 100^ allowed in respect of service charges and 25^ allowed in respect of fuel charges, and there might be no objection to a separate charge, say of 1 rupee or 2 rupees,on foreign planes, as a contribution towards overhead expenses. Miscellaneous points, (i) We remain of opinion that it is desirable to include provision about passports. The Gulf area is a special one and we are anxious to Iceep a very close control on people passing through it. (ii) If the matter is ultimately dealt with as suggested above, on thebasis of a formal agreement with His Majesty's Government, the agreement might specify that the aerodrome was the property of the ruler of X. It should also specify that His Majesty's Government assume responsibility for its maintenance in good condition. (iii) Provision should be made to give prior rights to Service aircraft. (iv) The position in the event of the lease coming to an end as regards the clearance of the ground, the right of acquisition or disposal of existing buildings, etc. should be ccvered. (v) For the phrase 'authorised person' in the Air Regulations it might be desirable to substitute 'officer of the Government'. (vi) There is something to be said for amplifying the Regulations as regards customs, quarantine, etc. (vii) Finally, and to this the India Office attach great importance, it should be specified, as suggested in the original tentative India Office draft, that while Airways sjre appointed as the managers of the aerodromes they should have no correspondence or dealings with the local rulers, save through the political authorities. Ho difficulty should arise on this point at Koweit or Bahrein at both of which there is a Political Agent and Staff. At GwadurGwadur and Shargah there are equally representatives of the Government of India or the Political Resident. 5. It seems desirable to deal more specifically with the 'private flyer' and to make it possible to impose some penalty (confiscation, imprisonment) as an alternative to a fine, the deterrent effect of which would be small* 6. Points which will need consideration are whether customs exemption for goods in transit shall be granted also to foreign air lines (the answer seems clearly yes); and on what terms Airways may be allowed to import refuelling oil (or spare parts) for sale to foreign flyers.

INDIA OFPICS, a.iv. 1. .P.Z.ii266/33. .VHIT.'iHALL, 22nd April 1933 Dear Duncan, In paragraph 1 of my letter to you No. p. 7,.2266/33 of 20th nprll, I referred to the uate of toe next Air rtoute meeting as sednesday, 26th April. Ihis is, of course, a mistatce for Tuesday, 25th April. I take the opportunity to refer to one point which was not touched on in my letter of 20th April. The Kesident mentioned at our meeting th^t there was some risk that the Jheikh might expect an addition to his subsidy in return for toe grant of permission to establish a public wireless station. VSe gathered that while airways, if they operate the station, will be prepared to carry the Jheikh's official messages free of charge, there could be no question of payment of any special additional subsidy to him. If this Is correct and he does put forward such a suggestion the answer must/ Flight lieutenant t.A. Duncan, Air ministry, .dastral House, Kingsway, *.C. 2.must presumably be that we are not prepared to make any additional payment in respect oX the opening of the public station ana that if the Sheikh Insists on Lj*AHLs ^.——r it we shell have no option but to does the (Station down* I am sending copies of this letter to Bertram, Blaxter, and Warner of the Foreign Office.

You will remember that there has been considerable discussion of the terms of the draft agreement to be negotiated between Imperial Airways and the Sheikh of Bahrein to govern the conaitions of employment by Airways of the civil aerodrome at Bahrein. While the terms of this agreement, which proved to raise a large number of general points of some importance, were still under discussion and before any decision had been reached we received a report from the Resident that Imperial Airways, who, under our agreement with the Sheikh of Shargah, are allowed to maintain a wireless station for service purposes only, had opened a public wireless station at Shargah and that a formal protest on the subject had been received from tne Sheikh, In the light of this incident and of the considerations to which attention had been drawn in connection with the draft Bahrein agreement, it seemed desirable to reconsider tne whole question of procedure in regard to Gulf aerodromes. The fact tnat Imperial Airways had made/n&amp;de a request to be allowed to negotiate an agreement for an aerodrome with tne Sheikh of Koweit and that the Sultan of Luscat was raising the question of the terms under which facilities were grunted to Airways at Gwadur was an additional reason for doing so. The general line that the Department thought the modification might take is indicated in the extract from a private letter to Colonel Powle dated 31st Aiarch 2. After informal discussion with the Foreign Office tne question was discussed generally at a conference at the Air Ministry on 3rd April, the provisional proceedings of which are attached and which are self-explanatory. It will be seen that, subject to closer examination of details, the general sense of the meeting was in favour of action on the broad lines suggested by the India Office - in other words, of the application (subject to consideration of special local circumstances) of the same principles in respect of all civil aerodromes in thecGulf ana to the concentration of control so far as possible in the hands of the local political authorities, it being provided that the activities/activities of Imperial Airways should be confined to ns-nagerial functions and that they should have no dealings of any sort with the Arab rulers save through the political authorities; finally, that the financial interests of the Arab rulers should not be overlooked. The effect of these proposals would be to place the real control in the hands of H.M.G., although all regulations etc. would issue in the name of the rulers There are obvious advantages in an arrangement of this nature from the point of dealing with complaints or requests from foreign powers. 3. Colonel Powle on his way home discussed the matter briefly with Air Vice Marshal Burnett, A.O.C. Iraq, who indicated that his views on the general question were as set out in his telegram of 4th April to the Air Ministry, of which a copy is below. The Resident had previously himself suggested in his telegram of 7th April to the Government of India, on P.Z.2028/33 below, the desirability of establishing State aerodromes in the arab Sheikhdoms, to be kept up by the States Governments under the advice of Airways, who would also have cnarge of wireless, and the Government/Government of India indicated their general agreement with his view. 4. As will he seen, there is no very substantial difference in principle between tne arrangements suggested by the Political Department and discussed at the meeting at the Air Ministry on 3rd April and those proposed by the Resident. The A.O.C.*s proposals on the other hand go rather farther. The question generally was discussed yesterday at an informal meeting with the Foreign Office, at which Colonel Fowle was present. The Foreign Office were on the whole disposed to think that from the point of view of international relations the balance of advantage lay m^iTgr with arrangements of the nature suggested by the Resident or by the India Office rather than with those suggested by Air Vice- Marshal Burnett, and it was generally agreed that this line should be taken on the resumption of discussion with the Air Ministry next week. /V.??INDIA OFFICE, LONDON, S. W. 20th April 1933. Dear Duncan, I write to put on record that the position in regard to the Shargah wireless station was informally discussed on the 19th April at a meeting at the India Office at which the Political Resident and representatives of the Foreign Office were present and v/hich you kindly attended. Provisional conclusions were reached as to the best methods of dealing with this problem and it was agreed that I should put them on record in a letter to you and that they should be brought up for consideration at the Air Route meeting which has been xixed for Wednesday, 26th April, in Shelmerdine’s room. 2. It was agreed in the first place, in the light of the information which you gave us, that the proposal that this ..question.- ^should be referred to the Imperial Communications Committee should be let drop and that no difficulty need arise in securing its expeditious disposal in the ordinary way. 3. As was made clear at the meeting at Gwydyr House on the 3rd April, the India Office see no objection to the maintenance/ Flight Lieutenant W.A. Duncan, Air Ministry, Adastral House, Kingsway, W. C. 2*maintenance of a public wireless station at Shargah (and, indeed, some possible advantage) so long as it is placed on a regular basis and the Sheikh’s consent obtained. On general grounds we are, however, definitely inclined to think that there is much to be said for the concentration of responsibility for public wireless arrangements in the Gulf under Imperial &amp; International Communications and if possible we should have preferred that responsibility for the Shargah station should be taken over by them. I understand from you, however, that this could not be done save at the cost of a subsidy which the Air Ministry are naturally very reluctant to have to pay and further that, while it may be anomalous that Imperial Airways should be responsible for running a private station, there is no objection of principle to their doing so if special circumstances seem to make this desirable* 4. After discussion the general sense of the ! meeting was that it was desirable to retain a public station at Shargah, subject to the Sheikh’s consent being obtained and to the necessary steps being taken (through the Government of India) to notify its existence to Berne; that in principle there seemed to be strong arguments in favour of the concentration under Imperial &amp; International Communications/Communications of wireless arrangements in the Gulf, hut that in the circumstances described above it would be best that at any rate for the present responsibility for operating the Shargah station should rest with Imperial Airways, the question of the transfer of responsibility to the Communications Company being reserved for consideration if at some future date receipts became sufficiently substantial to make it possible for the Communications Company to take over the station v/ithout the assistance of a Government subsidy; and finally, that while Airways, in these circumstances, should operate the station, it would be desirable that the concession to be granted by the Sheikh for its maintenance should be granted to His Majesty’s Government, Airways being appointed by His Majesty’s Government as their Agent. If this view is accepted by next Tuesday’s meeting we will write to the Government of India as regards the notification of the station to Berne and will also arrange for the despatch of the necessary instructions to the Gulf as to the reply to be made to the Sheikh of Shargah’s protest and the concession to be obtained from him for the r etention of a public station* 5* On a connected point you were good enough to say tha t/that you would make enquiries of Imperial Airways as to the position in regard to the acceptance of public traffic at the Gwadur wireless station# 6.

Imperial Airways could then be given authority to use either and to act as our agents, collecting landing fees for transmission to Air Ministry as has been done for Baghdad West and Gwadur. I consider that all landing grounds on the present air route to India should be military so that we can retain control and avoid complications in the future when dealing with both British and Foreign civil air lines.

These being under the control of ruler and the latter being susceptible to our influence, some measure of control vis-a-vis foreign aircraft in emergency would still remain with His Majesty’s Government.

Cui onel ^helmerdl ne said that the meeting had originally been arranged to diacuss a proposed draft agreement between Imperial Airways Ltd .9 and the Bahrein (loremment tor the operation of air services to and from Bahrein; but he understood that the India Office wiehed now to brin*: forward a proposal which, if adopted, would entail extensive altera tion in the draft agreement drawn up bv the company, or possibly a different form of agreement altogether. Mr. Laithwaite said that the India Offloe had had under consUU m il on the whole of the civil aviation arrange ment* in the Persian *htlf area and were deairoua of establish* ing them on a more satisfactory basis. The India Office were inclined to alter the method of handling this q testion. Their proposal was to draw up standing regiilations applicable in the case of all the sheikhs and the . ultan of Muscat* These regulations would acVtally be mafle by the rulers themselvea an the advice and r/ith. the concurrchce of ! lis a.Fety s aovemment The proposals siyW^S® India Office are in Appendices A, B an d C • The idea is that after the issue of standing regula- tiona (Appendix A) the ruler would lease a specified aerodrome to Imperial Airways Ltd. as Managers (Appendix B ) ant • enter into a financial agreement with the Company on the Htul of Appendix C. The India Office looked to the Air Ministry for advice. In particular in regard to the charges which could be levied for services (Appendix B(b)). Mr. Lmlthwale said ^ that it would be possible to prescribe that other companies aircraft could not go outside Imperial irways for une t. &gt;ecL. aerodrome services, Imperial Airways would retain ^erv^cs fees but not landing fees. Landing fees would be handed o?er» to the ruler. The adoption of an arrangement whereby the folerc would ma.ie the regulation® and all correspondence would be conducted throAgh political channel* would, ^r. rmlthw^ite said, strengthen the position of the India Office when dealing with any complaint from foreigners which might arise. The India ffic© were anxious that private Myers should be pro hibited from flying the Arab Coast route; Office proposals private flights would be prohibits moarregulations ismied by the rulers themselves. &amp; 1 ». Q.niel said that his first reaction to the proposal ess to support it strongly, rhe Air ministry representatives also gave it general support. Colonel Shelmerdine, however, expressed doubt as to whether ootrplete uniformity oould be attained and pointed out that private flyers at present used the aerodrome at Chiadar. (Jroup Captain Peirse raised the question of making an exception to the prohibition of private flying in favour of private aircraft owned by the oil companies and also in the case of pearling flights at Bahrein* It was agreed that a loophole should be left which would admit of special permission being given by the rulers in respect of oil companies 1 and pearling flights, and also that private flyers should be allowed to continue to uae the aerodrome at dwadar, but that apart from this a tight hand should be kept on 'exceptions'. iiT * ^y^al said that it was quite likely that the Ireuoh and tho Dutch would have to abandon the Persian route and this, togetuer with the fact that Imperial Airways and the loyal Air force fly down the Arab coast i^lght tempt private flyers to do the same. It was recognised that while private flyers are not at present likely to went to fly along the Arab coast route to India in preference to the Persian route, the xabilities on the latter route may deteriorate and the position become reversed| but it was decided to defer consideration of this point Uutil It beoams of practical importance Aa regards toe I«c»A«jN« aspect of the matter* the Foreign Office foit that the position was anomalous and they Old not want the question raised. It was not desirable that the local rulers should adhere to the Convention; but neither was it desirable they should act so in conflict with Its principles as to provoke a protest from the French and Dutoh, and so place His majesty a Government in an invidious position in having to defend their action.

It was agreed that the terms of the regulations, licence and agreement would need careful consideration and it was generally recognised tnat some minor variations might be necessary in the terms of the regulations to meet the special circumstances of the different States. The Air Ministry undertook to go into the matter further and to produce a preliminary statement of their views before Easter, with a view to further discussion on Wednesday, 19th April. (b) Bahrain Agreement . It was agreed that if action on the lines provisionally accepted in (a) above proved possible, the draft Bahrain Air agreement would have to be recast to conform with the new procedure and that it would not be profitable to consider it in detail at the present stage. (c) Kowelt Agreement . The meeting agreed that it was undesirable in principle that Airways should negotiate an agreement direct with the Sheikh of Koweit. The question of a Kowelt agreement and of its terms might be deferred until a decision had been reached on the procedure described in (a) above ‘J'V* U)tfjjfi) a&amp;argaO wireless, cussed. It was agreed: This incident was (&gt;5* (i) that the desirability of concentrating ail wireless in the Gulf In the hands of the Communications Company tfiould be considered; (11) that an imnediate reference should be made to the CoKmunications sub Committee of the C.I.D. on the subject of the Jhargah wireless station; that penning such a reference, ahich would be prepared by the Air Ministry, no answer should be sent to the representations made by the sheikh, and that despite the objections thereto the public station should be permitted to continue to function. (e) Facilities for the Dutch at Bahrain and Gwadur * It was agreed tdat tne Resident should he asked to approach the Gheikh of Bahrain and the Bultan of Muscat witn a view to obtaining the requisite facilities and that the Foreigi Office should simultaneously send a further Interim reply to the Dutch to this effect t warning them at the same time that the Imposition of landing fees by the /irab rulers concerned was understood to be under consideration and that neither on this point nor on the question of the financial terms on ahich facilities could be provided at the aerodromes in question could a final statement yet be made. (f) Kjacellaneous. (1) Private flyers. Die desirability of a general prohibition by the local rulers of all save specially authorised private flights, and of imposing sanctions for failure to comply with such prohibition, was generally accepted. It was agreed that the matter could best be dealt with in the general regulations referred/erred to in (a); * (li) it was agreed in principle that having regard to the strategic importance ot the .vrab air route, strategic must take priority over civil requirements in all cases where the same landing ground was common to the civil and the strategic air routes.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/1980</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000206</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/1980</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/30 ‘Air Route to India (Arab Coast): Procedure in connection with provision of civil aerodromes etc; Agreements between H.M.G. and local rulers along the Arabian Coast; Special authorisations’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1933/1939</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-20T23:31:37</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (393 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the inside front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 394; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and related notes on the drafting of general procedures for the provision of air facilities along the Arabian Coast Air Route, which would form the civil air agreements for Bahrain, Kuwait (also spelt Koweit), and Muscat.
