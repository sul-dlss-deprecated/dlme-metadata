SECRET. P.Z. 6646/35 PERSIA. 1. British and Indian interests in Persia relate principally to : — (1) The oilfields of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. This is mainly a British interest. (2) The maintenance of an adequate buffer State for the protection of India against the possibility of military aggression or Communist penetration from Russia. This is not so important as in the case of Afghanistan, owing to the desert character of the Indo-Persian border and the absence of any difficult tribal problem there. Nevertheless, from this point of view T the existence of a strong and independent Persian Government is to be preferred to the division of the country into Russian and British spheres of influence. (3) Our interest in the Persian Gulf as an approach to India, and in particular nowadays as the main air route to India and the East. The centre of gravity, so far as our interests are concerned, has recently shifted from the Persian to the Arab shore. But, in view of the regular trade and intercourse between the two coasts and the affinities of their populations, the Persian Gulf is still regarded to some extent as constituting a single problem. Our interest in preventing any outside Power from obtaining a naval base or fortified port in the Gulf remains as stated in Lord Lansdowne’s declaration of 1903, though the danger of any Power seeking to do so has become remote with the emergence of a strong central Persian Government, the establishment of the State of Iraq in alliance with us and of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the consolidation of our position on the Arab shore. 2. Whereas expenditure in Afghanistan, Sinkiaug and Nepal, and in regard to Tibet, is defrayed entirely from Indian revenues, diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia is shared between the Government of India and His Majesty’s Govern ment, the former of whom man the following consular posts in South and East Persia:—Bushire, Bandar Abbas and Kerman—two which are at present united, Mohammerah (a vice-consul), Meshed and Seistan (“ Zabul ”)—at present united— Duzdap (“ Zahidan ”), Birjand (vice-consul;. 3. Since the accession of Reza Shah the authority of the Government at Tehran has been gradually consolidated and extended over the whole country. This has been accompanied by a revival of Persian nationalism in a very sensitive form. Consequently, our position in the south and east is very different from what it was when, in default of any strong central authority, we had to deal with semi independent chieftains and tribes in the neighbourhood of the Gulf and the Indian border. Various functions which were once performed through British agency have been handed over to the Persian authorities. For example, in 1928 quarantine control was thus transferred, and in 1932 the land telegraph lines which had been operated by the Indo-European Telegraph Department were handed over to the Persian Government. Lighting and buoying in the Gulf has up to now been performed by British agency, but the lights on the Persian shore and in Persian territorial waters are now about to be transferred to the Persian authorities. The British naval stations at Henjam and Basidu (the latter long since disused, but maintained under a caretaker) were sore points with the Persian Government, and as these places were in effect hostages to Persia, which enabled her to keep up a constant series of pinpricks, they have now been relinquished. The main naval station will now be transferred to Bahrein, while facilities for recreational purposes, &amp;c., have also been obtained at Khor Quwai in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat. 4. From 1928 to 1934 unfruitful negotiations were in progress, with intervals of suspension, for the conclusion of a general treaty with Persia to settle various outstanding questions. Our principal desiderata in these negotiations were the abandonment of Persia’s claim to Bahrein, her recognition of our special treaty relations with the States on the Arab shore, a lease of Henjam and relinquishment of Persian claims to the islands of Tamb and Abu Musa, which belong to the Sheikhs of Ras al Khaimah and Sharjah. On our side we were prepared to 4087—3 35 9.352 relinquish our claim to Basidu, recognise Persian sovereignty over the island of Sirri, make a concession to Persian amour propre in regard to arrangements for the suppression of the slave trade, relinquish £1.510,000 of debt incurred by Persia during the war and post-war period, and continue (at financial loss) to run the Indian section of the Duzdap Railway (which was closed down in 1931), the Persian section of that railway being, of course, ceded to Persia. Now that it has been decided to transfer the naval station from Henjam, there is little concrete advantage to be gained from pursuing general negotiations for a treaty. It is unnecessary to treat the Persian claim to Bahrein too seriously. Persia has exercised no kind of authority there since the Persians were expelled in 1783 by the Arabs of the main land. The Persian claim has been exhaustively analysed here, m order that we might be prepared with a good case if Persia should seek a decision on her claim from the League of Nations. In 1934 the Law Officers were asked to advise whether Persia possesses any rights in Bahrein, and stated that in their opinion she has no rights either of sovereignty or suzerainty. It may be added that, though Persia has at various times stated her claim to the League of Nations, she shows no signs of desiring to seek a League decision on the matter.
