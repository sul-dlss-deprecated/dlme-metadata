Three additional foliation sequences are also present in parallel between ff 118-123, ff 191-203 and ff 212-216; these numbers are also written in pencil, but are not circled. The sequence includes two foliation anomalies: f 29a and f 172a.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and other papers relating to slaves' manumission applications heard at Sharjah. For each case, there is the initial correspondence, including the slave's manumission statement, sent from the Residency Agent at Sharjah ('Abd al-Razzaq Razuqi), followed by return correspondence from the Bahrain Agency confirming that a manumission certificate could be issued. Office notes at the end of each case briefly discuss the decision on manumission.In all but two cases included in the file manumission was granted, usually on the grounds either of the slave's ill-treatment by their master, or the prospect of them being sold. In two cases, the British Agent refused manumission: first in the case of a woman who, according to the Sharjah Agent, had visited 'places of prostitution' (folio 122), and second in the case of a man who was alleged to be already free (f 129). The cases featured in the file are also detailed in the Bushire subject file IOR/R/15/1/212.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024e#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
