British Consulate, KhoiH 1 af iSTIayir, 6th ?^ay # 1942. S1 2l ' x have the honour to report that on the night or the 29th April the British India Steam Navigation Company^ s. s, SUISANG caught fire at Abadan whilst loading tins of aviation petrol. It is understood that the fire started in the coal bunkers and that certain Anglo-Iranian Oil Company personnel with considerable personal courage covered down^the ship f s hatchways in an endeavour to prevent the fire spreading* and very nearly succeeded in getting it under control. However, the fire spread and the petrol exploded and the ship had to be abandoned and floated downstream. It beeam® a total loss and the burnt out hull now lies aground just off the Persian bank of the Shatt—al-Ar&amp;b some ton miles below Abadan, An enquiry has been conducted by the Port of Basrah authorities and I believe that sabotage or neglect is not suspected, though this cannot be entirely discounted as no satisfactory explanation has been offered either. The vessel was a hired Military Transport or Supply ship. The finding of the Court is presumably still under consideration in Basrah and T may not hear the official result for some time, if at all. The loading and cargo was under the su erintendence of the Hea Transport Officer and the Tavy have disposed of the wreckage so as not to be a danger to shipping. 2, A small table safe containing the Master’s copies of code tables, a small sura of money, and a revolver, appears to have been overlooked, and some Arabs removed it from tue wreck* The matter was reported to me and I sent an Arab leader named Haji Faisali in the Consulate launch to endeavour to locate the safe. Haji Faisali discovered about nine or ten Arabs whom he suspected had had something to do with it, and soon each was endeavouring to fix the blame upon the other. Later, when the Arabs were told of the contents and that only the revolver and the papers were wanted, one youth gave out that another of the Arabs had shown him the revolver. This man was already in custody with the Police at the instance of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company s Security Officer, who had joined up with Haji j?aisali upon getting a request from the Navy to help in the search. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's Security Officer eventually succeeded in m&amp;King tne Arabs divulge where the safe was, and it was recovered from a creek where it had been thrown, presumably by the man who had been seen with the revolver. The paper contents were entirely inciner ated, and it nay be safely assumed the codes were not comiiomised. 3 # This is the second occasion recently upon which this Sheikh Haji Faisali, who lives in a village just behing the Naval Base at Khorramshahr, has been helpful to H.M.'s Consul. He was previously suspected of intriguing on oehall oi bhoin.h Chassib and was being much troubled by the local Police. Cince I have succeeded in persuading the Governor to make the Police and Amniyeh leave him and certain others like him alone, he and they have been co-operating very well, not only with me but also with the Governor. Only two days ago the son of another and more important Sheikh, Kabi by name, went to Bahiaanshire village at the Governor's request, and upon rny suggestion, to put a stop to certain minor disturbances, and was actually fired upon beiore he succeeded. I am hoping, perhaps too optimistically, in this way to bring Arabs and Persians together in a more conciliatory spirit than hitherto.
