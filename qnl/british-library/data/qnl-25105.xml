'V' CONFIDENTIAL . S.N.O. No.93. In compliance with your orders I have the honour to report that I left Bombay on 21st November at 6.30 a.m., and proceeded at ordinary speed (11.5) knots and reduced to economical speed on 23rd at 8 a.m. intending to arrive at Hen,lam in the forenoon of 25th November, on which day I expect®! 'Sphinx” would arriveat Bushire. 2. I arrived at Hen 3 am at 10.30 a.m. on 25th November and obtained telegraphic communication with 'Sphinx' at Bushire on her arrival that afternoon, also with the Resident there, informing the latter of my orders and asking him for further information concerning the pirates at Dayir, also for his advice in dealing with the natives of Dayir, I also informed the Resident informally that I hoped he might be able to come in 'Sphinx” and join me. 3. On 26th November I received a telegram from the 'Sphinx' suggesting, at the request of the Resident, that the 'Lapwing” at Muscat should join 'Redbreast” on the Makran Coast, for the suppression of arms traffic, I accordingly ordered 'Lapwing” there under orders of 'Redbreast”. 4 . I also received a telegram from 'Sphinx” saying that the Resident suggested visiting Lingah in 'Sphinx” to obtain further information concerning the pirates xfc of Dayir and a local guide, to which I agreed and telegraphed that I would meet 'Sphinx” at Lingah on 29th November and telegraphed the intended movements of 'Highflyer' and 'Sphinx” to you and The Commander in Chief, H. M. Ships and Vessels, EAST INDIES STATION. H. M .S. 'Highflyer”, Bombay, 23rd December 1907.3 the Admiralty. 5. On 27th November I received a telegram from the Resident, at Rushire to the effect that he cr nsidered it nnadvisable for political reasons that 'Highflyer” should appear at Lingah, I therefore altered my plans and arranged to await 'Sphinx's’' arrival at Henjam. The 'Sphinx” left Bushire on this date, 27th Nov, for Lingah with the Resident on board. 6 . On 29th November the 'Sphinx” joined 'Highflyer” at Hen,lain, bringing the Resident, two natives from Koweit who could identify the pirates, the native agent from Lingah, and a Sayyid (an influential man and a descendant of the Prophet) who had been obtained from a dhow at sea, he having volunteered to come. The Resident and Commarrier Litchfield dined with me that night when we discussed the question of the pirates of Dayir, and I decided that 'Sphinx' should leave the following day to obtain another witness from Shiwu, the sole survivor of the Persian Dhow which had been pirated in November 06, also to obtain a chow from Lingah or elsewhere in which to land the native agent and Sayyid at Dayir, to obtain further necessary information. I also decided that 'Highflyer' should leave Hen jam for a rendezvous off Dayir on 1st December. 7. On 30th November I went on board 'Sphinx' and held a further consultation, when the native Agent from Lingah and the Sayyid were interviewed, and decided that 'Sphinx' should leave at once for Dayir and obtain further information of the whereabouts of the pirates etc., through the Sayyid and Native Agent, who would be landed there in the dhow at night, also to find out (1) if the Khan of Dayir had harboured or was harbour ing the pirates, (2) the feeling of the.natives towards the pirates, (3) to obtain local guides from Dayir. As the Native Agent would require two days at Dayir I decided to postpone my departure until 4th December, and to join 'Sphinx' off Ras Naband on 5th December, by which time the dhow should have returned from Dayir, Ras Naband being chosen as a rendezvousT / rendezvous in order that ’’Highflyer 1 ’ should not appear near Dayir, before the proper moment, as her presence ir that locality would immediately arouse suspicion and it was absol utely necessary to obtain all possible information secretly. 8 . During our consultation the action to be taken at Dayir was fully discussed. It was presumed that the natives of Dayir would not oppose us, but it was fully recognised that they would not give any infor nation immediately they suspected that any active measures were being taken against the pirates, for fear of future treatment at the hands of the Khans of Dashti and Dayir (Father and Hon), who without doubt have harboured these desperadoes. The Resident, Native Agent and the Sayyid agreed with my suggestion that if sufficient evidence was obtained that the &lt;xk Khans were cognisant of, or had connived at the presence of the pirates in or near Dayir, or refused to hand them over, strong measures should be taken to bring them to understand their responsibilities, and I suggested that in the latter contingency the Fort in which the Khan of Dayir lived should be knocked down by gun fire, due warning having been given to the inhabitants. The broad outline of this action commended itself to the Resident, the Native /.gent and the Sayyid, who all said that it would have a more beneficial and lasting effect on the co-mmity, than the perhaps evil effects of attacking and burning a village, with the attendant possibilities of innocent blood being shed. 9. The Resident came on board ’’Highflyer” and the ’’Sphiax” left at 1 p.m. on 30th, for Lingah and Dayir. I ordered the 'Lapwing” from Jask to Bundar Abbas on 30th , to be at the disposal of the Consul there, as the Resident had received a telegram saying that the people there were inclined to panic owing to a threatened attack by nomad tribes from inland. I have heard nothing more on the subject and the ’’Lapwing” has returned to the Makran Coast. 10. During10. During my stay h T en,iam from 25th November to 3rd December, I landed the small arm companies, fully equipped, and the field and machine guns on several occasions for drill, which the Officers end Men much enjoyed in the delightful weather at this time of the year. 11. On 4th December at 6 a.m. I left Hen jam and arrived off Ras Naband at daylight on6th, where 'Sphinx' awaited my arrival and as a strong shamal was blowing and the dhow had not arrived fromDayir and it was impossible wider existing conditions to at^hor off Dayir, I took shelter under the lee of Sheik Shuaib Island, anchoring at 5 p.m., 'Sphinx' arriving later in the evening. 12. On 6th December, 'Highflyer' weighed at 8 a.m., the weather having moderated, and proceeded to Ras Naband, the 'Sphinx' having proceeded there at. 6 a.m. I found the dhow at 1 p.m. and communicated with her, the Native Agent coming on board bringing information that the pirates had left Dayir or its vicinity 15 days ago taking their families with them, the people there having made it unpleasant for them. It was reported that they had gone to Ganawa (Kanawa on chart), 50 miles to northward of Bushire, they having sworn to the KHaN of Bandar Rig ( a place close to) that they would live peacefully in that locality. This information was obtained from an owie r of a dhow (a Nakhoda) at Dayir, whose relatives had been killed by the pirates, by the Native Agent and the Sayyid before mentioned. Having obtained this information I proceeded at once to Dayir (leaving the hired dhow to be towed there by 'Sphinx') where I arrived at 7 p.m.; the 'Sphinx' arrived later and sent the Native Agent on shore that night to try and get the atove mentioned Nakhoda on board. 18. On Saturday 7th December, the Nakhoda having arrived on board in the morning, a further consultation was held on board(o hoard 'Highflyer', the Resident, Conw&amp;nder Litchfield, and the Native Agent being present, the Nakhoda stated that he had received a message from one of the pirates to the effect that he (the pirate) regretted having killed the Nakhoda's relations and that he had no idea that the murdered men were any relation to the Kakhoda. The Nakhoda had recently visited Ganawa where he had exchanged visits with the pirates and had accepted their hospitality, he further stated that he was now a friend of the pirates and could now help us and that he hoped with God 1 s help that the pirates would be caught. 14. Similar circumstances now presented themselves at Bandar Rig or Ganawa to those vrhich had existed at Dayir, which were fully discussed and a similar conclusion was arrived at regarding the action to be taken with the Khan of Bandar Rig as had been arrived at regarding the Khan of Dayir, and that similar pressure should be brought to bear on Bandar Rig, The 'Sphinx” then left Dayir for a rendezvous off Bandar Rig, and I went on shore with the Resident and paid a visit to the Khan of Dayir. Manor Sox and I having agreed to tell him that it was lucky for him that the pirates were not there, as we should have considered him equally culpable with the pirates, if he had harboured them, and Manor Cox fully and forcibly pointed out to him his responsibilities in harbouring pirates or conniving at acts of piracy, to which he made fatuous replies, denying of course any connection with the pirates and assuring us of his ready assistance in their arrest at anjr time. This Khan of Dayir is in my opinion a liar, and his father, the Khan of Pashti (the district in which Dayir is) is probably no better than his son, ?nd they are equally culpable in the harbouring of the pirates subsequent to the piracies in November 06 and January 07. 16. I returned on board at 3 p.m. and sailed immediately forj tk) ( for a rendezvous off Bandar Rig where I arrived at. daylight on 8 th December with 'Sphinx” on company, and anchored as close to the shore as possible (8000 yards for 'Highflyer' and 2500 yards for 'Sphinx') but had it been necessary I think I could have anchored 3000 yards off temporarily on a rising tide. I landed about 11 a.in. to see the Khan, with Ccmmant er Litchfield Lieutenant Collins my 1st Lieutenant and the Residency Dragoman as interpreter, having pretously arranged with Major Cox a verbal ultimatum for the Khan of Bandar Rig, in which I forcibly and clearly pointed out to him that the sons of Humaidi the pirates, were now at Ganawa with their families with his knowledge, that I had been ordered by the British Government to arrest them, and that I had come to warn him thad as he was harbouring and had given shelter to these pirates he had placed himself in the unenviable position of being regarded as equally culpable with them, and under these circumstances my orders would warrant my taking extreme measures to punish him as well as them, but before doing so, however, I would give him this brief opportunity of co-operat ing with me in effecting the pirates immediate capture (before sunset that day), failing which he must accept the consequences. I then called on him to tell me at once what methods he ‘proposed to adopt. The Khan appeared to be much upset by these summary measures and began to vacillate, and at first said he would do nothing without orders from the Persian Government, to which I replied that my orders were peremptory and that I had no intention of waiting for him to receive any orders or to communicate with his Government, which argument appeared to appeal to him and after an hour’s interview the Khan promised to arrest the pirates forthwith, and as it was now noon and time was important - he having 10 miles or so toto go to Ganav/a - the Interview ended, as I had every reason to believe that the Khan was thoroughly frightened. 16. I at once arranged for a signal from the shore to be made by the Khan if he had caught the pirates and then returned on board. The 'Highflyer” and 'Sphinx' weighed at 2.30 p.m. and on seeing a flog hoisted on the Fort at Ganawa at about 3.30 p.m. anchored off that place at 4 p.m. I landed at once with Lieutenant Collins and ’‘ajor Cox in a cutter manned and armed, picking up a cutter en route from 'Sphinx' also manned and o.rrned. We were received by the Khan on landing and after a brief discussion, two of the pirates were handed over to us, one pirate having escaped inland. We then proceeded on board, having seized the dhow belonging to the pi rates. 17. I left the following morning with 'Sphinx'in company, for Bushire (the 'Shinx' towing the captured dhow), where I arrived at 11 a.m. (9th December). The pirates are now in cells (9th December) on hoard and I have handed the dhow over to the custody of the Resident. IB. I beg to bring to your notice the valuable assistance given me by Major Cox, who came to join me at great personal inconvenience. I have no hesitation in saying that through his intimate knowledge of Persian Gulf affairs and its people, coupled with Irs invaluable advice, we were enabled to bring our search for the pirates to a successful conclusion. I have already written to Major Cox thanking him for his services. I would also bring to your notice, for the informa tion of the Indian Government, the valuable assistance rendered by the Native Agent at Lingah, who obtained the necessary information secretly, which led up to the eventual arrest of the19. Co inn and er Litchfield’s hearty co-operption was also of the greatest assistance. SO. I beg to submit for your favourable consideration the attached 1 : st of expenses in connection with the search for and capture of the pirates, which money I have handed over to Ma^or Cox for distribution, having first thoroughly discussed with him and agreed to the various charges as being reasonable. The services of the dhow for a week were absolutely necessary, as all information had to be obtained secretly. All the witnesses volunteered their services on promise of pecuniary reward, provided their identity was not revealed to anyone, particularly to the pirates, as they feared retaliation from the latter in the event of their possible release or escape from the fate which I sincerely hope awaits them. The services of the Sayyid and v akheda were of the greatest assistance. The Hakhoda also piloted our boats into the Khors of Bandar Rig and Ganav/a, which was no easy matter, particularly at the latter place. 21 . I omitted to state that during my interview with the Khan of Bandar Rig, he asked me how he would be rewarded if he captured the pirates and handed them over to me, I replied that his reward would bo immediate, as in that case I should not have to resort to extreme measures and I added 'If you comply with my demands (to hand the pirates over before sunset favourable that evening) J will bring your good services to the/not Ice of the British Government, also your own'. I trust that my assurances to him will meet with your approval and that you v/ill be pleased to forward them in the proper direction. 22. During my stay a t Bushire I enjoyed the hospitality of the Resident there and I wee able to discuss the various matters in connection with the fate of the pirates. Many telegrams \the pirates. 19.

I beg to submit for your favourable consideration the attached 1’st of expenses in connection with the search for and capture of the pirates, which money I have handed over to ' f a t ior Cox for distrihution, having first thoroughly discussed with him and agreed to the various charges as being reasonable.

The services of the Cayyid and v akheda were of the greatest assistance. The Hakhoda. also piloted our boats into the Khors of Bandar Rig and Ganav/a, which was no easy matter, particularly at the latter place. 21. I omitted to state that during my interview with the Khan of Bandar Rig, he asked me how he would be rev/arded if he captured the pirates and handed them over to me, I replied that his reward would be immediate, as in that case I should not have to resort to extreme measures and I added 'If you comply v/ith my demands (to hand the pirates over before sunset favourable that evening) I wi 11 1:ring yonr good services to theynotice of the British Government, also your own”. I trust that my assurances to him will meet with your approval and that you will be pleased to forward them in the proper direction. 22. During my stay a t Bushire I enjoyed trie hospitality of the Resident there and I was able to discuss the various matters in connection with the fate of the pirates. Many telegramstelegrams passed betv/een the Resident, the Charge d*Affaires at Teheran, etc., etc.. Major Co&gt; and I v/ere fnlly agreed that as these pirates are clearly so notorious all over the Gulf, and from the evidence we had of their guilt, we were fully justified in insisting on their immediate public execution at Bushire without, further delay or discussion and so promote maritime peace and our prestige all over the Gulf. However, after many telegrams had been exchanged, permission was obtained to hand the pirates over- to the Sheikh of Mohommerah, and on 15th December I transferred them to the 'Sphinx” which Ship having embarked the Resident, left at 5 p.m. for Mohoramerah, with orders to ca.ll at Koweit en route as Major Cox wished to see the Sheik of Rowe it before going to Mohommerah. I ordered Commander Litchfield to pla.ee himself at the disposal of the Resident and to comply witn his requests as to the disposal of the pirates and then to return to Bushire and if possible to leave there in time to arrive at Karachi on the 87th in accordance with your orders. 28. On the 12th December 1 received a telegram from 'Redbreast' at Muscat, saying 'r&gt;8 Afghans had arrived there to buy arms and ammunition, the Sultan refuses to allow them to remain and a B. I. Steamer has refused to take them to Karachi. Consul asks me to do so, am I tc comply . I fully discussed the matter with Major Cox and I pointed out to him that except under very urgent circu® to rices, I did not consider that a man of war should be calleo on to do such duties, and I telegraphed to 'Redbreast' ... 'Suggest Afghans should be despatched in a dhow or detained by Sultan and sent in batches by mail steamer. In any case I required further details as to urgency before sanctioning 'Redbreast' heng used . As I did not consider (1) that a man of war snould he used. (2) that a gunboat was a suitable ship to employ. On the followingA*ar * (W following day. 13th* I recei'^d the foilovn'ng reply from Lieutenant and Commander Hose of ’'Redbreast” .... 'Consul informs me Sultan unable to detain Afghans. Consul fears disturbances at any time now quarantine is finished. Deport ation in dhows impossible* If Afghans break or are allowed out of quarantine station to srv/ait next mail, arms and ammun ition will be purchased and further arrangements will be made for their transport to the Makran Coast.' Major Cox also received a telegram from Major Grey seying that 'Senior Naval Officer demurs at my request to send Afghans in 'Redbreast' please urge him to give necessary orders' (or words to that effect). I then wired to 'Redbreast' 'Difficult to understand why Sultan cannot detain DO unarmed men in his forts pending expulsion, but if after communication with Consul their immediate expulsion is urgent you are to comply with his request. 'Lapwing' left Jask today for Muscat'. To which 'Redbreast' replied .... 'Consul considers immediate deportation absolutely necessary, leaving for Karachi'. 24. I trust that my action (of which I informed you by wire) in this matter has met with your approval, for I fully realise my responsibilities and those of the Commanding Officer of 'Redbreast' in allowing such a large number of Afghans (probably truculent) to be embarked on board a gunboat. However, as Lieutenant and Commander H^se did not protest as to the possibility of taking the Afghans in 'Redbreast', I gave him an order to comply with the request of the Consul. 2b. While at Bushire 'Highflyer' attempted to coal on three consecutive days, but the weather made it impossible until the third day, Sunday 15th, when I received 1 B 0 tons with difficulty, and sailed that day for Shargah, where the Resident had asked me to call with a view to sending a letterletter to the Native Agent there and also to show the Flag, which the Resident assured me would stiffen the Sheik’s hack in connection with the oxide mine at Abu doss Island, with which circumstances I understand that yon are acquainted. 1 arrived off Shargah on the morning of 17th December and having heard that the Native Agent there was ill, I sent a letter from the Resident on shore and sailed shortly afterwards for Muscat, where I arrived at 9.30 a.m. on 18th and coaled, receiving 180 tons. * * K * 87. The R.l.d.S. 'Lawrence” arrived on the 18th December with the Agent to the Viceroy and Governor General in Baluchistan (Sir Henry McMahon) on whom I called. Sir Henry returned my call the following forenoon and was saluted on leaving M Highf]yer ,f with 13 guns. I left for Bombay at noon that day (19th) having- ordered 'Sphinx” to resume the duties of Senior [Aval Officerin the Persian Gulf. 88. During my short stay at Muscat I discussed with Major Grey the question of the Afghans who had been taken to Karachi in 'Redbreast' and Major Grey informed me that the principal reason for not detaining the Afghans in custody at Muscat was. that they had not committed themselves in any way in coming to, or since their arrival at Muscat, as they had stated that they did not knew that Muscat was closed to them. Major Grey told me that ignorance on that point would not be accepted in the future and that any steamer bringing Afghans to Muscat would have to take them away, or transfer them to another ship for that purpose. I submit for your favourable consideration that the British India Steamship Company may be informed of existing conditions at Muscat, with a view to their not taking Afghans there and so avoid further complica tions and the necessity of H. M. Ships being called on to carrycarry out. expulsion duties, which ’’Redbreast” recently had done. Whether disturbances would have token place at Muscat if the b3 Afghans had been allov/ed in the tov/n I do not know but I think that H. H. the Sultan should be prepared to deal v/ith any disturbances in Muscat caused by 50 unarmed men. * * x * 30. 'Highflyer' l th3s day * Sir, Y ou r obe di ent s ervant, Signed... 0. S. Hickley.

I proceeded up the river to Busreh early on November 8th, mooring off the Consulate et 10.0 a.m. R.IA . Gunboat 'Comet u there, the latter having lately return ed from Ahwaz. Ships were dressed in honour of the ntional festival which celebrates the conclusion of Ramadan. I dressed ship upon anchoring. There was some difficulty in obtaining pratique, the quarantine Officer at first imposed two days quarantine owing tc the Ship having been to Muscat within the last month. I was however, able to persuade him to grant us pratique in the afternoon. Wali and Commodore of my intention to dress ship next morning in honour of the Birthday of H. ¥ # the King, and that I would call upon them early. 3. On November 3th I dressed ship in honour of His •? Majesty's birthday and paid an early call upon the Wali a.nd .Commodore.

In the absence of 1, Consul, who usually holds a re ooption on this day, I invited t he Br11ish community off to the Ship to honour His Majesty's health. 4. The ship coaled on Novenebr 12th, 136 tons of coal being obtained from Messrs Striek Co., tiie only firm able to supply me. The price arranged was Rupees 31 - I4as per ton which is about Rs4-J cheaper tlian Government rate at Bus hi re. The coo. 1, however, though demanded as Welsh and described on the supply note as North Welsh, proved to be of on inferior quality and is certainly not best Welsh Steam Cod . I have written to Messrs Strick Sc Co with regard to the matter. 6. I proceeded to Mahommerah on the loth to await the arrival of tha mail conveying Mr O'Keefe, Oh. A. 3., 1 A.B., and two Lascars and thus avoid the 5 days quarantine that would have been Imposed had I received these passengers from the mail at Busreii. I would suggest that'Naval passengers for ships in the river be in all cases booked to Mahommerah. On the 14th I went with H. M. Consul to visit Sheikh Khazal. He had had no recent news of the Pirates who appear to have laid low at Dayir vSince the attack on the Koweit dhow in February and he assumed that they were still at Dayir. I had intended to go down to Fao for a few days but Mr McDouall infcrmeA] me that the majority of the dhows had cleared for the south on the 11th and 12th and that he saw no immediate necessity for a ship near the bar. I therefore*n therefore returned to Busreh on the 15th and found that Mr Crov/, H. M. Consul had returned. Tt was arranged that Sheikh Khaza] should return my cal 3 when I next visited Mahouimerah as he was suffering froir a cold and his launch was under repairs. 6. Mr Crew informed re that a strong protest had been made to the lorte by j. 1 s Ambassador at Constantinople with reference to the uncivil treatment of the Commanding Officer of 11 Lapwing” at Katif. The Wali of Busreh had been instructed to enquire intet he matter v/^th a view to the punishment of the offending officials. Mr Crow informed me that a shortage of dates of some kinds had resulted in hifgh prices and that consequently the number of dhows returning to the river for the second date season about the middle of December might be expected to be less than usual. 8 x * x * 8. On November 20th 1 was informed that the Sheikh of Zubeir, a town about 10* west of Busreh, had been murdered with two of his people that afternoon in the Bazaar at Busreh. The Turkish troops were called out to quell the disturbance which followed. 9. On November 21st at 4.50 p.m. I received your telegram Mo.55 directing me to proceed to Koweit to obtain men who can identify the Hninaidi pirates and a Iter wards proceed to Bushire to place myself under the orders of the 11 HI ghflyer' 1 . My proceedings subsequent to the receipt of your telegram have been reported to Captain Hiekley of H.d.S.

The telegraphic coni mum cati on with Busreh by land lines proved to be more efficient than J was led to believe but it appears Ko be subject to temporary interruption? due bo weather or Arabs cutting the wire. Your telegram No.65 consisting of 67 groups came thrcuth in a bout 30 hours with only two slight errors. The line was interrupted very soon afterwards on account of heavy rain in the north and I ; j m doubtful whether you received my acknowledgment before the report of my arrival at Bushi re. 11. As re oar cist he movements of the other ships of the Division - ,I Lapwing 1 ' left Bunder Abbas at 5.0 p.m. October 24th and arrived Muscat early on 26th October where she embarked, : 1a t ior Ore} - and left for Sur the same evening. Ma.ior Grey was unable to trace the Somali arms he went to Sur to find and H Lapwing' returned to Muscat on 28th October. Between 28th October and 6th November some urgent defects in engine room were made good and on 6th November I ordered her to Karachi to clean boilers and generally overhaul her machinery. She arrived on the £th and returned to Muscat on 27th with orders to leave for the north on the 28th in readi ness to relieve me in the river. Owing however to the Resident's request for a second ship on. the arms traffic as soon as possible she has been temporarily diverted to assist 'Redbreast' on this service. 12. T left 'Redbreast' at Boshire on 5th November with orders to embark Mr Bill, First Assistant to -he Resident, and convey him to Abu Musa and Ras-al-Khaima, afterwards proceedings bo Muscat. The ob;ect of the Abu Musa Visit was to see if all v/as• m- -ii • m i—pr affiiiriiiit 'i niiMti -v ^ I was qujet. t.here and to reassure the Sheikh*s people. It however transpired that the Sheikh's guard had vacated the island and the 'Redbreast” proceeded to Shargah where Mr Bill obtained a promise from the Sheikh to send over a fresh guard at once. Mr Brown, the German Agent, has been in Bushire int&lt;p» viewing the German Consul about the Abu Muse concession and has also, I understand, been endeavouring to frighten the Sheikh of Shargah. At Ras-al-Khaima it was found that the slave dealer referred to in paragraph S of my letter of 14th October had returned to Khabura end I understand that being once more; in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat, H. H. is to be requested to cause his arrest. 13. 'Redbreast” arrived at Muscat on November 15th, her orders being to assist Political Agent in any further steps to be taken with regard to the Somali Arms and then proceed to the Mekran Coast for the suppression of the Arms Traffic. She left Muscat for Snr on the loth to make further enquiries about Somali Arms reported to he located there but returned tb Muscat without success on the 18th. ”Redbreast” visited Snr again, with Maior Grey, on the 24th . Ma { 1cr Grey had obtained authority from the Sultan to forcibly seize the arms which has been located in a house at West Sur, but It was found that the Mullah's Agents had got away for Ras-al-Khail, Somaliland, 3 days previously with 400 rifles. The affir is now closed for this year so far as this Division is concerned. 'Redbreast's” report states that Political Agent wired to the Resident at Aden notifying the departure of the arms for Ras-al-Khai1. 14. I told■■ ■■ ■■ 111 —i m x 14.

I lad all the rice on board examined and some doubt ful looking lice in the Canteen, the only rice stowed forward, thrown overboard. That rice had not however, been issued. The mess dec] and canteen were + hen disinfected. No further cases occurred until the 24th instant, when a Lascar Stoker Serang was found to be suffering from the disease and already in too critical a condition to be discharged Iron the ship had opportunity offered.

The names ol these Kov/eit. men are Hussein bin Bathir and Akbar bin Hahorne^ . They are both of Persian extraction born and brought up in Kov/eit and are seamen by profession. They last saw the sons of Abdullah bin Humaidi in Busreh and Mohammerah about 4 years ago, but say they can easily recognise them. Thev would not however be prepared to identify the pirate's crew. It appears that the crew is constantly changed, a fresh one being collected for each exp ed 11 -* on.

When at ''ohammerah, a few days before reeeiging Commander in Chief’s telegram, Sheikh Khazal and * r r McDouall. H. v. Consul, gave me similar information.

I instructed the Postmaster to retain mails for 'Highflyer” and 'Sphinx” at Bus hi re until further orders. 9. I arrived at Lingah 7.IB a.m. this morning. The flative Agent cme cf t 5mmedia' e 1 y, and ’fa j cr Cox explained our- business. The ^gent said thet the man who could give us the most assistance was a Persian Seyyjd named Abdul Qs-hir who had gebe over to Basidu oh behalf of the Governor oi Lingah to escort the Hu 13ah who was recently banished by the Deiya Begi and took refuge at Basidu but was notr permitted to return to Lingah. The Seyyid and his party were expected to return to [ingnh today. To avoid waste of time in waiting for the Seyyid J decided to proceed to Be sidr and speak any native craft I met on t&gt;w \ay. I weighed at 8.20 a.m. and after proceeding 10 1 east we yd fell in vith the d! rw crntaining the Seyyid. The Native Agent was sent on board the Dhow and brought back the Seyyid. 10. The Seyyid wus unite willing to accompany us and appearsappears to he very keen or. the poniohment of the pirates* houses in which the pirates and their relatives live y.t Batunah, about 6’ west of Dayir. He can procure local guides at Dayir and the relatives of the massacred crew of the Shivoh dhow who live at Dayir. The only survivor of that piracy, All bin Ibrahim, could be procured as a witness at Shivoh. 11. The Seyyid returned from a visit to Bushi re by last mail. Just before he left he met a Dayir man who told him that fck the pirates had recently bought a dhow and proceeded to Busreh, the Seyyid however is inclined to doubt the rollabi3ity of this infermation as the peop1e of the Dashti Boast are naturally disposed to disclaim connection with the pirates which yives their district an unenviable reputation. 12. I then proceeded at 10.20 a,m. direct for Henjam to communicate with you and report progress. The Native Agent subsequently informed the Resident that there is a Seed^e at Lingah who at one time was a slave in the house of the pi rates. the wyy north. 13.

At Mr Bill’s request I sent the Armourer and Carpenter’s Mate ashore to take a cart to pieces, and also landed a flagstaff to enable the Sheikh of Sharga to hoist his flag over the oxide works. 8. Leaving Abu ■'use at 6 p.m. I arrived at Sharga at 9.30 the same evening and at 8.0 a.m. the following day landed with Mr Bill, who interviewed the Sheikh in the British Residency’s Native Agent’s house. After many difficulties had been put in the way and excuses ade by the Sheikh, Mr Bill eventually got him to pionise to send a guard to Abu Musa forthwith, and I kept the Ship at Sharga until the party were seen to start at daylight, on the 11th; then embarking Issa bin Abdul At if (the Native Agent’s son) I proceeded to Umm al gawain and anchored off the place at 8.40 a.m. &lt;j.

Mr Bill and 1 landed immediately after anchoring but on getting ashore we were informed that the Sheikh was out hunting. However, messengers were sent after him and we waited tiij 11.30, by which time Mr Bill considered the Sheikh ought certainly to have returned; not having done so Mr Bill and I went back to the ship, leaving Issa bin Abdul At if on shore with a message from the former to the Sheikh + hat he must repair on board the 'Redbreast” on his return, aJ so that he must bring the slave with him or he would no* be received.

Sir, I have the honour to report that on roy arrival at. Muscat on the Ifrth instant, I was requested by the Political Agent to embark the Agency Dragoman and proceed to Sur and make investigations re the arrival there of ar agent of the Mad Mullah, named Hamed bin Shirwa, with a consignment of rifles for final transport to Somaliland. 2. In accordance with this request I left Muscat at 10.0 p.m., 16th., and arrived at Sur at daylight on the 17th. I landed at 7.SO with the Agency Dragoman, Sid Mahcmmed, and with my Interpreter, Had.ii Abdullah, I rent first to see the Hindoo Banyan Geviaa, who had sent the news of the arrival of Hamed bin Shirv/a at Sur, and was told by him that the Somali had sailed that morning about 3.0 a. . On being pressed for proof of this he produced several witnesses, whose evidence, however, seemed somewhat contra dictory; rtill the na.irrity of the evidence was in favour of his having sailed, and that, taken with the Banyan’s os- itive assurances of the fact, induced me to get away in chase, since, if the statement was true, it was of the utmost importance to get away without, delay, and if it were false any other enquiries concerning Hamed could be prosecuted on my return. 8. I got away at 10.15 and proceeded full speed round Has al ladd, and at. 2.0 p.m. overhauled 4 badans drcn I stopped and boarded. It turned cut that these ha left Sur at 7 a.m. and consequently it. seemed Impossible that if Hamed rhe Senior %val Officer, had Persian Gu1f Divls’ on. rwr*haH J eft Sur at 3.0 a.irw, as stated by Geiraia, that I could overhaul him before darkJ also the nacudas and crews of badans said they had seen ilamed’s boat In the Khor at Sur the previous evening and were inclined to think he had not sailed before them that morning. On this I determined to return to Sur and got there at 5.0 p.m. I then landed again v/ith Said Mahommed and Had t ii Abdullah and interviewed Geira a second time. He informed me that he had ascertained positively in the meantime that Hamed’s badan was still in the Khor; that he had started out that morning but the sight of the ,l Redbreast M had driven him in again. The latter part of this statement I found to be absolutely untrue when I saw the unpie a red state of the badan for any voyage. I went to her after leaving the Banyan. She v/as entirely empty and was lyiiw alongside another bomo 11 boat two-thirds laden with rice and dates. The owner and nacnda of this boat, a Somali named Mahmud Mahornmed f appeared on the scene and claimed ownership to Hamed’s boat as v/ell, saying he bought her from Sal ah bin Shaikh of Sup. a few days ago. I had the cargo of Mahmud’s boat ( sambuk) overhauled but found nothing suspicious. 4. After my examination of the boats I went to v'slt Sheikh Abdul lah bin Salim, who assured me he had co le from Jaalan to Sur entirely over this arms running affair and had issued orders to the effect that none of his people were to countenance it or to allow any arms to leave the ulaoe. He was leaving Sur again the next day but promised to leave someone to see his orders carried out. 5. While with Sheikh Abdullah a man called Jumma bin (?) arrived and told Said Mahommed that R. :ed bin Shirwa had imported 400 rifles into Sur and now had them hidden in the house of one Nasr bin Khamis, in west Sur; that flame wad intended leaving Sur before this nit had neen detained by t ie i 1 Inc usillness of !y Jasr bin Kbamis, and fbat. they proposed s»i ling together in 2 days or so; that their destination was Eas al Khail on the Somali Coast; that Haned had bought the badan from Sal ah bin Shaikh for 200 Rupees but in the name of Mahmud Mahommed and not his ov/n. j L 8 ■ &gt; i \ 11 KH II 0. I debt).ted liether to search asr bin Khamis’ house but decided to consult the Political Agent first, since there would be time to return again for this purpose, and it seemed perhaps advisable to have some representative of the Sultan (or some authority from him) if possible, to accompany one in such a proceeding. 7. I left Snr at 9.0 p.m., 17th, arrlvin at ,T ;jscai the following morning at 8.0 o 1 clock.

Foreign Office January 22nd. 1908 Sir Rs. 15,000 With reference to your letter of the 18th. ultimo relative to the capture of the Daylr pirates I am di rected by Secretary Sir E. Grey to transmit herewith to be laid before Mr. Secretary Morley copy of a telegram from His Majesty's Charge d'Affalres at Tehran from which It appears that In informing the Persian Govern ment of the proposed destruction by one of His Majes ty's Ships of the strongholds of the Chief of the Dash- ti at Daylr and Kangun, he omitted to state ; In accord ance with Major Cox's proposal that the above course would only be resorted to should the Chief fall to com ply with a demand for a sum of Fifteen thousand Rupees to be distributed among the victims of the pirates. It will also be observed that the Persian Govern ment decline the assistance of His Majesty's Government in the matter but assert their willingness to undertake the 'he Under Secretary of State, India Office.the destruction of the strongholds themselves. Sir E. Grey is disposed to agree with Mr .Marling that the more forcible measure will produce a better moral effect and subject to Mr. Morley's concurrence he proposes to inform him that he need take no steps to correct the mistake. He further proposes, if Mr. Morley sees no objec tion, to approve Mr. Marling's proposed intimation to the Persian Government that one of His Majesty's Ships will watch the operations and that the Officer in Com mand has instructions to complete the work if not carried out to his satisfaction. I am. Your most obedient.CONFIDENTIAL. Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received January 17, 2 p.m.) (No. 23.) Tehran, January 17, 1908, 8‘35 a.m IN my telegram No. 378 I should have said that Cox proposed destruction of strongholds of Chief of Dashti in default of payment of 15,000 rupees [?] to lie distributed as compensation to victims of pirates. I much regret oversight. Persian Government assert their willingness to undertake destruction themselves, hut decline our assistance. If you think it desirable, I can correct mistake with Persian Government, but I submit that a better moral effect will be produced by the more forcible measure, provided that it is effectively carried out. This will certainly not be done if the operation is left in the hands of the Persian Government, for Governor-General of Gulf Ports is a close friend of the Chief, but it could be assured if I intimated to the Persian Government that one of His Majesty’s ships will watch the operations, and that the officer in command has instructions to complete work if it is not carried out to his satisfaction.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the-Foreign Department, Calcutta. Two of the three pirate brothers have been arrested and their dhows seized. The third escaped inland. The dhows have been transferred to my custody pending disposal, and the prisoners are on the Highflyer, The prisoners, who are primarily Arab subjects of the Sheikh of Mokam- merah, admitted their identity and notoriety as pirates, but alleged that their bad reputation was due to piracies committed by them, at Sheikh Mubarak’s bidding, upon the dhows of his enemy, Yusuf Ibrahim and his adherents, seven or eight years ago. They naturally do not admit the piracies at Shivoh or Koweit, which are attributed to them. In the former case we have the original evidence of an individual who escaped, which is corroborated by the testimony of his uncle, a nahhoda from Hayir. In my opinion it would be altogether unsafe to hand the prisoners over to the Governor of the Gulf Ports (in whose immediate jurisdiction they were seized) except for the purpose of immediate execution in our presence. Captain Hickley concurs with me in thinking these brothers are clearly so notorious all over the Gulf as dangerous depredators that we are fully justified in insisting on their immediate and public execution at Bushire with out further discussion or delay. The dhows should be simultaneously burnt in. the harbour here while His Majesty’s ships are at Bushire. The news of the capture and of such public and prompt retribution will travel quickly, and will greatly promote maritime peace and our prestige in the Gulf. I request early instructions. Addressed to Mr. Marling, Tehran ; repeated to Commodore, Eoreign, Calcutta. . Telegram No. 271, dated the 11th (received 12 th) December 1907. From— C. M. Marling, Esq., in charge of His Britannic Majesty’s Legation at Tehran, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Please refer to your telegram No. 178. It is reported by the Consul- General at Bushire that two pirates have been captured and are now on the Highflyer But he strongly urges that it would be altogether unsafe to hand the prisoners over to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, except for instant execu tion. He asks for early instructions.4 I have sent the following reply :— « Your telegram No. 175, dated December 10th. I informed the Persian Government on explicit instructions from the Foreign Office that the pirates, if captured, would be handed over to satisfy the authorities, and we cannot well now attach conditions to the fulfilment of that promise. Though it might take time, I could put on strong pressure to obtain death sentence. The Minister for Foreign Affairs gives me his per aortal opinion that, if the notoriety of their crimes is as great as you say and if proof of the murders can be produced, the pirates would be executed. “ I see no objection to the burning of the dhows as you suggest. “ Pending an expression of the views of the Secretary of State, to whom I am reporting, you might retain the prisoners in custody.” Sent as No. 371 to the Foreign Office.

Cox, C.I E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to tbe Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Following sent to Tehran :— Begins. If it is finally decided that prisoners must be handed over to Persian authorities in view of position indicated in your telegram No. 163 of December 11th, my opinion is that with the deli very of the two well-known outlaws to their own Government our functions should terminate altogether. But, except under circumstances first recom mended, I greatly deprecate prisoners being handed over at Bushire. In fact, persons who assisted us in effecting their arrest particularly begged that this should not be done, as they no doubt feared bribery, escape, and retaliation. In any case proceedings undertaken by Bushire authorities will be protracted and probably have no finality, and thus the effect of British action, which will cost Government some thousands of pounds, will in a great measure be nullified. I strongly recommend, if prisoners must be handed over, that without further intimation to Persian Government I be authorised to deliver them immediately to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, their overlord, and who knows them well having expelled them from his territory. A written undertaking ' could no doubt be’obtained from him to take measures which will ensure their committing no more piracies. There is every hope that Sheikh of Mohammerah would take really effective measures owing to his strong friendship with Sheikh of koweit, who is greatly incensed against these pirates, whereas the measures taken by Bushire authorities probably would not be so effective. It w ould be quite consistent with your assurances to them if Persian Government could be informed post Jacto of their having been delivered to Mohammerah. Ends.

Marling, Esq., in charge of His Bitannic Majesty's Legation at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Please see your telegram No. 177.

Marling, Esq., in charge of His Britannic Majesty's Legation at Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Governm/nt of India in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Please refer to your telegram No. 197. His 1^tannic Majesty’s Consul- A/ General at Bushire suggests that the pirates should be delivered to tueSheikh of Mohammerah, since they are his subjects. This fulfils our promises to the Persian Government, and Major Cox seems confident that the Sheikh will do stern justice, specially as he is a friend of the Sheikh of Koweit, who is deeply interested in the punishment of pirates. Cox also apprehends that delivery in Bushire may have dangerous results to the witness and to those who assisted in capture, and that proceedings would in any case be protracted. I have authorised him to adopt this course, and the Persian Government are being informed accordingly. Addressed to the Poreign Office as No. 374 ; repeated to Calcutta.

My telegram No. 725. It is clearly demonstrated by previous records and present enquiries that since their expulsion from Mohammerah territory and subsequently from Koweit the pirates have been enabled to live in security and carry on their profession with impunity by reason of countenancing and sheltering allowed to them by Jamal Khan, Chief of Dashti, and lieutenant and relatives at the ports of Deyyir and Kangoon. Unless punishment is accorded to this family proceedings will not be complete. It is considered by Captain Hickley that certainly at Deyyir and in all probability at Kangoon the mud castle of Khan could be demolished at sufficiently close range by one of His Majesty’s ships to avoid risk of damaging unoffending villagers, who would be given adequate notice. I suggest for consideration that, if possible with the concurrence of the Persian Government and if necessary without it, an ultimatum be presented to Jamal Khan, who is at present at one of his coast ports, calling upon him to pay a fine of Its. 15,000 through British Eesidency for distribu tion among the families known to have lost relatives or merchandise in piracies, and informing him that failing compliance ships would forthwith take action above suggested.

Grey con curs in the recommendation of the Government of India that strong representations should be made to the Persian Government with a view to securing the cap ture and punishment of the offenders, and full pecuniary reparation for the sufferers in the Koweit case, and further that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demandsof His Majesty's Government, suitable naval action will be taken at Dayir. I am, however, to add that Sir E. Grey is not hopeful that the Persian Government will succeed, under present circumstances, in securing the punish ment of the offenders, or indeed that they will easi ly be induced to pay conpensation. He is accordingly of opinion that a vessel should be ordered to Dayir at once to watch the movements of the pirates in question, with the object if possible of effecting a capture at sea; and he further considers that the Commander should be authorised to land temporarily a sufficient force of men to capture the pirates and hand them over to the Persian authorities, if on arrival at Dayir he should hear that the pirates are in the neighbourhood. This action, as you are aware from the correspondence ending with Sir H. Walpole's letter of the 11th March 1903, would be in accord ance with precedent and practice. On learning that these views meet with the con currence of Mr. Secretary Morley, this Department would(s if 1 would enter into the necessary communications with the Admiralty. I am further to state that Sir E. Grey agrees that the Sheikh of Koweit should not he allowed to equip an armed dhow. With regard to the incidental remark made in the final paragraph of the Government of India’s despatch respecting the protection of Koweitis resident abroad, I am to inform you that notwithstanding the subsequent correspondence on the subject Sir E. Grey is disposed to adhere to the views expressed in Lord Lansdowne's despatch to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, No*245 of September 2nd 1903, of which a copy is enclosed for facility of reference. I am. Sir,Register No. (jj&amp; Minute Paper. /Lh ( V SECRET DEPARTMENT.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. FOREIGN DEPARTMENT. SECRET. External. To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M., His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 12th September 1907. Sir, We have the honour to forward herewith a copy of correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on the subject of two acts of serious and brutal piracy committed by Arabs residing at Dayir, a place on the coast of Persia about 100 miles south of Bushire. 2 . In November 1906 ,* the pirates attacked a native boat belonging to ^ ^ the Persian port of Shivoh between Keis Ft e enc osure o. . island and Taona. They killed all the crew except one boy who escaped after being left for dead, and seized the cargo which was valued at Rs. 6 , 000 . In * * * January 1907 ,t the pirates captured a Koweit boom, sailing from Basrah to Koweit. After murdering the crew and passengers who numbered 29 , they carried off the cargo and abandoned the boom which was subsequently found stranded on the island of Amair. 3 . The Political Resident made representations on the subject of the first piracy to the Derya Begi, but as they produced no result he telegraphed to the Minister at Tehran and informed him of what had happened. At the same time, he requested the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf to proceed to Dayir, and make enquiries. The local authorities at Dayir, when questioned by'Captain Bowman, denied all knowledge of the piracy, but from information subsequently received it appears that, on the very day when the “ Sphinx ” called at Dayir, the Chief of the pirates was in Dayir and was staying with the Khan of that place. On the 16 th of June 1907 , His Majesty’s Minister informed} the Resident that he could hold % Vide enclosure No. 4. 0u t no hopes that useful action would be taken by the Persian Government in the matter at present. 4 . It is true that in the first case the victims were Persian subjects and that it might be supposed that the Persian Government would themselves take steps to secure redress for their own subjects from the pirates residing within § Vide correspondence ending with your Secret their jurisdiction. The British Govern* despatch No. 2 , dated the 1 st February iyo7. ment have, however, acknowledged§ a general obligation for the preservation of the maritime peace of the Gulf, and it is their object to secure the suppression of piracy in Gulf waters. It would, therefore, in our opinion, be our duty, even if British interests or the interests of British-protected persons were not primarily concerned, to take all possible action with a view to scattering the Dayir gang. And in the case of the second offence we consider that we are under a special obligation in this instance, because some subjects of the Sheikh of Koweit to whom we are bound, under II vide our Secret despatch No. 35 (External), the Agreement|| of 23rd January lb99, to dated the 23rd February 1899. extend OUF good offices, have been robbed and murdered by the pirates.2 5. We would, accordingly, venture to recommend that a strong represent ation should be made to the Persian Government with a view to secure the capture and punishment of the offenders and full pecuniary reparation for tlie sufferers in the Koweit case. In view of the offence committed against their own subjects the Persian Government should presumably be only too ready to co-operate with us against the offenders. Put as it appears certain that no representations to the Persian authorities, whether made locally or at Tehran, are likely either to secure satisfaction for the offences which have been committed or to prevent a recurrence of such crimes in the future, we would suggest that the Persian Government should be informed that, failing compliance with the demands of His Majesty’s Government within a stated time, suitable naval action will be taken at Hayir. 6. If our proposal is approved, it is quite possible that, in order to clear out the pirates, it may be necessary for the naval authorities not only to enter Persian territorial waters but also to land men on the Persian coast. We are aware that the Persian Government in 1903 , with reference to an encounter between certain pirates, who had organised a surprise attack on Koweit, and the sailors of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ”, protested against the adoption of this course, * Firfe despatch from the Marquess of Lansdowne but the Minister at Tehian Was On to sir a. Hardinge, No. 44s dated the 4th April 1903 . that occasion directed* by His Majesty’s Government to inform the Persian Government that the Commanders of H. M.’s ships, whilst they would always be careful to respect the sovereign rights of Persia and to co-operate to the utmost of their ability with the local authorities, must, in the absence of any effective Persian naval force, retain their freedom to take at their discretion and on their responsibility, even within Persian territory, such measures for the repression of piracy, as the urgency or gravity of any particular case might seem to them to warrant. The Persian Government were reminded that the security from pirates enjoyed by the population both on the Persian and opposite Arab coasts was entirely due to the past efforts of the British navy, and they were informed that the British Government had entered into special compacts on this subject with the Trucial Chiefs, and that they could not engage to give any new orders to the Commanders of British vessels which would tend to restrict the efficiency of their action in maintaining the maritime peace in the Gulf. It was also pointed out that the Persian Government’s demand was hardly consistent with the fact that in 1897 , with the object of suppressing the traffic in arms, they had given permission for His Majesty’s steamships to search merchant vessels in Persian waters and to confiscate any arms and ammunition intended for Persian ports which might be found on board. 7 . In Marchf 1904 , the claim of the British Government to take + vide correspondence forwarded with Political measures even on Persian territory for Secretary letter No. 15, dated the 8th April 1904. the suppression of piracy WUS 0nC6 mOrQ enforced, when Sir N. O’Conor reported to the Marquess of Lansdowne that a serious case of piracy on the Shatt-el-Arab had been perpetrated on a British Indian sailing vessel laden with dates. He stated that His Majesty’s Consul at Basrah had reason to believe that the stolen property was hidden in the pirates’ huts at Abkatch on the Khor Hindian Persian coast of the Shatt-el-Arab, and suggested that the “ Lapwing ” then at Koweit should be instructed to search the place. Instructions were issued to the Commander of H. M. S. “ Lapwing ” and a search was accordingly made in Persian territory, but without success. 8. In view of these precedents His Majesty’s Government would doubtless not be disposed to consider any protest that the Persian Government might make regarding action taken by us against the pirates, and naval action in an outlying part of Persian territory on the Gulf, with the active assistance or consent of the Persian authorities, ought not unduly to excite the susceptibi lities of other powers. 9 . The most cogent reason in favour of immediate action in the present case J Vide enclosures Nos. 3 and 5. iS t0 be f ° Und in the faCt that the Sheikh . # # of Koweit has asked J with reference to the piracy committed on his subjects that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily armed dhow to protect his vessels plying between Koweit or Basrah and Persian ports. rWe consider that this proposal should be negatived, since if the Sheikh, with our consent and assistance, despatched an armed dhow to parade the Gulf, the Turks might regard it as a symptom of his growing independence, and they might complain of a disturbance of the status quo. Again, the Persian Government might consider the move to he a sinister one, especially * vide oar Secret despatch No. 150! (External), having regard to the fact that Mubarak dated the 5th September 1907. ^ recently rendered* armed assistance to the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Finally, the policing of the Persian Gulf by Mubarak would amount to an infringement of our prerogative, and therefore in accordance with established policy could not be allowed. Tint it is evident that, if we were to forbid the Sheikh to take steps for the protection of his subjects, and were at the same time to take no effective steps ourselves, we should inevitably arouse his resentment. On the other hand, if we succeeded in securing reparation for the attack on Mubarak’s subjects, this fact would afford an important demonstration of our will and power to protect his interests. We should thus, while confirming the Sheikh’s allegiance to us, conclusively establish our claim to protect his subjects whether in Persia or elsewhere. We trust, therefore, that the adoption of the measures proposed in paragraph 5 of this letter may be authorised.

Meanwhile another case of piracy with wholesale murder has just come to light, perpetrated sometime ago on a Koweit dhow and alleged on good grounds to have been committed by the same gang. In this connection Sheikh of Koweit writes urging that the authorities of Dashti should be called upon to hand the pirates over to justice, their habitat and identity being, he declares, notorious.

Sheikh Mubarak further asks that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily armed dhow to protect his dhows plying between Basrah or Koweit and Persian ports, and that no objections may be raised to his dealing direct with piracies if any are encountered. Such a vessel must, to be of any use, operate, if necessary, in territorial waters and creeks, and in any case I think that it would be difficult to prevent it from doing so. But apart from this, the Government of India will probably consider that the same objections exist as were held to exist with regard to a similar application which emanated from the Sheikh of Bahrein. If, however, we oppose Mubarak’s proposal, we should obviously insist on the Persian Government taking adequate measures to suppress the gang and see that such measures are satisfactorily carried out. I doubt the ability of the present Governor to take effective measures, and at present he does not admit that he has the jurisdiction to do so. If, how ever, he receives peremptory orders and the means to carry them out, I will endeavour to keep him up to the mark.* Repeated to Sir C.

The Shaikh replied that he had not thought of entering ports but proposed to effect the capture either in the open sea or to follow them in the Khor-i-Hindian where he seemed to think there was a chance of the pirates taking refuge. He agreed that it was necessary to consult you first and I asked him to be good enough to put his proposal in writing. That proposal I hive now the honour to submit and to request the favour of early instructions as to the reply to be given to the Shaikh.

The aforesaid boom was lost. It was conjectured that she had been wrecked by the winter gales. After 60 days, news came that the boom had grounded on the island of Amair and her mast and yards still standing and they saw in her blood and we sent the owner of the boom to the aforesaid boom and he also saw in her much blood and we did not know what had happened to them. After that, Nakhoda Abdulla of the people of Kharj informed us that, from the talk of the people of Dayar to him in Bahrein, the children of Hamaidi had taken away the boom, when at anchor at the buoy, and had killed all the people in her and had taken all her property and the cargo in the boom and had abandoned her, so that she grounded at the island of Amair. And the sons of Hamaidi are notorious, they are all dwelling in Dayar and a source of profit to the ruler of that place. We have sent Haji Abdulla of Kharj to you and he has informed you verbally. W'e hope that you will acquaint the Resident of this occurrence. And the sons of Hamaidi are pirates, well-known and banished by Shaikh Khazal and the Basrah Government.

In amplification of my telegram No. 376, dated 16th June 1907, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, precis of the two cases of piracy referred to. Duplicates are being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for information. - Prtcis of a case of piracy with murder committed on a Persian Dhow of Taonah in November 1906 , and subsequent correspondence. A native vessel of the “ Mashoweh ” type belonging to the Persian Port of Shivoh, which had been in the “ poos ” of dry-dock of Lingah for some days was ready for sea on 16th November. She had on board 6 persons and cargo to the value of 6,000 rupees. In the dry-dock alongside of her had been another “ Mashoweh ” manned by some Arabs. It seems that these Arabs are well known as “Bilashtis” (pirates), and are said to belong to a party of bad characters which was expelled from the Shatt-el-Arab two years ago by the Sheikh of Mohammerah on account of depredations committed there. They are variously stated to have been living for some time past at Dayer, Rangoon, and Umm-el-Kurm, on the Dashti Coast. Their identity was probably not recognised at Lingah until after the occurrence. This Arab Mashoweh got under way from Lingah on the night of the 16th September at the same time as the Shivoh craft, and it appears that on the night before the 1st Shawwal (*&gt;., night of 17th November) the Arabs approached the Persian Dhow on the pretence of asking for water and having boarded her, attacked and stabbed to death, as they thought, the six occupants and transferred all the merchandise found in her to their own vessel. They then tied the wound ed or murdered men to the anchor rope and threw them overboard with the anchor and bored a hole in the dhow so that she got waterlogged and partial^ sank. The pirates then left and it is not known where they went to. Of the six men thrown overboard, one, a boy of 16, who was not dead, got free from the ropes and was cast ashore between Charak and Taonah about noon on the 1st Shavval (18th November), where he was found by some persons of Taonah and taken to the Chief of that place Sheikh Abdullah bin Mahomed Bushri. _ He was nursed at Taonah until he was sufficiently recovered to be taken to Lingah to have his wounds tended. On the same afternoon that the boy was found an object was seen in the sea by the Taonah people and boats_ proceeding to the spot found that it was the scuttled dhow with several holes in her. The above was reported by the Residency Agent at Lingah on the 29th November 1906. Later reports from the same source, obtained from one Abdul Rahim bin Mullah Abdullah, an inhabitant of Rangoon, have brought the follow ing details to light. The occupants of the Shivoh dhow were as follows (1) Ibrahim. (2) Ali bin Ibrahim (3) Mahomed bin Abdul Ghani (4) and (5) Names not known... (6) One ship’s boy Son of above and sole survivor. Owner of the looted merchandise. A merchant of Gaobandi for the chief of which district he was also bringing some gold ornaments. Two of the crew. Taken prisoner by the pirates and murdered later.The pirates after sinking the dhow made for a small port 2 m i[ es east of Rangoon called Nakhl-i-Ghanem where they murdered the ship s boy, (No. 6) above referred to, and landed the captured goods. From here they transported the latter by land to Rangoon. Ahmed Khan, uncle of Jamal Rhan of Dashti, the Deputy Governor of this place, appears to have been away at the time but two of his relatives, who were acting for him, by name Mulla Hussein and Zayer Mirza are alleged to have received a portion of the booty, a share being also given to Haji Rhan bin Jamal Rhan, Deputy Governor of Dayir, who had come to know of the proceedings. Jamal Rhan, the Governor of Dashti, on hearing of the incident, evidently appeared to have feared pursuit, as he gave directions for the pirates to be dis guised as men of Dashti and taken to the village of Bordaghoon, 30 miles north of Dayir where they were to await his arrival. The families of the pirates reside at Rangoon and their dhow after landing the stolen goods appears to have been taken to the Rhor-i-Bardistan, 2 miles east of Dayir. As regards the pirates themselves they appear to have been three in number, all brothers, though there is some divergence of opinion regarding their precise names. (1) According to Abdul Rahim bin Mulla Abdulla, originally an inhabitant of Rangoon, but now residing at Lingah, they were— (*) Sheikh Abdulla. (n) Sheikh Ibrahim. {iit) Sheikh Abdul Reza. (2) According to the Abyssinian slave of one Mohamed bin Subah, who knew them while at Lingah, their names were— (i) Abdulla, («) Meloo, (m) Abdul Reza, and they were known as the family of Hamaidi and residents of Manyoohi. (3) When Captain Bowman of H.M.S. ‘'Sphinx” went to Dayir and Rangoon to make enquiries at the request of the^ Resident in January 1907, the local authorities denied all knowledge of this particular piracy, but declared that it was true that about 4 years ago so me Basrah Arabs had plundered a dhow belonging to Seyyid Saleh of Mohammerah and had then come to Dayir to sell the cargo, but that on the Sheikh of Mohammerah sending warning to Dayir about them, their dhow and cargo had been seized and the Arabs expelled. Their names were said to be— (1) Abdulla Ruthabin Hamaid. (2) Ibrahim bin Hamaid. (3) Ismail bin Hamaid al Amah (now a prisoner at Mohammerah). It was further stated that after being expelled from Dayir they had sought refuge at Abu Thabi or Shargah. ■ In connection with this visit of H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” Mr. Francis, retired Assistant Surgeon, one day stated in conversation to a member of the Residency that he was at Dayir the day the “ Sphinx ” called there, and that “ the pirate was actually staying wdth the Khan of that place at the time. That this fact was well known to everyone, but that as he (Mr. Francis) was treating the Khan, he could not go out and given information on board. Further corroboration from an independent source is furnished in a report from the Political Agent, Koweit, before whom one Muhammad bin Haji Abdulla bin Muhammad, a nakhoda and inhabitant of the island of Kharg, stated that the chief of the pirates was actually in “ Dayir at the time the “ Sphinx ” called.” (Note —It will be understood that H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” only went to the locality to make enquiries for the Resident’s information.)Action taken by the Residency. On receiving the first report (dated 29th November 1906) of the piracy from the Residency Agent at Lingah, enquiries were made at once from the Derva Begi, the then Governor of the Gulf Ports, as to what steps he proposed to take in the matter. The Derya Begi replied (13th December 1906) that Dayir was in Dashti under. Jamal Khan and that Dashti was in the jurisdiction of Pars and that therefore he was unable to see his way to taking any action. The Resident again communicated with him pointing out that he did not see how anything could be done except by sea by means of the “ Persepolis ” which was under his (the Governors) control, and enquired whether it would assist in any way if he (the Resident) were to move the Legation to get the “ Persepolis ” deputed The Derya Begi informed the Resident in reply (3rd January 1907) that the ‘ Perse- pohs ” had been damaged by the Customs officials to prevent him from paying a visit to Lingah and that he could not make use of the “Muzaffer” without orders from Tehran, as she was under the control of the Customs Director. Ou receipt of this the Resident telegraphed (5th January 1907) to the Minister, informing him of the position of affairs and requesting that the Persian Govern ment be moved to direct the Governor to proceed to Dashti in the “ Mozaffer.” At the same time (6th January 1907) he requested the senior Naval Officer (Captain Bowman) who happened to be at Bushire, to proceed to Dayir and make enquiries with a view to obtaining, if possible, further details regarding the piracy. On February 16th the Minister replied t6 the Resident’s telegram inform ing him that it was stated by the Persian Government that the necessary orders had been sent. In the meantime, however, there had been a change of Governors. T-Derya Begi having left Bushire on the 30th January was suc ceeded by Haji Saeed-es-Sultaneh, and the latter having been offered the Gover norship of Dashti by the Pars authorities and having accepted the same (28th February) the Pars Government to whom a reference was made on the subject by His Majesty’s Consul as Shiraz repudiated jurisdiction and threw back res ponsibility on Bushire. The new Governor of the Gulf Ports however promised to take necessary action in the matter, though he at the same time denied having received any orders from Tehran in that connection. No action has up to date been taken by him, and the Resident now understands that the Saeed-es-Sultaneh has submitted his resignation of the Governorship of Dashti though this has not yet been accepted. On 16th June 1907, in reply to Resident’s telegram No. 92—376 of 16th idem regarding another piracy committed apparently by the same gang on a Koweit Dhow.^ His Majesty’s Minister intimated that he could hold out no hopes that useful action would be taken by the Persian Government at present. Bushire ,• The 23rd June ' 1 tgoy. ) P. Z. COZ, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Brief details of a piracy committed on a Koweit Dhow. A Koweit boom with a crew of^4 men, natives of Basrah, and owned by AH bin Hamad ul Fathala, originally of Bahrein, but domiciled (since 40 years) in Koweit, left Koweit for Basrah on December 24th, 1906, leaving the latter place again on.her return journey on January 4th, 1907. She never returned and was given up for lost. _ According to the father of the nakhoda, who helped to load up the boat at Basrah, there were about 25 native passengers on board, amongst whom were— (1) the daughter of Brahim bin Nugaimish, wife of Ali bin Nugaimish; (2) Abdur Rahmam bin Shahab; both well known in Koweit.8 About the middle of March, news was received that the boom had been seen derelict off the island of Amair on the Arab Coast near El K at if, but on enquiries being made there by the owner’s son Hussein, he was informed that it had been salved and taken by the inhabitants of the island to Bahrein for sale. Subsequently it transpired that the vessel had been recognised at Bahrein by friends of Ali bin Fathala, and enquiries were made, which led to Sheikh Esa giving orders for the boat to be returned to the original owner whose son had now arrived at Bahrein with a letter from Sheikh Mubarek. The Amair people declared that they had found in the boom many blood marks, a severed human arm and the remains of a man with his hands tied behind his back and towed by the boom The vessel when found was said to have been absolutely empty con taining not a sail or a cubit’s length of rope. Its hull was however in perfectly sea worthy condition. Haii Abdullah bin Muhammad Arab, nakhoda of Kharg Island, made a statement before the Political Agent, Koweit, on 21st May to the effect that he had recently been sitting in a coffee-shop at Bahrein when a Persian of Dayir, who was present and discussing these piracies, stated that the sons of Hamaidi, the notorious pirates, were well known in his village. They had recently been absent for two or three months and had then returned bringing dates and brace lets and goldlaced clothes of women. The chief of them was one by name Abdulla bin Humaidi oi Basrah and his sons— (1) Abdur Reza. : * (2) Name unknown. Their crew consisted of— (1) Sevyid Mehdi of Ganawa (a well known robber, once punished by the headman of Bunder Rig.) (2) Six men of Daiyir. The man further stated that their head-quarters used to be Daiyir, but that now they lurked in Khor Ziyarat and had a at * 2 * house in Um-el-Kurran* and Jabrin Island. On 6th June Sheikh Mubarek wrote pressing for the punishment of these men and offering to arm a dhow for the purpose. His proposal is under refer ence to Government. BUSHIRE; The 23rd June igoj. P.

Sir, | I 11 continuation of mv General Letter of R7th .July 1907, I have the honour to infora you that I left Bushire for Aoweit at noon of July in ondoi* to obtain information re^ rding the movements of a pranpf of pirates reported to be cruising off Hindyan River (See paragraph ? General Letter, No.4^/07 - 27th duly 1907). I anchored at Koweit at 1.0 p.m. next day, and found that Sheikh Mubarrek was at Mo hammer ah, I therefore left at seven the same evening for the Shatt-al- Arab, Ma f ior :(nox. the Political Ayent very kindlv accompanying me in order that we might consult the Sheikh together. P.- I anchored at. Mohammerah at. G.15 p.m. of Pnd August, and having had an interview with Mr McDouall, H.M.Consul there, I it was arranged that he. Manor Knox, and mvself should meet Sheikh Mubarrek and Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah on board the former’s steam yacht 'MUSTIRIF-AL-SABAH ft at 7.SO next morning. This was done, and at our meeting Sheikh Khazal informed me that he was then endeavouring to get hold of the murderers, and ^Iso protested that he was always ready to do all that lav in his power to put down piracy. Sheikh Mubarrek stated that I he had information that the pirates were then at Haiyer (which \ he said they use as their base) having returned there from Pindvan. He expected they would be in the vicinity of the Shatt-al - Arab about the eighteenth of this month on the look out for f-he people coming up with specie to buy dates in » the river. Heal so informed me in answer to my enquiries, that he would be willing to put some of his own people who could identify Abdullah bin Humaidi (the ringleader) and his ^6 Commander in Chief, confederates H. M. Ships and Vessels, HAST INDIES.confederates on board whichever Man of %r was detailed for the protection of the date trade # Mr McDouall promised to informed the Kargazar at Mo hammer ah of the facts concerning the doings of Bin Himaidi and Ms gang, but it is I feaf % hopeless to expect anything from the Persian Officials, end as Daiyer is in their Terri- torrr we can do nothing there without their assistance. Sheikh Mibarrek is perfectlv sincere in his promises of assistance, as since the Shivoh boat was attacked, another craft belonging to Kowejt has been looted and all her people murdered bv (it is believed) the same gang. He has asked the Government of India’s permission to fit out an armed dhow him self, and is confident he could capture the pirates were he allowed to go to work in his own wav about it. I have not yet heard what answer he has recived to his proposal. G.- I left Mohammerah at 10.0 a.ra. the same day to take Major Knox back to Koweit, but found so little water on the Bar that I was. obliged to anchor for the night bv Po.l buoy. I proceeded next morning over the Bar, and anchored at Koweit, (where Major Knox disembarked) at 5 .go p.m. 4, - I left at 6.GO a.a. August 5th for Fao in order to fill up our foremost boiler with fresh waf.er after its having been cleaned} anchored for the night at the Outer Buov, and proceede3over the Bar next morning, anchoring off Fao at 11 o’clock. 5. - I left Fao at 8.GO a.m. 7 hh August, and anchored at Bushire at 6.GO ncxf morning. H.M.S. 'REDBREAST’’ arrived from Bahrein, in order to fill up with coal, two hours later. 6 # - I gave Lieutenant and Commander Hose orders to leave for Bahrein again on the tenth instant, and to remain there till the arrival of the Mail due on the sixteenth, after which he was to proceed to Koweit to consult wj th Major Knox and the Sheikh as toSheikh as fco Bin iumaidi and his people’s 'vheneabonts; and then to take on the duty of cruising in the vicinity of the Shatt-al-Arab for the protection of the date traders. 7 «” ff LAP WING” is detained long about the Masirah business this ship could relieve the 'REDBREAST” at the Shatt- al-Arab. and she could return again to Bahrein, otherwise the 'LAPWING' had better go to Bahrein to look after the Pearlers. J do not think Bahrein’s being without a shipfor about ten days or so will matter much, as Commander Hose has been in the habit of making cruises out to the Pearl Banks, and his sailing on the sixteenth will not excite much comment, also he intends to keep secret the facf of his being bound to the Shatt-al-Arab. 8 . - In accordance with your telegram No.44 of 89.7.07 I informed the Assistant Paymaster in charge at Bombay that Commander Litchfield should join at Muscat. 9. - I left Bushire at 6.80 a.m. of 10th August; anchored at Henjajn at 8.70 p.m. on the twelfth, left again at 5 o’clock the same evening, and anchored here at 8.80 a.m. of the fourteenth.

I have allowed the Captain of the 'Teutonia” to take passage in the 'Lapwing” as he is still ver'' anxious about his missing boats' crews, and also wishes to see the wreck before making a final report to his Companv.

In defiance of pressure from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, and myself here, no serious action has been taken by Persian authorities, and the Pars and Bushire Gov ernments continue to shift responsibility for maintenance of order in Dashti district from one to the other.

Sheikh Mubarak further asks that the Government of India will concur in his employing a heavily armed dhow to protect his dhows plying between Basrah or Koweit and Persian ports, and that no objections may be raised to his dealing direct with piracies if any are encountered. Such a vessel must, to be of any use, operate, if necessary, in territorial waters and creeks, and in any case I think that it would be difficult to prevent it from doing so. But apart from this, the Government oi India will probably consider that the same objections exist as were held to exist with • to.

If, however, we oppose Mubarak’s proposal, we should obviously insist on the Persian Government taking adequate measures to suppress the gang and see that such measures are satisfactorily carried out.

I informed the Shaikh that, while I felt sure that the Government would appreciate to the full his offer to co-operate in the suppression of these pests, it occurred to me that there might perhaps be difficulties to prevent their accept ance thereof, especially if the boom, to effect their object, had to enter Persian or Turkish ports, and that it would be advisable to consult the Resident before taking action. The Shaikh replied that he had not thought of entering ports but proposed to effect the capture either in the open sea or to follow them in the Khor-i-Hindian, where he seemed to think there was a chance of the pirates taking refuge. He agreed that it was necessary to consult you first and I asked him to be good enough to put his proposal in writing. That proposal I have now the honour to submit and to request the favour of early instructions as to the reply to be given to the Shaikh.

After complements .—We inform you that the boom of Ali ibn Fathala of our subjects, the people of Koweit, five months ago, loaded up from Bassora date baskets and passengers of the people of Koweit, both male and female, and left for Koweit. The aforesaid boom was lost. It was conjectured that she had been wrecked by the winter gales. After 60 days, news came that the boom had grounded on the island of Amair and her mast and yards still standing and they saw in her blood and we sent the owner of the boom to the aforesaid boom and he also saw in her much blood and we did not know what had happened to them. After that, Nakhoda Abdulla of the people of Kharj informed us that, from the talk of the people of Dayar to him in Bahrein, the children of Hamaidi had taken away the boom, when at anchor at the buoy, and had killed all the people in her and had taken all her property and the cargo in the boom and had abandoned her, so that she grounded at the island of Amair. And the sons of Hamaidi are notorious, they are all dwelling in Dayar and a source of profit to the ruler of that place. We have sent Haji Abdulla of Kharj to you and he has informed you verbally. We hope that you will acquaint the Resident of this occurrence. And the sons of Hamaidi are pirates, well-known and banished by Shaikh Khazal and the Bassora Government. It is incumbent on the ruler of Dayar that he should seize these men and hand them over to the British Government. in the Foreign Department, Simla.

In amplification of my telegram No. 376, dated 16th June too?, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India precis of the two cases of piracy referred to. ' r Duplicates are being forwarded to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran for information. Precis of a case of piracy ’with murder committed on a Persian Dhow off Taonah in November Igo6, and subsequent correspondence. . ^ native vessel of the “ Mashoweh ” type belonging to the Persian Port of Shivoh, which had been in the “ poos ” of dry-dock of Lingah for some days was ready for sea on 10th November. She had on board 6 persons and cargo to the value of 6,ooo rupees. &amp; In the dry-dock alongside of her had been another “ Mashoweh ” manned by some Arabs. It seems that these Arabs are well known as “Bilashtis” (pirates), and are said to belong to a party of bad characters which was expelled from the Shatt-el-Arab 2 years ago by the Sheikh of Mohammerah on account of depredations committed there. They are variously stated to have been living for some time past at Dayer, Rangoon, and Umm-el-Kurm, on the Dashti Coast. Their identity was probably not recognised at Lingah until after the occurrence. This Arab Mashoweh got under way from Lingah on the night of the 16th September at the same time as the Shivoh craft and it appears that on the night before the 1st Shawwal (*&gt;., night of 17th November) the Arabs approached the Persian Dhow on the pretence of asking for water and having boarded her, attacked and stabbed to death, as they thought, the 6 occupants and transferred all the merchandise found in her to their own vessel. They then tied the wound ed or murdered men to the anchor rope and threw them overboard with the anchor and bored a hole in the dhow so that she got waterlogged and partially sank. The pirates then left and it is not known where they went to. Of the 6 men thrown overboard, one, a boy of 16, who was not dead, got free from the ropes and was cast ashore between Charak and Taonah about noon on the 1st Shavval (18th November), where he was found by some persons of Taonah and taken to the Chief of that place Sheikh Abdullah bin Mahomed Bushri. He was nursed at Taonah until he was sufficiently recovered to be taken to Lingah to have his wounds tended. On the same afternoon that the boy was found an object was seen in the sea by the Taonah people and boats proceeding to the spot found that it was the scuttled dhow with several holes in her. The above was reported by the Residency Agent at Lingah on the 29th November 1906. Later reports from the same source, obtained from one Abdul Rahim bin Mullah Abdullah, an inhabitant of Rangoon, have brought the follow ing details to light. The occupants of the Shivoh dhow were as follows (1) Ibrahim. (2) All bin Ibrahim (3) Mahomed bin Abdul Ghani (4) and (5) Names not known... (6) One ship’s boy Son of above and sole survivor. Owner of the looted merchandise. A merchant of Gaobandi for the chief of which district he was also bringing some gold ornaments. Two of the crew. Taken prisoner by the pirates and murdered later.5 SPW! The pirates after sinking the dhow made for a small port 2 miles ea,t of Rangoon called Nakhl-i-Ghanem where they murdered the ships boy (No 6) above referred to, and landed the captured goods. From here they transported the latter by land to Rangoon. Ahmed Rhan, uncle of Jamal Rhan of Dashti the Deputy Governor of this place, appears to have been away at the time but two of his relatives, who were acting for him, by name Mulla Hussein and Za y e r Mirza are alleged to have received a portion of the booty, a share being also given to Haji Rhan bin Jamal Rhan, Deputy Governor of Dayir, who had come to know of the proceedings. Tamal Rhan, the Governor of Dashti, on hearing of the incident, evidently appeared to have feared pursuit, as he gave directions for the pirates ^ be dis * guised as men of Dashti and taken to the village of Bordaghoon, 30 miles north of Davir where they were to await his arrival. The families of the pirates reside at Rangoon and their dhow after landing the stolen goods appears to have been taken to the Rhor-bBardistan, 2 miles east of Dayir. As regards the pirates themselves they appear to have been three in number, all brothers, though there is some divergence of opinion regarding their precise names. (1) According to Abdul Rahim bin Mulla Abdulla, originally an inhabitant of Rangoon, but now residing at Lingah, they were— (i) Sheikh Abdulla. (it) Sheikh Ibrahim. (iit) Sheikh Abdul Reza. (2) According to the Abyssinian slave of one Mohamed bin Subah, who knew them while at Lingah, their names were— (*') Abdulla, (it) Meloo, (Hi) Abdul Reza, and they were known as the family of Hamaidi and residents of Manyoohi. (3) When Captain Bowman of H.M.S. “Sphinx” went to Dayir and Rangoon to make enquiries at the request of the Resident in January 1907, the local authorities denied all knowledge of this particular piracy, but declared that it was true that about 4 years ago some Bassora Arabs had plundered a dhow belonging to Seyyid Saleh of Mohammerah and had then come to Dayir to sell the cargo, but that on the Sheikh of Mohammerah sending warning to Dayir about them, their dhow and cargo had been seized and the Arabs expelled. Their names were said to be— (1) Abdulla Ruthabin Hamaid. (2) Ibrahim bin Hamaid. (3) Ismail bin Hamaid al Amah (now a prisoner at Mohammerah). It was further stated that after being expelled from Dayir they had sought refuge at Abu Thabi or Shargah. In connection with this visit of H.M.S. “Sphinx” Mr. Francis, retired Assistant Surgeon, one day stated in conversation to a member of the Residency that he was at Dayir the day the “ Sphinx ” called there, and that “ the pirate ” was actually staying with the Rhan of that place at the time. That this fact was well known to everyone, but that as he (Mr. Francis) was treating the Rhan, he could not go out and given information on board. Further corroboration from an independent source is furnished in a report from the Political Agent, Roweit, before whom one Muhammad bin Haji Abdulla bin Muhammad, a nakhoda and inhabitant of the island of Kharg, stated that the chief of the pirates was actually in “ Dayir at the time the “ Sphinx ” called.” (Note It will be understood that H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” only went to the locality to make enquiries for the Resident’s information.)V 6 Action taken by the Residency. orders from Tehran, as she was under the control of the Customs Director. On receipt of this the Resident telegraphed (5th January 1907) to the Minister informing mm of the position of affairs and requesting that the Persian Govern ment be moved to direct the Governor to proceed to Dashti in the “ Mozaffer.” At the same time (6th January 1907) he requested the senior Naval Officer (Captain Bowman) who happened to be at Bushire, to proceed to Dayir and make enquiries with a view to obtaining, if possible, further details regarding the On February 16th the Minister replied to the Resident’s telegram inform- mg him that it was stated by the Persian Government that the necessary orders had been sent. In the meantime, however, there had been a change of Governors. The Derya Begi having left Bushire on the 30th January was^suc- ceeded by Hap Saeed*es-Sultaneh, and the latter having been offered the Gover norship of Dashti by the Pars authorities and having accepted the same (28th February) the Pars Government to whom a reference was made on the subject by His Majesty’s Consul as Shiraz repudiated jurisdiction and threw back res ponsibility on Bushire. The new Governor of the Gulf Ports however promised to take necessary action in the matter, though he at the same time denied having received any orders from Tehran in that connection. No action has up to date been taken by him and the Resident now understands that the Saeed-es-Sultaneh has submitted his resignation of the Governorship of Dashti though this has not yet been accepted. On 16th June 1907, in reply to Resident’s telegram No. 92—376 of 16th idem regarding another piracy committed apparently by the same gang on a Koweit Dhow^ His Majesty’s Minister intimated that he could hold out no hopes that useful action would be taken by the Persian Government at present. Brief details of a piracy committed on a Koweit Dhow. A Koweit boom with a crew of 4 men, natives of Bassora, and owned by Ali bin Hamad ul Fathala, originally of Bahrein, but domiciled (since 40 years) in Koweit, left Koweit for Bassora on December 24th, 1906, leaving the latter place again on her return journey on January 4th, 1907. She never returned and was given up for lost. According to the father of the nakhoda, who helped to load up the boat at Bassora, there were about 25 native passengers on board, amongst whom were— (1) the daughter of Brahim bin Nugaimish, wife of Ali bin Nugaimish; (2) Abdur Rahmam bin Shahab; both well known in Koweit. piracy. Bushire j The 23 rd June /go?. P. Z. COZ, Major, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf7 About the middle of March, news was received that the boom had been seen derelict off the island of Amair on the Arab Coast near El Katif, but pn enquiries being made there by the owner’s son Hussein, he was informed that it had been salved and taken by the inhabitants of the island to Bahrein for sale. Subsequently it transpired that the vessel had been recognised at Bahrein by friends of Ali bin Fathala, and enquiries were made, which led to Sheikh Esa giving orders for the boat to be returned to the original owner whose son had now arrived at Bahrein with a letter from Sheikh Mubarek. The Amair people declared that they had found in the boom many blood marks, a severed human arm and the remains of a man with his hands tied behind his back and towed by the boom. The vessel when found was said to have been absolutely empty con taining not a sail ora cubit’s length of rope. Its hull was however in perfectly sea worthy condition. Haji Abdullah bin Muhammad Arab, nakhoda of Kharg Island, made a statement before the Political Agent, Koweit, on 21st May to the effect that he had recently been sitting in a coffee-shop at Bahrein when a Persian of Dayir, who was present and discussing these piracies, stated that the sons of Hamaidi, the notorious pirates, were well known in his viliage. They had recently been absent for two or three months and had then returned bringing dates and brace lets and goldlaced clothes of women. The chief of them was one by name Abdulla bin Humaidi of Bassora and his sons— (1) Abdur Reza. (2) Name unknown. Their crew consisted of — (1) Seyyid Mehdi of Ganawa (a well known robber, once punished by the headman of Bunder Rig.) (2) Six men of Daiyir. The man further stated that their head-quarters used to be Daiyir, but that now they lurked in Khor Ziyarat and had a house in Um-el-Kurran* and Jabrin Island. On 6th June Sheikh Mubarek wrote pressing for the punishment of these men and offering to arm a dhow for the purpose. His proposal is under refer ence to Government, Bushire j The 2 jrd June igof. P.

To The Right Hon’ble JOHN MORLEY, O.M.j Sis Majesty’s Secretary of State for India, Simla, the 5th September 1907, Sir, We have the honour to forward herewith copies of correspondence* regard ing the conduct of the Sheikh of Koweit * Letter from the Political Resident in the Persian i n taking Part in an expedition Organized 1907, Sh 1 enc\i C u 0 r n e8. dential) ’ dated the 28th July by the Sheikh of Mohammerah against his rebellious tribesmen. 2 . It appears that Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah found himself obliged to take strong measures in his capacity as Persian Governor of the Mohammerah District, in order to compel the tribesmen of the Beni Traf to pay their revenue. Sheikh Mubarak, about the middle of June, proceeded to Moham- merah in his steam-yacht for the purpose of supporting his friend. He took with him a large quantity of small arms and ammunition, waterskins and other articles which he handed over to Sheikh Khazal, and he subsequently sent his vessel back for a second consignment. He also arranged, at Sheikh KhazaPs request, to garrison the Mohammerah outpost of Kasbeh temporarily with some of his own men, so as to free the Arab garrison for service with the field force. The operations resulted in the surrender of the Beni Truf. Although the operations in which Sheikh Khazal was engaged are described merely as the reduction to order of a rebellious tribe the Beni Truf, we have reason to believe from a note by Colonel Burton, when acting as Consul at Mohammerah in 1904 , that the Sheikh has contemplated the reduction of this tribe for some time, with the object of extending his unquestioned territorial authority to Hawizeh on the Turkish frontier; so that the proceedings have probably more than a temporary and local significance and may form part of a scheme for consolidating the Arab power in these regions under a central head. 3. We consider that by conveying arms and ammunition up the Shatt-el-Arab in his private yacht without the authority or permission of the Persian Government, the Sheikh ran the risk of involving himself in serious difficulties with that Government or with the Turkish authorities, in either of which cases diplomatic complications affecting His Majesty’s Gov ernment might have arisen. The Persian Government might ^ reasonably imagine that the prompt assistance rendered by Mubarak to Sheikh Khazal would encourage the latter to assert his independence, should he find^ a conve nient opportunity for doing so, while the Porte might regard the incident as an indication of Mubarak’s growing disregard of Turkish suzerainty and he might2 $ Fide correspondence forwarded with Foreign Secretary’s letters No. 4L M., dated the 11th October 1906, and No. 45 M., dated the 8 th November 1906. even have been arrested as a pirate for plying in Turkish waters with an armed vessel.

Your attention is invited in this connection to the despatch of 19 th July 1906 from Sir C. Spring-Eice to Sir E. Grey which we have received since the preceding remarks were written. 4 . The possibility of a coalition between these Sheikhs who occupy the territory dominating the head of the Gulf had not escaped our attention, and in connection with this incident we venture to invite a reference to the apprehensions which we expressed in our telegram | No. S.— 100 , dated the 8 th October 1906 , to the Political Eesident in the Persian Gulf, as to the possible formation of a confederacy of Arab Sheikhs led by Sheikh Mubarak and the Sheikh of Mohammerah in order to secure their independence of foreign dominion. The attitude assumed by Sheikh Mubarak appears to favour the supposition that he is at all events desirous of drawing closer the bonds between himself and Sheikh Khazal, even to the extent of furnishing armed assistance to the latter in Persian territory, so that the matter will have to be closely watched in future. 6 . As you are aware, the Agreement§ concluded with the Sheikh of Koweit § vide our Secret despatch No. 35 (External), on the 23 rd January 1899 contains no dated the 23rd February 1899. ^ stipulation US to the Conduct of the Sheikh’s external relations by the British Government, but merely provides that the Sheikh shall not, without the previous sanction of the British Govern ment, receive the representative of any Poreign Power at Koweit, or give for occupation or any other purpose any portion of his territory to the Government or subjects of any other Power. Por so long as these stipulations are observed, the good offices of the British Government were promised under the Agree ment to the Sheikh. This formal Agreement has, however, since been modified by the messages conveyed to the Sheikh in compliance with Lord George Hamilton’s telegram of the 27 th September 1901 , in connection with the differences between the Sheikh of Koweit and the Amir of Nejd, and the Eon’ble St. John Brodrick’s telegram of the 3 rd Pebruary 1904 , when a conflict was feared between the Sheikh, in combination with Sadun Pasha, and certain Arab tribes under Turkish protection. On both these occasions the Sheikh of Koweit was informed that His Majesty’s Government would use their good offices on his behalf only if he refrained from aggression and was guided by || Vide correspondence ending with your telegram, their advice 1 and His Majestv’s GoVCrn- dated the 16th July 1907. + A . i j. j i. . . .

But we consider that our position in Koweit vis-a-vis other Powers would be^ greatly strengthened if this principle of policy could now be embodied ma formal agreement; and advantage might perhaps be taken of Sheikh Khazal’s recent warlike expedition in Moharnmerah and f th ® negotiations^ now in progress for the purchase of the Koweit foreshore, the requisite clause to the Agreement to be executed in which Sheikh Mubarak is apparently anxious to repeat his pledges as to the exclusion of all foreign interests in Koweit other than the British. It might be necessary, in order to secure the Sheikh’s consent to this addition, to increase, by way ot a subsidy, the annual payment of Es. 60,000 for which the Sheikh has TT Vide our telegram, dated the 28th August 1907. as ked^[ as rent for the foreshore ; but WG 0 , ., T , ,, . * should, of course, attempt to obtain his consent without the promise of any increased payment. Our Political Ao-ent may also be able to utilise this recent adventure of Sheikh Mubarak as a lever# '&gt; to induce him to give us the reservations required on reasonable terms. We now have the honour to request your sanction to the foregoing proposal; and, if it commends itself to His Majesty’s Government, we would ask that your views may be communicated to us by telegraph, since the Sheikh has stated that his offer regarding the foreshore will only remain open for two months with effect, as we understand, from the 14 th August; and it would be convenient that the negotiations regarding the proposed addition to the Agreement should be con ducted simultaneously with those regarding the foreshore. 6. If His Majesty’s Government do not approve of this proposal, we con sider that the Sheikh should be informed that the Government of India take strong exception to the share taken by him in the recent expedition in Arabistan and that, unless he seeks and is guided by our advice in such matters, we shall not be able to exercise our good offices on his behalf.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf I # T °- S,R L0 “' S W ' Dane ' K.C.I.E,, C.S.I., Secretary t 0 the Government of Ind in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward for the information of the Government of India * Koweit No. 313 , dated 22nd June 1907. a c ?Py °f a communication* which I have .. u* a r cu u u ar i t , received from the Political Agent at Kovveit on the subject of Shaikh Mubarak’s recent visit to Mohammerah. 2. On receipt, before I left Bushire, of the demi-official communication mentioned in paragraph 3 thereof, I let Major Knox know informallv that I did not_ propose to take any action until I had received further and parallel illumi nation on the subject from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerahi Up to the time I left for Shiraz on 26th June Mr. McDouall’s reports did not give me the impression that any deterrent action on my part was either neces sary or useful, nor indeed was any possible, as I was not in any case in a position to communicate quickly or satisfactorily with Shaikh Mubarak in time for mv d u® ° f “f; „ Mai ? r Knox &gt; ! etter No - 3'3 now enclosed arrived after I had left Bushire and followed me to Shiraz, where, on arrival, I ascertained bv telegraph from Bushire that the Shaikh of Mohamraerah’s operations had termi nated; that he had effectively brought the Beni Truf to heel- and that Shaikh Mubarak had returned to Koweit. ’ andthat Under these circumstances we can afford to examine the several aspects of the incident with deliberation. r 1 ^ ~ 3. Stated briefly the position was as follows :— Shaikh Khazal in his official capacity of Governor, on behalf of the Persian Government, of the Mohammerah district and appanages, having for a long time past had difficulties with the Beni Truf, owing to non-payment of revenue by them, ultimately found himself obliged to take the field against them. Shaikh Mubarak learning that his fast friend was having an anxious time, and also prompted ^ no doubt by the consideration that were Shaikh Khazal defeated, his own security for large sums of money lent to him would be greatly prejudiced, proceeded to Mohammerah in his steam yacht to support his ally with his presence and counsels. He took with him at the same time (and sent his vessel back for a second consignment) a large quantity of small arms and ammunition ; waterskins, and other articles likely to prove useful to his ally. He also arranged at Shaikh Khazal s request to place some of his own men temporarily to garrison the Mohammerah outpost of Khasbeh opposite Mohammerah, in order to free its present Arab garrison for service with Shaikh KhazaBs field force. 4. Looking at the picture from the most favourable point of view we see Shaikh Mubarak rendering prompt and yeoman service to his friend the Persian Governor of Mohammerah, with a result greatly to the berefit of the Persian Administration and of law and order in Arabistan, as well as to the enhancement of the prestige of their representative. If the Persian Government take exception to Shaikh Khazal receiving help from Shaikh Mubarak, it is presumably open to them to display such signs of their displeasure to Shaikh Khazal, as will deter him from accepting such assistance again. Or, if they feel so inclined, which is unlikely, they might move us to use our influence with Mubarak to discourage such action on his part in future. The unfavourable aspects of the incident are, that Shaikh Mubarak used his steam yacht to convey arms and ammunition up the Shatt-el-Arab, a course which is open to exception from an international point of view ; and which may possibly imbue the Persian Government with the apprehension that he might at any time take the same measures to assist the Shaikh of Mohammerah in asserting his independence. His action may even give foreign Governments a w m2 ^ ' r-- ~- V 1 f handle for the charge that we are directly encouraging the two Shaikhs in this direction. In fact this charge has already •Minister to Resident, No. 104 of 30 th June made by the Russian Legation, as 1907. _ .... .... . J , , 0 VI* FMrst Assistant to Minister, No. 809 of 3^ July w iH be seen from the two telegrams cited,* •s 0 ?* which passed after I left Bushire. 5. Regarding the matter from the standpoint of the Political Ag;ent at Koweit, I quite understand Major Knox feeling hurt at Shaikh Mubarak’s neglect , to consult him or to give him his confidence. On the other hand, put ting myself in Shaikh Mubarak’s shoes, I cannot ignore the fact that any help which was to be given to Shaikh Khazal must be given promptly if at all, and that he has sufficient experience of our deliberate methods to know well enough that by the time he could receive a reply to any reference made to us, the crisis would long since have passed and Shaikh Khazal would have been defeated, or would have won without his help. On the whole, and unless the position becomes modified by further diplomatic action on the part of Persia, Turkey, or Russia (to which we seem to have a fairly practical answer), I cannot think that Shaikh Mubarak’s escapade, if it be one, calls for the drastic notice advocated by Major Knox ; namely, (0 a sharp remonstrance accompanied by force; or (it) the withdrawal of our representative from Koweit. I am rather inclined to consider that the case will be met by niy informing Shaikh Mubarak, on behalf of Government, if necessary, that we quite sympathise with him in his desire to prove a friend in need to his ally Shaikh Khazal, but feel called upon to make it plain to him that by conveying arms and ammunition up the Shatt-el-Arab in his private yacht without the authority or permission of the Persian Government he ran great risk of placing himself in serious difficulties with that Government or the Porte, from which we should have found great difficulty in assisting him to extricate himself. I have not got with me the text of our secret agreement with Shaikh Mubarak, but if his action could be quoted as being inconsistent with that part of the document dealing with his relations with foreign powers, so much the better. 6. While expressing these views I quite realise that it would be possible to regard this interesting incident in quite a different light to that in which it presents itself to me; and I can do no more than commit the circumstances to the wiser and more detached examination of Government. I have not forwarded a copy of this communication to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. From- No. 313 , dated Koweit, the 22 nd June 1907 . -The Political Agent, Koweit, To—-The Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to inform you of further details with reference to the return of Shaikh Mubarak’s steam launch to this port on Wednesday last. The vessel arrived about noon of the 19th with only Ali bin Khalifa and Suliman bin Hamud aboard of her. 2. The interval between noon and sunset was busily employed in loading her up with small arms and ammunition. This was all carried on without the small est attempt at concealment in broad day-light and it is estimated that at least 2,000 rifles and a proportionate quantity of ammunition were put on board of her. 3. I have already reported demi-officially that 1,500 rifles are said to have gone with her on her first voyage. I have also reported that Shaikh Jabir bin Mo’alla of the Nasser of Gasbah left for up-river. I only learnt the next morning that he left in Shaikh Mubarak’s launch. g3 f is MV 4. The reason for these extraordinary proceedings is variously reported and probably erroneously as to detail though fairly correct in the main. The two undisputed assertions are— (a) that Shaikh Mubarak has lent Shaikh Khazal a very large sum of money on this year’s date-crop ; (£) that Shaikh Mubarak wants to make sure of repayment, as Shaikh KhazaPs affairs are in a bad way. 6. One report goes that Shaikh Khazal is dead and that there is trouble about the inheritance and that Shaikh Mubarak wishes to secure the heir who, he thinks, will look after his interests. The other version is that Shaikh KhazaPs tribes have risen against him and Mubarak is sending him assistance. 7. Those who support the first rumour state that the reason for Jabir bin Mo’alla’s return is that Shaikh Mubarak proposes to install him again as Shaikh of Gasbah and will support him in that position, provided he secures Mubarak in the enjoyment of this year’s date-crop. 8. Whichever version is correct, the facts seem enough to warrant very serious apprehension. Shaikh Mubarak is openly using a large vessel, his private property, to import large quantities of arms into either Persian or Turkish territory, and it appears to me that the authorities of either country might try and effect his arrest on this account alone and we should have nothing to say in his defence. Indeed, one rumour of his capture by the Turkish authorities at Basrah has already reached me, though I am inclined to treat it as a wild flight of the imagina tion. 9. Compared with this escapade, the interference in the affairs of Central Arabia would appear mere child’s play. 10. With much hesitation in dealing with matters of such grave import, I venture to suggest that only two courses are open to us— {a) to administer a sharp remonstrance to Shaikh Mubarak, supporting it with such a show of force, as will make it evident to him that we are his masters, as well as protectors andfmean to be so, and insist on the scrupulous fulfilment, so far as is now possible, of all the various promises that he has made and broken. An important point would be the deportation of three or four of the principal importers of arms. It does not seem to me that there would be any serious local opposition, even if the inhabitants were capable of such opposition, for Shaikh Mubarak’s rule is unpopular and the Koweit people say openly that all the money he has sent to Shaikh Khazal has been wrung out of them by new and unheard of taxes. I fully believe that the Shaikh realises that the Turks will never forgive him and that the Germans have so thrown in their lot with the Turks that they cannot deal with him sincerely if they would. His only hope is in our support, which has made him what he now is, the richest and most powerful Shaikh that Koweit has ever seen: he would, in my opinion, submit to whatever terms we chose to compel him to, if he were once convinced that we were in earnest ; (b) if it is decided that such drastic action is impossible in present circumstances, it would be well to withdraw our representative, for Shaikh Mubarak’s high-handed actions are bound to involve us in serious trouble before long and he listens to no remonstrances.

There is nothing unusual in the punitive expedition of the Shaikh of Mohammerah against the Beni Truf, as it is a frequent occurrence for this tribe to be in revolt. The accusation made by the Russians is of course entirely without foundation. t t Under Secrets Commi Under Secretsz(?S 1~.

Now that you are proceeding to the ports to meet his Excellency the Viceroy of India, 1 have no doubt you will give, full instructions to the British skips that, when they pursue pirates m the Persian waters and get near the Persian coast, the pursuit may be left m the hands of the Persian authorities in order that the crew should not l , 8 T t0 USe arms or enter Persian territory. In this way such incidents as took p ace last year, and which may have serious consequences and give trouble to the officials or the two Governments, may be avoided. a J S0 . to P°int_ out to_ your Excellency that if at anv time you have been requested to insist on British ships not importing arms into Persia; or have been asked to recommend that other ships should he watched from doing so, this step, the benefit of which has been and is shared by the British Government, cannot affect theindis- putabJe right oi. the Persian Government in protecting its borders. 1 may also add that it loi the punishment of Mr. Graves’ murderers permission was given that British mews should co-operate with the Persians, this was an exceptional measure with special permission, and it does not in any wav affect the rights of the Persian Government. . S j nce &gt; as your Excellency is aware, the intention of the Persian Government is to avoid incidents which may lead to troubles, I have no doubt the British authorities will meet the wishes of the Persian Government, and will give full instructions to the nrouer authorities on the subject. ^ 1 '</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000001_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/155/1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000001</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/155/1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 3208/1908 Pt 1 ‘Persian Gulf: Dayir pirates (coast of Persia)’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1904/1908</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-12-17T12:38:16</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>163 folios</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>Part 1 of the volume comprises correspondence concerning criminal actions reported to have taken place in ports and around the coastal waters of the Persian Gulf, including arms trafficking and murder, designated by British Government officials under the rubric of piracy. Key correspondents include: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Major Percy Zachariah Cox); Foreign Office officials (Sir Louis Du Pan Mallet; Sir Charles Hardinge); the Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty (Sir Charles Inigo Thomas); the Under Secretary of State for India (Sir Arthur Godley); the British Ambassador at Tehran (Charles Murray Marling).Reference is made to incidents taking place in 1906 and 1907 (ff 182-185), committed by individuals previously expelled from Mohammerah [Khorramshahr], and now residing in the Dashtī ports of Dayir [Bandar-e Deyyer] and Kangan [Bandar-e Kangān] in Persia. Much of the subsequent correspondence details British officials’ negotiations with the Persian Government to send vessels to the Dashtī coast, in order to apprehend the suspected individuals and destroy ‘strongholds’ along the coast. Naval reports sent by Captain C S Hickley of HMS
                           Highflyer(ff 54-66a) and Lieutenant Shirley Litchfield of HMS
                           Sphinx(ff 66b-75) provide details of the expedition in November 1907 to Dayir, which resulted in the successful apprehension of the suspects. Later correspondence refers to the British Government’s expression of appreciation for the assistance provided by the Khan of Bander Rig [Bandar Rīg] in apprehending the suspects, the handover of the suspects to the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and British officials’ desire that, should it be proved that the suspects committed murder, the death penalty be passed on them.The file also contains correspondence relating to the Shaikh of Kuwait’s activities in dealing with incidents of piracy in the waters around the Shatt al Arab, and the deportation from Muscat to Karachi of a number of Afghans believed to be involved in arms trafficking.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Secretary to the Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Sphinx, paddle steamer</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HMS Highflyer, cruiser</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Charles Inigo Thomas</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dashti</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar-e Deyyer</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bandar-e Kangan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Deyr</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Khorramshahr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Law of the sea</topic></subject><subject><topic>Homicide</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms control</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Administration of Justice</topic></subject><subject><topic>Arms traffic</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100027915585.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
