I am, Sir, Your most obedient servant, J. L. MAFFEY. India Office Date. 28th November 1^34 (Confidential) Description. From the Resident at Aden (with enclosures) Copy also sent to Foreign Office and AdmiraltyCopy of a letter $o.4t&gt;G£ dated the 14th July 19^4 from the Chief Comuiiseioner, Aden, to the Secretary to the Government of India, foreign and i'olitiaal Department, : imla. 3UdJ^CX ;* Bight of fishing in watere ^iatee . I have the honour to state that a question hap arisen regarding fishing rights in the t?ea bordering the ooapt of the /fcdali Sultanate of LaheJ, a State in the Aden Proteotoriste, Hie Highness the Saltan olaime territorial juriedlotion in respect of fishing rights in these watert up to a three mile limit, and consider* that fishing in them should be reserved for the benefit of Abdali eubjeote, and that Bden fishermen oannot operate in them except with we his peraiiesion and subject to hia taxation, there is nothing either in the treaty with the Abd&amp;li Sultan or any other Aden protectorate treaty dealing with this point, 2. The Jultan’r olaim raises e question of principle, which it may be necessary for me to submit to the Colonial Office, which now controls the Aden protectorate, before doing ^o I shall be grateful for your advioe inesttiuch as the Aden Protectorate treaties were originally made by the Government of India, and as the position with regard to the sea bordering the States of the Aden Protectorate Is therefore presumably analogous to that of the sea bordering States in India, such as Travanoore, Cochin, Cutch and the maritime States of Kathiawar. 3. I find that 'Territorial latere' are defined in Aharton*8 Lexicon as follows;. ' Territorial Patera . This expression is used with regard to that portion of the sen. up to a limited distance, which i® immediately adjacent to the shores \*of any oountry. Th« ^•aerally reoo£Ci8«d liaeit Is three mlXes a Territorial waters are oonsidered ae territory to the extent that fishing ic such waters is reserved for the exclusive benefit of the rubjeote of the adjacent country. 5ee the Territorial outers Jurisdiction Act, ld78, 4i and 4h Viot.c.7^ t passed in aenee^uencs of the decision in K.v. Teyn, • (1876) 2 jxd 63. • 4. I do not know, whether this definition is applicable In the cage of the States I have mentioned, I asemue that there is no doubt that for international purposes the waters borlerin* on these Indian ; tates and similarly the waters bordering on the aden protectorate states are Jrltieh, but it is possible that for administrative purposes (including fishing rights) they are regarded ae belonging to the States oonoerned. 5. I am unable to find any explanation of this point in the information available to me here, and I shall be glad if you will be good enough to enlighten me ae to the position in the case of Indian maritime State,&amp; -/ C)' MSfir. ® to tha Cdoratary, ^olitloal Department, Inditt Offioe, ^ on&amp;on, UQ,t iatod th# ^eoruary 19^ I &amp;Ri dirooted to &amp; d d r ft ft? you on the ecbjeot of the rights ajsd juriediotion of Indian Marlti te ; tate© in waters adjoinir. 5 their 90 tk»z line. £. The position hitherto maintained by the Toverncient of India if that the Indian State* hioh have no international status, have &amp;l*o, ae of ri^ht, no Jurifdiotion over the ro« oalled territorial waters opposite their ooect line. They * have held that thie ^nriFdiotion veets in the nritiuh Jovernitent as par^ mount Power, but that the lovercmect will oontider, in eaoh oafe ae it ariBet, how muoh juriedlotion and of what kind each State will be }.ern,itted to exeroUe, if it wiahee to do eo. In accordance with theta principle*, the lovermaent of India in 19C&amp; permitted the ftawnnagar Darbar to ^rant a leaee of its pearl fi»heriee but ruled that a Darbar monopoly of general iiehing rights mutt oe diealioved. They also apxed that it might be clearly explained to the Daroar that the jritirh Government did not waive their rights by not asserting theai on this occasion. The principle wa. reaffirmed in 1917 in a deoieion upon a reference made by the dombay Government enquiring whether certain trane-*hipmant fees levied by the Hawanagar State were reasonable and should be permitted. d. The question W'te again raised in 19£9 by the &gt;overnuent of Bombay in connection with a complaint received oy them froa a British Indian subject, who alleged that hip fishing boats had been seized by the ilawanagcr Tar bar for violation of the r^rb&amp;r &gt;iehery Buie© and that his servant had been fined Rt.50o/-. a copy of the relevant correspondence is attached which j .mm wmmam UPWW A 4 whioh -1X1 ebow that the oo&amp;plaiimiit did not dispute the Darber'p ri^ht to control fishery within the three-mile limit, but etsted that his bo&amp;t£ had been seised in outPiae the three-mile limit. Since, however, ae pointed out by the Bombay XoTernrr.ent, the care touches on important ipsuee as to the ri^hte of States in their territorial waters, disposal of the matter hap been deferred in the expectation that some pronouncement on this question zl i&lt;ht be made in the course of recent constitutional diBouasiono, 7hic expeotation has not been fulfilled, but the Government of India cons!ler that they should take this opportunity of restating their vieAp on the whole question* It will be observed that, if the ruling of 190$ referred to above ie to be maintained. Air, shrofffc complaint ehouid oe taken up with the Darbar and the Derbar should be called upon to refund the fine of tfa.600 impoced upon Aar .Shroff for breach of the ftawanagar ilehery Kules and alec to refrain from enforcing those ruler In future. ?here appear however to be valid objections to this courte. In tfte first place, kr.ihroff doe^ not eppear to question the Xjerbar’e right to impoee rectriotlone upon fiehing within the threa-n.ile limit but b&amp;ees hie complaint on the assertion that his boatf were seised out side that limit. Seoondly, the Sawangar Derbar have in faot imposed restrictions upon fishing within the three-mile limit einoe 1699 in spite of the lovernment oi India's ruling of 1909. The ftate tfiight, therefore, reasonably olaim the preaoriptlve right to continue to exercise this amount of jurisdiction. Thirdly, a more detailed examination of the juristic position has led to the conclusion that the territorial waters of the maritime ftatee of India form part of the territories of tho*e state?, but that the exercise of jurisdictionjariftdlotlOB within thor* watere ic diTidad bat^aen tha and the i^ramouct ^o»ar in eiaoh a *&amp;y that tha Statae * jurisdiction it liuiiUd to oneas, in which no qaafction of foreign relatione or external policy of any kind, including dofanoa, arira*?« Tha adoption of tfeii* theory would m&gt;ke it posaible to allow the Darbar? to exercise all emteria; and economic ri#hl« - ruch ae fishinf and 'flotaem and jeteasu^-wlth in the three-iaile limit from their ooaet line and to aatert the?# rights a^ainet xiritish Indian 3i*$eotB or foreign nationals. It would not, on the other hand, diminish the rights of the Paramount Power to take action for the defence of Inlia and for the fulfilment of their internet ional obligation!? within those territorial waters, a. The SoTermhent of Indie consider that these principles may logically oe deduced from recent changes of opinion regarding the soope of 'tar&amp;iann.toy' and from the ieciaion arrived at by Hie Majesty’s dbverrasant with re^jard to sovereignty over the air, in which connection I ate to invite atttention to Mr. ^ed^wood-Senn*« eoret despatch o.d of diet July 1930, before however oomrrunlcating their views to the dombfty lovernment. they consider it dacir*&amp;ble to coneult the Secretary of State and I stn to repeat that 1 may be informed whether these principle® have hie approval.frsm the iolitia&amp;l D«paru»«nt, Indtii* m Qifloe. io.r # Y«4^a/3£» th« doth Jon* 1^3£.
