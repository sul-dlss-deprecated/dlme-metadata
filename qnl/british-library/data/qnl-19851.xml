Dnfidential 19/^/22. N ./c. I The Hon'bla the Political Resident in the Persian gulf Buahire• Memorandum As you are aware there ia always present in Bahrain a large floating popul&amp;tion of Persians,Najdis t .Yamani3,Somalia,Iraqis, Arabs of the Trucial coast etc. For a few months of the year most of these are engaged in the pearl trade,bat for the remainder of the year they thong the oo:tee shops and houses of ill repute and a great many live by their wits.As a result petty crime.assaults,thefts etc are very common.Such offenders when sentenced become a burden to H.M^s Government. It is not worth while sending prisoners under short sentences to India both on the score of expense and inconvenience, ^nd at the same time their retention here is a source of expense and embarrassment,no proper prison existing. On the other hand the scs±±ix r ' * •ttidude 01 thio Court towards crime is Keenly watched and each case is the subject of Bazaar gossip.Any undue leniency is -t once I reflaoted in an increase of crime.

Should such procedure be approved,presumably it could be introduced by a'Kings Regulation? It would be necessary to provide for a severe penalty for fc 'ailure to comply with an order to leave Bahrain in lieu of imprison- lient t or for returning before expiry of sentence. 5 -F'. Bare the prooedare outlined in this Of: ice adopted, it would afford a useful control over Persian criminals,who after for crime more than one conviction or ngaigvKH^MHyawyka ^itiiar^ jqc persistently keeping a disorderly house,could be refused a passport to return. Major Political Agent.Bahrain.£~l } P.h, Heferanoe P .A .Bahrein 1 s letter below iIo .54/c of 19th iiaroh 1022 in which he asks for Kind's Regulation under the Bahrein Order in Council sanctioning banishment in lieu of imprisonment in cases of convictions. There is no doubt that such a punishment v/ould be very useful, but it would have to be very carefully used and would ( Uve rise to a lot of comment. Th^re would also be the diffi- • culty ?f 1t w is used often of gett ln T the ma,n av/ay and also of preventing them coming back. The iJorth West Frontier Crimes He f rulations have '^ot rul ^s b^i which persons may be expelled from any place ; district or the II.W.F.Province, but this is only under certain circumstances such as blood fieud ^tc and is not in lieu of imprisonment, while section 21 of the Bahrein Order in Council ^ives the 1 Political Anient necessary cowers to e::nort undesirables under certain circum stances, I therefore do not think that such a King/s ivefrula- tion would be likely to be sanctioned, and I would T )roT )ose writing to ^ a .Bahrein and sayinr that in the present circumstances you consider that such a 'in^s Repilation as he nroposes would in your opinion be very onen to abuse and also would not have much chance of boin^ sanctioned by Government and Liaerefore you do not feel inclined to take it i up. j G.F.W.A. 20/4/22. ■ J ices! ^ l/l ^^ i'^u 1 /y \ r ' i t v hsyCi. ^7 7^uiUi'iu&amp;niAL y No. of 19P j 2 • 4 of 19^8 British KeaiAency b Consulate-General Buahlre, 9th May 1922• To The Political Agent, Bahrein# Introducing a King's Regulation under Bahrein Order in Council sanctioning baniohnent in liou of irapriaorment in iialirein. artference your memorandum Ilo.54/c, dated 19th March 1922, I an directed to state that, as the naxinun 'ounishraent under a King's regulation is only 3 months imprisonment or a fine of Rs.1500/- (oection 71 (2) &amp; (*)), an&lt; ^ this is presumably a less severe punishment than banishment, so a -Cing's Kegulation could not sanction it. There is no doubt, that such a pui liment as you propose, would be very useful, but it would also lay itself onen to abuse especially in the case of nev.ly appointed Political Agent who had not had considerable experience. Further under Section 21 or the Bahrein Order in Council you have got powers to banish undesirable 5ox!A characters in certain circumstances. For these reasons the Political Hesident does not consider that such a regulation would be altogether suitable at ^resent, # and he is therefore not willing to take it up, especially as there is very little likelihood that the Government of India wcull sanction it.

It is suggested that the Bahrain State should simultaneously issue similar legislation anc^ they have not yet been shown to' His Excellency Shai/ii IIamad / the representative committee framed them was summoned with his approval, anu were unanimous as . to. their value, and his acceptance may taken for granted.

Tae ..indu Community were not represented on tixis committee, but I circulated the draft to them and invited them to make sug gestions. Their representatives called at the Agency and after certain of the provisions /ere explained to them expresses their approval of the draft. 4. The fear of the effect that Sr cult^rua pearl may have on the Bahrain trade if all dealing in it is not heavily penalised is widely felt, and prominence has been given to it by a case in which the brother-in-law of Shaikh i.Iuhammad bin Isa is accused.

This will only be prohibited when none for sale in Baixrain. .,o penalty has been mentioned in the draft as I am unaware what the highest penalty that can be attached to a Kings Regula tion is.

There is no objection to the sale of bleached drilled pearls m Bahrain,as buyers are on their guard and assume them pearl to have been bleached. It is impossible to bleach an undrilied/ satisfactorily since the chemical cannot penetrate to the centre, v/hereas if it is drilled^both inside and outside are simultaneous ly treated. I notice that the sending of pearls to the banks for sale has not been penalised as suggested. It is regarded in Bahrain as a dishonest practice.

(ii) No penalty is apparently provided for the sale of 'bleached undrilled pearls. I regret I am unable to make any further comment as my office have mislaid your original letter, but I venture to point out that I first raised this question on November 4^1929 hoping that it would be settled before the commencement of the diving season and wish to add that, since the matter is urgent, I would prefer an incomplete King's Regulation now to a more perfect one in three months time. 3.

Will you kindly confirm that this forni is the certificate referred to in this Section. 3. Further, by Section 40 of the said Act, the local Government (the Political Resident, no doubt) is to supply the Marriage Registrar with a marriage notice book. This has apparently not been done. A suitable book can be made up from the 'Notice of Marriage' form, S (Agency) 139, of which I enclose a sample. I could make up a book from these and use it for the purpose if there is no objection. 4.

MEMORANDUM A r^ease reier to your memorandum No:534 dated the 11th March 1931. The grounds on which it is desirable that the IiiO.idui 1i^xa^ ^ecrets Act should he made applicable to Bahrain are that the Indian Penal Code^ which is at present the only 0trier Act under which action can be taken N 'conveys no authority to deal with offences in regard to official secrets^ana since this Agency has had an unfortunate record for treachery in the past it seems desirable to guard against the future by arming the Political Agent with the special powers contained in this Act.

Since this act exists specially for this purpose it would appear as desirable in Bahrain as in British India and I request that the Hon T ble the Political Resident will be pleased to reconsider his decision. 2. With regard to the argument that since the Political Agent would be Prosecutor he should not therefore be Judge also, I would state that this contingency has been for seen and that the Secretary, as Additional Sessions Judge would be competent to dispose of the case and obviate the difficulty.

Reference your memorandum No.559/15/22 dated May 9th, 1931. I am directed to inform you that the Ilon'ble the Political Resident sees no reason to modify the views expressed in this office memorandum No.320 dated the 22nd April 1931 to your address. He does not consider it necessary to pass a special act to deal with possible delinquencies in one small office consist ing of some 4 or 5 Clerks, especially in a place where the work, speaking generally, is not of a very highly confidential nature. Vith reference to paragraph 2 of your letter I am to state that, as the post of Judicial Assistant to the Political Resident came to an end with the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council from which it derived its sanction, the Sec etary to the Hon'ale the political Resident has ceased to exercise the powers of an Additional Sessions Judge.

The remark conveyed in the first para of the Memorandum under reference is noted ; but with regard to the second I would request that early action be taken to insert a provision in the Bahrain Order in Council to enable the Secretary to the Kon'ble the Political Resident to act as Additional Sessions Judge at Bahrain. 2. Apart from the possibility of the Political Agent being personally involved in a case and being unable to hear it,there is a probability that the increasing pre occupations of the post2 now caused by the operations of oil drilling will render it impossible for him to take a particular case or cases. 3. It would facilitate matters if the proposed amendment could be drawn up at Bushire and if the Hon T ble the Political Resident concurs I would be glad if this could be done.

Sir, In view of the fact that the Bahrain Petroleum Company have commenced operations^ I have the honour to request that the Hon T hle the Political Resident will he pleased to extend the Indian Workmen's Compensation Act to Bahrain and that the necessary King's Regulation may he issued as early as possible. 2. A considerable number of British and British protected subjects will be employed and without this Act it will not be possible to compel the Company to pay compensation to the men or their dependants in the event of an accident occurring; since they will undoubtedly turn to this Agency for assistance it is desirable that some legal provision should exist.

I quite agree that the extension of complicated acts to Bahrain is to he avoided hut the situation is more complicated than it appears. 2. If an employee has a proper agreement executed before the Protector of Emigrants he is sufficiently coYered ? hut ? unfortunately the Company have engaged many Indians,'both locally and from T Iraq,without the execution of any agreement at all. These men are in no way protected and I -a* ^lliwimi'hihiW i m 'Trmif have no means of enforcing claims against them. Further certain Indians have already managed to secure visas for Bahrain with the intention of looking for work in the Bahrain Oil Company,and since the Protector of Emigrants only functions when Indians proceed on engagement with firms and not when they travel on their own account,the number of unprotected employees will increaseo in fact i do not know of their having engaged any men in the ortho dox manner employed 'by the A.. .0.0. 3. Then there are the Protected subjects. The Bahrain Petroleum Company have engaged many already and will employ still more and there is no reason why their protection should he left to the whim of the Company. To give an instance ,a Somali employed hy . essrs Callenaers was killed in putting up the Pier light,and though I have been able to trace his widow the Company refuse to pay any compensation. 4. Since Bahrain subjects will also ks require to be protected, I suggest the Bahrain Government tissue some /V 0f 0^5 &amp;&gt; some simple rules for compensation in the case of accidents and that we should apply them to the .a.gencj Courts by a Regulation under the Order in Gouncil. It will be necessary to word it so that T heavy industry T alone is affected as public feeling is not ripe for any general compensation scheme,fatal accidents from motor cars &amp;c.,being somewhat irregularly but satisfactorily disposed of by means of blood money.

P Bahrain,the 5th February 1933. / }ky Before the promulgation of the Bahrain Orcrr-in- Council,there was an understanding that the Political Agent did not execute anyone without previously asking the -Political Resident whether there was any political objection. The Court proceaure has now been placed on a regular footing by the Order-in-Gouncil,but the position of the Political Agents Court is rather different from that oi a Court in India. In Bahrain we are charged by the Shaikh with jurisdiction over foreigners,and it seems to me that in addition to our duty to the Court of Justice and to the individual under trial,we have also to consider our responsibility towards the Ruler,who has placed his foreign jurisdiction in our hands,and so wield it that it does not involve him in unpleasantness with his neighbours or give rise to difficulties as to our own position. 2. It is alleged that a few days back a Najdi murdered a Bahrain subject in the course of a quarrel over a few annas. The case is still in the hands of the Lower Court for the preliminary enquiry,but tne circumstances were such that there seems little doubt that I shall have to con sider in the Session^ Court whether a capital sentance should be inflicted. 3. The Adviser tells me that he does not think that there is any liklihood of trouble being caused by such a sentence,so far as the Shaikh is concerned,but I should be grateful if you would inform me whether there is any politic al objection to the iniliction of capital punishment on ajgtk IQBBMHHHHBH 3 Hon T ble Lieut Colonel T.C.W.Fowle,C.B.E., Political nesiaent in the Persian ^ulf, at Bahrain. 2.

To V U 1^.(3 1.^ The Political Agent, B A II x\ A X li. )u'bjecti Labour employea by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. /_ f-i 0 ' In 1931, Hajor Prior suggested the application of the Indian ivorkmen's Compensation ^ct (VIII of 1923; to Bahrain, 'but I deprecated the application of this oomplicated Act anu eventually an undertaking vas obtained fx^om the Chief Local Bepresentative, The Balirain letrcleum Company, that pending a permanent agreement the Company would dispose of claims for accident compensation on the lines of the Indian workmen's Compensation Act of 1925, ana that in the event of disagreement the Political Agent, Bahrain, would act as arbitrator. In this connection see correspondence ending with ilajor Prior's letter No. 943 dated the 2nd August 1931.—^ ^ q ^ 2. The position regards coiiipensation for injury hy accident is, therefore, satiwifactory. There remains hov.evor, the general question of the engagement, terms and conditions of service of Indian 1 ahour^mployed 'by PMMl MMM I ' « - »»■■■»MM - the Company and to what extent these^comply with the ons of the Indian Emigration Act (VII of 1922). ^ • • '.&gt; TheThe Labour Koster of the Company dated the 1st Ootoher 1935 shows 23 sklllecl and 12 semi- skilled Indian employees, all of whom, if recruited in India, - - 1 i ii appear to Ise affected 'by the provisions of the Act ( vide Section 2 and Chapters IV and VI thereof), and with the erection of the refinery, the number is likely to increase► 3. The Boster does nob show any unskilled Indian labour, and it is unlikely that the Company will require to import unskilled Indian Labour, It may he noted, however, that under Section 10 (l) of the Indian I5migrj tion Act, the emigration of unskilled Indian labour to Bahrain would he unlawful until the Govern ment of India publish a notification rendering it lawful# 4. It is not known how the Company recruit their Indian skilled employees. Do they do it through an agent in India? If so, and If he does not comply with the provisions of the Indian Smigration Act he would, of course, he liable to be proceeded against by the Local Government in India. If the Company engage them locally, i.e # in Bahrain, the provisions of the Act would not apply. 5. In the case of Indian and British protected skilled labour recruited locally it is desirable that a proper form of contract should be entered into, setting forth clearly the rights and liabiiities of both parties, including the point of compensation uealt with in the correspondence with i^ajor Prior referred to in paragraph 1 above. This will minimise the possibili- ty of suits being brought in the Agency Courts for breach-s- m 'breach of contract, and if they are 'brought the Court has definite laaterial on v:hlch to come to a decision. 6. I enclose, for your information, a copy of the forms of agreement used for Indian clerks and artisans 'by the Anglo-' rani an Oi! reoruitecl 'by the Anglo-' ranian Oil Company. Is this, in ypw opinion, suila'ble for Bahrain? There is no neod for an ar^itraticn clause as anji employee could file suit for 'bre-c*' of contract in the Agency Courts. Moreover, the only suitable arbitrator would 'be either the Politioyl Agent, or the Assistant Political Agent, and if either party refused to accept the arbitral award the case would then hr.ve to 'be tried 'before one of these officers in their judicial capacity, which would be un desirable. It is likely that any form of contract fixed for Bahrain will have to be submitted for the approval of the Government of India. 7. It is possible that, in order to avoid conforming to requirements in the Ccse of Indian 1 Dour, the Company mi^ht instead reoriiit only foreign labour, such as Persians, Ironis, etcetera. This would contravene Article XVII of the fining Lease, and any tendency in that direction should be checlcect. It could be pointed out to the Company that such foreign labour would be equally entitled as Indian, to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for breroa of contract, and it is desirable for them also to have proper contracts. 8. It is assumed that the American and British employees of the Company are engaged on proper forms of contract. We need not, therefore, take up their case-4- \lC oase 'beyond noting that they h^ve the right to sue the Company in the Agency Courts for breach of contract. 9. The intereats of Bahraini labour employed 'by the Oonipany are not our concern (beyond acting aa a channel of cornipunication and giving our good orrioGs to the 3tr&gt;te) and must be looked after by the Bahrain Government 10. Proper contracts for the unskilled labour employed by the Company would not be practicable and are not necessary. As far as compensation for injuries is con cerned they are covered by the agreement referred to in paragraph 1 above. The only class of unskilled labour regarding which difficulty might arise are Indians recruited in India and, as pointed out in paragraph 3 above, emigration of such labour to Bahrain is unlikely and is at present unlawful. 11. To sum up: (a) Indian skilled labour recruited in Inaia: This yimi fh i f iVmVri liii class, if the provisions of the Indian ^migration Act are complied with,, will i^so facto be in possession of a contract on which thoy can sue in the Agency Courts. lb) Indian and British protected skillea labour recruited in Bahrain: This class should also m mm*** be provided with a suitable contract, vide paragraph 4 above, on which they can sue in the Agency Courts. ic) American and British employees are presumed to have proper contracts. With regard to other foreignI ^7 5 foroign sKillea labour, suoh as Iraqis ana Persians; As this olass also h&amp;s the right to sue the Company m the Agency Courts, they should also 'be, and presumably are, in possession of contracts. (d) Bahrain subjects: It is for the Bahrain Sovern- rnant to safeguard the interests of this class and we are no.t concerned beyond affording our good offices. (e) Contracts are unnecesrary in the case of un- skilled labour. (f) The agreement with the Company regarding com- pensation for injury referred to in paragraph 1 above covers all classes of labour, skilled and unskilled. Please let me have your views. Sd.

Ghowdhury, we are anxious to clear up several points regarding local law and legal procedure, and to make a thorough study oi' this case in order to avoid a repetition. Jould it be possible lor us to have information on the following points:- 1. Are we correct in stating that the Indian .iorkmen's Compensation ^ct has not been actually applied to Bahrain but is merely used as a guide between your office and ourselves in reaching solutions of problems which arise ? 2. We understand there is nothing in existing in Bahrain in the nature of a Workmen* s Compensation Act. Is this correct? 3. We understand that, according to the Bahrain Order in Council 1913, the political Agent would decide a dispute as between tv/o parties in accordance with the ^ode of Civil Procedure and other Indian enactments relating to the Administration of Civil Justice, the Political Agent taking the status of a District Judge of tne presidency of Bombay. .»e assume this would be true if both parties were British subjects. For instance, the Company on the one hand and the Indian (in the case of Qhowdhury) on the other hand. 4. Is there an appeal from the political Agent's court to that of the political Resident? 5. Is it within the power ol either party 19 direct that the suit^ will be determined in accordance with the Code of Civil procedure (in India) and other enactments made applicable to Bahrain, that is, so far as local conditions permit, ana subject always to local customs or usage. 6. .iould it be possible for us to secure copies of all laws which ap ;ly to Bahrein, especially those as eet out in the Order in Bahrain Council 1913? We shall appreciate your furnishing us with the above information as soon as possible.13° Ko ; 2236-28/2 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 18th December 1935. To The Chief Local 'Representative, The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, Bahrain. Dear Sir, ^ \ With reference to your letter No.pA.295 dated the 1st November 1935 in which you made certain enquiries about local law and legal procedure, I beg to inform you that the answers to questions 1 and 2 and 4 in your letter are in the affirmative and to question 5 in the negative. 2. I think that in reply to your question 3 (and in amplification of the reply in paragraph 1 above), it might simplify matters for your Company if I were to explain briefly the juridical position in Bahrain. 3. The procedure to be followed ift and the law to be applied in any legal proceedings. Civil or Criminal is laid down in the Bahrain Order-in-Council, 1913 with its attendant King 1 s 'Regulations. 4. Briefly:- (a) if both parties are foreigners the case^is tried in the Political Agent's Court, (b) if both parties are Bahrain subjects, the case is tried in the Bahrain Courts, (c) if the plaintiff is a foreigner and the accused a Bahrain subject, che case is tried in the Joint Court (the Shaikh and the political Agent, or one of the Shaikh's relations and tne Indian Assistant sitting together), and(d) if the plaintiff is a Bahrain subiect and the accused is a foreigner, tlie case is tried (by arrangement with che Shaikh) in the Political Agent T s Court (instead of the Joint Court). D. Tne law applied in the Political Agent T s Court is that provided for in tne Baiuain Order-in-Council (which applies certain Indian Acts to Bahrain) and its attendant King's Regulations# Provision is made lor the application of the customary law of Bahrain, where it does not conflict with the provisions of the Craer-in-Council. The law applied in the Joint Court is Bahrain customaiy law, 'but the Political Agent is naturally bound by the principles of British justice. 6. In reply to the en^uiiy regarding an individual case in your paragraph 3, if Doth parties to a criminal case or civil suit are British subjects, the matter is tried (or heard) by the Political Agent's Court (or his subordinate Courts, that is to say, the Court of the assistant Political Agent, who exercises the powers of a Pirst Glass Magistrate and Subordinate Judge of the Pirst Class, or of the Indian Assistant, who exercises the powers of a Second ^lass Magistrate and Suoordinat Judge) according to the nature of the case or suit. 7. The publications referred to in question 6 of your letter can be obtained from most laige booksellers for example, Messrs Thacker and Company Limited, Bombay, or the Government of India, Central publication Branch, Civil Lines, Delhi. 8.

No.C/133 of 1936. Olfice of the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Shiraz. Dated the 25th August, 1936. Prom - The Hon ! ble Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. To - The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Simla. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that, as an outcome of the . trouble in which certain employees of the Bahrain Petrol eum Company Limited v/re involved (reported in Colonel Fowled Memorandum Ho.1139/86/11 dated the 1st June 1936), the question how best to maintain discipline among the British and American employees in the Oil Camp has been under consideration in consultation with the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. 2. At Ordinary times the Company rely on certain of their employees to maintain discipline in virtue of their seniority and standing in the Company, but such men have no legal status and in the event of a distrubance they may be unable to control it and may even, if they use force, find themselves in serious trouble, should, for example, a case of assault be brought against them in the Courts. 3. It would not be suitable to employ the Bahrain Police, for maintaining order on the Company's premises (save as a last resort in serious trouble) and it is, in any case, most undesirable that a racial element should be introduced into the already delicate problem of keeping order among a very mixed lot of British and American (and now a few German as well) subjects. It would be expensive, and inexpedient on political/8./ -2- political and other grounds^ to raise a regular force of* iJuropean police. There is, however, no doubt that some pernianent arrangement for maintaining order is necessary, and the need is increased and rendered urgent by the fact that in the autumn there is to be a further influx of temporary British and American labour in connection with the extension of the Hef inery. 4. The squad of bpecial Police Officers appointed by the Political Agent from among the employees of the Company during trie a is turbance mentioned above admirably served the purpose for which they were appointed and I am satisfied that in the enrolment of a small permanent squad of Special Police Officers lies the solution to the problem, particularly asthe principle has gained the strong support of public opinion. ■ ihe 1&gt;0l itical Agent ha4, at the time of the disturbance to act at a moment's notice, but it afterwards seemed doubtful whether he actually had powers to appoint Special Police Officers (The (Indian) General P 0 lice Act (V of 1861 has not been applied to Bahrain and it would be unsuitable to do so) and I, therefore, recommend the issue of the enclosed draft King's Regulations under Article 70 (a) of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1915, empowering the political Agent, Bahrain, to appoint Special Police Officers. This proposal was - approved in principle by Colonel Powle before his departure. 6. I would add that in practice the persons to be appoint ed will ordinarily be chosen, and changed from time to time as may prove convenient, in consultation betv/een the Politcal Agent, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and the Chief Local Representative of the B a hrain Petroleum Company Limited. ^' As the influx of large numbers of temporary labour is expected to begin in September, I beg that 1 be given sanction to publish the proposed King's Regulation, if approved, by telegram.-3- 8.
