Sir, I have the honour to refer to my printed letter No. C/66, dated the 21st January, 1941, and to enclose copies of two notes of mine on recent interviews that I have had with the Regent. effective control of Ibri and has installed Mohammad bin Salim al Eaqeshi as his Governor. Zahar bin Ghausn has composed his differ ences with the local tribes at Saleef (wrongly called Sibele in my printed letter under reference) and seems to be content to remain there for the time being. The fort of Ainane is still in the hands £*t of its owner, Sheikh Ali bin Said, the Sultan having failed to obtain possession of it by diplomacy and the Imam having made not attempt to do so by force. The Beni Kalban are still refusing to come to terms with the Imam. The Imam himself is at Bahlah where he was reported to have gathered together a large force but it is now said that he has disbanded his army on Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar’s guaranteeing the quiescence of the Ghafiri tribes. will probably not be able to return to Muscat for at least a month owing to transport difficulties. I am keeping him fully informed of the situation by telegram and he has so far not given any indi cation of his re-action to the Imam's partial success. He was expecting to meet me in Karachi at the beginning of this month but 2 . The present situation in the Dahirah is that the Imam has 3. The Sultan is in Bombay and, even should he desire to, / unfortunatelyunfortunately I have not been able to get there yet and it will not now be possible for me to discuss the situation with him before the middle of the month. The Sultan may v^ait until he has had an opportunity of talking things over or he may initiate a counter move by telegram. It will probably be the former course that he will decide upon. 4. The Regent who is taking matters very calmly has a very low opinion of the Omani. He says, with considerable truth, that he will do anything for money and that the pendulum will swing right over should the Sultan show any inclination to make monetary presents. The Regent never believed the stories about the Imam’s great army as he said the tribesmen would only come for what they could get and would disperse as soon as they discovered that there was little prospect of financial gain. He considers that the Imam’s Governor of Ibri will find himself in difficulties in the near future as the tribes in the neighbourhood are a care free lot and if the Governor attempts to enforce the Shara Law, as appears to be his intention, they will soon become restive and the Imam will have to choose between maintaining his position by bribery or force or withdrawing within his original limits and allowing the people of Ibri to continue their, from the Mutawa’s point of view, reprehen sible ways. 5. In order to increase the Imam’s difficulties until the Sultan's intentions are known the Regent has, like many other leaden in times of crises, decided to hold army mavoeuvres. During the course of next few days a substantial part of the Muscat Force will move to the small village of Adhaba which is fifteen miles from here and is the starting point from the coast for the Wadi Samaii. The Wadi Samaii is very important strategically to the Imam and he cannot view with equanimity the possibility of the Sultan making a thrust in that direction while he is himself involved with the Dahirah tribes so that this training camp may have the effect of / inducing himinducing him to abandon Ibri and return to Nizwa particularly as Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi has so far shown no enthusiasm for his manoeuvres in the Dahirah. The Imam* s position is not a happy one and he now seems to have decided to rest content with the occupation of Ibri. So far he has made no move in the direction of the Beni Kalban country and it is possible that he is hoping for the arrival of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi as a mediator. It will be interesting to see what, if any, re-action in Oman is caused by the troops move to Adhaba. I will inform you of the Sultan’s intentions by cable after seeing him in Bombay unless he decides on earlier action when I will communicate with you immediately. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd./ T. Hickinbothara. Maj or, Political Agent &amp; Consul, Muscat.(M from ^ not^ cn an interview with Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Minister for internal Affairs, at 10 a*m. on February let, 1941,at his office* M i* Saiyid Shahab considered that there was little doubt that Ibri and Saleef were in the hands of the Imam* He considered that the wali Mudhaffar's information was not absolutely accurate and suspected the 4&amp;11 Mudhaffar of wishing to quarrel with the 1mm* He said that he had received information similar to that which I obtained from Shuin bin mar and that he had further been recently informed that the Imara had coixected an army of at least eight to ten thousand men at Bahlah* He said that in his opinion this last item of information was a gross exaggeration as he cojld not for the life of him understand where the Imam could raise such a force and pay it, when it was known that Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi had so far not taken any part in the )ahira.h trouble. Evan if Ainane was occupied by the Imam, Saiyid Shahab did not consider that it was possible for the followers of the Khalili to hold the area they had at present acquired for more than a month to six weeks* He felt sure that the Imam's Force woula melt away as the prospects of pay and loot dwindled. For hi© part he was not prepared to give one pie or one round of ammunition unless the Imam made a definite move into the Beni Kalban territory when it would be necessary, firstly, to endeavour by persuasion to settle the trouble between the Beni ralban and the Imam and, secondly, should persuasion fail to take steps to prevent the Imam from obtaining or as the case imy be retaining a foothold in the Beni J£alban territary.'*fifteen miles from here ii extract from a note on an interview with aiyid Shahab bm Faisal, Minieter for External Affaira/'Ma^at, on February oth, 1941, at 10 a.m. at the Consul Saiyid Shahab said that he had receive the v.ali of Sohar which had been addressed to Handan bin Saliym by Zahar bin Ghausn and A1 Pe.qeshi to the effect that the Imam has control of Ibri and that A1 FeKes i has been appointed &gt;oLi on behalf of the Imam. Furthei*, that the situation is cal;a and that in future the law of the Shara will govern Ibri* Saiyid Shahab has also heard that the Beni _ are Kalban still recalcitrant and are prepared to resist by force any attempt on the part of the Imam to enter their country. It is rumoured that the Imam has disbanded hie force at Bahlah on an undertaking having been given by Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar to be responsible for the conduct of the Ghafiri tribes* Saiyid Shahab has suggested to the Adviser that it would be a good thing to hold a training camp at idhaba, and it is probable that certain of the Bait- al-F&amp;laj troops will move out for further training within a week. Saiyid Shahab 1 s idea is that the purpose for which the troops are going to Adhaba should not be announced and that the Imam should thereby find himself in some doubt about the exact reason for this move.

The Imam is said to have appealed to Saqr bin Bultan of the Haim at jsaraimi for assistance but his appeal has not been answered. it is rumoured that the chafiri tribes who have so upset the imam f s plans have been encouraged by Bheikh Suleiman- 2 - -A. • ^ 1729 19 V. toin Eamiyar himself who is of the Crhafiri section.

It is probable that if he fails to obtain assistance the imam will appeal to an influential leader such as Sheilch Suleiman bin Sinan of iankul or possibly even Sheikh Suleiman bin Hamiyar himself to use his good offices to bring about a settlement. it is thought unlikely that the imam will obtain any substantial assistance.

That the Sultan*s efforts have been successful is borne out by the fact that in the winter of 1938-39 geologist© of Petroleum Concessions were able to travel in safety from Khaburah through Ibri - Yanqul - Jebel Hafit to Baratmi, and that many / influentialinfluential Sheikha have recently paid visits to Juscat. Ibrl am it© neighbourhood is particularly affected by the event© to be narrated in this report* Ibri is described at page 767 of the secorci volume of Loriaer and there is little to add except to say that it still maintains it© evil reputation as the ^Thieves iarket** ( cr'^y * l?^ ) * The present f hsikh is Abdullah bin Hashid Yakubl, a blind naan who is credibly reported as being at the head of a thousand rifles. To the east of Ibri is the town of Dari* which is under the control of Sheikh &amp;li bin Said of the Beni Ghafir. Both these towns are marked on the maps published by the Survey of India but unfortunately the position of the large fort of hinane is not. The fort which is garrisoned by All bin Said's Beni Ghafir is the key to the Wadi al Hawasinah and the Northern Dahirah. built It is said to be a atone^bullding of considerable strength situated in an open plain between Ibri and Daris f rather nearer to the latter town. 3. decent i;veott. Bom little time ago certain mn from the Beni Kalban tribe who inhabit the Miskin - l«aqaniyat area murdered adherents of the X&amp;am 9 ^loha^maad bin Abdullah al Khalili, near the town of Rastaq. The IflMWl then called upon the Beni Kalban to hand over the murderer© which they refused to do. He then threatened to enter their country and undertake operations against them whereupon representat ive© from the tribe arrived in %scat and sought the Sultan's aid. They regard the Sultan as their overlord. The Sultan answered them evasively and promised nothing definite contenting himself with telling them to come to him again If it appeared that the Imam really intended to carry out his threat saying that he would then consider the matter. The Beni Kalban Sheikhs returned to their tribal area. Sixteen days ago the Imam sent forty men under hi© representative Zahar bin Ghausn Hanai to Ibri. It is not clear if these people were invited to the town by Abdullah bln Rashid or if they were sent on the Initiative of the Imam. It is probable that / they werenr.5 . i?KT th«y were apt invited. Suffice it ie to say that ^Mullah bin Haahid was sufficiently iapreaaed by the message carried by zahar bin Ghausn to hand over control of the area to him. The loan's men have been installed in a strong point and he ie in virtual control of the town and very considerable 'Bait al Val M (crown lands) on which he will be able to raise by no means inconsiderable funds. The latest news indicates that £ahar bin Ghauan has left Ibri and returned to Hlswa leaving a token force of only ten men in th ? town. The reason for this move is doubtful but it would seem that either he has been recalled or more probably that he has gone to make a personal report to the Imam on his mission and will return with a larger force* Am moon as the control of Ibri passed to the Imam the Beni Kalban Sheikhs and the Hawaainah Sheikh, Saif bin Sultan, came to Muscat and interviewed the Sultan. The Beni Kalban were not given a definite promise but were told to discuss the situation with the tali» ..iucihaffar bin Suleiman* of Sohar who happened to be in Muscat in connection with affairs i t Dhibah. The Sultan after consultation with vfudhaffar bin Suleiman sent Sheikh Saif bin Sultan al Hawasinah to Ainane to negotiate with All bin Said for the surrender of the fort. He has been Instructed to promise Sheikh 411 bin Said that the Sultan will not interfere with his 1 crown lands' at Daris and will overlook their disagreement of last year and win be 'kind' to him. The extent of the 'kindness' is an unknown quality and will not be a subject of negotiation as Saif bin Sultan has been told that the fort must be surrendered at once and All bin Said must trust to the Sultan's sense of fairness. tf the fort is surrendered then the Hawasinah will hold it with a hundred men. The Wall, Mydhaffar bin Suleiman* has now returned to iohur to sound the uahirah Sheikhs and to organise them in prepared- n^cs for the next move. He has been supplied by the Sultan with a certain amount of money and ammunition to assist him in improving relations with some of the more distant tribes. He has been / ordered tooa^darsd 'to i*ot.urn Sq&amp;c&amp;X Ini'aeciia't-dXy ■ &gt;ri t,h® 3th of this aonth to :mka a report on the situation to Salyid Bhahab bin Faisal, who is acting as Kagsnt in the Sultan’s ab^encs, and has been further instructed to seek an interview with me in order to inforra 3S of the latest events* 4* b-ultan, 1 , s Intent j.Q&amp;s • It is the Sultan’s intention to evict the Imam from Ibri mid at least to restore the status quo of three weeks ago. to do this it is essential for him to obtain possession of the key to the position - the fort of Ainane. Should he be successful in obtaining the surrender to his men of &amp;inane he will at once strengthen the garrison with a detach ment of regular troops with automatic weapons who will be moved from Bait- al-Falaj by way of the Batinah road to Khabur&amp;h and th^n across country to Ghaiz&amp;in where camel or other pack transport #111 have to be made available for their onward journey through the Wadi al Hawaelnab• I understand from tlie Sultan that he has no fear of interruption to his line of communication ttirough the Beni Kalb an and Hawaeinah country* fhould the Sultan fail to obtain &amp;inune by diplomacy it will most probably fall into the hands of the Imam, whose move further north the Sultan will try to prevent by stirring up the tribes In the Dhank - Yaaqul - FalaiJ Beni Qitab area to oppose him (the Sultan) and to harass his left flank while h%icompletes his preparations for the as?ssuit on &gt;\inane. 6. lorn’s Intentlom* It is very difficult to say with any degree of certainty what the Imam has as his ultimate goal. It would seem that he has moved against Ibri (successfully) as the first move in an operation to acquire control of the western end of the wadi Hawaainah which is essential if he really intends to take action against the Beni Kalbin. At the same time he seems to be undertaking a very large venture to deal with what is really a tribal matter of no particular importance and one which would normally bo settled by tribal custom* / X believe hisI believe his intentions to be other than just the punishment of a few tribal murderers* It ie possible that he is making an attempt j to extend his political influence to whole of the Oahirah up to the Baraimi Oasis which will put him in practical control of the interesting oil country and will open the Batinah to tribal raids* ' s* the Sultan cannot afford to ignore the Imam*s incursion into teri itory under his political control* It is a direct blow at his prestige and if the movement is continued will place the Sultan in a very awkward position having regard to his agreement with Petroleum Concessions limited* In addition the Imam will be a constant threat to the Batinah with its rich date gardens and coastal towns with their email but important British Indian trading communities* It is therefore essential for him to take action to restore the position* He well realises that the allegiance of the Dahirah tribes with one or two exceptions such as the a! Bu G ham is bedouin and 9 the hlawi at Yanqul will go to the party which can prot^ee the strongest and most effective force* If Ainane falls into the Imam’s hands the Sultan's task will be difficult* If 4inane falls into the Sultan’s hands the Imam's position at Ibri will be untenable and he will have to choose between vacating Ibrl and treating the matter as purely a tribal dispute to be settled by tribal custom 9 or raising his followers and undertaking a major operation against the Sultan* Should the Imam adopt the former course the Sultan will probably occupy Ibri and hand over the administration to his representative at Ainane who will probably be tudhaffar bin Suleiman or lahmood bin tfohwmad bin Turki f tali of Birkah* It is probable that the Imam will adopt the former course as the latter might easily result in his being forced by flanking movements to vacate Mizwa and retire to his property in the kadi Samail where he would become virtually a prisoner as the Sultan already holds the eastern entrance while the western entrance is under the control of Sheikh Hamad bin Hamad ar R&amp;waihi, the Sultan's Wall of Musannah* / SMclaslaB6 7. Cosci&amp;iigiu I have been fully infomed of the the Sultan and have at his request discussed the situation with the military Adviser, The Sultan is leaving for India today hut will return should his presence be rendered necessary by develop ments* In the meantime the conduct of affairs is in the hands of ^udhaff&amp;r bin Suleiman at Sohar, who has the Sultan*s confidence, and Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, the Regent, who has not however been informed by His Highness of hi© intentions. * It is known that the Imam is consulting Sheikh Isa bin Saleh al Harthi and Sheikh Suleiman bin Hsmiyar of Jebel Akhdar and hie further action will depend on the result of this conference Sheikh Isa bin Saleh will not be favourably disposed to warlike operations and his considerable influence will be on the side of peace* Should the Imam obtain the support necessary for his operation it will be sometime before there are any major develop ments in the situation. It will take time to collect tribesmen and in the event of All bin Said not surrendering control of Alrmne to the Sultan it will be at least a month to six weeks before the Imam is in a position to undertake an operation against Ali bin Said who will certainly resist to the best of his ability. The Hawasinah Sheikh will not reach a inane until about the 17th of this month and I have no doubt much time will be wasted in confer ence* , I will keep you fully informed of the position.

It is suggested that a more likely motivation for this action was to take control of the area in which Petroleum Concessions Ltd had been most interested.The Political Resident in the Gulf suggests that it would be a set-back for British interests if the Sultan were to lose ground in this area, and after a number of letters providing updates of the situation the correspondence ends with a letter from Major Hickinbotham informing that Saiyid Shahab bin Faisal, Regent and Minister for External Affairs, Muscat, had been contacted by Ali bin Said of Ainane, offering surrender of the strategically-important fort at Ainane to the Sultan on terms, in consequence of pressure from the Imam. The Regent proposed to discuss terms, an action which gained Major Hickinbotham's approval.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
