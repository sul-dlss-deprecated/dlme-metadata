MEMORANDUM on the SUCCESSION to the THRONE of PERSIA. On the death of Abbas Mirza, on October the 22nd, 1833,* the question of the succession to the throne of Persia, was very fully discussed between the English and Russian Governments. On January the 28th, 1834, Mr. Bligh,t then Ambassador at St. Petersburg, wrote to Lord Palmerston, that Fath Ali Shah had requested the Emperor of Russia to sanction the nomination of his grandson, Muham mad Mirza, as heir apparent. Mr. Bligh represented Count Nesselrode as very anxious that the British Government should be in accord with the Russian on the subject of the succession. Lord Palmerston,}: in a conversation with Prince Lieven, on the 16th of July in the same year, speaks of ' concurring with the Russian Govern ment in thinking that Muhammad Mirza would, on the whole, be the most eligible choice.' The whole tenor of the correspondence as to the succession of Muhammad Shah shows, that, at that epoch, the choice of an heir was considered § to be at the discretion of the Shah, though certainly Muhammad, as the son of the recognized heir apparent, Abbas Mirza, had the best natural claim to a similar recognition. Mr. Bligh|| writes to Lord Palmerston, on August the 22nd, 1835, that, in consequence of the ravages of the cholera, the new Shah had named his son, ' an infant but four years old,' as his successor. M. Rodofinikin assured Mr. Bligh that the leaning of his Imperial master was ' in favour of the direct male heir, in spite of the disadvantages attendant upon his tender years.' * Sir J.

Sir John, in the above-mentioned despatch, reports the conversation he had held with Count Medem, in which, in reply to the count's state ment, that he had been instructed to concur with the British minister in recommending the order of succession most likely to insure the tranquil lity of Persia, he acknowledges the advantages to Persia of the Russian and British Governments being in accord on the question of the succession, as 'the united influences of the two Governments would tend greatly to promote a peaceable elevation of the prince, whom thev should a&lt;rree to ' recognize as heir to the throne.'

Sir John then stated his opinion that the Shah's eldest son being a minor, Bahman Mirza the only surviving full brother of the Shah, ought to be regarded as the next heir; and that besides the superior claim he derived from the circumstance, be was probably better fitted, by his character and habits, to govern the country efficiently and well, whether as regent or as sovereign, than any other of Abbas Mirza's sons; that in so numerous a family as that of the late Shah, or even that of the present Shah's father, the late Prince Royal, it was desirable to circumscribe, as much as possible the riofht of succession ; that the late Shah, and even his predecessor, Agha Muhammad, had laid it down as a principle in the selection of the heir to the throne, that he should be descended from Kajars by his vxther as well as by his father ; that in accordance with this principle Abbas Mirza had been chosen heir, in preference to his elder brothers, and had been married to a lady of the same tribe, with the avowed view, that her son, if she bore one, should succeed to the throne. ' This lady bore three sons, ot whom ' the present Shah (Muhammad Shah) is the oldest, and Bahman Mirza, 'the second. Her third son, Kahraman Mirza, died lately at Tabriz. On the death of Abbas Mirza, the present Shah, her eldest son, had been ' named heir, in succession to his father, and in the event of the Shah s ' dying without leaving a son, it appeared to me there could be no doubt ' that the only surviving son of Abbas Mirza by the Shah's mother must 'be regarded as having a superior claim to Abbas Mirzas sons by any ' of his other wives.' Sir John added that it fortunately happened that Bahman Mirza was a prince whom there could be no inducement to set aside, and that it it should become necessary to appoint a regent, he was the fittest person for the office; or if the Shah should leave no son to succeed him, then Bahman Mirza was the next heir, both as nearest of kin to the Shah, and according to the principle on which the last two sovereigns of Persia had regulated the succession. That in case the Shah's eldest son should die, and that the next should be a very young child, even then, the hereditary order of succession should be preserved, and Bahman Mirza be appointed regent, notwithstanding the danger of usurpation, which would be a less evil than disturbing the order of succession. Sir John lays great stress on the necessity of there being ' no sanctioned deviation from the established 'principle of hereditary succession.' Count Medem entirely agreed, ^ that the Shah's eldest surviving son should succeed; and that, if too t( young to govern, Bahman Mirza should be appointed regent; and that4 -if the Shah should leave no son, then Rnh-nan Mirza shonld be con- ' sidered heir to the throne, and his eldest son after him. In conclusion Sir Join, McNeill refers to his despatch (No 43) of 1837, to Lord Palmerston, and to Lord Palmerstons (No. 37) of tic - &gt; September, 1837, in reply. Sir John, in his despatch (No. 43), bad pro posed three courses. The first course was that proposed by Count ozzo di Borgo, viz.: that the two Governments should enter into an arrange ment to prevents disputed succession, and by thdr united influence and erertiom place the heir apparent on the throne. This course Sir J. McNeill rejected, as opening a door for the introduction ot Russian troops into Persia. The second course proposed was that of perfect neutrality, and to this Sir John appeared to lean in his despatch, but sup posed it would be unsatisfactory to Russia, and that that State would find in the civil war that might ensue a pretext for armed interference. The third course proposed was a middle one, of not deciding at that time, but to leave it at the discretion of the envoy to adopt such measures as circumstances might render advisable. Lord Palmerston, in his reply,* approves of the third course, and adds that ' whatever inconveniences might arise from a minority, those ' inconveniences would be less than the evils which would spring from a ' departure from the line of hereditary succession.' There is,' says his Lordship, 'no more fertile source of disorder and calamity to a country ' than the icant of a settled principle to regulate the succession to the ' throne.' In a despatch of the 14:th of January, 1846, from Count Woronzow to Prince Dolgorouky, it is stated that as soon as Muhammad Shah expires, the Russian and English envoys are to wait upon Nasiru-'d-din Shah, to recognize him as Shah. It is further stated that as Nasiru-'d-din had attained the age of fifteen, 'I'age de la majorite que le Coran fixe, ' une r^gence pourrait difficilement lui etre impost?. Mais les deux representans I'engageraient, vu son jeune age, a appeler aupres de lui ' Behman Mirza, par un acte de sa propre volonte, et a lui confier ' temporairement les fonctions de regent.' In Lord Bloomfield's despatch (No. 233) of 1850,f to Lord Palmerston, he states that M. Seniavine thought that 'any arrangement ' which it might be hereafter expedient to make, should originate with the Persian Government, and not with the representatives of England and '* Russia' Nasiru-'d-din, the present Shah, succeeded to the throne on the 4th of September, 1848, the day of his father's death.j: On the 13th of June, * Persian Correspondence, vol. 47, No. 37, of 1837, September the 27th. t Kussian Correspondence, vol. 378. t See Persian Correspondence, vol. 13S, No. 78, of 1848.1849,* Col. Farrant reported the birth of a son to the Shah, w hich event took place on the 8th; the mother is called by Col. Farrant the head wifef of His Majesty,—a princess of the royal family; this son, who was named Prince Sultan Mahmud, was proclaimed heir apparent on the 5th of October, 1849.+ Col. Farrant states that the suddenness of the announcement greatly surprised him, and that he was for the moment at a loss to understand the reason of such precipitancy ; but learned that it was owing to a remark made by the Russian minister, who appears to have been displeased that the birth of the child had never been notified to his Government. Prince Dolgorouky declined to attend the ceremony of nominating the heir apparent, as he said that he could not acknow ledge the young prince officially until he had received instructions from St. Petersburg. On the 17th of December, Lord Palmerston acknowledged the above despatch, and approved of Col. Farrant's attending the nomination festival^ of the Shah's 'eldest son.'' || The prince thus nominated to be heir apparent, remained so till August, 1857. On the 19th of that month.Mr. Murray reported to Lord Clarendon that the Shah had announced in the Tehran Gazette of the week previous his intention of solemnly proclaiming the heir apparent to the the throne. The proclamation was to take place on the Shah's birthday, during the last week of the ensuing September, and ' the ' step was taken without waiting to see whether Her Majesty's Govern- ' ment and that of Russia gave their sanction and approval to the setting ' aside the young prince, who was considered by them, and actually was ' from his parentage on the mother s side, the most eligible candidate for ' the succession.' Mr. Murray remarks, that for the last three genera tions the Governments of England and Russia ' have always been invited ' to accept and recognize the heir apparent before he was proclaimed.' In the present instance,' adds Mr. Murray, ' the adhesion of these two * See Persian Correspondence, vol. 145, No. 45, from Colonel Farrant to Lord Fahnerston. t But according to Sir J. Shell's letter, No. 18, of February the 21st, 1852, the Shah had no son by any of his full wives, till the 8th of that month, more than two years after Colonel Farrant's Report. J Persian Correspondence, vol. 146. Colonel Farrant, No. 76 of 1849. § Ibid., vol 143, No. 35 of 1849. 1| Lord Palmerston has been misled by the correspondence into supposing that this was the eldest son. Colonel Farrant's letter, No. 45 of 1849, vol. 145, announcing the birth of this son, merely states that he was the offspring of the Shah's head wife ; and it appears from Sir Justin Shell's letter, No. 100, of 1852, vol. 171, that the Shahs eldest son was the offspring of an inferior wife, while the second son, said thereto be an infant a few months old, was born to a princess of the Shah's own house. The birth of this infant was reported by Sir J. Sheil on February the 21st, 1852, vol. 169, No. 18. It is expressly said there that his Majesty, having no other son by any of his full wives, this prince, who has been named Sultan Muin-'d-din, was consequently heir apparent. In Sir J, Shell's letter. No. 112, of 27th August, vol. 171, the nomination of this prince as heir apparent is mentioned, and his mother is said there to be aKajar princess. This letter was approved by Lord Palmer ston on the 5th November, 1852, vol. 168, No. 63. Persian Correspondence, vol. 218, No. 79. BBBiwra 6 .. Governments was more than ever uecessary. as the Shah has thought - fit to set aside the issue of a legit,mate wife of the royal t,ihe,m f.n.uu ' of the issue of a lady of humble birth, whom, though she has long been « an inmate of the royal harem. His Majesty never .named t,ll a lew •' weeks ago,' Mr, Murray goes on to attribute this change in the Shah's intentions regarding the succession to an intrigue of the Sadr Azim, who undertook to bring about the marriage * of the Shah's favourite lady with His Majesty amTthe recognition of her son as heir apparent, provided she would withdraw her countenance from the commander-in-chief. I he change, according to Mr. Murray, occasioned great dissatisfaction throughout the kingdom, and especially amongst the whole Kajar tribe, \\lio considered that their privilege, heretofore respected, had been violated. Mr. Murray feared, therefore, in case of the Shalls death, a civil war might ensue. On the other hand, he acknowledged, that the British and Russian Governments were certainly disposed to admit the rigid of the Shah to select whichever of his sons he considered the best fitted for the succession. This despatch from Mr. Murray caused the ' succession ' question to be re-opened, and references having been made to Sir Justice Sheil, the regulating principle was even more closely discussed than it was in 1842, by Sir J. McNeill. The reference to Sir J. Sheil was made on the 11th of September, and on the 14thf that gentleman replied. He first adverted to the discrepancy between the despatches of Lord Wodehouse, No. 880, and of Mr. Murray, No. 79, of 1857; the heir nominated by e Shah beniQ said in the former despatch to be the Shah's eldest son, and by Mr. Murray to be the second son. With reference to what had been said by Mr. Murray, as to the mother of the heir apparent not having been married to the Shah till within a few weeks of the recogni tion of her son as successor to the throne, Sir J. Sheil observes, tbat'she was previously married by what is called Sighah, and on this second occasion by the ' Akdi,' a higher order of marriage; that, offspring by the Sighah marriage is, according to the Persian or Shiah sect, as legitimate as offspring by the Akdi marriage, the only difference between the marriages being, that there may be any number of Sighah wives, but onlv four Akdi wives. Sir J Shell objects to the principle advocated by the Russian minister of allowing the Shah perfect liberty of choice' as to his snc- cessoi, because it would open the door to intrigues, and perhaps to t * W, ' di ' S t0 '' e ' ak ™' f ' r,n of -arriage.the object being a tranquil succession, which would be risked by any disturbance of the right of primogeniture. In the case referred to him, Sir Justin is of opinion that if the heir be the eldest son, there should be no hesitation in recognizing him; if the second son,* the Shah should be recommended to adhere to the rule which was followed with reference to himself and to his father, in both of which instances the mothers were Kajars. In conclusion, Sir Justin observes that the essential point is the establishment of a fixed rule; and that in case it should be thought that J o the principle of primogeniture ought not to be extended to the sons of Sighah wives, it should at least be recognized with reference to the offspring of an Akdi marriage. On the 15th of September, 1857, Lord Clarendon transmitted to Mr. Murrayf two despatches j: from Her Majesty's minister at St. Peters burg, reporting conversations he had held with Prince Gortchakoffas to the Persian succession. On October the 6th Lord Palmerston wrote with his own hand a memorandum on the draft to Lord Wodehouse on the Persian succession question, and with reference to the conversations held by Lord Wodehouse with Prince Gortchakoff. The memorandum is as follows:— ' The first point in all matters is clearly to establish the facts which ' are to be the foundation of a decision. In this case, all is confusion. ' Mr. Murray says that the son of the newly-married wife, is the Shah's ' eldest son. Lord Wodehouse reports Prince GortchakofF to have said ' that this child is the second son. The probability is, that Wodehouse ' may have mistaken Gortchakoff, or that GortchakofF may have made a ' mistake. Murray, writing on the spot, is most likely to be accurate on ' this point. ' By the despatch^ of March last, the English Government expressed ' an opinion in favour of the eldest son as successor to the throne, but it ' is to be presumed that what was meant was the eldest legitimate son. ' Then arises the question, whether the mother of this eldest son was a ' wife of the Shah when the son was born. If she was his wife in such a 4S manner as to render her children legitimate with a view to succession ' to the throne, why was she lately married to the Shah ? and does not ' that recent marriage prove that there was no anterior marriage valid by ' Persian law, as rendering the child capable of succeeding to the ' throne. This opinion does not seem reconcilable with the former part of Sir Justin's letter. After distinctly stating that he regards the principle of primogeniture as the most im portant, he seems here to place it on the same footing with that of Kajar parentage on both sides. t Persian Correspondence, vol. 216, No. 105.

It would be des.rable that ' he should explain his meaning. ' I conjecture that the state of the matter is that the Shah had, till ' lately, designated as his successor his second son, because that son was ' the first son born in lawful wedlock, and that this choice had been 'approved by England and Russia; that recently he has married the ' mother of his first -born son in order to render that son legitimate as ' his successor, and that this has been done with the support of the ' Sadr Azim, and against the opinions and feelings of the royal family, ' this newly-married wife not being of noble birth. There seem to be 'two questions, first whether the recent marriage legitimates retro- ' spectively the son born before the marriage; secondly, whether the ' want of proper descent on the part ot the mother disqualifies the son, « whether born in lawful wedlock or not' 'Sir Justin Sheil seems to be right in making the priority of birth ' the guiding test of conflicting claims, and especially as that principle has ' been acted upon in Persia on the two last occasions, although it is not ' the Muhammadan law of inheritance/' ' The draft proposed to be sent seems to be founded on right principle, ' though there does not appear to be any necessity for erecting Mr. ' Thomson into the dignity of arbiter in the matter. But it might be 'well to refer Lord Wodehouse more distinctly to the despatch* of ' March, to the opinions expressed in which the Government adhere. On the 1st of October Mr. Hammond, by Lord Palmerston's desire, wrote to Sir J. Sheil, inquiring whether in Persia a marriage has a retrospective effect in legitimatizing children before it. Sir J. Sheil replied on October the 2nd, stating that the case submitted could never occur, as there are no 'kept women' in Persia, the Sighah system removing the necessity. The offspring of both marriages are equally legitimate; but those of the Akdi marriage are more respectable, the Akdi wife being generally of equal rank with her husband. This answer from Sir J. Sheil did not satisfy- Lord Palmerston, who recorded a second memorandum, requiring three questions to be answered :— First. the Shah, before his recent marriage, declare a son by another marriage to be his heir? Secondly.—If he did, which was that son? and was he older or * No. 159.9 younger than the son by the lady whom he has recently married, the son, viz., whom he now wishes to declare his successor? Thirdly.— Assuming that the son whom he now wants to declare his heir is either older or younger than his other son or sons by Akdi wives, why was it necessary for him to make the mother of this son an Akdi wife by marrying her a second time, and in a more formal manner; and does not this lead to the conclusion ;hat as lono- as the mother was not an Akdi wife her son could o not succeed to the throne ? Then comes the question whether the marriage carries with it a retrospective effect, and gives to the son of this lady a capacity to succeed to the throne which does not attach to him in virtue of that kind of marriage under which he was born ? ' If the late marriage carries with it this retrospective effect as to ' the capacity of the son to succeed, and if that son is the eldest of all the ' Shah's sons, then I do not see any ground on which we could object to 'acknowledge the Shah's choice; but if the marriage does not carry with ' it such retrospective effect, or if this son is younger than some other son ' born of another w T ife married in the Akdi category, then, in either of ' these cases, it would seem that we might demur as to acknowledging ' this son heir and successor.' * On the 8th of October, 1857, Lord Clarendon transmitted to Mr. Murray a copy of his answerf to Lord Wodehouse's despatch. No. 385, of the 27th of August, noted above ; and on October the 20th Lord Clarendont transmitted to Mr. Murray a copy of a despatch received from Lord Wodehouse, No. 441, October the 7th. On the 28th of October, Lord Clarendon transmitted to Mr. Murray copy of a telegram sent by him on the 13th to Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, instructing his Excellency to inform Mr. Murray by the earliest opportunity that Her Majesty's Government recognized as heir to the Persian throne the son nominated by the Shah. On the 4th of November, 1857, Mr. Murray§ reported the proclamation of the heir apparent ; and on June the 30th, 1858, Mr Murray reported the death of the child who had been so proclaimed. Since that period, the only occasion on which the ' succession ' question has been mooted is in Mr. Doria's letter to Lord Stanley, of the 28th. of February, 1859, No. 18. Mr. Doria there states, that at an audience with the Shah, on the 19th, he called His Majesty's attention to the non-existence of a recognized heir. His Majesty replied, that he was aware of the necessity, and hoped soon to name one. Mr. Doria * There does not seem to have been any answer to tlie&amp;c questions. + Eussian Correspondence, No. 684, of October the 6th 1857. ^ Persian Correspondence, vol. 216, No. 138. § Vol. 220, No. 123. || No. 97 of 1858, vol. 232.

MEMORANDUM by SIR H. RAWLINSON on the SUCCESSION to the THRONE of PERSIA. The question of the Persian succession, always an embarrassing matter, comes up for consideration at present under circumstances of peculiar difficulty. Hitherto (that is since the subject first came under discussion by the European Governments on the death of Abbas Mirza in 1833) three points have been recognized as essential to a decision of the question: Istly. The principle of descent from father to son (instead of from brother to brother), and the right of primogeniture ; 2ndlv. That the mother of the prince, designated as Wali Ahd (or heir apparent) should be an Akdi (or legitimate) wife of the sovereign, and of the Kajar tribe, and 3rdly. The nomination of his successor by the reigning sovereign. In the last two cases of the Persian succession, these three conditions have been realized. Muhammad Shah was the eldest son of the Crown Prince, Abbas Mirza, by an Akdi wife of the very highest rank m the Kajar tribe, and was indicated as his successor by Path \li Shah, with the concurrence of the British and Russian Governments - ami the present sovereign, NasiruVI-din Shah, was also the eldest son ,.f Muhammad Shah, by an Akdi Kajar wife, and was nominated hen- apparent by his father during his lifetime, with the approval of the European Governments. v-r mnrs; f' - ££5 bines two of the requisites ■ but fl , qi _ a ' |a ' ' esctnt . and thus com- prince as heir apparent, because lie'liopes m ' 0n ' i ' ate lady, who is of ignoble birth hnt I 6 maIe lssue another whom he is much attached ' For ' ' 0 ^ ''' l '' 1 ' cl l )al wife . and to a ^ (or temporary) wife, and ^ ** tKlS ti,,le ' A Pril 2.3rd, Url b0ni ' ^ aPPearS fr0lU the eviclen ce of Dr. Dickson, on leave at11 regarded, owing to the inferior position of bis mother. Recently, however, the Shah, having contracted the Akdi ceremony with this lady, who was before only a Sighah wife, and having placed her at the head of his female establishment, demanded the recognition of his son as heir apparent; and after some demur, the European Governments signified their assent, admitting the double claim of primogeniture and nomination by the sovereign to overrule the single objection of ignoble birth. As the prince to whom this statement relates is now dead, the circumstances attending his nomination are only of value in so far as they furnish a precedent for our guidance in the settlement of the pending question. If the Shah should be pressed to declare a successor at the present moment, he could not do otherwise than nominate Muzaffaru'd- din Mirza; but the appointment would be made with an exceedingly bad grace, and in the event of a son being born to the favourite wife, every effort would be made to set the nomination aside. The Shah, indeed, would perhaps propose to make any arrangement, that might be now concluded, conditional on the birth of a brother to the late heir apparent; and in either point of view, it thus becomes necessary to consider what our course ought to be, if such a prince were born. In point of right, this princes position would be very defective; he would have primogeniture and descent against him, and the single title of the Shah s nomination in his favour; and if the three conditions were of equal weight, his claim to the succession ought thus to be rejected ; but the Shah may be expected to say that we have already waived our objec tion on account of the mean extraction of the prince's mother; and, moreover, there can be no doubt but that, practically, the will of the reigning sovereign carries more weight than all the other considerations combined. I doubt, therefore, whether we could effectually resist this deter mination of the Shah to do honour to the family of his favourite wife ; or whether it would be worth our while to incur the odium of a prolonged opposition. It would be a preferable course, perhaps, to concert with Russia that the Shah should be urged, as a precautionary measure of the utmost necessity, to name his provisional successor at once; whilst, at the same time. His Majesty received an assurance from the two European Governments that his nomination of an heir apparent should be subject to reconsideration in the event of another son being born to him of his favourite wife, the Farrukhu's-Sultanah. The real question at issue, however, and to which our attention should be principally directed, is not the nomination of an heir-apparent, but the selection of a regent; for if any casualty were to occur within the next few years, by which the throne of Persia was vacated, it would make but little difference in regard to the eventual settlement of the question, whether the Kajar prince, MuzafWd-din Mirza, now in histn tnkfi his seat on the throne as a puppet sovereign, or eighth year, were to take h.s sea royal whether the crown were to be suspenaen, !„ either case the wisiies, over the infant brow of his less noble bro he.. kinMv authority must be vicariously exerc.sed ; and as c regency* is hardly compatible with Eastern inst.tntmns, we should thu be forced to recognize some prince of the royal family as regent; and .t need hardly be added that, in a country like Persia, with a n . head of affairs it would be absurd to expect the nominal sovere.gn to survive bis nonage. In considering, therefore, the question of appointing a regent, we are, if the case should arise within the next six years, considering in reality the question of the succession. Whoever may he accepted as regent, will infallibly, in a short time, become Shah; and it behoves us, therefore, to consider this question well before we commit ourselves to any decision. Hitherto it has been judged that there was but one prince, Bahman Mirza, who from his birth, position, and qualifications, could possibly aspire to the post of regent; and we were thus compelled to acquiesce in the prospect of his elevation, although his Russian predilec tions were notorious, and it was evident that his accession to power nvou M involve a complete forfeiture of our influence ; but as time has passed on, another prince has now become eligible for the regency, of superior pretensions to Bahman Mirza, and as much a partisan ot England as his uncle is of Russia. I allude to Abbas Mirza, usually called the Naibu s- Sultanah, who was the favourite son of the late king, Muhammad Shah, and who, as a means of escape from the hostility of his brother, the present Shah, was sent by Col. Sheil in 1853, with a British passport, to Baghdad, where he has resided ever since, more or less connected with the English, and enjoying our quasi-protection. On general grounds, it would be a matter of some difficulty to decide betwocn the respective claims of Bahman Mirza the uncle, and Abbas Mirza the nephew. The former is of pure Kajar descent; he was own brother (by the same mother as well as father) to the late king, Muhammad Shah ; he proved his capacity for administration in the government of the important pro- Mnce of Azarbuijan ; he is rich, has the whole of the royal family and the m hole of the influence of the Kajar tribe on his side, and has, besides, a considerable party both at Tehran and at Tabriz. Abbas Mirza, on the other hand, cannot pretend to any special qualification. He is young (twenty-one years of age), poor (being dependent for his support on a pension allowed by the Shah), and inexperienced ; but he has the over powering claim of nearer consanguinity, being brother to the present Shah, while Bahman Mirza is only uncle-; and there can be no doubt, moreover, but that in Persia generally he is the popular candidate,— a distinction which he owes partly to his name,t partly to the predictions See Colonel Shell's despatch, No. 112, of 1852. time!f Fallfln Siri, 1 ' 188 '' 1 ''''' 1 ''' AbbMlIirza ' tlie „ prince of Persia in the13 current all over the country that he will eventually succeed to the throne, partly to the trouble he has taken to ingratiate himself with the Sheeah priesthood during his residence in the holy cities ; and partly to the sup posed disqualification of his Persian descent as opposed to Kajar extrac tion ; for his mother was a Kurdish lady of noble family, and the people of Central and Southern Persia would thus gladly rally round him in preference to a Turk or Kajar prince. The Shah is equally suspicious of his uncle and his brother; or Bahman Mirza, who has resided for the last twelve years under Russian protection at Teflis, and of Abbas Mirza, who resides in close relationship with the English at Baghdad. There would thus be no advantage, and there miffht be disadvantage in holding communication with the Shah o O o on the subject of the regency; and it is not to be expected that negotia tions even with Russia on the same subject could lead to any definite issue, unless we blindly followed her policy and accepted her minion as regent. It would be well then, I think, m this matter, to keep our counsel strictly to ourselves. We might agree with Russia on the nomi nation of the heir apparent, but reserve our line of action with regard to a regency, if the occasion for such an arrangement should arise, merely recommending a complete system of non-intervention; and if further explanations were insisted on, engaging to afford no support, either moral or physical, to Abbas Mirza, provided Russia would observe the same strict neutrality with regard to Bahman Mirza. I should have no doubt but that if the yoice of the nation were allowed freely to declare itself, Abbas Mirza would be at the head of the poll; but, at the same time, I have every reason to fear that, in spite of any engajrement to the contrarv, Russia would endeavour, if she were j n o •' * able, to control that free expression of feeling, and to force her minion on the Persian people, and the only advantage, therefore, I could propose to derive from our own reticence in the matter would be to obtain a iaii field for the rival claims in the event of Russia being unable to move, and to secure us moreover a complete liberty of action to support Abbas Mirza, if we found it at the time conducive to our interests, or if Russia, contrary to her promise, interfered in favour of her own protege. H. C. R. P.S. Since the foregoing memorandum was written, intelligence has been received from Persia, of events which introduce a further element of confusion into this already sufficiently complicated question. The Shah, pressed by the European missions to declare a successor before starting on his journey to Sultanieh, and apprehensive, that if he satisfied public expectation by naming the proper heir, Muzaffaru'd-din Mirza, he might find it difficult at a later period to supersede him, has cow selected another prince, of less inconvenient pretensions. This prince, Kamran Mirza by name, is the son of a Sighah wife of the Shah's, of very D14 humble family, and popularly known as ' tl.e Bricklayer's .laughter f lie has no friends or supporters, and would thus offer no impediment i t le Shah desired, at some future day, to name another heir apparent in his place. Although, indeed, the present appointment has not been declnred to he provisional, it is well understood that the Shah still looks to the probability of another son being born to him of his favourite wife Farrukhu- 's-Sultanah, and that if such an event were to take place, Kamran Mirza would be at once degraded, and his infant brother would bo nominated in his place. To such an arrangement neither the British nor the Kussian Government would probably object, as the claim of the infant to be appointed heir apparent would be stronger than that ot his deceased brother, whom the two Governments did actually acknowledge; inas much as he would be born of a recognized queen consort, whereas the lady at the period of the birth of her eldest son was merely in the position of a concubine. But the question which now comes up for consideration is whether the British Government shall embarrass itself by recognizing as heir apparent a prince who, at best, occupies a mere temporary position, and who has no right to even that equivocal distinction. If the Shah were to die whilst Kamran Mirza still enjoyed the nominal dignity of Wali Ahd, the latter prince would not have the slightest chance of succeeding to the throne, or even remaining as tlie acknowledged heir. The only means of saving the country from universal anarchy would be in the immediate nomination of a regent; and the previous recognition of Kamran Mirza by the British Government would thus be a source of embarrassment to us, and perhaps of danger to the country. Moreover, it may be inferred from the notoriety of the views which the Shah entertains on the subject of the succession, that His Majesty would not be displeased at our remaining quiescent in the matter of Kamran Mirza; that in fact he would prefer our reserving our decision pending the birth of another son to the Farrukhu's-Sultanah. If His Majesty could have been persuaded to nominate Muzaffaru'd-din Mirza, then our recognition of the prince might have been of some value in confirming his position, and preventing bloodshed in the event of the Shah's death. As the case stands, we can only, I think, trust to fortune in bringing about the speedy birth of another son to the Farrukhu's-Sultanah, and in preserving the Shah's life during the interim. At any rate, if there is any doubtful point requiring to be solved at present, it is simply this, whether we might not bv friendly consultation with the Russian Government, arrant for the 'ioint Muzaff' th H e r ''!

' ^ bei '? bo ' 1 to»1 15 t V ' \ f) NOT L on the APPOINTMENT of a REGENT in case of the Demise of the SHAH of PERSIA, and his successor being a Minor. I t appears from the conversation between Sir J. McNeill and Count Medem adverted to at pp. 4 and 9 of the Memorandum on the Succession to the throne of Persia, that in February, 1842, the Russian and British Governments were in accord as to appointing Bahman Mirza regent, in case an infant should succeed to the throne. In Count Woronzow's despatch to Prince Dolgorouky of the 14th of January, 1846, it is ex pressly said that, in case of Nasiru-'d-din's succeeding Muhammad Shah, the representatives of the two Governments were to confer on Bahman Mirza temporarily the functions of regent, though there might be difficulty in imposing such a restraint on Nasiru-'d-din, as he had readied the age of fifteen, ' I'age de la majorite que le Kuran Hxe.' On the 15th of August, 1852,* Colonel Sheil reported to Lord Malmesbury that a desperate attempt had been made on the life of Nasiru- 'd-din Shah by some assassins of the Babi sect. In his letter No. 100, of the next day's date. Colonel Sheil stated the mode in which he should have acted had the attempt been successful; he says, ' T, therefore, think it prudent to state the mode in which I proposed to act, in order that my opinions may undergo correction, in the event of a future contingency, should they be at variance with the sentiments of Her Majesty's Govern ment/' After stating that he intended to use every effort, ' in conjunction with his Russian colleague,' to obtain the recognition of the Shah's second son as Shah, as being born of a regular wife, a Kajar princess, he adds,t ' The question then to be considered was, by whom the oflice of regent ' was to be filled during a long minority. During the reign of the late ' Shah, it was arranged between the English and Russian Governments that 'this function should devolve on Bahman Mirza. in the event of the earlv ' death of Muhammad Shah. It appeared to me that there was little ' choice, but to promote the same selection on the present occasion, in spite ' of the numerous disadvantages attending the regency of a pensioner of Russia. I need not say that Prince Dolgorouky was perfectly ready to ' adopt a similar course.' ' I do not conceal from myself that the effects of this step would be ' the total loss of English influence, and the transfer to Russia of a supre macy in the councils of 1 ersia, ror a time at least. It is only the fear of worse evils that would induce me to co-operate in producincj such a result.

' It does not appear certain that the quiet acquisition of the regency ' by Bahman Mirza, would be attended with the permanent extinction o ' English influence. The gratitude of a Persian is not lasting. Muhamma.; ' Shah* owed his throne to English gold, yet within a few months ho ' forgot his benefactors, and was quite ready to expel them from India, ' had he been able. ' Bahman Mirza has proved his capacity for government by Ins admi- ' nistration of the province of Azurbaijan. Avarice is his chief detect, ' but it is fortunately accompanied by the peculiarity of a dislike to the ' indulgence of the same vice by other people. ' I have tried to place the question clearly before your lordship. The ' evil of this prince holding the functions of regent, terminating probably ' in his becoming Shah, by the murder of his sovereign, is great and certain. ' The problem to solve is, whether evils of greater magnitude will not be ' avoided by acquiescence in his administration. From the tenor of the above remarks, it appears that when Col. Sheil wrote, in August, 1852, there was no positive formal agreement as to the appointment of a regent in case of the Shah's death ; that Col. Sheil saw great evils in the nomination of Bahman Mirza to that office; first in the Russian tendencies of Bahman, and secondly in his probable usurpation of the the throne after the murder of the young Shah, whom it would be his sacred duty and express business to protect; and that these evils were to be risked in order to avoid the worse evil of rebellion andf 'the confusion and disorder which would inevitably follow * This is hardly accurate. He was the eldest sou and heir of Abbas Mirza, the fourth son and heir of hath AU Shah, by Kajar descent. He was the rightful successor, tiie viceroy of a large province, and would probably have made his claim to the throne good, without English assistance. For his subsequent anti-English bias there was abundant reason, in the English opposition to his views upon Herat, views the injustice of which it is very difficult to establish. + See conclusion of Colonel Sheil's despatch above cited.17 ' from a divergence of opinion and conduct between the the English and ' Russian ministers at the court of the Shah.' Col. Sheil was of opinion that these troubles would break out in Persia, because there was no person, except Bahman Mirza, to whom the office of regency could be confided. He observes, however, that the next heir to the ' throne is the Shah's brother, the Naibu-'s-Sultanah, a boy thirteen years ' of age.' This boy is now a young man of twenty-one, has been for years protected by the British Government, owes everything, even life itself, to it, and being the uncle of the prince who would, as matters now stand, succeed to the throne, has naturally a greater claim than Bahman Mirza to be appointed regent. On the 27th of August, 1852,* Col. Sheil further reported to Lord Malmesbury a conversation he had had with the prime minister of Persia as to the succession, und adds, ' The embarrassing question of a ' regency has not been touched on. I take this opportunity of rnen- ' tioning to your Lordship that in this country a regency by commission, ' or through a council, would, in my judgment, not answer ; each member ' would devote himself exclusively to his own exaltation and the sup- ' planting of his colleagues.' On the 27th of October, 1852, Lord Malmesbury f replied to Colonel Shell's despatch No. 100, of the 16th of August, quoted above. After expressing the concurrence of Her Majesty's Government with the views expressed in that despatch as to the succession, Lord Malmesbury says: ' Her Majesty's Government also concur in your opinion that, in case the ' Shah should die during the minority of that prince, no more suitable ' person than Bahman Mirza could at the present time be selected ' as regent. Her Majesty's Government are not insensible to the ' possibility that Bahman Mirza, either out of gratitude for the asylum ' which he now enjoys in Russia, or for some other motive, may possibly ' use any ascendancy which he may possess in Persia for the furtherance 'of Russian objects in that country. But it is just as likely that his ' intercourse with the Russians may have tended rather to indispose J ' Bahman Mirza to them ; and that, if the British minister cordially ' concurs with his Russian colleagues in advocating that prince's claims, ' he will, in the long run, prove himself to be as well disposed to England * Vol. 171, No. 112 t The despatch was seen hy Lord Derby. In vol. 176 of the Persian Correspond ence is a memorandum in the handwriting of Mr. Hammond, on which the despatch was based. It is there expressly said that the Naibu-'s-Sultanah (Abbas Mirza) could not be regent, ' because he was only thirteen years old.' It is also said that Bahman Mirza 'might be supposed likely to be swayed by Russian feelings ; but just as likely that he will have seen enough of the Russians not to admire them.' To this remark is appended, ' I quite agree,' with Lord Stanley's initials. ^ This surmise is shown to be a mistake, by the conduct of Bahman Mirza during the war between England and Russia, when that prince exerted himself most zealously to promote Russian interests. E18 as any Persian ruler, whatever his previous history may have been, can ' be expected to be.' ' The capacity of Bahman Mirza for the administration of affairs ' seems to be admitted ; and, as the Russian Government would doubtless 'advocate his claims, an unhesitating admission ot them on the pait ot ' Her Majesty's Government, if the occasion should arise for their making ' it, would obviate, on this important question, all appearance of disagree- ' ment with Russia, which Her Majesty's Government quite agree with ' you in thinking might be productive of much inconvenience. This is all, in the Persian correspondence, as to the appoint ment of Bahman Mirzato the office of regent in case ot the Shah s death. Some kind of agreement appears to have been entered into on this head with the Russian Government by Her Majesty's minister at St. Petersburg, but there does not seem to be a positive and formal engage ment to bind Great Britain down to recognize Bahman Mirza as regent in preference to others, and especially to Abbas Mirza, the Naibu- s-Sul- tanah. The agreement above mentioned is noticed in a demi-official letter of Sir J. Shell's, dated January 30th, 1857.* It appears that a reference had been made to him from the Foreign Office as to the truth of an assertion by Prince Gortchakoff, that the Russian and British Governments had agreed that, 'in the event of the Shah dying without legitimate heirs, Bahman Mirza should succeed to the throne.' Sir J. Sheil states that ' there is no foundation whatever for this assertion,' that the question had never been considered, and that the only point which had been discussed was Bahman Mirza's nomination to the regency, if the necessity occurred. Colonel Sheil goes on to say : ' The Russians have been always ' assiduous in proclaiming the right of Bahman Mirza to the regency, which really implies the possession of the throne. He is their partisan • k and pensioner. His Royal Highness is the most suitable person for that 'office; but, in my opinion, he has not any legal claim to the ' Failing posterity to the Shah, the true heir is Abbas Mirza.' crown. &lt; m U ' (1 J 0,,ehou8e &gt; in llis •'espatch.f alludes to the readiness of Her .. r:t V. :r mi ' ent 10 j0in 1!l,SSia in the nomination of the Shah s legitimate son ' to the succession. ^ ' What is tlie meaning of the word 'legitimate?'

' In Persia there are two kinds of legal marriages : Akdi, implying ' the above four wives, and Sighah, of which the number is unlimited, the ' contract being for any time however short, according to agreement, but ' not exceeding ninety years. ' Unless under extraordinary circumstances, such as very high rank ' on the side of an Akdi wife, the offspring of both forms of marriage ' rank alike, or nearly so. ' Her Majesty's Government lias, therefore, to determine, whether ' the sous of both kinds of marriage are to be considered elisrible in the O o ' regular line of succession, or whether this is to be limited to the ' offspring of the Akdi marriage. ' I observe from Lord Wodehouse's despatch that the faculty ot choosing a successor is attributed to the Shah. This power opens the ' door to intrigue and contention of every kind. The handsomest and favourite wife * for the moment is sure to assert her privileges. 44 In my opinion, the simplest plan would be to insist on the Shah's ' invariably naming his eldest son as his successor. That eldest son should ' also, in my judgment, be nominated without consideration of the form of ' the marriage from which he springs: just as at this moment, it appears, ' the Shah is disposed to choose his successor from a son descended from ' a Sighah wife. It might, nevertheless, happen, that circumstances ' would arise to prevent such a rule from being undeviatingly carried out. ' In the mean while, however, if the present Shah were to die, ' according to my view of the matter, his eldest son, from whatever ' marriage sprung, should be recognized as king under the regency of ' Bahman Mirza,f who, however, would soon assume the crown ; but ' should the reigning Shah die without heirs. Abbas Mirza appears to be ' indisputably entitled to the succession to the throne. As I before said, ' his mother was one of the late Shah's regular wives (Akdi), and there ' is no doubt, if Muhammad Shah had survived a short time, he would ' have named this 'prince to he his successor. ' For English interests, it is better that, instead of a Russian par- ' tisan like Bahman Mirza, the throne should be filled by Abbas Mirza, * As shown at present in the case of the Farrukhu's-Sultanah. t Colonel Sheil gives no reason for this preference of Bahman Mirza over Abbas. Perhaps lie did not at the moment remember that Abbas bad reached an age when he might under take the regency to which his nearer propinquity to the infant Shah would give him an undoubted claim.20 ' whose life, a 8 well a 8 his mother's, or at ^ « throuffh my mediation, in conjunction with the cffo „ .

The expressions used by Lord Wodehouse as to this appointment of Bahman Mirza to the regency are strong, but hardly amounting to a formal engagement. The whole despatch is as follows:— LORD WODEHOUSE to the EARL CLARENDON, No. 27. S t. P etersburg, January lO^A, 1857. My Lord, In accordance with your Lordship's instructions, conveyed to me in your despatch No. 617, of the 30th ultimo, I have stated to Prince Gortchakoff that Her Majesty's Government are most anxious to act in agreement with the Russian Government in the matter of the succession to the Persian throne, which was now again in doubt in conse quence of the death of the heir apparent. I said that in the event of the remaining legitimate son of the Shah being nominated heir apparent. Her Majesty's Government would bo prepared to join with Russia in recognizing him ; and with respect to a regency, which would be necessary in case of the Shah dying before his son, now an infant, attained his majority, Her Majesty's Government did not think that a more suitable person than Bahman Mirza, could be appointed. Prince Gortchakoff said, that he entirely agreed with Her Majesty's Government as to the importance of there being an understanding between England and Russia on this subject, and he concurred with them in desiring that the regular line of succession should be preserved b} the nomination of the Shah's legitimate son as heir apparent; but it appeared from the reports which he had received from M. Anitchkoff, that the Shah was inclined to appoint a son who is the issue of a ' Sighah' marriage, the same who is mentioned in the postscript to Mr. Murray's despatch No. 112. His Excellency read to me M. AnitchkofTs despatch, which stated that this nomination would be unpopular in Persia, and is21 open to many objections. M. Anitchkoff adds, that the mother of the deceased heir apparent is now with child, and that the Shall has pro mised her that, if the child should prove a son, he will nominate him his successor; but that there is little probability of this promise beinor performed. His Excellency also read to me his answer to M. Anitchkoff, stating that the Russian Government were of opinion that, in order to preserve the regular line of succession, the legitimate son of the Shah ought to be named heir apparent; but that it would be advisable that M. Anitchkoft' should abstain at present from taking any direct steps to promote this nomination, for fear of provoking the jealousy of the Shah against his son. With respect to the regency, Prince Gortchakoff had no objection to make to Bahman Mirza, who is at present residing in the Russian Trans- Caucasian provinces. He said it was agreed, he believed, between Her Majesty's Government and the Russian Government, in the former dis cussions which took place on this subject, that in the event of the Shah dying without legitimate heirs, Bahman Mirza should succeed to the throne. I have not found, however, any trace of this in the correspondence between Lord Malmesbury and Sir Hamilton Seymour in 1852, on this subject; and I observed, therefore, in reply, that I was not aware that this eventuality had been formally taken into consideration. The despatch of Count Nesselrode to Baron Hrunnow, of November 24, 1852, com municated to Lord Malmesbury, refers only to the nomination of the Shah's son as his successor. The recognition of Bahman Mirza as successor, in the event of the Shah having no legitimate issue, would exclude Abbas Mirza, who, it appears by Colonel Sheil's despatch of August 16, 1852, stands next in the regular order of succession to the Shah's sons; and I do not know how far Her Majesty's Government may think it advisable to pledge themselves beforehand upon this point. I have, &amp;rc., (Signed) WODEHOUSE. The above despatch contains the latest declaration of the policy of Her Majesty's Government on the Persian succession and regency, and deserves to be carefully weighed, though evidently written under a mis apprehension of Russian views. Should it be considered to impose an obligation on the Government to act in accordance with it, Bahman Mirza will, in the judgment of those best acquainted with Persian pro ceedings in parallel cases, pass through the regency to the throne. In that case British interests must suffer, unless Bahman Mirza, after all his life showing himself a fiery partisan of the Russians, should suddenly F22 turn against them, just at the time when they might be most useful to him, in furthering his views upon Herat, and in othei aggiessm. aiul ambitious projects, which descend like an heirloom in the Shahs tamil}. It was surmised some years back that the very fact of Hahman s constant intercourse with the Russians was likely to make him unfa\ourabI^ disposed towards them, but there is only this slender surmise to oppose to facts of a quite contrary nature extending over many years. It remains to be considered, therefore, whether a quasi-agreement come to by Lord Wodehouse under a misapprehension, must outweigh con siderations which might induce a different policy. It must be remembered that the heir apparent of the time of Lord Wodehouse's despatch is dead ; that at present no new heir apparent has been declared, and it will, perhaps, appear reasonable, when the Shah announces his next choice, to open the whole question anew. This might be done, if on no other ground, most fairly and justly on that of Abbas Mirza's greater claim to be regent, now that he is of an age to undertake that important office. tinted by Cox * Wyman.-July ,3, 1859.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000039_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C1</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000039</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C1</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'ABSTRACT
