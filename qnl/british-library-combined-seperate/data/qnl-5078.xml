Each case has its own header page, but there is no index sheet for the cases at the front of the file. The cases are arranged in chronological order, from the earliest occuring case at the beginning of the file, to the latest at the rear. Within each case, correspondence and other papers are arranged in similar chronological order. Office notes relating to each case can be found after the case correspondence. Circled serial numbers in pencil and crayon refer to entries in the notes.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence begins on the front cover and finishes on the back cover, and uses circled numbers in the top right of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is comprised of twenty-six manumission application cases numbered 31 to 56, cases 13 to 30 being contained in the Bahrain Agency file 'File A/11 II Slave cases Trucial Coast' (IOR/R/15/2/1852). The file contains a total of eighty-nine individual manumission applications, made to the Residency Agent at Sharjah ('Abd al-Razzaq Razuqi) and submitted to the Political Agent in Bahrain, for authorisation from the Political Resident. All of the manumission statements are included in the file, in both in English and Arabic, along with correspondence from the Residency Agent to the Bahrain Agency, and the Bahrain Agency to the Political Residency. All of the cases were straightforward in that manumission was unconditionally granted by the Political Resident.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Slave emancipation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Slave trade</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024c#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00024c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
