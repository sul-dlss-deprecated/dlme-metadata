Transjordan , Mr. Forster stated that the sugar allocation in 1947 had been 3#000 tons and in addition Transjordan bad obtained another 300 - 300 tons. In the last four months 23#000 tons had been sold to Transjordan from the U.K. for sterling, as oral authority had been obtained fro® the Treasury to supply sugar to Transjordan for sterling. It was accepted that a large part of this sugar had in fact been smuggled to Syria or despatched there after being consigned to Transjordan in transit for Syria. It was agreed that a quota of 4,000 tons per annum might be considered reasonable for the requirements of Transjordan. It was decided that a telegram should be sent to the British Minister, Amman, proposing to fix a quota of 4,000 tons per annum and to deduct from this amount any supplies obtained from any other source. In the meanwhile the Ministry of Food would not fix up any more shipments to Transjordan. 3« Trucxal Coast . Mr. Forster stated that the shipments of U.K. sugar for sterling in the last four months had been:- Kuwait 23#000 tons Bahrain 2,700 tons Dubar 200 tons The greater part of the sugar sent to Kuwait must have sent on to other destinations and it was agreed that reasonable annual quotas might be as follows:* Kuwait 3#600 tons Bahrain 3,600 tons Dubar 600 tons Sir William Rook pointed out that if shipments of sugar from the U.K. were cut down, there was s danger that the merchants on the Persian Gulf would be encouraged to purchase additional supplies st much higher prices fro® Java and would thus raise the price of Javan sugar against us. But it was considered that to the extent that extra supplies were purchased with black-market dollars, there would be no expenditure of foreign exchange from the Sterling Area reserves and It was unlikely that the merchants could use the banking system for the payments to be made in sterling. It was decided to send a telegram to the President in the Persian Gulf to ask for hin views on the proposed quotas and for confirmation that quantities in excess of the quotas cannot be obtained from other sources by payment through official banking charnels.

Your note fairly represents the general line of our discussions, except for the quantities set out under para.3 which I corrected with you over the telephone yesterday. Our actual sales to the Trucial Coast to date are:- Koweit 23,000 tons Bahrein 2,700 ,f Dubai 200 u whilst the total quantity sold to Transjordan to date is 26,000 tons. as regards Iraq, the following are the details you ask for: - Total quota for 1946 : 32,400 tons, all supplied by Ministry of Food under I.K.F.C. allocation. Total quota for 1947; - 39,300 tons, of which 32,400 tons was supplied by the U.K. under I.K.F.C. allocation, and 6,900 tons from undesignated sources. M.O.F. total sales to date for 1948 : 7,800 tons. We think we should suggest to the Iraqi Government a total quota for 1948 of 40,00 tons to be supplied by the Ministry of Food, provided they undertake to restrict import licences to this quantity, and that in the event of sugar being imported from sources other than the Ministry of Food any such excess shall be deducted from our allocation. In view of the fact that Iran, Transjordan and other adjacent territories will import far more in 1948 than in 1947, we may later on have to increase the total figure of 40,000 tons but think as a temporary measure it would be better to try and secure agreement on the basis of 40,000 tons. We regard the suggested 1948 quotas for the Sheikhdoms, viz: Koweit 3,600 tons Bahrein 3,600 ' Dubai 600 “ as reasonable, and would like to work on these annual totals as soon as the Foreign Office and yourselves are satisfied that it would be a satisfactory arrangement. These quantities would be additional to business already done. We presume that Mrs. Luce will be responsible for arranging these quotas with the Political x&lt;esident, and also the quota for xraq. In the meantime, we have notified the refiners and the trade that for the time being ail further sales to these territories are to be suspended. Copies of a letter I sent out yesterday to this effect were sent to Mrs. Luce and yourself. Yours sincerely, C. Gill, Lsq. , (B. a.

Can you confirm ?/ tr E.601/48 External Secretary* I agree with your note. I should have thought that, through our Exchange Control, we could regulate or prohibit the use by the Sheikhdoms of sterling area dollars for the purchase of sugar. It may be, as the Political Resident says, they can take L action to prevent unrestricted imports of sugar from the sterling area, but the amounts available outside of the U.K. must be quite small. If there were an abundance of sugar in the sterling area India would not have to use dollars to replenish her stock (c.f. para 2 of Miss Loughnane’s letter of the 19th December, and para 3 of Forster’s letter of the 23rd December). I appreciate the advantages mentioned by the Ministry of Food in our supplying the sugar rather than allowing the Sheikhdoms to dollar countries, but that need not mean that we should sescto them without limit. Whatever we do they will still be able, if they want to, to buy sugar with black market dollars, which I believe they manage to acquire in fair quantity. I think there is a case for asking the Ministry of Food whether they have taken full account of the effect of Exchange Control. Until we are satisfied about this we aught not to reply to the Political Resident.Telegrams: Foodkeeper, London * Telephone: WELbeck 5500 7 &gt; Please quote Ministry reference ' in reply M.o.F. Ref.

February, 1948 Sugar for Persian Gulf Sheikdoms and Muscat I much regret the delay in replying to yourjletter of 23rd January, referring to the Political Resident^ telegram No. 1309, of 19th December* in which he suggested that the U.K. might fix export quotas for pefined sugar to these territories. This in itself would not stop or even seriously check the trade in imported sugar, as we should simply step out of the picture, and hand the business over to Cuba, U.S.A., Holland or Belgium. If we continue to do the trade as we are doing now our dollar outlay is restricted to the f.o.b. cost of the raw sugar, all the other outgoings, including inward and outward freight, refiners processing costs etc. being in sterling. On the other hand, if Cuba, which is the most likely competitor, does the business, the whole cost of the refined sugar c.i.f. Persian Gulf, would have to be paid in dollars, of which we take it the greater burden would eventually fall on us. Admittedly, 8. consideraole amount of smuggling is going on, as sales to Kuweit and other adjacent terri tories over the past few months are far in excess of local consumption, but if the local Governments are /notnot prepared to impose import quotas, it is difficult to see how the business can be effectively checked. There would appear to be no sense in putting our heads in the sand and calmly^-^ading over the trade to our competitors. There is a consider able amount of useful profit for this country, apart from the fact that we are gradually recapturing valuable export trade in an area where we had a good name before the war.

If India is prepared to supply sugar to Kuweit against sterling we should prefer that she should so so rather than we should supply Kuweit direct. In the latter case we should have to replace our stocks with dollar sugar; in the former, India would replace it, but the dollars would come out of India*s dollar target which would already have been agreed as an overall figure.

We have just read a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on this same subject. He has approached the Government of India to ascertain whether they will be able to supply the sugar requirements of the Persian Gulf States for next year, but he rather expects their reply will be negative, and he is anxious to know how the States will stand if India does refuse. Do you think the Ministry of Food could arrange their supplies? From the foreign exchange point of view this would be much better than leaving them to urn A. do their own buying, since A «e should have to find the foreign exchange, and that, I suppose, mean dollars.

I enclose a copy of a letter No. / 2A33 with enclosure. 2254^80/18 of the 28th October, 1947, from the Political. Resident in the Persian Gulf gnclooing a statement of the quotas of sugar allotted by the Government of India to the Gulf States and Muscat during the last four years. (Gwadur is a small enclave of Muscat territory on the Baluchistan coast line). You will see that the Political Resident has approached the Government of India for the continuance of existing arrangement a/arrangements for the supply of sugar to these territories, but tha.t he considers it unlikely that they will be willing to do this. We believe that both India and Pakistan ar e now sugar importing countries and that in consequence neither Dominion is likely to be able to assist her over next year’s supply for the Gulf. We therefore feel that it would be advisable to consider alternative arrangements now. We should be glad to know your views on this matter and in particular which of the alternatives mentioned in paragraph 3 of the Political Resident’ s letter enclosed would be preferred by the Ministry of Food. If arrangements are to be left to the Political Resident and local authorities it will be ♦ necessary to furnish them with information as to the best sources of supply and the proper authorities at those sources with whom they should correspond.PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY D.Q. No. 2254-80/18&gt; BAHRAIN. 28th October, 1947. . 0 jyx&gt;« - . I forward herewith a statement shov^ring the quotas of sugar allotted by the Government of India for the Gulf States during the last four years. I have asked the Government of India whether they are willing to supply sugar on the same basis during the next sugar year which begins on the 1st December 1947 and I rather expect the reply will be in the negative. I am forwarding you this statement now so that figures will be available in case I have to telegraph and ask for the future supply of sugar to be arranged by His Majesty's Government. 2. The quota for Muscat is inadequate and constant complaints have been made to this Residency regarding it. I think the Political Agent who originally stated Muscat's requirements probably under-estimated them. We have never been able to persuade the Government of India to increase the quota. 3. One of the main points for decision will be whether His Majesty's Government will themselves supply sugar to the Gulf States or whether they will provide foreign exchange to enable the States to make their ovm purchases.

Donaldson, Esquire, C.M.G., Commonwealth Relations Office, Whitehall, LONDON.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00031e_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/787</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x00031e</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/787</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Ext 329/43(1) ‘SUPPLY OF SUGAR TO PERSIAN GULF STATES’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1949</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-23T15:57:33</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (44 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.The subject Ext 329/43 (Supply of Food to the Persian Gulf) consists of three files: IOR/L/PS/12/786-788.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 46; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is concerned with replacing sugar previously obtained by the Persian Gulf States (Bahrain, Kuwait, Muscat, and the Trucial Coast) from India with sugar supplied from the United Kingdom; sugar production in India and Pakistan had fallen following the end of the Second World War (1939-1945).The main correspondents are: the Persian Gulf Political Resident (William Rupert Hay), officials of the Commonwealth Relations Office (Eion Pelly Donaldson, Francis Anthony Kitchener Harrison, and R I Hallows), officials of the Ministry of Food (B A Forester), and officials of the Treasury (H A G Gill).The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
