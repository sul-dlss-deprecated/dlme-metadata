Depictions of elephants became increasingly common in the Mughal period. Stylistically this example may be attributed to sometime in the late 10th century AH/AD 16th, although the Persian inscription on the page states that it was completed in Bukhara on the last day of Safar 731 AH/AD 1330. There are a few numbers inscribed on the page: 4500, 9, and 18. The work is framed by marbled paper and a border illuminated with animal and floral motifs. On the back is a sample of calligraphy in Nasta'liq script signed by Mirza Muhammad al-Katib and dated 983 AH/AD 1575-1576.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15299", "Keywords": "Indian; Islamic; Mughal; Illustration; Miniature; Painting; India", "Provenance": "Henry Walters, Baltimore [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": "Mughal Dynasty", "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-01-24T13:51:40.93", "Creator": "Mirza Muhammad al-Katib", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1503689", "ExhibIDs": "2871", "Images": "CPS_W.702.a_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
