Dear Weightman. When I was last in Bahrain and visited the Shaikh, he had a high seat placed between two sofas with the result that I found myself about a foot lower than him. Would you kindly see that on any occasion where I am likely to meet him 2 chairs of equal size are arranged as conversation on different planes is difficult. I may be mistaken, but I think the idea is borrowed from Ibn Saud, who has these little thrones put up in each room that he is likely to go in, so that no one can sit in his seat. Yours sincerely, Sd/- C.G. Prior.Dated the 2Gth Novemoer U^j p.O. Ho. Reference our telephone conversation tnis morning about the official arrival of the Political Resident* * 2. According to precedent the procedure would be briefly as follows{ On arrival of the Mearchus I go off to call on the Political Resident and remain there until His Highness comes. His Highness goes off 20 minutes after me end is met with due ceremony on board. In the absence of saluting guns aboard the Nearchus, we agreed that a salute might be fired by the shore battery as His Highness leaves the ship. The return call would occur a few minutes later. There would be a guard of honour for the Political Resident at the pier and the usual salute of IS guns would be fired. After inspecting tne guard the Political Resident would go to the Palace at Qudhaibia, being met there with proper ceremony. y.e ourselves r uil cress uniform anu I Si;Oui, e ri tefui if you would invite His Highness to wear his decorations. 5. As was mentioned on the telephone, would you be good enough to arrange that two similar chairs are placed in the Shaikh*s Majlis room at the Palace, as the Political Resident finus it most inconvenient to c^rry -h~ conversation set led about a foot lower than His Hlgnness. 4 . I will of course let you know the expected time of arrival directly I hear myself. Yours sincerely, Dalrympie Belgrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BahrainD.O. No. C/771 Efeted the S6th November 1333. J. Wiil^you please refer to your demi-official letter No. C/77'6 dated the Idth November 1933 ? 2. According to our Ceremonial Book full uniform end medals are *orn on an official arrival by the Political which I personally think rather ludicrous. Officially the winter has started I suppose so the uniform should, I think, be blue. 3. The normal drill is for the Political Agent to arrive first, with the Assistant Political Agent, and for the Shaikh to follow about 20 minutes later. As the Nearchus comes so close in to Manama the shore battery can quite easily fire a salute for His Highness when he leaves; and your return call could follow almost immediately, merely allowing time for the police to get ready to fire your salute. In the old days the return call used to be paid at the Customs Majlis, but as this no longer exists it will be paid at the Qudhabia 4. I am arranging (vide your demi-official letter No. C/774) that there are two chairs in the Shaikh’s Majlis room. I am assured that the reason for the present arrangement of the furniture is that His Highness finds it so difficult to get out of sofa and there is only one 'official' chair in the Palace here as the Shaikh has taken the others out to Sakhir. However I will see that one is brougnt back. 5. V.e shall of course be delighted if you will stay at the Agency. Would you mind a dinner A. 1 on the- first ni ,ht ? Yours sincerely.
