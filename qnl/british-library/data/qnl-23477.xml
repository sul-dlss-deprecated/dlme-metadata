We are adTiaed by the Director of Customs that it la hia intention to charge duty on thia mialanded cargo and we can 9M no reason for his request. As you are aware stetuaers cargo is disciiurged as expeditiously aa poaaible and by illiterate cooliea. Therefore errora are bound to occur in the outturn of the ateamer, parti cularly, if the oargo is under Mil Marie. We therefore, conaider itunjust to be asked to pay duty, not only on this account but from the point of rlew of precedent and practice at this and other ports mentioned abors^ in this particular instance the Director of customs states that duty is demanded because the cargo in question consists of a number of packages and not a single package. Against this we would mention that we hare hitherto cleared a number of packages #f the same commodity without payment of duty, noreorer^ we would point out tftat mlalanded goods are naturally not destined for this port. They do not eron appear on the ship's manifest but are excess of same and If duty is to be leTied on this mlslanded cargo, duty must also be paid on the cargo which was not landed and which Is sub sequently frstutned to Bahrein to sktihfy the shortage of mafilfest* In otiuir words duty would bo -twioe collocted for one transaction which tire ware sure you will agree is unreasonable. Aoreorer, con signees of cargo will decline to pay this duty aad may eten refuse to xproducO the tnTOices on which duty is to be assessed. consO^ quently duty Is liable to be assessed on a higher Customs raluation but in any oase will hawe to be borne by the Stesmshlp Company. As the Steamship Company are not the importers or shippers of goods, we do not think it reasonable for them to be asked to pay duty on mis- landed goods. Landing charges. Import Yard and Export charges are paid on these goods since same are incurred and we are of the opinion that an additional fine of say Rs.l/- per Shipping Bill^ would be reasonable as a charge against the steamer for the error made. It may so transpire that raluable cargo is mislanded and theduty payablt on such goods would be naturally out of all proportion to the freight earned* Ws shall be most obliged If you will take up this matter with the Bahrein Oorernment on behalf of the under mentioned Sttamship Companies and obtain a reasonable ruling on this point* We would onoe again mention that there is ne published copy of Custom* rule* aftd regulations at tnis port to which Agents of Steamship Companies^ itxporters and Importers of cargo can refer and that It Iw extremely troublesome for them to contend with regulations introduced from time to time without warning* We btg to requset that this natter be also placed before the aoTertiment with a rlew to it publishing Customs regulations at an eatljr date* xeurs faithfully, ihtMEiSOFOf AMlA j.anage:\ Copy tot' Ths British India Steam Kawigatlon Co.,Ltd., Bombay.

Would it be possible for you to enquire on our behalf from the Customs authorities in Busrah and Karachi and Bushire, or shall I write myself to these authorities and make enquiries? 3. I agree that shipping agents such as the Mesopotamia Persia Corporation should be given copies of the Bahrain Customs rules but the publi cation of these rules is a matter requiring con siderable labour and at the moment it is impossible to —to spare the time to edit and publish these regulations, but I hope in course of time that this will be done.

Perusal of the items to be sold will no doubt indicate to you that they are not ladies' clothing. They are, in fact, the effects of two dead Norwegian sailors, whose administrator is Captain I. Smith of The Bahrein Petroleum Coy Ltd. In general, it might be well to remind you that goods having lain in the Customs flncleared for six months become Government property, and automatically go up for auction. The goods to which your Mrs Murad lays claim are in this class; but I have not offered for public auction the female clothing, for reasons of delicacy. The ultimate disposal of same will have to decided later on. Yours V. sincerely. Ul . H-Letter No. 1/288 dated the 2kind April 1934 from The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd, Bahrain.
