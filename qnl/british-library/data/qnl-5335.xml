(£ &amp;\ g&gt; nn i Copy of memorandum No. 1019-503F 1 dated 9th May 1943 from the Adviser to the Government , Bahrain, to the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain. I #'{ e &gt; ’■ People in the villages around Budeya are mainly dependent on making sailcloth for which imported yarn from India is used. The price of sailcloth has risen in recent months hy about 75 ^. I understand that this is owing to the price of yarn and I hear that export of yarn from India is or is going to be stopped. The Political Resident is willing to take up this matter but before doing so he wants some facts. Can you give me any information on the subject? Copy of memorandum No.GT/19/330 dated 8 th j/Awal, 1362 (13th May 1943) from the Director of Customs and Port Officer, Bahrain, to the Adviser to the Government, Bahrain. With reference to your memorandum of the 4th j/Awal 1362 (c/w 9th May 1943), in regard to sailcloth; from enquiries I have made from the various importers of this commodity, I am informed that so far no restrictions have been imposed by the Government of India on the export of sailcloth. 2 . I confirm the local price has risen approximately 75$ due in the main to the increase in price in India. Foregoing copy forwarded to the Political Agent, Bahrain, for information. No. /a.
