MINUTE OR SUGGESTED REPLY. The Prime Minister: So far as territory administered under the authority of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom is concerned, most thorough and exhaustive consideration has already been given to the possibility of re-settling the Assyrians of Iraq in these areas. As a result of the initial investigation which was begun when the Council of the League of Nations decided in October, I 933&lt; to a i m at the re-settlement of this community outside Iraq, a scheme for settlement within the Colony of British Guiana was put before the Committee of the League Council which is responsible for handling the Assyrian problem. The League Committee were, however, obliged to come to the conclusion that for over whelming reasons this scheme was im practicable. After the abandonment by the League July* I 93 b» of a further scheme for the settlement of the Assyrians in the Ghab district of Syria, His Majesty’s Government undertook a new inquiry into the possibility of establishing the [Form No. 7a.] Assyrians in territory within the British Colonial Empire. Unfortunately, as the United Kingdom representative informed the League Council in September last, the same obstacles which have prevented a successful outcome of the attempts to settle the Assyrians in the rest of the world have operated just as strongly in the case of the territories within the Colonial Empire. Despite the close atten tion which the Government have given to the matter, the difficulties in the way of the settlement of Assyrians in any of those British territories which are not automatically excluded by climatic con ditions have proved to be insuperable. The question of settling Assyrians in the Dominions is a matter for the Dominion Governments themselves. The Dominions have, however, been ap proached direct by the Assyrian Commit tee of the League Council and they have made it clear that for various reasons they are unable to accept the Assyrian com munity in their territories. In the circumstances I regret that I do not consider that it would serve any use ful purpose to set up a fresh committee of inquiry as proposed by my hon. Friend. His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom will, however, continue as in the past to give all the assistance that they can to the League Council’s Committee, and they have already in formed the League of their intention to recommend Parliament to vote a substan tial proportionate share (amounting to nearly £22,000) of the cost of a scheme estimated to require some £51,000 whicl was adopted by the Council of the Leagu on the 29th September last to establis 1 on a satisfactory material basis near! 9,000 Assyrians from Iraq who have been provisionally resettled by the League Committee on the River Khabur in north eastern Syria. As regards the Assyrians remaining in Iraq, His Majesty s Gov ernment have been happy to learn from the declaration recently made to the League Council by the Iraqi Minister foi Foreign Affairs of the intention of his Government to arrange for a special ex pert investigation into the economic situa-. tion of those Assyrians and to inform tha, League in due course of the resultant ref port and of the effect which had beeif given to its recommendations. 5150 1000 2.31Department.

Mr. Arthur Henderson, — To ask the Secretary of State for the Colonies, whether he has considered or will consider the possibility of settling the Assyrians of Iraq in some part of British-controlled territories in the African continent. [Wednesday 1(M February.] 4650 1000 3.36 MFffiTTE -OR-SUGGESTED REPLY. The Secretary of State for the Colonies (Mr. Ormsby-Gore): Yes, Sir. During recent years my predecessors and I have given the most earnest consideration to this question. Not only the African terri tories, but the whole of the Colonial Empire has been carefully considered with a view to finding some possible place of settlement. Unfortunately it has not yet been possible to find a suitable area in any of the non-self-governing Colonies, Protectorates or Mandated Territories, in which it would be practicable to settle the Assyrians of Iraq, apart from the serious political and economic difficulties which would inevitably arise. Inquiries, however, are still being pursued. Mr. Bellenger: Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether it would entail any considerable cost on the British Government to settle these Assyrians? Mr. Ormsby-Gore: I forget what was the exact amount that was stated at Geneva, but I understand that there is to be a conditional contribution, if the League pays so much and the Iraq Government pay so much. Mr. Henderson: Would not the money be well spent if it were possible to settle them? Mr. Ormsby-Gore: If we could find a climatically, socially and economically suitable area, it would be our wish that they should be settled. Captain Heilgers: Can my right hon. Friend say why Transjordania, which is a very similar country to the Assyrians’ home land, was rejected? Mr. Ormsby-Gore: It is very similar to Iraq, and we do not want exactly the same problem to arise in Arab Trans jordania as has arisen in Arabt / EXTRACT FROM THE MINUTES OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS DATED 193 6 &gt; PAGE 10JO . 53.

United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office.—[Received December 16.) (No. 193.) THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a record of the sixty-first meeting of the Council Committee on the 7th December, 1935. respecting the Assyrian question, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador. Bagdad. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, December 13, 1935. Enclosure. Record of the Sixty-First Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held at Geneva on December 7, 1935, at 5-30 p.m. Per so-A ssyrians. M. Arocha recalled that in the instructions sent to M. Cuenod regarding the consultation of the Assyrians (document C/Min.Ass./151) the committee had expressed its point of view about the Persian Assyrians. This had occasioned a letter from the Iraqi Government (document C/Min.Ass./154), in which the Iraqi Government had made it clear that, in their view, the committee’s task was not concerned with Assyrians of Persian origin. The President thought that the committee was still not in a position to reach any definite decision on this point, and he suggested that it could only be left open for the time being. He asked whether, according to present instructions, the Persian Assyrians were actually to be consulted or not. The United Kingdom Representative said that, according to the instructions sent to M. Cuenod, the local committee was not to take the initiative in consulting Persian Assyrians, but if such Assyrians presented themselves and expressed a desire to go to Syria, the committee was not precluded from taking particulars about them. It was, however, to make it clear that the taking of particulars involved no obligation and did not prejudice in any way the ultimate decision of the Council Committee. There seemed, therefore, no alternative but to leave the question open for the moment. He personally, however, entirely agreed with the point of view of the Iraqi Government. The Danish Representative said that he also agreed. He thought it difficult for the committee to interpret its terms of reference in the sense that it had the power to deal with Assyrians of Persian origin. Liquidation of A ssyrian Property. M. Arocha recalled that in its letter of the 17th October to the Iraqi Government the committee had enquired whether that Government was prepared to facilitate the liquidation of Assyrian property by purchasing such property, at a price to be fixed by the local committee. M. Arocha read extracts from document C/Min.Ass./157, showing that the Iraqi Government regretted their inability to accept any further liability by undertaking itself ^o purchase Assyrian property. The Iraqi Government were prepared, however, to give all possible help in ensuring a satisfactory liquidation of the propertv. [581 q 3]'1 1 he President suggested that the local committee should be asked to give their views as to how this point was to be dealt with. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought it was a very important point, to which the committee ought to give most careful consideration. It was clear that, unless some satisfactory means of disposing of property at a fair price were arrived at, the Assyrians would be the losers, and it seemed necessary to guard against this. In reply to an observation by M. Arocha, he agreed that the committee had already dealt with it in connexion with the transfers of Assyrians which had already taken place; but those transfers were on a comparatively small scale, and the Assyrians concerned were for the most part taken from the more destitute members of the community. What was now contemplated was an operation on a much larger scale, and the committee would have to deal with Assyrians who were more firmly established and who had possibly a consideiable amount of immovable propertv, besides a greater number of sheep and cattle than they might be able to take ‘with them to Syria. If no arrangements were made, the Assyrians might either dispose of their property at nditulous pi ices, or, if they found themselves compelled to do so, might be influenced in theii choice about going to Syria. Furthermore, there was the question of crops. Assyrians in the villages who had sown crops might be unwilling to move until they could harvest them, unless some arrangements were made for selling the crops unharvested. The question was a difficult one and he thought it was important that the Iraqi Government should be asked what they proposed as an alternative to the suggestion already made by the committee I he views of the local committee should also be obtained. The Pi evident agreed. I he local committee might be asked to report on the nature of the property, its estimated quantity and the ways and means of disposing of it. The French Representative thought it might be difficult for the local committee to make a report until the consultation was completed and the quantity ot the property affected was approximately known. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that the importance of the matter ought nevertheless to be impressed upon the local committee and their preliminary views obtained without loss of time. The Danish Representative agreed. Apart from safeguarding the Assyrians against loss it was m the interest of the Council Committee that the financial position of the Assyrians and consequently their power of maintaining themselves m Syria should not be impaired. He thought that the actual amounts concerned did not matter much. 1 he question of the principle involved should be referred to the local committee. This was agreed to. Finance. tv, C • th fi '' e&lt; l u ? st y the President, Mr. Hill explained the present situation, the basic figure for the cost of the whole operation was 86 million French francs Ihis was composed of 62 million French francs for public works and 24 million French fiancs for settlement. The last figure was based on two assumptions: (a) that the number of Assyrians to be provided for was 15,000; and (b) that certain reductions proposed by the Council Committee were approved by the Hidi Commissioner. Both these assumptions seemed now likely to be affected, and the figure of 24 million might thus be exceeded. The Iraqi Government thought that more than 15 000 Assyrians would go. The reductions proposed by the committee had been referred to the High Commissioner for approval, and the Hio-h Commissioner, who was then in Europe, had approved a reduction of 500 000 French francs out of the 2 million French francs proposed. The remainder he said, would have to be referred to Beirut. The High Commissioner, on his return to Beirut, had taken the line that no further reductions could be agreed to until the Board of Irustees had been set up and had examined the position. M. Burnier, for his part, however, had stated that he could not accept reductions in the hgures for maintenance and equipment. M. Burnier had of course no authority to accept or reject, but his view would probably be decisive with the Board of Trustees when set up.3 ® incidentally that it ought to be impressed on the Assyrians • a Q . e ^ expected, so far as possible, to pay for their own maintenance 111 A/r ia Tj-ii W ? S im P^ le&lt; ^ ^ n . v &amp; r ious documents but had never been made clear. . r 'j 1 concluded by saying that to meet the total estimated cost the amount promised was approximately 72,500,000 French francs. The Secretariat was in communication with the United Kingdom and Iraqi Governments in regard to the amounts required for the coming year. p that the only funds in hand at the moment were the remainder °p fu 6 ^00,000 ad\anced by the Iraqi Government. Out of this sum 50 per cent. 0 e total estimated cost of settling the Assyrians transferred last summer had een to the French authorities, and this payment represented, in fact, an excess oi o40,000 French francs over the estimate since drawn up for 1935. The sum or 540,000 francs thus represented an advance on the budget for 1936. On r 1C . iailc ^ sum °f a P°ut 700,000 French francs provided in the estimate oi 1935 in respect of the arrears of expenses in connexion with the Khabur ■settlement had not yet been paid to the French authorities. Allowing for this W3S 3Iltici P ated that at the beginning of 1936 there would be about lo( ,0004 rench francs in hand. The Secretary-General would be ready to advance at the beginning of 1936 the whole of the League contribution for that year, and the Committee would have to look to the United Kingdom and Iraqi Govern ments for the rest of the expenditure anticipated for 1936. He understood that in ^ ec * Kingdom Government had it in mind to arrange for an advance of £60,000 so as to equal the amount already paid by the Iraqi Government, and that the intention thereafter was that the two Governments should contribute oqual and parallel amounts. Ike b rench Representative said that the French High Commissioner was ready to agree that the amount of 705,000 French francs payable to him in 1935 on account of the Khabur arrears should be paid at the beginning of 1936; and that the similar amount payable in 1936 should be paid in 1937. The United Kingdom Representative, with reference to M. Bieler’s last remarks, said that no definite decision as to figures had yet been come to by the 1 nited Kingdom Government. The matter was still under consideration. The French Representative asked what the position was as regards the budget tor 1936. Mr. Bieler replied that if the Trustee Board were constituted by the 1st January it would have to study the whole question, and he presumed that it would address the Secretary-General, as soon as possible, with regard to the budgetary provisions for 1936. The amount for the necessary preparatory work was, however, assured. (Contributions by Private Organisations. The United Kingdom Representative, in reply to an enquiry, said that he had good reason to suppose that a genuine effort was being made for a campaign among private organisations in the United Kingdom. The collection of funds from these sources was, however, bound to be a gradual process, and those who were organising the campaign must be left to work it out in their own way. He asked whether there was any news of efforts in other countries, and what was being done vis-a-vis of international organisations. M. Arocha said that there was nothing to report except a letter from Professor Keller to M. Burnier, in which Professor Keller had said that certain organisations with which he was in touch, including organisations in the Lmited Kingdom, were contemplating the raising of funds—not, however, for settlement work but for the religious needs of the Assyrians when they arrived in Syria. As Professor Keller's letter indicated that the appeal which the Archbishop of Canterbury had in mind to launch had this limited object*, the United Kingdom Representative said that he thought he could say definitely that the idea was erroneous. The Archbishop fully understood that money was necessary in ■considerable amounts for settlement. The President said that he had received a visit from Professor Keller, who had repeated to him much the same as had been included in his letter to M. Burnier.4 M. Arocha said that tentative approaches to American and other inter national organisations had, so far, produced no result, and he wondered whether the organisations in the United Kingdom should not be pressed to bring international organisations within the orbit of their campaign. The United Kingdom Representative protested against this being left to organisations in the United Kingdom. He felt that altogether too much onus was being placed on them, and that no real effort was being made to work for international action. M. Botherg agreed. He thought that every effort should be made to set up an international committee to centralise funds. The President thought that the Secretariat ought to study M. Borberg’s proposal. M. Char ton thought that the committee should not be discouraged by the lack of response from international organisations. His own experience in refugee questions led him to believe that there was more chance of collecting money from private sources once the work of settlement had actually begun and some results could be shown. He believed also that there was more chance of obtaining a banking credit towards filling the present gap when some actual results had been obtained. 7 he President agreed, but thought that the problem of centralising private efforts should nevertheless be studied forthwith. M. Borherg said that the danger was that private organisations, unless guided aright, might be inclined to subscribe for some definite object, like the construction of a church or a hospital, instead of for general settlement work. This would not necessarily be helpful. M. Charron said that this was particularly the case with the Rockefeller Foundation, which always tried to give money for some definite object, rather than to help a general cause. It was agreed that the Secretariat should give further study to the organisa tion of international effort. Assyrian Delegation to the Ghab. A draft letter to the local committee in Iraq explaining why this suggestion could not be accepted was considered and adopted. It was agreed that it was preferable to send this letter to the local committee as a body rather than to M. Cuenod as originally proposed, but it was also agreed to send it through the Iraqi Government under a short covering note. Future Procedure. The President said that the next step was to obtain the approval of the Council for the statutes of the Trustee Board, and if possible for the appoint ment of the members of the board. The alternative practicable dates for a Council meeting were the 10th December and the 17th December. The terms of the statutes were not yet fixed. The views of the United Kingdom Government on the draft were not known. The observations of the French High Commissioner had not yet been received, and in any case the French High Commissioner had not yet seen the latest draft of the statutes. The appointment of the third member of the proposed board required some discussion, and a report would have to be made for the Council. In view of all that had to be done, he was accordingly in favour of asking the Secretary-General that a Council meeting should be arranged for the 17th December This was agreed to. J. C.

[E 7252/2/93 United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office.—{Received December 13.) (No. 190.) THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copy of a record of the fifty-ninth and sixtieth meetings of Council Committee respecting the Assyrian question, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador, Bagdad. Genera. December 11. 1935. Enclosure. Record of Fifty-ninth and Sixtieth Meetings of the Assyrian Committee of the Council, held at Geneva, on December 6, 1935, at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. respectively. AT the request of the president, M. A rocha explained the various amend ments proposed by the French authorities and the Iraqi Government to the draft message to the Assyrians. M. Arocha said that the Iraqi Government had now agreed to the wording of the ante-penultimate paragraph of the message regarding the time which the transfer was likely to take, but their agreement was on the understanding that the local committee would, during the consultation, place before the Assyrians the definite programme of transfer which the Iraqi Government had suggested (see Document No. C./Min.Ass./155). M. Arocha read a private letter from M. Cuenod, according to which the local committee had drawn up an itinerary for its consultation. This itinerary showed the magnitude of the task before the local committee. It provided for some 5,000 miles' travel by motor car, in addition to twenty-four days on horseback. The whole task was likely to take forty-five days, not counting the consultation of the Assyrians in Barwar-i-Bala and Nerva Raikan, who were at present inaccessible owing to snow. (M. Arocha added that, according to the latest information, the number of Assyrians in these districts was about 4,000, and it would not be practicable to consult them until April, or perhaps even May.) The letter also gave a provisional estimate which the committee had drawn up as to the numbers- of Assyrians in each tribe who might be expected to wish to leave Iraq. In answer to an enquiry by the United Kingdom representative, M. Arocha confirmed that the numbers in this provisional estimate corresponded to those on which the Iraqi Government’s programme of transfer was based. M. Arocha then read a telegram from M. Burnier to the effect that the accommodation of 20,000 Assyrians was theoretically possible during the year 1936 if the Trustee Board were to begin preparatory work immediately and climatic conditions were favourable, and if, moreover, the immigrants were prepared to work intensively. It would be necessary to begin transfers by the end of March, and M. Burnier thought that monthly transfers of 3,000 would be possible if the preparatory works were sufficiently advanced when the first arrivals were transferred. M. Arocha added that the Iraqi delegation had received a telegram from the Iraqi Government announcing the readiness of that Government to transfer during 1936 the maximum number that could be absorbed in Syria. The President thought that the main point which the committee now had to consider was the time and manner of the consultation, and the first thing was to decide whether the committee could accept the programme of transfer which [581 n —2 bthe Iraqi Government wished to place before the Assyrians during the consulta tion, pending a decision on which the consultation was being held up. The main consideration was finance. Even if the French authorities could accept the numbers of Assyrians contemplated in the Iraqi programme within the relevant dates, was the programme financially practicable ? The total number provided for in the Iraqi programme was some 21,000, in addition to those already^ provisionally settled on the Ivhabur; whereas the estimates on which th^^ committee had hitherto worked were based on the transfer of 15,000 new immi- orants and even for that number the whole of the necessary funds were not yet in sight. M. Arocha said that a suggestion had been made by the Iraqi representative that, even if the whole programme could not be placed before the Assyrians, it might be agreed upon as between the committee and the Iraqi Government, and each Assyrian, when indicating his desire to go to Syria, could be told, in accordance with the programme, the date on which he would be required to move. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that this involved an equally definite commitment which it seemed impossible for the committee to enter into under present financial circumstances. M. Arocha thought that it might be necessary to fall back on fixing the dates between which the whole move would take place. Even this, however, was difficult in the present situation, and it was possible that the fixing of terminal dates would not prevent the Assyrians from flocking into Mosul. The President suggested that perhaps a programme of transfer might be drawn up for the total number for which the necessary funds were already assured. Then up to that number each individual Assyrian who elected to go could be told the date on which he would go. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that in an earlier message, in which the committee had urged the Assyrians to return to and remain in their villages quietly until the time for transfer came, it had been stated that those who acted in this way would not be prejudiced in the ultimate transfer. The giving of preference to those consulted first, which was involved in the proposal just made, might mean that this pledge was not, in fact, kept. The President, addressing the Iraqi representative, said that the committee fully appreciated the Iraqi Government’s preoccupation and would like to assist in overcoming the difficulty. It was clear, however, from the discussion which had taken place that the committee could not take premature responsibility. It had found a place for settlement; it had found a good deal of the money which was necessary; but it was not yet in a position to agree to anything so definite as the Iraqi programme, and he suggested that it was equally in the interests of the Iraqi Government themselves not to have too definite engagements, as if it were found when the time came that these,engagements could not be fulfilled, the resulting trouble would recoil as much upon the Iraqi Government as upon the committee. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that the Iraqi Government should be informed that the committee felt unable to agree to the programme of transfer; that it sympathised with the object of the Iraqi Government and would be glad to consider any alternative means of overcoming the difficulty. Through lack of local knowledge, it had not felt able to make counter-proposals, as the Iraqi Government had asked, but would consider any proposals put forward by the Iraqi Government. M. Arocha objected that this procedure would involve delay. The French Representative recalled that the High Commissioner had always made it clear that he was not prepared to take the Assyrians without an assurance that he would not be involved in financial responsibility for them. The financing of the transfer of 15,000 was more or less assured, but the High Commissioner would have difficulty in committing himself to more under present circumstances. * .17. Arocha observed that the figure of 15,000 had only been taken, both at Beirut and at Geneva, as a basis of discussion. It was always foreseen that more3 ' might have to be transferred, and, in fact, the French authorities had fixed a kind of sliding scale. They had said that every 1,000 Assyrians over and above the 15,000 would cost, approximately, an extra million francs. The French Representative said that the exact figure was immaterial. The *-43oint was that receipts were limited. The President said that the consultation must, of course, proceed, even though it might result in a larger number of Assyrians electing to go than there were funds to pay for. At the same time, any engagements which the committee entered into must correspond to the money available. The committee could not promise more. In short, all the Assyrians could be consulted, but no promise could be made that they avouM go at a certain date. M. Arocha thought that in the circumstances it was running a considerable risk to hold the consultation—seeing that it was likely to result in many more Assyrians going to Syria than had hitherto been contemplated. The United Kingdom Representative said that there were two kinds of risks. He thought that when the committee agreed to the message in October, all the members had realised that there was a certain risk involved, because the issue of the message to the Assyrians did entail a kind of moral obligation to see that somehow or other all Assyrians who elected to go were eventually transferred to Syria. He thought he was interpreting the minds of the members of the committee in saying that the committee had accepted that risk, and he did not think it was a very serious one. Means could no doubt be found to raise extra funds as and when needed. On the other hand, the Iraqi programme of transfer involved a much more definite risk. It was. to his mind, quite out of the question that the committee should promise at this stage that the transfer should take place on definite dates, or within definite dates. However, the question to be decided was not necessarily concerned with the dates of transfer. The Iraqi Government had suggested two alternatives—either to fix the time which the whole transfer would take or to publish a detailed programme. But both alternatives were only the means to an end. The whole difficulty was to prevent the Assyrians from leaving their villages and leaving their work prematurely and going into Mosul. The Iraqis had suggested means of preventing this which the committee could not accept. Was there any alternative which the committee could suggest ? The French Representative said that apart from financial reasons it was impossible to fix a definite programme, because it would be dependent on climatic conditions. But might not the order in which the various tribes would be trans ferred be established ? The remnants of those tribes now represented among the Assyrians in Syria might be taken first. The United Kingdom Representative said that perhaps some such programme might be combined with a programme of transfer by villages, such as he had suggested in correspondence prior to the present meeting, so that there would be no incentive to concentration in Mosul. The President said that it might be possible to work out some combination of this sort. It was essential, however, to avoid any definite commitment. Could the Iraqi representative give any advice? He appreciated the fear of the Iraqi Government that the Assyrians might flock into Mosul, but might not the Iraqi Government be creating even greater difficulties by trying to fix a definite programme which it might be impossible to carry out ? The Iraqi Representative said that the local committee and the Iraqi Government were in close touch with the Assyrians, and were in a better position than others to realise the difficulties. There was no doubt, however, a danger in fixing dates and numbers. The President suggested a procedure in two stages. There might be a preliminary consultation, during which the Assyrians would simply be asked to say “Yes” or “ No” as to whether they wished to go to Syria. The local com mittee, having got all replies, could then study the list and work out the order of departure. The second stage would be * the announcement of a definite programme of transfer. [581 n—2 j b 24 M. Arocha doubted whether this would meet the difficulty. The Assyrians * would, during the consultation, be required to sign the declaration, of which the text was given in the message to the Assyrians, and it was at that point that the danger of flocking into Mosul would arise. The United Kingdom Representative thought that this was a misinterpre^ tation of the procedure hitherto proposed. He pointed out that the message* contemplated that the declaration should be signed by individual Assyrians, not during the consultation, but before entering Syria. The message, in fact, did propose the procedure which the President had just suggested. The Danish Representative agreed with this view. As M. Arocha said that he did not think that this was what the local committee would understand from the message, the United Kingdom Representative proposed, and it was agreed, that the distinction should be made quite clear to M. Cuenod. Once the declaration was signed, there was a definite obligation to transfer the Assyrians w ho had signed it to Syria, and it seemed important at the present stage to avoid any such definite commitment. The United Kingdom Representative said that as the discussion had so far produced no result, it was for consideration—though he himself did not yet wish to propose it—whether the whole plan hitherto contemplated should not be changed. When the committee had decided to embark upon the consultation im October, it had been thought that the consultation could be completed in time to have the results available for the January Council. Major Thomson had thought this possible, and it would in fact have been possible, but for the unfortunate delay which had occurred in setting the consultation going. It was now, in any' case, impossible to have the results in time for the January Council, and, in fact, if the committee adhered to its original view of establishing the total number of Assyrians to be transferred and thus fixing the limits of the problem before any transfers w^ere undertaken, transfer could not begin until May, or perhaps even June, of next year, since 4.000 of the Assyrians at least could not be consulted owing to climatic conditions until April or May. In these circum stances it was for consideration whether the committee should not proceed piece meal, i.e., that it should make up its mind that how 7 ever many Assyrians elected to go would, in fact, have to be transferred sooner or later, and that it should fix with the Iraqi Government the order in which tribes should be transferred. This would not necessarily be published, but the local committee would then be instructed to go to each tribe or area in turn, and in each area carry out not only the consultation, but the actual transfer, before proceeding to the next. This might involve a postponement of the beginning of the consultation until February or March, but it would not involve any delay in getting the transfer started. A discussion on this suggestion revealed a general disinclination to take so definite a step in present financial circumstances and a preference for attempting still to get a general idea of the total number to be transferred, before transfer took place. It was accepted, however, that the impossibility of consulting the Assyrians in Barwar-i-Bala and Nerva Raikan should not be allowed to hold up the beginning of the actual transfer operation. The Danish Representative said that what the Iraqi Government wanted was that the Assyrians should not leave their villages for Mosul in the belief that they would thereby obtain earlier transfer. It seemed, therefore, that the difficulty might be overcome by impressing on the minds of the Assyrians the idea that they would be transferred not from Mosul, but from the village in which they were living. When the consultation took place, the local committee might say that as soon as the results were known a plan of transfer would be established, and the Assyrians in that particular village would then be informed of the date on which then’ village would have to move. It might be stipulated also that the necessary declaration would have to be signed in the village. An incidental suggestion was that the committee, when carrying out the consultation, ought to find out how many of those who elected to go were in a position to pay for their own transfer. The Iraqi Representative, asked for his view, said that in point of fact all transfers would probably take place via Mosul, as road conditions made this convenient. At the same time he saw no reason why this should be indicated to the Assyrians.Mr. Hill pointed out that it might be inconvenient to stipulate that the 'declaration should in all cases be signed in the village of origin. This might add to the burden of the local committee. The Danish representative accordingly withdrew this part of his proposal. ^ Mr. McKinnon Wood and M. Habicht of the Legal Section entered the meeting at this point, and the discussion was interrupted to deal with certain points about the statute of the Trustee Board. Mr. McKinnon Wood submitted the attached redraft (Annex A) of several articles, in accordance with the discussion at the fifty-eighth meeting. Discussion on article 6 revealed the fact that it was no longer the intention of the High Commissioner to lend the services of his personnel in a part-time advisory capacity. M. de Martel apparently had it in mind to second suitable personnel to the service of the Board of Trustees, but he would expect such personnel to be the employees of the board and paid by the board, in the same way as any other personnel which it might engage. In the light of this explanation, it was agreed that there was no real point in keeping the second sentence of article 6 as in the redraft, and it was accordingly deleted. 1 he other articles in the attached redraft were accepted (ad referendum in the •case of the United Kingdom and French representatives), with the following amendments :— In article 2 (3) the word “ personal ” was inserted before the word “ responsibility.” The phrase “ or their own action as members of the board ” added to the words “ activities of the board ”; and the words “ in the case of ” inserted before the words “ a breach of trust.” The curious wording of the redraft of article 10 was explained as intended to cover all expenditure which the board might incur, and not merely its own administrative expenses. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that expenditure on the settlement operation was already provided for in article 3, and that if article 10 was necessary at ail it should be confined to the administrative expenses of the board. The article was accordingly amended to read : “ The expenses of the board shall he payable in accordance with the annexed Financial Regulations.” Mr. McK innon Wood recalled that the President had asked whether the provision that the Council should take decisions on reports by the Greek Settle ment Commission by majority vote had ever been operated. The point had been looked into, and there appeared to be no record of it. If the committee desired that the Council should have this power of deciding by majority vote any matters concerning the Assyrian Board of Trustees, it was desirable that it should be inserted in the draft statute, but there had been special reasons for the rule in the case of the Greek Commission, and he doubted whether it was necessary in the present case. It seemed hardly conceivable that the Council should wish to enforce decisions in Syria against the vote of the French Government. The United Kingdom Representative agreed that in the present case there appeared to be no reason for providing for a majority decision of the Council. It was not, however, on that point that the provisions of articles 17 and 18 of the Greek Statute seemed to afford a useful precedent. The point in the present case was that the object of the statute was to set up an autonomous body. At the same time it seemed desirable, in the interests of all concerned, that the Council of the League should retain some degree of ultimate control, and unless the power of the Council was stated in the statute, there might be some doubt as to what the Council could do. It was agreed that provisions on the lines of articles 17 and 18 of the Greek Statute should be inserted, omitting the provision for majority decisions of the Council. The committee then returned to the question of the consultation of the Assyrians. The, President asked the Iraqi representative for his view on the Danish representative’s proposal. The Iraqi Representative said that it seemed to him to come near to meeting the object which the Iraqi Government had in mind when putting forward their programme of transfer. At the same time it would, of course, be much better if it were possible to give an approximate date of transfer.It was agreed that a draft telegram to the Iraqi Government should be* prepared on the lines of M. Borberg’s proposal, for consideration at a later meeting. The meeting was resumed at 5 p.m. The attached redrafts of the last sentence of article 3; paragraphs 1 and ^ of article 9; and article 11 were submitted (see Annex B). So far as articles 3 and 11 were concerned, the redrafts were accepted. The redraft of article 9 gave rise to a long discussion. It was objected that the appointment of substitutes by any member unable to sit might involve practical difficulties. The member concerned might not be capable of appointing a substitute, or of consulting his colleagues. A suggestion that permanent substitutes should be appointed at the outset of the board’s work—either by the members themselves or by the Council of the League—was put forward, but doubt was expressed as to whether a sufficient number of suitable persons would be available locally. It was pointed out, however, that to provide for a quorum of three, without providing for substitutes, might prove impracticable, and preference was expressed by various members for a return to the quorum of two. The United Kingdom Representative asked what was to happen if the quorum of two were not in agreement. Would it not be better to have the unanimity rule throughout? This would probably not in practice lead to delay. It would, in fact, be an incentive to the members of the board to reach a compromise acceptable to them all, so as to avoid the necessity of reference to the Council of minor points at all events. The majority rule might, on the other hand, lead to friction within the board. The French Representative, on the other hand, said that in the case of the quorum of two it was clear that one of the two would always be a representative of the High Commissioner, and in such a case he thought that a preponderating vote should be given to the other member, since the ultimate responsibility of the settlement operation would lie with the Trustee Board, which was the creation of the Council of the League. As regards the idea of unanimity in all decisions, he thought that the High Commissioner might not like to be in the position of either having to agree with all decisions of the Trustee Board or of provoking a reference to the Council of the League. The United Kingdom Representative asked whether it was not undesirable that the members appointed by the Council should be in a position to over rule the High Commissioner on points which might be of importance to the administration of the mandated territories as a whole. The President expressed agreement with the United Kingdom representative. The French Representative said, however, that he could not think of any question which would be likely to affect the administration as a whole. Of course, it might be possible to stipulate that decisions on certain questions should be by unanimity, but that in the main decisions should be by majority. He agreed that it was difficult for the Council Committee to define the questions on which unanimity was necessary. As Mr. McKinnon Wood had said that the majority rule was usual in the case of organisations emanating from the League, and as there was clearly no agreement among the members of the committee, it was decided that the best course would be to leave the article as originally drafted, pending at all events the observations of the High Commissioner, and perhaps to allow it to be tested by experience. The attached redraft of article 9 was therefore not accepted, and the question was left open. The draft of a telegram to the Iraqi Government about the consultation of the Assyrians was then considered and adopted (see Document C/Min./Ass./161).. J. C.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 7251/2/93] United Kingdom Delegate to Foreign Office.—(Received December 13.) (No. 189.) THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a record of the fifty-eighth meeting of the Council Committee, held on the 5th December, respecting the Assyrian question, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty s Ambassador, Bagdad. Geneva, December 11, 1935. Enclosure. Record of the Fifty-Fjighth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held at Geneva on December 5. 1935, at 5-30 p.m. The President said that the documents which had been circulated contained a great many details about the preparatory work which was required in the mandated territories before any Assyrians could be received in the vicinity of the Ghab area. The best thing seemed to be to proceed without delay with the appointment of the Board of Trustees, so that the study and preparation of the measures involved could be left to that body. The Council Committee obviously had not sufficient local knowledge. There was a legal difficulty, namely that the Board of Trustees could only be set up by a decision of the Council of the League. If sufficient progress were made, however, it might be possible in a few days’ time to ask for a meeting of the Council, profiting by the presence of its members in connexion with the forthcoming meeting of the Council of Eighteen in the Abyssinian question. It would be a great gain of time if the Board could be set up in the near future, and could study the questions at issue; otherwise the Council Committee would itself have to take decisions which properly fell within the competence of the Board, and thus assume an undesirable responsibility. M. Olivan therefore proposed that the committee should first of all examine the draft statute of the Board of Trustees which had been prepared by the Legal Section of the Secretariat. The United Kingdom Representative said that when he left London he had no reason to believe that the examination of the statute of the Board of Trustees was a matter of such urgency. While ready, therefore, to discuss the statute, he was not in a position to accept any particular wording on behalf of the United Kingdom Government. Any suggestions which he made must be regarded as purely personal, and he must refer any new text to his Government before agreeing to it. The French Representative said that he was as yet without the observations of the High Commissioner, and could therefore only discuss the draft statute tentatively. The Danish Representative asked whether the committee was legally able to take a decision on the statute. The President replied that the committee could only make recommendations to the Council. M. A rocha observed that it was necessary to explain the present situation, in order to show the urgency of proceeding to a discussion of the statute. The report adopted by the committee at its last session in October had been distributed on the [581 n—1 b2 12th November. Meanwhile, as provided in that report, the Legal bection had drafted the statute of the Board of Trustees. The message to the Assyrians, decided upon at the last meeting of the committee, had been sent to Iraq, and certain modifications had been discussed with the Iraqi Government and with the French High Commissioner. There was now agreement on the text of the^ message, but it had not yet been published, since the Iraqi Government hadw accepted it on the assumption that the committee would approve the suggestion made by that Government of putting before the Assyrians during the consultation a definite programme of transfer. The Iraqi Government had been informed that the committee would consider this programme at its present meeting. The committee had also to take a decision on the request which had been made by certain so-called representatives of Assyrian tribes, that they should be allowed to send a delegation to the Ghab area. The most important fact, however, for present purposes was that a letter had just been received from M. Burnier, describing the work which had to be done before the Assyrians could be received in the mandated territories. M. Arocha then read M. Burnier’s letter, the main point of which was that the necessary preparatory work would take three months. M. Arocha remarked on this latter point that, unless the preparatory work were begun almost at once, the whole operation of transfer would inevitably be delayed. The President observed that M. Arocha’s expose of the situation only reinforced his view that the first point to be taken should he the draft statute of the Board of Trustees. The United Kinqdom Representative asked that, in view of its importance, M. Burnier’s letter—although a private one to M. Arocha—should be distributed. This was agreed to (copy of letter attached as Annex A).( ] ) The Danish Representative said that M. Burnier’s letter clearly showed the necessity for a Council meeting in the near future, if that could be arranged. Was it certain that all the members of the Council would be in Geneva on the 12th December? The United Kingdom Representative stipulated that the committee should not at the present stage take a definite decision about asking for a Council meeting. The President explained that all that was intended for the moment was to find out whether a meeting of the Council was materially possible, should it be found necessary. He instructed M. Arocha to inform the Secretary-General that the committee would probably ask for a meeting of the Council in the near future, but that it had not yet taken a decision. The committee then proceeded to a first reading of the draft statute of the Board of Trustees (Annex B). A discussion took place on the basis of the French text. Minor drafting changes were made in article 1. As regards article 2, the President suggested that there was an apparent conflict between clauses 2 and 3. It was decided that they should be amended on the lines of articles 15 and 16 of the statute of the Nansen Office. On the proposal of the United Kingdom delegate, it was agreed that article 3 should be expanded so as to emphasise the distinction between the functions of the Board of Trustees during the first four years or so of its existence, and its subsequent activities after the ownership of the reclaimed area in the Ghab had been vested in it. On article 4, the United Kingdom Delegate observed that no provision was made for the payment of the third member of the Board of Trustees. He reserved his attitude on this point. The United Kingdom Representative observed that article 5 seemed to be too widely worded. If taken literally, it would give the chairman power to ignore his colleagues. He suggested that something on the lines of article 9 of the statute of the Greek Refugee Commission would be appropriate. This article (*) (*) Not printed.[581 n—1] B 2 3 provided that the chairman, or in his absence his substitute, would convene all meetings of the Settlement Commission, sign all documents and correspondence, and be responsible for the execution of the decisions of the Settlement Commission. 1 his was agreed to. It was agreed that article 6, which had been taken bodily from the Greek Statute, was not very happily worded, and, following observations by the French repi esentative, it was decided to amend the article in the sense of making more of the offei of the High Commission to provide personnel and recommendino- the Board of Trustees to take advantage of that offer. The French Representative reserved his attitude regarding article 7. Article 9 raised the question whether the proceedings of the Board should be ky unanimity or majority. There was a general feeling that the unanimitv rule of which a corollary would be reference to the Council in case of all differences of opinion, might be cumbersome and involve too much delay. On the other hand, it was realised that the majority rule was likely to cause difficulties, and there was doubt as to how it would fit in with the provision that a quorum could be constituted by two members. 7’Ae United Kingdom Representative pointed out that in the Statute of the Greek Commission provision had been made for any member who could not attend meetings to be represented by a substitute. As the present draft provided for the appointment of substitutes, he suggested that this idea might be further explored, so that there would always have to be three members at every meeting. It was decided to reserve consideration of this article, the President expressing his personal view that decisions by majority should be agreed to. but that the proviso that two members might constitute a quorum should be omitted. In article 10 it was agreed that the reference to article 2 of the Financial Regulations should be deleted, and that the article should provide simply that the expenses of the Board should be met in the manner provided for in the annexed Financial Regulations. As regards article 11, the United Kingdom Representative pointed out that the similar articles in the Greek Statute had gone on to indicate what the action of the Council should be. Had the Legal Section omitted these provisions on purpose, or not? M. Habicht said that the provision in the Greek Statute that the Council should pronounce on reports of the commission by a majority vote and should, by a majority vote, if necessary, proceed to an enquiry into the Settlement Commission’s work was an unusual one, and the Legal Section had not therefore felt it possible to insert it in the present statute without precise instructions to that effect. If, however, the committee decided that the Council was to supervise the work of the Board of Trustees, his personal opinion was that it was advisable to stipulate that the Council should act by a majority vote. The President asked whether the Council had, in fact, taken decisions bv majority vote in regard to the Greek settlement work. M. Habicht undertook to look up this point, and meanwhile the question was left open. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that there was an apparent conflict between article 12 and the annexed Financial Regulations regarding the procedure to be adopted in cases of dispute regarding the interpretation of those regulations. According to article 19 of the regulations, questions which could not be settled under the regulations were to be submitted to the Secretary-General, and by him, if necessary, to the Council Committee. Article 12 of the statute, however, provided that questions regarding the interpretation of the Financial Regulations were to be submitted to the Council itself. He thought that there should be no misunderstanding as to what the procedure should be. It was agreed that the words “annexed Financial Regulations ” be deleted from article 12.4 The committee then proceeded to discuss the request made by so-called repre sentatives of certain Assyrian tribes to be sent as a delegation to see the Ghab area before the tribes concerned were called upon to take a decision. In reply to a question, M. A rocha said that subsequent correspondence showed that the local committee thought that the expenses of any such delegation would have to be paid by the Council Committee. M. Olivdn recalled that representatives of the tribes concerned had visited him in Mosul. In reply to his question whether they would be prepared to go to Syria, they had stated they could not decide without knowing the conditions of the proposed settlement in Syria. M. Olivan had said that he was not then in a position to give detailed information, and the interview terminated, though the representatives concerned had afterwards complained that they had not received a proper hearing. M. Olivan thought that it was a delicate matter to allow Assyrian delegates to go to the Ghab area. A visit to land which was to be completely transformed before settlement was not likely to give reliable impressions. Even members of the committee who knew of the improvements projected would find it difficult at the present stage to realise what the land would be like after the development works had been undertaken. He thought also that it was a dangerous precedent to allow a delegation to go to the Ghab. as the committee would be bound to allow other Assyrians to go if they expressed a desire. Moreover, the High Commissioner might have objections. He asked the Iraqi representative what his opinion was. The Iraqi Representative replied that he knew nothing of the matter. He had not been informed of the request of the Assyrians concerned. He would like to know what the views of the committee were, and he would then inform his Government, Personally, he thought the idea of sending a delegation to the Ghab a dangerous one. The United Kingdom Representative said that he entirely agreed that the delegation should be discouraged. He thought, however, that the matter should be handled very carefully, as otherwise the committee might be severely criticised on the ground that it was obstructing the Assyrians and trying to conceal from them the real situation. He thought that it was important to impress upon the Assyrians not only that the visit was financially impossible, but that it would serve no useful purpose, in view of the fact that the Ghab area was to be transformed by public works before settlement took place. He thought it should also be impressed upon the Assyrians that the French Government were not likely to put forward—nor the committee to endorse—any scheme unless they had reason to suppose that it was likely to offer a prosperous future to the Assyrians. Furthermore, it should be impressed upon them that the prime object of the committee had been to find an alternative home for those who felt it impossible to remain longer in Iraq. The choice, in fact, before the Assyrians lay between accepting the Syrian scheme or remaining in Iraq. The Danish Representative agreed and thought that the committee ought to mark its disapproval of the lack of confidence in the French authorities and in the League Committee which the request amounted to. He entirely agreed that the question ought to be most carefully explained to M. Cuenod. The French Representative read a communication from the French High Commissioner showing that M. de Martel thought the proposed visit of a delega tion entirely out of the question, and recommending that the Assyrians must be told that they must rely, upon the French authorities and the League Committee. It was agreed that it might be preferable, in order to avoid misunderstanding, that the communication to M. Cuenod should be in the form of a letter sent by air mail, rather than a telegram. The next meeting was fixed for the 6th December at 10 a.m. to consider Jie question of the consultation of the Assyrians and the programme of transfer. J. C. STERN DALE BENNETT.[ Annex A.

Mr. RHYS DAVIES asked the Secre tary of State for Foreign Affairs the pur pose of the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations which has been con vened for 17 th December, to discuss the question of Assyrian settlement ? Viscount CRANBORNE: The President of the Council Committee for settling the Assyrians in Iraq requested that a special meeting of the Council might be called for 17 th December to consider various urgent points arising out of the Committee’s report to the Council. The most important of these related to the constitution of a Trustee Board to under take financial responsibility for the operation of settling the Assyrians in the Ghab area in Syria, and to carry out, in collaboration with the High Com missioner for Syria, the actual admini stration of the settlement. The meeting was duly convened, but has now been merged in the meeting of the Council subsequently convened for 18 th December to consider the Italo-Abyssinian conflict.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HISliRWANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). 8371 L 1935 'i October 21, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 6287/163/93] Mr. Bateman to Sir Samuel Hoare.—(Received October 21.) (No. 542.) Sir, Bagdad, October 9, 1935. IT may be useful, for future reference, if I attempt to summarise the circumstances in which solutions of the separate problems concerning the Iraq railways and Assyrian settlement came to be sought simultaneously. 2. As regards the Assyrians, it can, I think, be assumed that up to the end of August and beginning of September Yasin Pasha had definitely decided against any increase in the sum of £125,000 which the Iraqi Government had promised to contribute as a result of M. Olivan’s visit in May. For the greater part of the summer Nuri Pasha had been absent from Bagdad, and it was therefore impossible to look to him for help in inducing the Prime Minister to change his mind. Indeed, when on the 29th August I communicated to him the news that His Majesty’s Government were prepared to make a generous contribu tion, yari passu with the Iraqi Government, in a final effort to liquidate the Assyrian question, his only response was to refer me to Yasin Pasha in the hope that, if this gesture failed to move him, the Prime Minister might be persuaded to go himself to Geneva. At that time, Nuri Pasha was smarting under the unfair criticism that had been levelled at him by his opponents in the Cabinet on his return empty-handed from Tehran, and rumour had it that he was on the point of resigning. He was therefore anxious, for reasons of his own, to get Yasin Pasha to share openly the burden which, up till then, he had borne alone. But to expect the Prime Minister to do so for the sake of settling the Assyrian question was, to say the least, disingenuous. 3. To begin with, there were internal political considerations which gave him pause. If he left Bagdad, Rashid Ali—the Minister of the Interior—would have remained at the head of affairs. This would have been inadvisable for more than one reason. Secondly, it was Yasin Pasha himself who had made the promise to the Council of the League in 1933, and he was well aware that excessive pressure would, on that account alone, be brought to bear on him at Geneva. Resistance would be far easier in Bagdad. If, eventually, the Iraqi Government were forced to capitulate, then the blame would rest primarily on Nuri Pasha. For his part, he had on the 7th August told me quite definitely that his letter of the 26th May to M. Olivan had contained his last word. He had refused to give way, even though there was (as M. Arocha had pointed out from Beirut) a chance of getting some 4,000 Assyrians over to Syria by the autumn, if he would waive the per capita condition. 4. Last, but by no means least, he remained unconvinced of the necessity for an increase in the contribution to be made by the Iraqi Government. His line throughout all my talks with him on the subject was that in 1933, following upon the disastrous events of that unhappy year, he had only offered to help the Assyrians on their way to a new home. It had never been suggested, even when a new habitat was being sought for them in Brazil and Guiana, that Iraq should contribute more than £100,000, and he failed to see why settlement in Syria should be so costly. At the back of his mind there was clearly the suspicion that he was being asked to pay for an enterprise in Syria which would eventually be of benefit to the French alone—an idea which he found most repugnant. When answers were found to these arguments, he would ask me to place myself in his position. Was I not nauseated by the filth, squalor, misery, poverty, and disease in which the greater part of the 3 million indigenous inhabitants of Iraq were eking out a bare existence ? Surely his first care was for them. Would I, if I were in his shoes, relish the prospect of having to defend a payment of one-tenth of a year’s revenue on people who had come uninvited to Iraq, who had battened on the country, grown fat and lazy (and, in some cases, rich) in the [531 x—1]2 process, and had acquired a nuisance value which they used whenever it suited them to embarrass and vilify the Government? If Iraq was being made to pay for Simel, surely the payment should not increase with every year that passed. There was a limit, and the punishment should be made to fit the crime. 5. There are. no doubt, ripostes to all these thrusts, but I found it by no means easy to persuade Yasin Pasha of the dangers of allowing an Assyrian enclave to remain hostile in Iraq. There is still much of the soldier left in him. Through the force of his own personality he has now established himself, in six months and against odds, in a position which appears to be stronger than that of any of his predecessors. He has set himself the task of establishing firm rule in a lawless country, and to all outward showing he has achieved no little success. A case based on possible danger from the Assyrians comes to him to-day with less force than it would have done a year ago. 6. As regards the railways, he was inclined to regard His Majesty’s Govern ment as obstructive and dilatory. He had been given to understand by Nuri Pasha, after his return from London in July, that negotiations to put an end to the present indeterminate status of the system would be opened almost immediately, and, in any case, before the departure of His Majesty’s Ambassador on leave. When this was seen to be impossible, he became taciturn, and on occasion disgruntled and querulous. He could not understand why His Majesty’s Government should be so long in making up their mind. Had they not, during the Euphrates troubles, stood by and seen their property damaged by the tribesmen without moving a finger ? Surely their interest in the railways could not be so great as to necessitate the lengthy cogitation that was holding up his whole development programme. He could not move without coming up against this difficulty. A piece of railway land was badly needed as a new museum site. It could not be handed over until the railway question was out of the way. His scheme for extending the system to Mosul and broadening the gauge would probably mean floating a loan in London. But, without knowing how much he was to be called upon to pay for the existing lines, how could he reasonably approach Parliament ? There was, of course, a certain amount of froth in all this, but there was no doubt at all of the Prime Minister’s genuine desire to arrive at a settlement as soon as possible. 7. When on the 28th August the proposals of His Majesty’s Government were explained to him (in the presence of Nuri Pasha), his whole manner changed perceptibly and it was clear that something in the nature of a detente had been effected. Had there been time for leisurely negotiation, it is more than possible that the Iraqi Government would eventually have agreed to the minimum payment of £500,000 required by His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Eden’s telegram No. 15 of the 14th September from Geneva, however, changed the tempo. Its terms showed that the fate of the scheme of Assyrian settlement in Syiia depended upon whether or not Yasin Pasha could be brought, within a few hquis, to change his mind and consent to double the Iraqi contribution unconditionally. It was equally clear that His Majesty’s Government regarded the matter as one of the most urgent importance, and that a decided final effort would ImAe to be made to bring Yasin Pasha into line. 8. On the 16th September, it seemed to me that the position could be broadly stated in the following way : Yasin Pasha had been favourably impressed with the railway proposals put forward by His Majesty’s Government and was probably willing to close with them, provided he could efiect a ieduction m the cash payment demanded. In my instructions (your telegram No. -^09 °f fhe 24th August) it had been definitely stated that His Majesty s Government regarded this side of the matter as of secondary importance. I hey were unwilling to see the negotiations fail on financial grounds, and I was given discretion to reduce the amount originally required from £650,000 to £500,000, if necessary to secure agreement on the remaining conditions of transfer. It so happened that I had an advantage over the Prime Minister in being in possession of the latest available railway returns. Up to the end of July, the deficit m the year s working amounted to nearly £23.000, and I was apprehensive that, if this information came to the knowledge of the Prime Minister, he might be tempted (for all his anxiety to effect a rapid settlement) to adopt the Fabian tactics which had been foreseen as a possibility earlier in the year, in order to bring down the figure of payment to one which would be entirely unacceptable to His Majesty s Government. From this point of view, therefore, there was something to be said on our side also for disposing of the railway question without undue delay.8 9. On the other hand, though the urgency of the Assyrian question was patent, there was nothing to show that Yasin Pasha had departed in the slightest from the attitude which he had adopted hitherto. Something more than a honeyed tongue would therefore be necessary to make him give way. . 10. Here, then, were all the elements necessary for a transaction which Pwould at one stroke dispose of two outstanding questions. There was no time to consult you in the matter, and I therefore decided that the best course would be to make first a final appeal to the Prime Minister regarding the Assyrians and then, if this failed, to try him out by guaranteeing your acceptance of £500.000 for the railways if he. for his part, would guarantee the necessary Iraqi contribution for Assyrian resettlement. 11. On the 17th September I sought an interview with him and read Mr. Eden’s telegram as though it was a personal appeal from the head of the British delegation in Geneva to the head of the Iraqi Government. 1 said that there was no need to go over all the old ground again. The gesture made by His Majesty’s Government had constituted a new “point de depart.’’ It had been prompted by a genuine and urgent desire to break the back of this difficult problem, but it would not succeed unless the Iraqi Government pulled their full weight. It now remained for the Iraqi Government to decide whether, for the sake of £125,000, they would incur the odium of disastrous failure and the possibility of much greater expense and trouble later on. I added that this was an occasion which left no time for anything but a rapid decision, and I begged Yasin Pasha to consider most carefully all the consequences of a blank negative. 12. This message produced some effect, but it was quite clear, from the few remarks which the Prime Minister let fall, that he could not bring himself (and despaired of bringing his colleagues) to go back on all that he had hitherto said. 13. In these circumstances, therefore, I deemed it desirable to offer him something in the way of tangible encouragement. Up to that time, I had given him to understand that the figure of £650,000 required by His Majesty’s Govern ment for the railways, bearing as it did a justifiable relationship with the figure of 275 lakhs of rupees mentioned in the Financial Agreement of 1930. was not capable of reduction, and I had vigorously contested the story put about by Nuri Pasha at Geneva to the effect that, at a pinch, His Majesty’s Government would accept, as payment, the railway reserve fund. At the same time, Yasin Pasha was clearly out to secure some reduction in this figure. He had said that he had not, at present, got enough in the till to make an immediate payment of this dimension. This seemed to show that if I insisted on full payment, not only would the railway negotiations become protracted, but the opportunity to secure an increased Assyrian contribution would be missed. While, therefore, Yasin Pasha was searching in his mind for the terms of a polite but none the less final negative, I made him the offer reported in my telegram No. 230 of the 17th September. 14. At first he seemed incredulous and went so far as to say that he regretted the connexion which had been made between the two questions. I replied that there was no need for regret, that I had in no way connected them and that all I had endeavoured to do was to indicate, on my own responsibility, a rapid means whereby at one stroke he could dispose satisfactorily of both. If he saw no virtue in the proposal, then it would be as easy for me to withdraw it as it was difficult to make it. I was by no means wedded to the idea, but the position was such that an immediate decision one way or the other was called for. If he thought the suggestion feasible, I would guarantee my offer as a firm one and one which would be acceptable to you, but if there was to be further argument, time would be lost and no guarantee would be possible. 15. In reply, Yasin Pasha said he would be frank with me. He could not accept without squaring the Minister of the Interior, who had a following and who would need a great deal of persuasion before consenting to an increase in the Iraqi contribution towards Assyrian settlement. The inducement would have to be very attractive. He did not think Rashid Ali would consent to the whole £250,000 in any case, and, even if he could be forced up to £200,000, it would be necessary to reduce the railway payment to £400,000. Could I recommend His Majesty’s Government to accept this offer ? I declined for the reasons described above, whereupon a long discussion ensued which traversed, inter alia, the shortness of Iraq’s purse and the difficulties of Iraqi politics. Finally, after% 4 again warning the Prime Minister that his suggestion, which savoured of bargaining, would waste most valuable time, I consented to consult you but without leading him to think that there was the slightest hope of agreement, so long as the Iraqi Government made difficulties over the full amount of the contribution required from them for Assyrian settlement. 16. The next day, Yasin Pasha, after repeated telephonic enquiries, callec upon me as soon as he heard that your reply had been received. Much of the old ground was retraversed, but finally, when he realised that the sine qua non of a settlement of the railway question at his figure of £400,000 was his agreement to pay unconditionally a total of £250,000 for the Assyrians, he gave way with good grace. The rest of the story has, I think, been made clear in my telegrams and despatches. 17. The present position is that the Iraqi Government have bound them selves to double their contribution to Assyrian settlement unconditionally and agreement has been reached in principle regarding the conditions of a railway settlement. 18. From reports which reach me from many sources, it appears that, over the past two weeks, the attitude of the Government, not only towards the railways but to other British interests, has undergone a decided change. There is less desire to obstruct and more to help, and I can only hope that the details of the railway settlement, which remain for further discussion, will do nothing to prejudice what appears to be a most favourable situation. 19. It is, of course, conceivable that by bargaining at the last moment I might have succeeded in splitting the difference and fixing the railway purchase price at £450,000. On the whole, however. I am inclined to think that there may be a very distinct advantage in our being able to point out in the future that the financial transaction was closed at the figure proposed by the Prime Minister himself. 20.

[Communicated to the Council and the Members of the League.] LEAGUE OF NATIONS SETTLEMENT OF THE ASSYRIANS OF IRAQ REPORT BY THE COMMITTEE TO THE COUNCIL (Annexed: Financial Regulations for the Control of the Funds). On October 14th, 1933, the Council set up the present Committee, to which it delegated extensive powers. The functions of the Committee were “ to take, in close co-operation with the Iraqi Government, all such steps as it might think fit with a view to the preparation and execution of a detailed scheme for the settlement, elsewhere than in Iraq, of such Assyrians as might express the desire to leave the country ” [Official Journal, December 1933, page 1647). Ever since a destination has been found for the Assyrians in the French mandated territories of the Levant, under the conditions set out in the letter of the French Government, dated April 14th, 1935, of which the Council took note on April 17th, 1935, the main difficulty has been the provision of the necessary funds. In a report on September 12th, 1935, the Committee referred to the Council the question of the financial participation of the League which had been made, by the United Kingdom Government, a condition of its own independent contribution. The Committee’s report was referred to the Assembly of the League, the Sixth Committee of which, on September 20th, passed the following resolution on this subject: “ The Sixth Committee, “ Recognising the efforts made by the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq to find a destination for those Assyrians who may wish to leave that country; ' Considering that the projected scheme of settlement in the Ghab area of the French mandated territories of the Levant offers the prospect of a satisfactory and permanent solutiorn of the Assyrian problem; “ Taking note of the extent to which the Iraqi Government, the United Kingdom Go vernment and the authorities of the French mandated territories of the Levant, are prepared to contribute to the realisation of this scheme and in the firm hope of contributions from private charitable organisations; “ Recognising that a considerable balance is nevertheless inevitable when all these contributions have been taken into account; “ Having regard to the special features of the problem and more particularly its humani tarian aspect, the deep interest which the Council has always taken in its solution and finally the dangers to the tranquillity of the Near East which a postponement of a decision would involve: “ Considers that the proposal of the United Kingdom concerning the financial partici pation of the League is worthy of the most sympathetic consideration of the Assembly and consequently refers to the Fourth Commission the question of the provision of the necessary funds.” In the Fourth Committee, the United Kingdom delegation proposed a resolution ending with the following recommendation: ' Recommends the Assembly to undertake to provide the funds necessary to complete the scheme, over and above the contributions referred to above, and specifically to approve the insertion towards meeting that liability of a sum in the budget of the League; “ Decides, in consequence, that the above recommendations be forthwith referred to the Supervisory Commission for detailed study of the financial proposals.”— 2 — \ Alter various delegations had explained their points of view, this resolution was adopted by Vhe Fourth Committee and referred, together with the resolution of the Sixth Committee quoted above, to the Supervisory Commission for consideration and report. The Supervisory Commission reported that it was unable to endorse the suggestion that all expenditure not covered by contributions from other sources should be borne by the League, and recommended that the total amount of the League’s contribution should be clearly fixed forthwith, and that the sum thus definitely fixed should in no case be increased later. It recom mended to the Fourth Committee that the League’s contribution should be fixed at the final figure of 1,300,000 gold francs. It added that, in view of the subsidy granted by the League, the latter was entitled to expect, although this did not imply any financial liability whatsoever on its part, that very strict supervision would be exercised over the various parts of the operation. These recommendations were endorsed by the Fourth Committee and adopted by the Assembly. * * * The total estimated expense of the scheme of settlement was set out in a table attached to a note which the Council Committee prepared on September 18th for the guidance of the Assembly, and this table is for convenience annexed to the present report. There are, of course, still certain unknown factors, and the table must therefore be regarded as provisional. For example, the number of the Assyrians for whom provision will have to be made has not yet been established and this point is dealt with below. Moreover, the estimates assume that certain economies and adjustments could be made in the figures originally put forward during the discussions in Beirut in August last between the representatives of the Committee and the authorities of the mandated territories and the possibility of effecting these economies and adjustments is still under consideration between the Committee and the High Commissioner. It will be seen that the table provides for a total expenditure of 62 million hrench francs on reclamation works and an expenditure, after allowing for certain incidental receipts, of 24 million French francs on the settlement operations proper. To meet this expenditure, the following contributions are in sight: The mandated territories have offered to pay 22 million French francs towards the first section of the Ghab reclamation works, plus a further sum, on a recoverable basis, of 6.5 million French francs towards the second section of those works— i.e., a total of 28.5 million hrench francs. The United Kingdom Government has offered, under certain conditions, to seek Parliamentary sanction for a contribution, equivalent to five-twelfths of the expense which the Council Committee may have to meet, up to a maximum of £250,000. The Iraqi Government has offered, under similar conditions, to increase up to the same maximum the sum which it had previously promised. A total amount of approximately 37.5 million French francs may thus be expected from these two sources. Finally, the contribution from the League is approximately equivalent to 6.5 million French francs. Thus, to meet a total estimated expenditure of 86 million French francs, contributions to the amount to about 72.5 million French francs are already in sight. The Council Committee has under consideration the means whereby the rest of the money required can be raised. It is studying the possibility of a credit operation based in the main on payments to be made later by the Assyrians towards the purchase of their land. It is, however, to be expected that, even if this operation materialises, it will not do more than cover part of the balance remaining to be found. The Committee must therefore rely to a very large extent on private charitable organisations from whom it trusts that substantial contributions will eventually be forthcoming, though the result of the appeal which has been made to them naturally cannot be known for some little time. Failing a beginning with the preparatory work in the mandated territories by the middle of the present month, a delay of a year in the whole operation was anticipated, and, as was pointed out by the President of the Council Committee in his speech to the Sixth Committee of the Assembly on September 17th, 1 this involved a political risk, which the Council Committee viewed with very grave apprehension. As the High Commissioner was prepared at once to take the steps required to begin this preparatory work, provided that the necessary funds could be made available, the sum of 1 million French francs has been placed at his disposal for this purpose from funds already in hand. * * * Ever since the Committee decided to direct its efforts towards settling the Assyrians in the mandated territories of the Levant, it has given detailed consideration to the question of the organisation and financial administration of the scheme. The administration of the funds for the existing provisional Assyrian settlement in the Khabur region in Syria is governed by financial regulations agreed upon between the Committee, the Secretary-General and the High Commissioner and put into force during the visit of the President of the Committee to Beirut in June last, as reported in Annex I of the Committee’s report to the Council of September 12th, 1935. 2 Under these regulations, the estimates require the approval of the Committee. The funds are issued by the Secretary-General, whose approval is required for transfers between chapters of the 1 Document A.VI/5.1935. 2 Document C.352.M.179.1935.VII.1 Document C.352.M.179.1935.VII. budget. Finally, the audit is in the hands of the League of Nations. The High Commissioner,, on the other hand, is responsible for the general financial administration of the funds, including the day-to-day control over expenditure. The Committee has now reconsidered the above arrangements, bearing in mind the wider scope of the present scheme and the greater financial issues at stake in comparison with the provisional settlement on the Khabur, and, further, the above-quoted stipulations of the Supervisory Commission regarding the necessity of strict financial supervision over the various parts of the operation. The scheme now envisaged consists of two sections, first the public works necessary to reclaim the Ghab plain, and secondly, the maintenance and provisional settlement of the Assyrians, pending the completion of the reclamation scheme, and their final settlement on the reclaimed land. The first of these operations is an element which was not present when the existing financial regulations were drawn up. The nature of the work involved and the fact that the mandated territories accept any residuary liability over and above the present estimated cost of 62 million French francs make it appropriate that the entire control—both financial and administrative— should be in the hands of the High Commissioner. The League, however, has an interest in the general progress of the work and in the expenditure to which it is contributing, the more so as the High Commissioner is ready to pay into the general settlement fund a proportion of any savings which may be effected on the present estimates. It is appropriate, therefore, that progress reports and accounts should be communicated periodically for information to the League, and the High Commissioner has agreed that the annual budgets relating to this part of the operation should also be submitted. As regards the organisation of the settlement proper, the Committee has reviewed the recommendations in the detailed study prepared in consultation with its representatives by the authorities in the mandated territories and transmitted by the French Government on August 28th 1 in the light of the following circumstances: The High Commissioner intends that his services shall co-operate to the fullest possible extent in the installation and administration of the Assyrian colonies, pending their final absorption into the local administrative machinery and, in the sphere of education and health in particular, it is clear that the administration can only be carried out by the competent services of the High Commissioner. On the other hand, as regards finance, the High Commissioner has felt unable, in view of the altered circumstances and in particular the international origin of the funds, to assume the responsibility for the application of those funds, though he intends to afford to whatever body may be set up to exercise this responsibility every facility for satisfying itself that the utmost economy in expenditure is realised. As the funds available are strictly limited, the Committee would like to lay stress upon the necessity for carrying out the operation with the utmost economy in expenditure consistent with its efficient execution. As the Supervisory Commission has emphasised, close financial supervision will be necessary to ensure this economy. After due consideration of the various factors involved, the Council Committee has reached the conclusion that the most satisfactory course would be for the Council to set up in the mandated territories of the Levant, as soon as practicable, an autonomous body with legal personality to undertake financial responsibility for the settlement operation, as distinct from the public works for the reclamation of the Ghab, and, in collaboration with the High Commissioner, the administra tion of the settlement. This body, which might be known as the “ Assyrian Settlement Trustee Board ”, would, in addition, eventually take over, administer and dispose of the land in the Ghab area when reclaimed. The financial functions which the Committee thinks should be carried out by the Trustee Board are set out in the attached financial regulations, which will eventually be annexed to the Statute from which the Trustee Board will derive its legal personality. These regulations provide for the custody of funds, the periodic examination of accounts and systematic audit by the League of Nations. Estimates require the approval of the Committee. The regulations place upon the Trustee Board the responsibility for preparing the annual budget for the settlement operation proper and for incurring expenditure. They provide that the High Commissioner shall act as custodian of the Board’s funds, which he will administer within the limits of the available credit. Payments will be made by him on the submission by the Trustee Board of certified warrants. It is understood that the High Commissioner is prepared to place at the disposal of the Trustee Board the personnel necessary to assist it in the performance of its financial functions. The Statute necessary to give legal personality to the Trustee Board will have to be carefully drawn up in consultation with the High Commissioner. It should, inter alia, provide for the rendering by the Board to the Secretary-General, for submission to the Council, of periodical reports on the progress of the settlement scheme, the condition of the Assyrian settlers and, in general, all questions relating to their provisional and final settlement. The precise composition of the Trustee Board will require further consideration, though the Committee thinks that its number should be kept as low as possible, and that it should in any case include the High Commissioner or his representative.— 4 — Having regard to the close liaison necessary between the new body and the High Commissioner as the executive authority of the mandated territories, the Committee recommends that the Board should appoint an expert on settlement questions to collaborate with the officials of the High Commission in the conduct of the settlement operation. * * * In its report of September 12th, 1935, the Committee was able to inform the Council that a number of Assyrians were already being transferred from Iraq to the existing provisional settlement in the upper Khabur in Syria. There are at present in that settlement some 6,000 Assyrians. It is impossible to proceed further with the preparation of final estimates or with the elaboration of definite plans for settlement without accurate knowledge of the total number of Assyrians to be transferred. The Committee has always held the view that the individual consultation of the Assyrians of Iraq with the object of ascertaining the number of those who desire to take advantage of the proposed scheme of settlement in the French mandated territories of the Levant could not well take place until it was clear that a substantial proportion of the funds necessary for the realisation of the scheme would be forthcoming. It feels that this difficulty has how been removed by the offers of contributions made by the Iraqi Government, the mandated territories of the Levant, the United Kingdom Government and the League of Nations itself. 1 he Council Committee therefore considers that the consultation of the Assyrians should take place without further avoidable delay, and it is in communication with the Iraqi Government and the High Commissioner for Syria and the Lebanon with that end in view. It hopes that it may be possible to begin the consultation in the early days of November with the object of having the results available at the beginning of January 1936. I he Committee believes that it has interpreted the wishes of the Council in taking the steps recorded in the present report, and, in particular, those relating to the individual consultation for the purpose of ascertaining the number of Assyrians who may desire to leave Iraq and to the application of 1 million French francs to the preparatory work in the Ghab area, which it was necessary to begin by October 15th at the latest, in order to avoid the dangers to the tranquillity of the Near East which, in the words of the resolution of the Sixth Committee adopted by the Assembly on September 28th, 1935 , any postponement would involve.

CONFIDENTIAL. TTT' 8158 1935 i October 22. 1935. Section 2. [ E 6299/2/93] Record of the Fifty-sixth and Fifty-seventh Meetings of the Assyrian Committee, held at Geneva on October 16, 1935, at 10-30 a.m. and 5 p.m. respectively. —{Received in Foreign Office, October 22.) The President explained to Subih Beg, the new Iraqi representative, who had been invited to the meeting of the previous day, but had been prevented from attending, what had passed at that meeting. The committee then passed to the consideration of the composition and constitution of the proposed Trustee Board. The President asked the United Kingdom representative to explain the views of the sub-committee on this question. The United Kingdom Representative repeated that the sub-committee had felt that the matter lay rather outside its competence and required detailed consideration by the full Council Committee. As regards the composition of the board, the sub-committee had no definite views except that it would be best to keep the number of the members of the board as low as possible. The sub committee had tentatively contemplated a board of three members, and it seemed essential that one of the three should be a representative of the French High Commissioner. As regards the functions of the board, the idea of the sub committee was that in the first stage of the settlement operation, i.e., until the Ghab area was reclaimed, the Trustee Board should exercise general supervision, that it should appoint a settlement expert to collaborate with the French authorities in the actual execution of the settlement operation and that it should fulfil the financial duties laid down in the “ reglement financier” provisionally adopted by the committee at its last meeting. When the Ghab area was reclaimed, the ownership of the reclaimed land destined for the Assyrians should be vested in the Trustee Board, who would be responsible for its ultimate distribution to the Assyrians, the collection from the Assyrians, in the form of a purchase price, of a part of the cost of that settlement and the delivery of title-deeds to the Assyrians when they bad paid this price. A discussion then took place as to whether the board should be limited to three members. The French Representative recalled that the Beirut recommendations had contemplated a four-member board, consisting of— (1) A Council representative; (2) A representative of the High Commissioner; (3) A representative of the Government of Lattakia; (4) A member to be appointed by the Council in agreement with the High Commissioner. The French representative thought it unnecessary that there should be on the Trustee Board now contemplated a representative of the Government of Lattakia. There was general agreement that the board should consist of at least three persons of whom one should be a representative of the High Commissioner; and that another member ought to be M. Cuenod, who is at present the representative of the Council Committee on the local committee in Iraq and who had been thought of as the ultimate Council representative in the mandated territories. The French Representative suggested that the other member might be a representative of the charitable organisations who might subscribe to the scheme. Another suggestion that was made was that some prominent resident in Beirut might be willing to serve. The question of the relationship of the board to the League was next considered. [531 y—2]2 The United Kingdom Representative said that his understanding of the Secretary-General’s views was that while the new board should be autonomous after its constitution, it should be constituted by the Council of the League, and its statutes should be approved by the Council to whom it should furnish periodical reports on the progress of the settlement operation. The President then raised the question of the salaries of the members of the board. Were all the members to be paid, and if so were they to receive an annual salary or be paid a fixed sum for every meeting of the board ? It was agreed, in principle, that M. Cuenod, at all events, ought to receive an annual salary and that the salary of High Commissioner’s representative might be paid, at any rate in part, from the settlement funds. The question of the payment of the third member of the board was left over for further consideration. The method of voting on the board was then raised. Were the decisions of the board to require unanimity or to be by majority, and was this a point for the Council to fix or for the board itself to decide in view of its autonomous status? No definite conclusion was reached on these points, but there was evidently a feeling in the committee that the Council had the right in the statutes of the Board to stipulate that decisions on certain points should require unanimity or should be decided by majority. It was further recognised that there might be subjects on which it would be necessary to guard against the possibility of the High Commissioner’s representative being overruled. The legal section of the Secretariat (represented at the meeting by M. Habicht) was asked to study the question further in the light of the discussion. M. Habicht raised the question whether it was contemplated that the new board should be constituted under the local law in the mandated territories, or whether it should have an international status. He pointed out that there were precedents for both methods. The body set up to organise the Greek refugee settlement had been constituted under the local law of Greece, whereas the Nansen Office had been set up by the League of Nations. The United Kingdom Representative expressed the view that it would no doubt be necessary to give local legal status to the new body in whatever manner the local law might require; and the statutes would require careful consideration by the French High Commission in the light of local law. It seemed essential, however, that primarily that body should be set up by the Council of the League! The French Representative pointed out that had it not been for the fact that the Nansen Office was due to expire in 1938, that office would, no doubt, have been entrusted with the settlement operation. What was wanted, therefore, was something on the lines of the Nansen Office, and he suggested that the legal section should be guided very largely by the manner in which the Nansen Office had been set up. The President suggested that the statutes should be divided into two parts to show clearly the functions which the Trustee Board would have to fulfil in the first four years of the settlement scheme, i.e., until the Ghab reclamation scheme was completed, and the functions which it would have to fulfil after that period in relation to the reclaimed land. He asked the legal section to prepare and circulate draft statutes for subsequent discussions by the committee at its next session which would probably be in January. The President continued that in view of the discussion which had taken place, he was now prepared to accept the “ reglement financier” and the draft report to the Council which had been considered by the committee at its last meeting. On his proposal, those documents were definitely adopted by the committee. It was agreed, however, that their publication and circulation should be suspended out of regard for the Secretary-General until M. Avenol had had an opportunity of reading them. The committee then passed to the consideration of the question of consulting the Assyrians of Iraq as to their desire to take advantage of the proposed scheme! There was general recognition of the fact that it was desirable that this consulta tion should take place as soon as possible, as until the number of Assyrians to be transferred was precisely known it was difficult to make further progress with the preparation of final estimates or the elaboration of definite plans of settlement.3 Major Thomson, who was present at the meeting, expressed the view that it was practicable to begin the consultation at the beginning of November with a fair prospect of having the results ready in the early part of January. In reply to an enquiry by the United Kingdom representative Major Thomson confirmed 0 ^ that, while he no longer thought it desirable or practicable to include all the details of the settlement scheme in a single comprehensive document to be laid before the Assyrians by the local committee in Iraq as he had originally urged, it was desirable that the local committee’s consultation should be on the basis of some document emanating from the Council Committee so as to remove any doubt in the minds of the Assyrians as to the standing of the local committee in this matter. Major Thomson suggested that this document might be in the form of a message to the Assyrians from the Council Committee and he had prepared the draft of such a message. I he United Kingdom Representative said he thought it important that this document, though in the form of a message from the Council Committee, should have the prior concurrence both of the Iraqi Government and of the French High Commissioner. He suggested that the text of the message, if and when approved by the committee, should be sent in the first place to the French High Commissioner and to the Iraqi Government, and that the latter should be asked, if they concurred, and provided the French High Commissioner had also concurred, to publish the document among the Assyrians and to issue the necessary instructions to the local committee to proceed with the consultation. This procedure was agreed to and the draft message was then considered and adopted with minor modifications. A further meeting was held at 5 p.m. The President then referred to a report which had been adopted by the Health Committee of the League, which referred to various questions concerning malaria which might affect the settlement of the Assyrians, and reminded the Council that the Malaria Commission of the Health Organisation would be prepared to give technical assistance if the Council deemed it desirable. The President said that it was perhaps premature for the committee to take cognisance of this report at the present stage, since the report was addressed to the Council and would be discussed by the Council in January. At a later stage, however, the President reserved the right to return to this question. The committee then adopted the texts of notes to the Iraqi Government and to the French High Commissioner, covering the proposed message to the Assyrians. The note to the Iraqi Government asked that Government, provided that it concurred in the terms of the message and that the French High Commissioner had also concurred, to publish it to the Assyrians and issue the necessary instruc tions to the local committee to begin the consultation. The note further asked the Iraqi Government whether they would be prepared to consider an arrange ment for the liquidation of the property of the Assyrians in Iraq whereby the Assyrians would have the option of selling their property to the Iraqi Govern ment at a valuation to be fixed by the local committee, the Assyrians concerned receiving a credit note for the purchase price which would be paid by the Iraqi Government into a special account to be designated later by the Secretary-General of the League. On Major Thomson’s suggestion, it was agreed to add to the message to the Assyrians a paragraph about medical arrangements. The committee then decided to add to its report to the Council a section dealing with the consultation of the Assyrians and a draft of this section was adopted. A draft of instructions to M. Cuenod regarding the consultation of the Assyrians was next considered. These instructions dealt, inter alia, with Assyrians of Persian origin. The committee decided that it could not in any case concern itself with such Assyrians who had come into Iraq since the 14th October, 1933 (the date on which the Council Committee was set up). As regards Persian Assyrians living in Iraq before that date, it entirely reserved it s decision and decided to instruct M. Cuenod that while the local committee mUht draw up lists of such Assyrians if they asked to be included in the settle ment scheme the local committee was to make it cleai that the piepaiation of such lists did not in any way place the Council Committee under any obligation or prejudice its ultimate decision. The drafting of instructions on these lines was left to the Secretariat.4 The Iraqi Representative, at the request of the President, promised to ascertain from the Iraqi Government at what stage they would be prepared to transfer to the League the balance of the contribution of £125,000 originally promised in Yasin Pasha’s letter of the 26th May, 1935. (Of this sum £60,000 was paid by the Iraqi Government in August last.) On the proposal of Mr. Hill, the French Representative undertook to enquire from the French High Commissioner regarding the amount of land which would be made available for sheep grazing on the Jebel Ansariyeh. The meeting then ended on the understanding that the next session would normally be held in the early part of January prior to the Council meeting, but that it would be summoned by the President before then if occasion arose. It was further agreed that if the Secretary-General had observations to make on the committee’s report or on the “ reglement financier,’’ and these observations involved amendments, the President would have discretion to deal with the matter as far as possible by means of individual consultation with the members of the committee, in preference to summoning a formal meeting.

STERNDALE BENNETT. o—^ THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT [E 6298/2/93j Record of the 55th Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held at Geneva on October 15, 1935, at 6 p.m.— [Received in Foreign Office, October 22.) ^President recalled that at the last meeting of the committee on the 27th beptember a sub-committee had been set up to consider the whole question ot the organisation of the settlement scheme in the mandated territories, with particular reference to financial control. He asked the United Kingdom repre sentative to give an account of the proceedings of the sub-committee. 7 Ae United Kingdom Representative said that a clear distinction had been rawn during the discussions in the Assembly between the Ghab reclamation scheme and the settlement operation proper. It was generally agreed that the reclamation scheme should be carried out by the services of the French High Commission in Syria, and as the mandated territories were prepared to accept any residuary liability over and above the present estimated cost of 62 million hrench francs, it was appropriate that financial control should in principle remain with them. The League, however, had a close interest in the progress of the work and a particular financial interest, in view of the fact that the French authorities were prepared to share with the League any savings on the present estimates. Furthermore, the High Commissioner preferred that the contributions of the mandated territories towards the reclamation scheme should be paid into the genera] fund to be collected by the League for the Assyrian settlement scheme as a whole, and that the annual budgets for the reclamation scheme should have the approval of the League. The recommendations of the sub-committee provided for this and also for eventual audit by the League of the accounts for the reclamation scheme in the same way as for those for the settlement operation proper, but, in the case of the reclamation scheme, local financial control, i.e., responsibility for the authorisation of actual expenditure, remained with the French High Commissioner. As regards the settlement operation proper, the recommendations which resulted from the discussions at Beirut in August last between representatives of the Council Committee and the authorities in the mandated territories had envisaged the appointment of a representative of the Council to reside in Beirut and to maintain general liaison between the Council and the French High Commissioner. The same recommendations contemplated that local financial control would remain with the French High Commissioner, and that what might be termed the field work of settlement would be carried out by an Executive Committee, on which there would be a settlement expert nominated' by the Council. This Executive Committee would carry out decisions of the High Commissioner reached in agreement with the Council representative in Beirut. Furthermore, the recommendations contemplated the ultimate establishment of a Trustee Committee, in which the ownership of the land reclaimed in the Ghab area would be vested pending its ultimate disposal to the Assyrians on the payment by them of a portion of the settlement costs. This Trustee Committee would have the task of collecting the repayments from the Assyrians, allotting land to them and finally handing over to them the title-deeds. Since the Beirut recommendations were made a good deal had happened which necessitated departure from those recommendations. Financial control had assumed a new importance in view of the fact that the cost of settlement could still not be precisely estimated, while funds were known to be limited. The High Commissioner was still ready to offer the fullest co-operation of his services in the execution of the settlement scheme, and in particular he was prepared to assume entire executive control in matters relating to health and education. As regards finance, however, he was no longer prepared, in view of the circumstances referred to above and the international origin of the funds, to take over responsibilitv for EASTERN (Iraq) October 22, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [531 y 1]2 controlling expenditure. It was his wish that this responsibility should be assumed by the League, acting through the proposed Council representative at Beirut. This seemed appropriate seeing that the League was the guardian of funds contributed from several sources and was itself making a substantial contribution. Against this, however, it had been suggested that the report of the Supervisory Commission of the 25th September precluded the League from further participation in the scheme, except in an advisory capacity, and in particular it had been urged by the Secretary-General that the appointment of a repre sentative of the Council to exercise financial functions in Beirut would give rise to constitutional difficulties within the League, and would be open to particular objection from the legal point of view as it would involve the possibility of the League or its representatives being sued or having to sue in the mandated territories. The sub-committee was faced with the fact that under the existing “ reglement financier,” which governed the provisional settlement on the Khabur, the League was already exercising a considerable degree of financial control. Under that “ reglement ” estimates required League approval, the League was the custodian of the funds and issued them to the High Commissioner as and when required, and the eventual audit was in the hands of the League. The sub committee had felt that the Supervisory Commission’s report could not be taken to mean that the League should renounce the control which it already exercised. That control seemed to follow naturally from the part which the League had already played in the elaboration of the scheme of settlement, and its continuance seemed to be in the best interests of the League with a view to avoiding, as far as possible, an ultimate deficit and a recurrence of the question of responsibility for filling it. On the other hand, the sub-committee recognised the force of the Secretary-General’s objections to the appointment of a representative in Beirut to exercise additional financial control locally. The Secretary-General had proposed that an autonomous body with legal personality should be set up by the Council in the mandated territories to exercise this control and, in collaboration with the High Commissioner, to carry out the settlement operation. The sub committee had considered the best solution to be to advance the date of the constitution of the Trustee Committee contemplated in the Beirut recom mendations. The composition of that body and the contents of the statute required to give it personality were matters which would need careful consideration, and lay somewhat outside the competence of the sub-committee. But the financial functions of the new body, which it was proposed should he called the Assyrian Settlement Trustee Board, had been worked out in detail in the revised “ reglement financier,” which was now submitted for the consideration of the committee as a whole. The sub-committee had further drawn up an explanatory note in the shape of a draft report from the Council Committee to the Council. The United Kingdom representative explained that, while the “ reglement ” and the draft report to the Council had been drawn up with every desire to meet what were understood to be the Secretary-General’s views, the documents had not yet been seen by M. Avenol himself owing to his absence from Geneva. The United Kingdom representative therefore suggested that the committee should, if it adopted the documents, suspend their publication and circulation to the Council until M. Avenol had seen them and had had an opportunity of making observations, which, of course, the committee would always be ready to consider. The “ reglement” and the draft report were then read and considered in detail. When this was concluded the President said that he would personally prefer, before giving his final assent to them, to have a discussion on the composition and constitution of the proposed Trustee Board. He suggested that this discussion should take place on the following day. In the meantime the “ reglement ” and the draft report could be considered as provisionally adopted. J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT.

IT was found that the existing settlements of Tkhuma, Upper Tiari and Diz on the Khabur were capable of very large expansion without the provision of further pumps, “ naurs,' &amp;c., and that consequently it was far more economical to send as many of these tribes as possible. This policy was followed therefore, and mainly owing to this economy it was found possible to persuade the French authorities to accept 2,301 instead of the originally agreed 1,800. A further 300 are also to be crossed during the winter, being people who have remained behind with animals until climatic conditions permit their being walked across. This will clear all Tkhuma and Upper Tiari villages in the Qadhas of Dohuk and Amadia. There are no Diz villages. The details by tribes of those sent across is as follows Tkhuma 876 Serra 20 Tal (Tkhuma) 100 Nodis 4 Upper Tiari 968 Barwar 7 Jilu ... 92 Khananis 7 Shemzdin 73 Baz ... 28 Gawar 15 Lewan 4 Diz ... 42 Marbisho 46 2.301 Qochanis 19 is understood that on arrival at Hassicha it was discovered twenty people registered as Tkhuma were not in fact Tkhuma, though they had been certified as such by the heads of the Tkhuma in Mosul. From the beginning it was announced that no one, not even members of the three selected tribes, should come from Bagdad, Kirkuk or other outlying stations unless they had actually been summoned by the committee. Despite this order, which was circulated through several channels, including Bishop Yusuf (who happened to be in Bagdad) and the levies, Qasha Yukhana, the notorious agitator in Mosul, contrived to persuade many Tkhuma from Bagdad to proceed to Mosul at their own expense. A number of these gave up good appointments to come, and as it was found impossible to include them on the lists for emigration, they now find themselves facing the winter without employment. Qasha Yukhana also produced a list of “ destitutes ” of Mosul for emigra tion, and informed them they would all be included on the list for emigration. [531 g—1]It was found possible to include about 100 out of 160 of these people, and it was also discovered that the Qasha had induced people in employment in Mosul to resign. It was clear from the baggage of the Mosul emigrants that they were in a very much better financial condition than those from the villages. Qasha Yukhana and his family left Mosul for Syria on the seventh convoy. Forty-five levies (Upper Tiari and Tkhuma) and 209 of their dependants proceeded to Mosul at their own expense and were emigrated in the third convoy.

HIS Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Bagdad presents his compliments to His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and has the honour to transmit to him copy of a note dated the 28th September to the Iraqi Prime Minister and of his reply dated the 2nd October respecting the Assyrian settlement. Bagdad, October 2, 1935. Enclosure 1. Mr. Bateman to Iraqi Prime Minister. (No. 485. Private and Confidential.) My dear Prime Minister. Bagdad, September 28, 1935. IN accordance with a recent request made by your Excellency, I have pleasure in placing on record my understanding of the conclusions reached in regard to the financial aspect of the Assyrian question as a result of our recent discussions on this subject. 2. Your Excellency will remember that, on the 10th September, the United Kingdom representative on the Assyrian Committee at Geneva made an announce ment concerning the willingness of His Majesty’s Government to contribute, towards a satisfactory scheme of settlement, a sum equivalent to five-twelfths of the amount to be found by the Assyrian Committee of the League, subject to the consent of Parliament and provided that the British contribution should not exceed £250,000. 3. I informed your Excellency of this declaration and, on the 17th September, read urgent messages from His Majesty’s Government indicating that, in order to allow of a favourable vote being taken by the Assembly on the question of a contribution from the League of Nations, it was essential that an immediate decision should be taken by the Iraqi Government to double unconditionally the contribution of £125,000 which they had already offered. Failing this, it was generally feared that the last hope of solving this difficult problem would be wrecked. 4. As a result of further consideration, your Excellency agreed that the Iraqi contribution should be raised to a maximum of £250,000 on precisely the same conditions as the corresponding contribution promised by His Majesty’s Government, and the necessary instructions were sent to his Excellency Nuri Pasha at Geneva. It was clearly understood that this involved an additional contri bution from the Iraqi Government of £125.000 new money, which will not be subject to any deductions in respect of money already spent on the Assyrians by the Iraqi Government since 1933, or in respect of transport expenses within Iraq. The Iraqi Government also agreed to abandon the condition that their contribution should be made on the basis of an expenditure not exceeding £10 per head. 5. I now note with pleasure that his Excellency Nuri Pasha addressed a letter of the 26th September to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations in the following terms :—- “ In conformity with my promise made to the Fourth Committee at its meeting on the 20th September, I have now the honour to inform you that my Government, in order to procure a final and definite solution of the Assyrian question, accept the conditions laid down by the United Kingdom, in so far as those conditions apply to Iraq, in Sir Samuel Hoare’s letter of the 12th September, 1935. [531 h—1]2 “ It follows that the Iraqi Government will recommend Parliament to authorise it to raise, jpari passu with the United Kingdom contribution, the contribution which it has already promised towards the proposed scheme of settlement of the Assyrians in Syria, so as to pay to the League for this purpose a sum amounting to five-twelfths of that part of the expense of the scheme which the Council Committee may be called upon to cover up to a 'N - maximum of £250,000.” 6. I have also noted the personal assurance given to me by your Excellency on the 21st September that no difficulty need be anticipated concerning the approval of the Iraqi Parliament to the additional contribution or the conditions on which it will be made. 7. Your Excellency will, of course, appreciate that this question is one between the Government of Iraq and the League of Nations, who are the responsible authority. His Majesty's Government have, nevertheless, entered into the discussions, in view of the interest which they share with the Iraqi Government in ensuring that everything possible should be done to bring about an early settlement of this difficult question. They have noted the understanding reached with the Government of Iraq, since they themselves are making a contri bution similar to, and conditional on, the contribution of the Iraqi Government. 8. Your Excellency will, I am sure, agree that the above sets out the present position accurately. Yours very sincerely, C. H. BATEMAN. Enclosure 2. Iraqi Prime Minister to Mr. Bateman.

[E 6043/2/93] Record of the Fifty-Fourth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held at Geneva on September 27, 1935, at 4 p.m. THE meeting was attended for the first time by the representative of Ecuador, who has been chosen to replace the representative of Mexico following the replacement of Mexico by Ecuador on the Council. The President said that the object of the meeting was to exchange views on the procedure to be followed now that it was practically certain that a League contribution of 1,300,000 Swiss francs would be voted by the Assembly. There still remained a gap to be filled of 13,500,000 French francs. It was necessary to consider how to fill this gap and to decide whether the preparatory work in the Gharb area should be begun before the means of filling the gap had been worked out. As the figure of 13,500,000 French francs had been arrived at in discussions between the United Kingdom and French Governments, he would ask the United Kingdom representative whether he had any suggestions to make as to how this gap should be filled. The United Kingdom Representative said that for the moment he had no suggestions. In view of the substantial amount which seemed likely to be forth coming from the United Kingdom Government, Iraq and the League, it was possible that the authorities in the mandated territories of the Levant might be willing to reconsider the possibilities of raising the necessary credit, but the committee might consider whether there was any other way of raising the money. He thought that it would be useful to have the views of the League Treasury on this point, and also to know whether there were any other assets which the authorities of the mandated territories were disposed to make available as security for a credit, additional to Assyrian reimbursements. He felt it would be out of place for him to make any suggestions on this latter point, which was clearly one for the authorities of the mandated territories to consider in the first instance. As to the remainder of the work before the committee, the United Kingdom representative pointed out that the LTnited Kingdom offer had been subject to certain conditions. Two of these conditions seemed likely to be fulfilled, i.e., the contributions of Iraq and of the League. But there were certain general conditions that still remained to be satisfied. The United Kingdom Government has stipulated that the scheme must be satisfactory in itself, and in particular that a proper scheme of financial control should be worked out. They had also stipulated that there must be a reasonable assurance that the necessary funds would be forthcoming to ensure the completion of the whole scheme. The question of financial control turned on the kind of organisation which was to be set up, and this seemed to be a matter on which the committee ought soon to take a decision. When the nature of the machinery had been agreed upon, financial regulations would be easier to draft. The condition about the reasonable probability of sufficient funds being available would depend upon the manner in which it was proposed to fill the gap of 13,500,000 French francs and upon the response of private charitable organisations. There was the further point about the consultation of the Assyrians. At what stage was this to take place? Whenever it did take place it would be necessary for the committee in the first place to draw up a detailed document showing the Assyrians precisely what conditions they would enjoy if they went to Syria. The French Representative said that,,as regards the filling of the gap of 13,500,000 French francs, the authorities of the French mandated territories were prepared to consider any plan which might be suggested, but were not prepared to put one forward themselves. They had already made their maximum offer. In the first place, they had offered 22 million francs, and subsequently they had added an additional 6,500,000 fr., towards an estimated gap of 20 million francs. [531 a—1]2 they had made this additional offer in the hope that the United Kingdom and Iraqi Governments would be prepared to fill the remaining two-thirds of the gap. M. Panafieu pointed out that the authorities of the mandated territories could not accept any further financial liability over and above what they had already offered. The President expressed the view that, if the United Kingdom. Iraqi and I rench Governments were not prepared to go further, the money must somehow be found elsewhere, and it seemed desirable to explore in the first place how far it could be raised from private sources. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that the United Kingdom and Iraqi offers were conditional upon parliamentary sanction, and this necessarily involved some delay. Furthermore, if an appeal to private organisa- tl0 “e to be successful he was advised that a very carefully planned campaign would be necessary, and this would also take time. The'main point at the moment, however, seemed to be that preparatory work in the Gharb area must begin during the coming month unless there was to be a delay of a year. Were the I rench authorities prepared to begin this work forthwith' in the light of the financial offers which had been made ? The French Representative said that recent discussions had drawn a clear dividing line between the preliminary operation of drainage and irrigation and the ultimate operation of settlement. The work which had to be done this year concerned the preliminary operation, and it concerned works which were necessary for the completion of the Gharb scheme whether the Assyrians were ultimately settled there or not. He thought it possible, therefore, that the French authorities might be willing to start work on that part of the scheme provided that the funds required this year for that part were forthcoming without waiting foi the funds for the ultimate resettlement of the Assyrians to be assured in full. The President said that it would be a great advantage if this work could be proceeded with without waiting for the completion of discussions as to how to fill the gap of 13,500 000 French francs. I his latter problem and the others which lad been alluded to by the United Kingdom representative could then be discussed at leisure. He raised the point whether it was necessary to have the sanction of the Council before proceeding. M Arocha said that it would be necessary to consult the League Treasury m the first place, but, subject to their observations, he thought that it was not necessary for the committee to obtain authority from the Council, though it might perhaps be advisable for it to do so if the opportunity presented itself. The President then raised the question of a special appeal to private organisations. He recalled that an appeal had already been made but it was perhaps unlikely that there would be any response to'it except in the United ingdom, and he wondered whether it would be advisable to send a special anneal to organisations m the United Kingdom. P appeal r ru ^he United Kingdom Representative deprecated any such special anneal the Lmted Kingdom Government had not so far taken any special^teps touring the matter to the notice of private organisations in the United Kingdom, as they felt that it was desirable to postpone such action until their own offer had been announced He felt sure, however, that such action as the United Kingdom Government could take m this sense would now be taken. But, although he fkd not wish to rake up past history once more, he felt that, in the light of all that had been said m the past tew days, a special appeal to private organisations in the United Kingdom would be misunderstood and resented in certain It .mght not have at all the desired effect. In any c^ he dnf n^ acfept the view that money could not be raised from other countries He felt iw attempt ought to he made, for instance, to collect money in America and netLn’ the Secretariat could advise how this might best be done. Furthermore there Assyrians. 0US mte ™ atl0na! ° r g“i S ations which might be interested in the tt The Danish Representative agreed. He deprecated any special anneal to the hnited Kingdom. He reca led that Professor Keller’s organ,sationTad at an earlier stage shown great interest in this matter and might be able to help, re mi if e °^ ei similar institutions to be approached. In any case, he felt ,^ mUC P 01 , 6 wanted from the committee itself than a mere written appeal ri^ ought to be carefully prepared and personal contact established with likely sources of contributions. tt •+ a V • 1PS , l( ^ eni expressed agreement with the views put forward bv the ni iu n i m anc ^ representatives. As regards Professor Keller, he ^ ou . c 1 e .^° know more about him before getting into touch with him again. e nad derived the impression at an earlier stage that his influence was perhaps not as great as it appeared to be. He thought, however, that the whole question ot obtaining funds from private sources should be carefully considered bv the secretariat and discussed by the committee at a future meeting. Mr. Hill said that steps had already been taken by the Secretariat to approach the Rockefeller Foundation. The suggestion had been made, and he ought it should be made in any appeal to private organisations, that the plan was likely to break down unless help were forthcoming. The French Representative suggested that it would be advisable, in pi esenting the matter, not to lay stress on the fact that the money still required was needed m connexion with public works. The public works scheme was, in tact an essential part of the whole settlement operation, and the money was really necessary to enable the settlement operation as a whole to be put into effect. 7 he President then raised the question of the procedure to be followed in discussing the organisation of the scheme in the mandated territories and the hnancial regulations which would be necessary. rh f French Representative said that he did not at present know the views oi jM. de Martel on these questions, which were obviously delicate ones. The United Kingdom Representative having been invited by the president to expiess his views, said that he appreciated the delicacy of the questions, and he would like to make it clear at once that the United Kingdom suggestion that thei e should be a separation of functions, and that, in the case of the settlement operation proper, entire financial control should be assumed by the organisation to be set up by the League to administer it, implied no lack of confidence in the services of the High Commission. The close co-operation of those services would be not only valuable, but essential. The United Kingdom delegation had merely been acting on a financial principle—that effective control of the finances of a scheme of this sort should be in the hands of those who held in trust money contributed from many sources. They had felt that it was not altogether fair to place upon the French authorities a responsibility which should belong to the League as custodian of the funds. The draft reglement financier gave the League a certain measure of control, i.e., the estimates had to be approved and the budget ultimately audited by the League; but, briefly, the British criticism of the reglement was that it did not give the League effective control over day-to-day expenditure, and the fact had to be faced that M. Burnier, who would have executive authority in the matter of settlement, had sometimes been •criticised in the past for a certain disregard of economy. The United Kingdom representative was not yet in a position to put forward definite proposals regarding the local organisation of the scheme. ‘ This needed careful considera tion in the light of what had passed in the last few days. Prima facie the proposals made in the reports on the Beirut discussions might be taken as a basis but he thought that the United Kingdom Government might wish to suggest that the representative of the League should be more closely associated with the executive work and should have a closer financial control. The French Representative said that of course the French authorities wished to have absolute control over the public works. The settlement of the Assvrians however, was an entirely different matter, and he felt sure that they were ready to give all control to the League. The question of control had been placed before the Supervisory Committee, but unfortunately the Supervisorv Committee hml made no definite pronouncement about it. M. A rocha said that he thought he would be interpreting the wishes of the Secretary-General in saying that League control must be limited, seeino- that the financial participation in the League was limited.4 The President said that the question was obviously a complicated one, which could best be discussed in a small sub-committee. On his proposal it was agreed that a sub-committee, consisting of the United Kingdom and French repre sentatives and a representative of the League Treasury, should consider the whole question of organisation and financial control, and in due course present a report to the committee as a whole. The United Kingdom Representative said that this led him to raise the question of the position of Iraq. Iraq was now going to be a substantial contributor, and he thought the time had come to associate the Iraqi repre sentative much more closely with the work of the committee. The Iraqi Government were naturally very closely concerned with the details of organisation and would now be closely interested in the question of financial control. The President entirely agreed, and said that, while there might be meetings at which it would be better not to ask the Iraqi representative to attend, he thought that as general rule the Iraqi representative ought now to be asked to attend each meeting, and should collaborate to the utmost extent in the work of the committee. The Iraqi representative could not actually be a member of the committee without a decision to this effect by the Council, but he thought that the proceedings of the Council themselves provided a precedent, as when a question was being discussed which concerned a State not a member of the Council, that State was usually invited to take part in the proceedings. The next question discussed was the consultation of the Assyrians. The president mentioned in this connexion that Nuri Pasha had informed him that there was now a campaign being carried on among certain sections of the Assyrians against leaving Iraq. M. A rocha said that long and complicated instructions to the local authority would be necessary, and he understood that some members of the local committee thought it better to leave the consultation until the beginning of the New Year. There would, therefore, be plenty of time in which to draw up the instructions. The United Kingdom Representative said that he must reserve his views on the point as to whether the consultation should take place at the earliest possible moment, i.e., this autumn, or should be postponed until the New Year. He thought that this was a matter on which the committee should be guided to a very large extent by the Iraqi Government. Also the views of Major Thomson, the president of the local committee, were not yet known. He thought he might be able to find out privately what Major Thomson’s views were. M. Arocha recalled that, in the note which the committee had drawn up for the guidance of the Sixth and Fourth Committees, mention was made of the possibility of certain reductions and adjustments in the estimates. A step which the committee must now take was to ask the High Commissioner of the mandated territories for his consent to the proposed modifications. A long and somewhat confused discussion followed on the question of procedure. It was agreed that the immediate question was to ensure the commencement of the preliminary work in the Gharb so as to avoid a year’s delay in putting the plan into operation. The question was whether 1 million French francs could be placed at the disposal of the French authorities for this purpose. M. Arocha pointed out that sufficient funds were, in fact, at the disposal of the committee in a bank in Syria, but these funds were earmarked for use in connexion with the settlement in the Khabur of those Assyrians who had been recently transferred. He did not know whether the Iraqi Government, who had provided these funds for this purpose, would be prepared to authorise the use of them for anothei purpose, and in any case, even if the Iraqi Government agreed, the League would be taking a certain responsibility in authorising that the funds should be diverted from their original purpose. If by any chance the scheme broke down, the responsibility of the League might be a serious one. It was agreed that in the first place the president should approach Nuri Pasha as to his willingness to allow the funds which had been advanced by the Iraqi Government to be used for the preparatory work in the Gharb. If Nuri Pasha concurred, the question would be further discussed with the League Treasury. 8 Foreign Office, October 1, 1935. J. C.

WI1H reference to my telegram No. 219 of the 5th September, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith an extract from the August report of His Majesty’s acting consul at Mosul concerning the exodus of Assyrians to the Khabour between the 1st and 8th September. 2. In paragraph 138 of his report Mr. Wiltshire confirms what the officer commanding the levies told me at the time when his forty-five soldiers and their dependents were preparing to leave Bagdad for Mosul. 3. It appears that a number of their friends persuaded themselves, despite the warnings and entreaties of both their own leaders and the British officers in the levies, that their chance of leaving Iraq had arrived. They threw up their employment and chartered lorries, at their own expense, to take them to Mosul, where they hoped to attach themselves to one or other of the convoys mentioned in Mr. Wiltshire’s report. 4. It is possible that these people may become destitute in Mosul this winter. If this should be the case, they are deserving of no sympathy. I have, &amp;e. C. H. BATEMAN. Enclosure. Extract from Mosul and Diana Report No. 9 for August and the First Week of September 1935. (A )—Political A ssyrians. 137. By mid-September 1,800 Assyrians will have been transported from Mosul to the Khabour. The first convoy, on the 1st September, contained 303 Assyrians; the second, on the 3rd ^September, 194; the third, on the 6th September, 333 Assyrians; and the fourth, on the 8th September, 306. Nearly all of these are of the three tribes, Diz, Tokhuma and E T pper Tayari; but, owing to the readiness of Assyrians to perjure themselves, a certain number of men or families from other tribes have been transported to Syria under false pretences, including some Persian Assyrians from Urumieh, and even one Tel Kaifi (Chaldean) family. It was harder to check the claims of applicants from among the medley of Mosul Assyrians than in the villages. The three selected tribes were but poorly represented in the Diana-Harir area, not more than about half a dozen houses being eligible; the others showed acute disappointment at being left in Iraq. These few families went in the second convoy. Forty-five levies from Bagdad went with the third; they were mostly the oldest and least useful men, and one fell out of the lorry on the way to Mosul, but escaped serious injury through being drunk. 138. A number of Assyrians have*come to Mosul from Bagdad without authorisation, some of them having given up good jobs in the capital. They will probably sit about Mosul all this winter. 139. In October the cattle of those Assyrians of the Dohuk and Amadia qadhas now being transported will be sent across on foot to the Khabour. with some forty single Assyrians as shepherds. If and when money is found for the Ghab settlement scheme, those of the other tribes who wish to go will be [506 z—1]2 settled there this autumn or next spring, and only then will the Khabour settlers be transferred to the Orontes. ****** 141. Most Assyrians now leaving Iraq have been unable to dispose of their rifles privately, since nearly all of them have Government licences for their rifles. Few Kurds have such licences, and none has been willing officially to buy a rifle; an Assyrian found to have disposed of a registered rifle unofficially is liable to be imprisoned, unless he claims to have given it in during the 1933 disturbances. Some Assyrians in Syria have written to friends still in Mosul telling them not to give in their rifles to the Government, but to smuggle them in their bedding into Syria, where, they say, inspection is lax; in fact, rumour says that 200 have already been so smuggled! Whatever the truth may be of these letters (and the idea is scouted m official quarters), they may have a certain propaganda effect in inducing future Assyrians to try to smuggle rifles into Syria. The Iraq Government is paying only H dinars for each rifle. Some 150 rifles were handed in by the first three convoys. 142. The following is a copy of the newly printed declaration form which all Assyrians leaving the country in the future will be required to sign (those who have already been transported before the preparation of this form made a verbal declaration to the same effect when signing on) :— Societe des Nations.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, September 23, 1935. Enclosure. Record of the Fifty-third Meeting of the Assyrian Committee of the Council, held at Geneva on September 18 at 10-30 p.m. THE committee met to consider in detail a note which had been prepared on the reports of the French High Commission, and of Mr. Hill and M. Cuenod as a result of the Beirut conversations in August. The president said that, before proceeding to the examination of this note, he felt bound to acquaint the committee with a communication made to him orally by Dr. Rajchman. Dr. Rajchman was apparently much perturbed by the prevalence of malaria in the region to which it was proposed to send the Assyrians, and he had suggested that, before the plan was proceeded with, a detailed study of the measures to be taken to combat malaria should be made by the Health Section of the League. . Mr. Hill said that the High Commission had given particular attention to this point and had been much preoccupied by the responsibility of putting forward the scheme in view of the situation as regards malaria. It was impressed with its responsibilities not only to the Assyrians themselves but to the neighbouring populations. The medical service of the High Commission had therefore made very extensive provision for meeting the danger and, he might add, at an extremely low cost to the Council Committee. The general feeling of the meeting was that in view of the care with which the French authorities had evidently gone into this question and of the measures which they had taken, it was unnecessary and inopportune to postpone the scheme for a further detailed study by the Health Organisation of the League. The committee then passed to the consideration of the note on the financial aspect of the scheme of settlement. This note was eventually appro\ed in the form circulated in document A.VI/5/1935 of the 18th September, 1935.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit the record of the 52nd meeting of the Council Committee, respecting the Assyrian question. Geneva, September 16, 1935. Enclosure. Record of the Fifty-second Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held in Geneva on September 10, 1935, at 6 -45 p.m. THE President said that the committee had to consider both the results of the discussions which had recently taken place in Beirut between Mr. Hill and M. Cuenod, on behalf of the committee and the authorities of the mandated territories, and the replies to the appeals for funds which the committee had made in July last. . The results of the Beirut conversations had been embodied in extensive reports which would have to be studied in great detail, and at the present meeting the president proposed to deal solely with the major question of finance. Ihe five replies so far received to the general appeal for funds had been negative. The Iraqi Government had replied to the separate appeal addressed to them m an inconclusive manner. The special appeal to the United Kingdom Government was still without reply, but he understood that the United Kingdom delegate was now in a position to make a statement on the question, and he would ask him to do so forthwith. The United Kingdom Representative recalled that the special appeal addressed to the United Kingdom Government on the 13th July, on behalf of all the members of the committee other than himself, had asked for the reeonsideia- tion on purely practical grounds of the previous decision of the United Kingdom Government that, while willing to pay their share of a League contribution, they could not contemplate any independent payment. The Lnited Kingdom Govern ment were only too well aware of the difficulties of financing the proposed settle ment scheme, and they had considered the president s appeal with eveiy desne to do their utmost to facilitate a solution of the question. The United Kingdom Government still adhered to their view that, apart from the conti ibution of the Iraqi Government and of the Assyrians themselves, the financing of Assyrian settlement should be a collective responsibility on the part of the League as a whole, and their offer to bear their share of the League contribution, which they still believed to be indispensable, still stood; but, in addition, the U nited Kingdom Government were now prepared, under certain conditions, to lecommend Parlia ment to sanction an independent contribution. Their change of attitude was based on purely practical grounds, and was, of course, without prejudice to the question of responsibility, on which the views of His Majesty’s Government remained unchanged. His Majesty’s Government were, in fact, most anxious that the efforts made by the committee, and the considerable personal eftoit ol the president himself, should not end in failure; and if failure was to be avoided, they were convinced that all concerned must take a large and geneiqus view, leaving aside theoretical discussion and bringing to beai the maximum of practical co-operation. x , The conditions on which the United Kingdom Government were prepared to contemplate an independent contribution were, in general, that the scheme of settlement ultimately elaborated should be satisfactory from the material point [506 s—112 of view, and financially well regulated, and that there should be a reasonable probability that the funds forthcoming from other sources, when combined with the independent contribution from the United Kingdom, would be sufficient to ensure the success of such a scheme. Furthermore, the contribution of the United Kingdom Government must depend upon what the Iraqi Government were prepared to pay and on the readiness of the League to provide whatever balance might remain to be found after the contributions from all independent sources had been taken into account. There were still so many uncertain factors that it was difficult to speak of precise figures, and with a view to removing some of the uncertainties and reducing the problem to practical proportions before replying to M. Olivan’s appeal, the United Kingdom Government had recently engaged in informal discussions with the French and Iraqi Governments. The United Kingdom representative then acquainted the committee with the results of these discussions, as set out in the attached record, which had been previously agreed upon with the French representative. The United Kingdom representative also informed the committee that the United Kingdom Government had approached the Iraqi Government and urged them to double the contribution of £125,000 which they had already offered. So far, however, they were unaware what view the Iraqi Government would take, and it was unlikely that there would be any progress in this direction until the arrival in Geneva of Yasin Pasha, the Iraqi Prime Minister, on the 15th September. In these circumstances the United Kingdom delegation had not felt it possible to delay any longer in acquainting the Assyrian Committee with the attitude which His Majesty’s Government were prepared, in principle, to take up in reply to M. Olivan’s appeal. They hoped that the measure in which they were prepared to respond to that appeal would enable further immediate progress to be made in the elaboration of a settlement scheme in which time was an important element. Furthermore, an essential part of the proposal of the United Kingdom was the financial participation of the League. When this question was raised previously —namely, in January 1934—the Council had taken the view that only the Assembly could take a decision regarding the financial participation of the League, and if the question was to be decided by the present Assembly, there was clearly no time to be lost. In these circumstances the United Kingdom represen tative had been authorised to inform the committee at once that, if the conditions to which he had already referred were fulfilled, and provided, in particular, that the Iraqi Government would contribute at least an equal amount to the proposed scheme of settlement in the mandated territories of the Levant, the United Kingdom Government would be prepared to ask Parliament to authorise an independent contribution by the United Kingdom equivalent to five-twelfths of that part of the expenses of the scheme which the Assyrian Committee might be called upon to find, but subject to the proviso that such contribution by the United Kingdom Government should in no circumstances exceed £250,000. To prevent any misunderstanding, the United Kingdom representative said that he wished to make it clear that this involved the willingness of the Iraqi Government to double the cash contribution of £125,000 which they had alreadv offered towards the proposed scheme of settlement in Syria. The Iraqi Govern ment were prone to use the argument that they had already been involved in considerable expense in connexion with the Assyrians within Iraq since the troubles of August 1933, and to claim that these expenses should be counted as part of their contribution. It was necessary to make it clear to the Iraqi Government that if this question were to be solved, the contribution of the Iraqi Government must be new money. The President said that the committee would wish to take note of the offer made by the United Kingdom Government, and to thank the United Kingdom representative for his statement of the position. The committee would also wish to thank the French Government for the attitude which they had taken up in the informal discussions of which the United Kingdom representative had just acquainted the committee. The committee then discussed procedure. It was realised that as the offer of the United Kingdom Government involved a contribution by the League, the question would have to go before the Assembly. The sooner, therefore, it could be submitted to the Council for reference to the Assembly the better, and it was3 'Vf agreed that without waiting to enter upon the detailed consideration of the results o the Beirut discussions, a report to the Council should be drawn up on the question or finance, with special reference to the possibility of a League contribution. ° The general lines of a report to the Council were then discussed. (A report 4ft on these lines was subsequently drawn up and approved by the committee at an informal meeting on the following day.) 7 President asked at what moment the United Kingdom contribution would be available, assuming the conditions attached to it to be fulfilled. The United Kingdom delegate said that he was not in a position to answer this question. It was to be hoped that the conditions would be fulfilled during the course °f the present Assembly, i.e., that a satisfactory detailed scheme would he worked out and that the Iraqi Government and the League would agree to do what was incumbent upon each of them under the British proposals. But assuming this to be done, the question of when the United Kingdom contribution could be made available depended on parliamentary procedure. The United ingdom i epresentative promised to obtain such details as might be possible on this point. J. C. STERNDALE BENNETT. Annex. Note on Informal Discussions which have taken place at Geneva between United Kingdom, and French representatives concerning the Financing of the Scheme for Assyrian Settlement in the French Mandated Territories of the Levant. THE United Kingdom and French representatives agreed to discuss this question without commitment on either side at this stage, but with the object of discovering a practicable and mutually satisfactory solution which might be proposed to the Assyrian Committee. The United Kingdom representatives stated their view that it was impracticable for the Assyrian Committee to raise the sum of approximately 70 million French francs (30 million for settlement and 40 million out of 62 million for the Gharb draining and irrigation scheme) contemplated in the estimates contained in the report by the French High Commission in Syria which has been prepared as a result of the recent discussion in Beirut between representatives of the High Commission and of the Assyrian Committee. The United Kingdom representatives, with all reservation as to whether the Assyrian Committee would be able to raise as much as 45 million francs, thought that this represented the maximum that the committee could reasonably be expected to raise. They asked the French representatives, taking into account the benefits which the' Gharb scheme might ultimately be expected to bring to the mandated territories, to consider the possibility of an arrangement which would limit the liability of the committee to 45 million francs. They proposed that the operation of the preliminary drainage and irrigation of the Gharb plain should be separated from that of the actual settlement of the Assyrians, the Assyrian Committee assuming entire responsibility for the latter operation, and the French authorities assuming entire responsibility for the former subject to a fixed contribution to it from the Assyrian Committee and subject to a first charge up to an agreed amount upon Assyrian reimbursements. As the cost of the settlement operation appeared likely to be, according to the results of the Beirut conversations, 30 million francs, the United Kingdom representatives suggested that the contribution of the Assyrian Committee to the drainage and irrigation scheme should be limited to 15 million francs. The French representatives, while willing to consider this suggestion, pointed out that it would involve the mandated territories in a hitherto unforeseen expense of 25 million francs apart from 22 million francs already promised by the State of Lattakia; and that eventual Assyrian reimbursements on the scale contemplated during the Beirut conversations would be insufficient to cover this extra expense.4 After consideration, the French representatives put forward the following counter-suggestion. They cited certain factors and suggested the possibility of certain adjustments which would in their opinion reduce the cost of settlement proper by 5 million francs. They considered that the estimate of 30 million francs for settlement could thus safely be written down to 25 million francs, and they suggested that the Assyrian Committee’s fixed contribution to the drainage and irrigation scheme might be correspondingly raised from 15 to 20 million francs without affecting the principle that the committee’s contribu tion to the whole operation should be limited to 45 million francs. If this suggestion were adopted there would remain 20 million francs to find for the drainage and irrigation scheme. The French representatives declared that the State of Lattakia was not in a position to pay this sum and that it could only be raised by means of a credit operation. It was recognised on both sides that Assyrian reimbursements were too uncertain a factor to render them an adequate security for such an operation as a commercial proposition. It was further recognised that the League was unlikely to be able either itself to advance the money or,'on the basis of Assyrian reimbursements only, to obtain the necessary credit. The French representatives stated that the mandated territories were prepared to pay 6,500,000 fr. towards the sum required, of which 5 million only might be on a recoverable basis; but it would be necessary to look elsewhere for the remaining 13,500,000 fr., and the only suggestion which the French repre sentatives could make was that some philanthropic organisation might be willing to advance the money. The United Kingdom representatives, while expressing their appreciation of this effort to fill the gap, urged that further consideration should be given to the possibility of the whole of the necessary credit of 20 million francs being obtained by the mandated territories. They pointed out that if the Gharb scheme were realised, a community would be established there which in a comparatively short space of time would be in a position to pay taxes. They asked the French representatives to take into account this eventual tax yield as well as the Assyrian reimbursements contemplated during the Beirut conversations. The French representatives have reconsidered the position on this basis, but. in spite of every desire to reach a solution, are unable to depart from their view that it is materially impossible for the mandated territories to do more than indicated above. They pointed out also that, if the figure of 62 million francs were exceeded in practice, the excess liability would fall entirely on the mandated territories. The United Kingdom and French representatives were accordingly obliged to recognise that they could see no way of raising the credit for 13,560.000 fr. which, assuming that the Assyrian Committee can, in fact, raise 45 million francs in cash, is the only obstacle to the elaboration of a plan on the lines suggested by the United Kingdom representatives. They agreed that they could only report the position to their respective Governments. It may be pointed out that, assuming the contribution of 20 million francs at the outset by the Assyrian Committee towards the work of drainage and irrigation, and taking into account the sum of 22 million francs originally promised by the State of Lattakia, the credit of 20 million francs, of which the mandated territories would be prepared to furnish 6,500,000 fr., would not be required until the third year of the operation. ot siOEXE.P In any further counnunicution on this subject, please quote No. £ i , a l&gt;^Sddre8s —not to any person by name, but to— “ X..0 Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. p.z.'l 7434 THE Under-Secretary of State for Fcfcsigij events his compliments to C ^q,c^&lt;Xo^\ }vx 4 X^'o^ and, by direction of the Secretary of State, transmits herewith cop uz/o of the under-mentioned paper.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copy of a despatch from Viscount Cranborne, of to-day’s date, respecting League financial participation in the Assyrian settlement. Geneva, October 3, 1935. Enclosure. Viscount Cranborne to Sir Samuel Hoare. United Kingdom Delegation (No. 155.) to the League of Nations, Sir, Geneva, October 3, 1935. I HAVE the honour to report that, following upon the offer by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to make an independent financial contribution to the Assyrian settlement scheme in Syria, subject to certain conditions, of which one was the readiness of the League of Nations to provide whatever balance might remain to be found after the contributions from all independent sources had been taken into account, the question of League financial participation in the scheme was referred by the Council to the Assembly, and by the Assembly,' in the first place, to its Sixth Committee. 2. The proceedings in the Sixth Committee were opened on the 17th September by a statement made on behalf of the chairman of the Committee of the Council which has been dealing for the past two years with Assyrian resettlement. This statement set out the elements of the problem and reviewed the efforts which the committee had made to solve it. Various schemes, including two in Brazil and British Guiana respectively, which had been subject to detailed local examination, had proved unworkable, and the committee had been compelled to recognise that its task was insoluble unless the French Government, in spite of the difficulties originally foreseen, were prepared to receive the Assyrians in the Mandated Territories of the Levant. Accordingly, the committee had addressed itself to the French Government, which had received the appeal with sympathy, but had stipulated that no financial responsibility should devolve upon the French Government or upon the Mandated Territories. A provisional settlement of limited capacity already existed on the Upper Khabur River in North-East Syria, but for various reasons it was desirable that the permanent settlement should be in the Ghab area, where a detailed scheme had been worked out. The difficulty was finance. The scheme involved preliminary drainage and irrigation operations estimated to cost 62 million French francs, of which the Mandated Territories of the Levant had, in spite of the reservation made by the French Government, now agreed to pay 22 million, leaving 40 million to be found by the Council Committee. In addition, the committee might have to find anything up to 30 million French francs for settlement proper. The United Kingdom Government had made certain suggestions tending to reduce this total liability of the Council Committee from 70 million to 45 million French francs, but the course of discussion had shown that this was only possible if means could be devised of raising, in the third year of the operation, a credit of 20 million French francs on the security, in the main, of Assyrian reimbursements. Towardsthis credit the Mandated Territories were willing to advance 6,500,000 French francs, leaving a gap to be filled of 13,500,000 French francs. To meet the sum of 45 million French francs immediately required, the committee had only, so far, the contribution promised by the Iraqi Government in May last of £10 a head up to £125,000, and the United Kingdom conditional offer of five-twelfths of the expense of the scheme which the Council Committee might be called upon to cover, up to a maximum of £250,000. The question of the League’s financial^^ participation in any scheme of settlement was one which the Assyrian Committee^^ had always held to be outside its competence, and a vote of the Assembly was necessary for its approval. The statement pointed out that a decision was urgently needed. If the transfer of the Assyrians was to be begun in 1936 and completed during that year, no time could be lost in beginning the preliminary work in the Ghab. Unless this work was begun within the next few weeks, there was a risk of a year’s postponement of the whole operation, and this risk the Committee of the Council viewed with the gravest apprehension. The committee therefore hoped that the Assembly would consider the question with the utmost sympathy, with a view to finding, if possible, the means whereby the League could participate in the measure necessary to ensure that the efforts which had been made to find a solution should not have been in vain. 3. The United Kingdom delegate, in opening the debate, gave an historical account of the circumstances in which the Assyrian problem had arisen. Lord Cranborne explained that the entry of the Assyrians into the war had not been the work of the British Government. It was with the forces of Imperial Russia that the Assyrian insurgents had joined up. Great Britain had had no independent dealings with the community until two or three years later, when the battered remnants had been saved from annihilation by British forces and brought to safety in 1918 within the borders of what is now Iraq. Having rescued the Assyrians in this manner, the British Government had continued to help them in Iraq from humanitarian motives over a considerable period and at very great expense to the British Treasury. After the war, the Assyrians desired to return to their former homes and the United Kingdom had done its utmost to help them. During the peace negotiations with Turkey, the United Kingdom Government had aimed at incorporating within Iraqi territory the Hakkiari district of Turkey, to which the majority of the iVssyrians belonged, in order that they might be established there as an autonomous community under the sovereignty of Iraq. The question of the delimitation of the Iraqi-Turkish frontier had eventually, in virtue of the Treaty of Lausanne, come before the League Council in 1925, and the United Kingdom Government had made it clear that, unless the Hakkiari territory were included in Iraq, all hope of a separate homogeneous existence for the Assyrians would be destroyed. Unfortunately, the Council of the League had decided that the Hakkiari territory must remain Turkish, and this decision, which had finally separated some 20,000 Assyrians from their original homes, lay, in the view of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, at the root of the present difficulties. The problem, therefore, had an international character. The Assyrians could not return to their country of origin. They were largely an alien element in the country of their present residence. The regime which brought them into the war no longer existed, and the responsibility for the present situation could not be laid at the door of anv single Government. The future of the Assyrians clearly called for collective action and the problem was exactly the kind of problem which the world looked to the League to solve. A special responsibility had often been attributed in the matter to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, but the facts did not justify such a view. His Majesty’s Government were, however, most anxious to obtain a satisfactory solution of the problem, and the offer to pay five-twelfths of the cost of settlement, up to a maximum of £250,000, which His Majesty’s Government had recently made, showed that they were prepared to hear what they believed to be perhaps even more than their fair share in reaching a solution. They also believed that, for its part, the League would not desire to avoid its share of the consequences of enforcing the Council’s Mosul Boundary decision of 1925. In conclusion. Lord Cranborne pointed out that the settlement of the Assyrians was not a refugee problem; it was a political problem which had a humanitarian aspect. The Council, by the creation of its Committee for Assyrian Settlement in 1933, had decided to solve an exceptional problem by exceptional measures. The Council Committee had made great efforts to give3 [531 e—1] B 2 effect to that decision. Owing to the action of the United Kingdom, French and Iraqi Governments, a fair prospect for the Assyrians was now opening up, and Lord Cranborne felt convinced that the Assembly would not let the opportunity pass for want of any financial assistance which it was within the power of the League to give. 4. The Iraqi delegate said that, while he had not yet received final instruc tions from his Government, the generous offer of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom had greatly improved the situation, and he hoped shortly to be in a position to make a statement. The Italian delegate expressed satis faction that the problem of the Assyrians had at last entered on a phase of positive solution. Provided that the financial consequences of the proposed scheme would not make too large a call on the League budget, the Italian delega tion would feel very great satisfaction at the scheme. 5. M. Erik de Scavenius (Denmark) was then appointed rapporteur, and he presented a report and resolution at the next meeting of the committee on the 19th September. The report pointed out that the Assyrian question was not a refugee problem, but eminently a political problem, which the Council, as early as 1933, decided to consider as exceptional. Its immediate and radical solution would greatly contribute to the maintenance of peace and tranquillity in the Near East. Its abandonment would have consequences which would affect not only the Assyrians and Iraq, but also other Stales, with reactions which would be bound to damage the highest interests of the League of Nations. The reso lution, after reciting the various aspects of the problem, declared that the proposal of the United Kingdom concerning the financial participation of the League was worthy of the most sympathetic consideration of the Assembly and that the Sixth Committee consequently referred to the Fourth Committee the question of the provision of the necessary funds. 6. After the Netherlands delegate had declared that he would abstain from voting, the report and resolution were adopted by the committee. 7. In the meantime the Council Committee had been giving further detailed consideration to the plan of settlement and had drawn up a note on the financial aspect of it which was transmitted by the Sixth Committee to the Fourth Committee. This note envisaged certain economies and adjustments which would bring down the cost of settlement proper to some 24 million French francs instead of 30 million as originally contemplated. 8. The Financial Regulations of the League required that the Fourth Committee should in the first place decide by a two-thirds majority whether it was prepared in principle to authorise a credit for this purpose in the budget for the coming year. The debate on the question of procedure was opened bv Dr. Burgin, the United Kingdom delegate, who reviewed once more the events leading up to the present situation and emphasised that the scheme now under consideration represented the last chance of an honourable and permanent solution of the Assyrian problem. Dr. Burgin explained the financial position and pointed out that, on the basis of the latest figures produced by the Council Committee and assuming that the proposed credit operation could be realised, 44 million French francs, or 8,800,000 Swiss francs, remained to be found, after taking into account the contribution of the Mandated Territories of the Levant. The United Kingdom was prepared to contribute up to a maximum of 3,750,000 Swiss francs and it was hoped that the Iraqi Government would do the same, making 7,500,000 Swiss francs in all. Dr. Burgin tabled a resolution recommending the Assembly to undertake to provide the funds necessary to complete the scheme, over and above all independent contributions, including those from private charitable sources, and specifically to approve the insertion towards meeting that liability of a sum in the budget of the League. He pointed out that, so far as the drainage and irrigation works were concerned, the figures were final, as the authorities of the Mandated Territories had assumed liability for any excess, but the cost of settle ment was an estimate which might be exceeded. But on the assumption that the estimates were exactly realised and the proposed credit operation successfullv carried out, the gap which the resolution asked the League to fill might be 1,300,000 Swiss francs. Dr. Burgin, after showing the need for strict financial control, emphasised the amount of progress hitherto made towards a solution of the problem and drew attention to the hopes expressed by the Council Committee, in the Council itself, and in the Sixth Committee, that the Assembly would not4 fail to take the necessary measures to complete the task. League assistance was equitable in view of the past connexion of the League with the problem. But he asked the committee to look upon the part to be played by the League not as a liability but as an opportunity to permit the completion of a work which, if successful, would be a brilliant addition to its solid achievements in the . humanitarian sphere. \ 9. After a somewhat lengthy debate, in which considerable opposition was 1 expressed to the assumption by the League of financial liability in a question which several speakers evidently still regarded as an ordinary refugee question, / the committee decided by twenty-nine votes to none, with seven abstentions, to [ refer the matter to the Supervisory Commission for study and report. 10. The meeting of the Supervisory Commission was private, but Dr. Burgin was invited to appear before the commission. He restated the case for League participation and for the assumption by the League of the residual liability. He urged that the League should at all events participate in a manner which would ensure the success of the scheme. 11. The Supervisory Commission presented its report on the 25th September. It pointed out that the estimates for settlement might be exceeded as the number of Assyrians to be transferred was uncertain, and that difficulties might arise in obtaining the proposed credit of 20 million French francs, since no other security than Assyrian reimbursements was at present contemplated. It pointed out, moreover, that League intervention in settlement questions had, hitherto, been confined to obtaining technical advice, providing experts and collaborating in 1 the issue of loans, without any large sums being charged direct to the League budget and without the League's action in the matter exceeding the limits of organisation and co-ordination. The Council had, however, been dealing with the matter for some years past and the commission thus felt obliged to propose that the Assembly should grant financial assistance for this work so far as its budgetary resources would allow. The commission stipulated that its conclusions must not serve as a precedent and that the League could not accept a residuary liability. The League contribution should be clearly fixed forthwith and should in no case be increased later. With these provisos the commission recommended the Fourth Committee to fix at 1,300,000 Swiss francs the final figure of the League’s contribution to the work of settling the Assyrians of Iraq in the Mandated Territories of the Levant. This sum would be spread over four years, namely, 400,000 Swiss francs for 1936 and 300,000 in each of the following three years. i 12. This report was discussed by the Fourth Committee on the i 26th September. The Iraqi delegate, Xuri Pasha, then announced that the Iraqi K Government accepted the conditions attached to the offer of the United Kingdom Government in so far as those conditions applied to Iraq and that the Iraqi Government would accordingly recommend Parliament to authorise, pari passu with the United Kingdom, the increase of the contribution already promised by Iraq, up to a maximum of £250,000. 13. The United Kingdom delegate pointed out that the recommendations of the Supervisory Commission stopped short of the assumption by the League of unlimited liability. Nevertheless, His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom, while unable to increase their independent contribution, would main tain their offer, subject to its other conditions being fulfilled and, in particular, subject to the condition that a satisfactory scheme of financial control was adopted which would, in practice, have regard to the fact that the funds available were limited. 14. A lengthy debate followed in which opposition was expressed by the Latvian and Greek delegates and reservations made by the delegates of Spain (who, however, supported the proposed credit) and Belgium. M. Rappard, the delegate of Switzerland, in his capacity as a member of'the Permanent Mandates Commission claimed that Sir F. Humphrys had, before that Commission in 1931, accepted entire responsibility on behalf of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom for the consequences of the termination of the mandatory regime in Iraq and he indicated, without opposing the present credit, that it would have been fitting if His Majesty's Government had assumed entire financial responsibility for the present scheme.

IN a letter dated the 13th July last, you were good enough to inform me that as a consequence of the mission which you performed at Beirut, the Council Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq had decided to turn its attention to the Gharb district and to take immediate measures for this purpose. With this end in view, the committee expressed the desire to obtain, if possible before the 15th August next, a detailed and complete study of the Gharb settlement scheme. In communicating to me this wish, you expressed the desire that this study should be prepared on the spot by the services of the High Commissariat in consultation with two experts appointed by the committee. I have the honour to inform you that I have duly communicated to the High Commissariat the suggestions submitted by the committee. I take this oppor tunity of confirming that the High Commissariat will willingly avail itself of the assistance of the experts which the committee is sending to Beirut. Lastly, I would add that following upon the exchange of views which has taken place at Paris between the High Commissioner of the Republic at Beirut and M. Arocha and Mr. Hill, detailed supplementary instructions have been sent to the Eligh Commissariat. The task assigned to M. Cuenod. expert on transfers of populations, and to Mr. Hill, the financial expert, who will be specially responsible for seeing that the estimate is submitted in a form answering to the committee’s requirements, has been indicated. It has been made clear that M. Cuenod will submit the list of questions raised by the Assyrians of Iraq to which he has to furnish replies. Special directions have been given for the estimates contained in the schedule to be prepared with due attention to the savings which can be made, as compared with the previous estimates, in respect of the cost of material, the employment of the Assyrians themselves as labour, and the material situation of the refugees. The High Commissariat is also requested to deduct from the estimates of aggregate expenditure the aggregate estimates of the repayments to be made by the Assyro-Chaldeans. For this purpose a plan must be drawn up on the basis of past experience, indicating the time-limits within which refunds should be made, and the intervals between the individual payments. The High Commissariat has been notified of the fact that Mr. Hill is authorised to examine with the services of the High Commissariat the possibilities of mobilising the sums to be expected from these repayments. Lastly, mention is made of the wish expressed by the committee to receive periodically a report on the utilisation of funds, and to entrust this task to M. Cuenod as the committee’s local representative during the period of installation. I have, &amp;c.

This will involve an additional contribution from the Iraqi Govern ment of £125,000 which will not be subject to any deduc tions in respect of money already spent by the Iraqi Government or in respect of transport expenses within Iraq (see Geneva telegram No. 18 (of September 19th) to you, and your telegram No. 234 (of September 20th))and in particular the Iraqi Government have agreed to abandon the condition, which they originally desired to impose, that their con tribution should be on the basis of an expenditure not exceeding £10 per head. You have noted with pleasure that Nuri Pasha has now agreed to make a declaration at Geneva to give effect to this decision, and you also note that Yasin Pasha has given you a personal guarantee (see final sentence of your telegram No. 235 (of the 21st September)), which has been repeated by Nuri Pasha at Geneva (see Geneva telegram No. 162 (of September 24th))that there will bo no difficulty about obtaining the approval of the Iraqi Parliament to the additional Iraqi contribution on these conditions. You should add that,, while the question is entirely one between the Iraqi Government and the League of Nations, since it is the League and not His Majesty’s Government who are the responsible authority in the Assyrian question,. His Majesty’s Government have neverthe less entered into those discussions, and taken note of the aboveabove understand ins, in view of fact that they are them selves mehins similar contribution (conditionally on Iraqi contribution) and of the interest which they share with the Iraqi Government in ensuring that everything possible is done to briny about a very early settlement of this difficult question* I leave it to you, in view of your knowledge of Yasin* s character, vhethor to ask him to confirm that the above understanding is correct. Such confirmation might have certain advantages, but might perhaps lead Yasin to embark on further discussion or to bring in undesirable reference to railway settlement. 4. The object of your letter would be to enable us if necessary to bring informal pressure to bear on the Iraqi Government to secure a satisfactory attitude on the part, of the Iraqi Parliament in the event of any unexpected diffi culties arising. The correspondence would, of course', be treated as confidential and would cease to have any importance once the Iraqi Parliamentary consent had been given. 5 0 I do not consider it desirable or practicable to hold up railway negotiations pending the Iraqi Parliament’s approval of the increased Iraqi Assyrian contribution. On the other hand the new railway settlement, as it involves a derogation from the existing ratified treaty commitments, will need similar ratification* As explained in my immediately following telegram you should make sure that this point is not overlooked; and, should any &gt; serious difficulty arise over the X UilU UVVU OUXUjLAO -L t-ux X xwx ratification of the railway settlement to be deferred pending satisfactory evidence that Iraqis are playing up over Assy r ion quo st ion * Addressed to Bagdad No. 234, repeated to Genova no. 168.(E 5751/2/95) W DISTR I BUTION Code telegram to Mr. Bateman (Bagdad), Foreign Office, 26th September, 1955. 10.00 p.m. No. 255. (R). My immediately preceding telegram (of September 26th: Financial settlement of Iraqi railways and Assyrian questions). Letter regarding railways should be sent simultaneously but separately. It should contain no reference to Assyrian contribution or to correspondence regarding it. 2. Best course will be to make it a reply to Prime Minister's letter of September 11th (see your despatch No. 490 (of deptember 12th)). You would refer generally to discussions which had taken place and place on record your understanding that Yasin Pasha is prepared in principle to accept other conditions laid down in your letter of August 51st if His Majesty s Government for their part will agree to accept 5400,000 instead of £650,000 as a cash payment. You would continue that after reference to His Majesty’s Government you are authorised to accent this reduced amount but only provided that other conditions of railway settlement are integrally accepted, to avoid misapprehension it would be well to quote the exact terms, which would be identical with those given in your letter of August 51st except for reduced cash payment and for introduction of words to show that list of reserved key posts is to be specified in ultimate agreement. Letter should conclude by asking for a letter of confirmation of acceptance of terms quoted and after reference to need for drafting terms ol agreement should finally make it clear that as new agreement will replace a ratified treaty obligation it also will be subject to ratification2 . ratification and vdll enter into fores on the exchange of ratifications* 5. You may make general use of paragraphs 8, 9 and 1C of draft enclosed in your despatch rc. 501 (of September 19th). But reference in paragraph 10 to importance which Hi Majesty's Government attach to reservation of general manag ship and key posts should, if made at all, he less pointed, as in present form it might only arouse Iraqi suspicions, ns whole agreement will he in writing final sentence of paragraph seems unnecessary. As regards paragraph 9 of your draft point might he brought out rather more clearly that 1930 notes ao not provide for reservation of any posts for British subjects and are therefore unsuitable for present purpose, moreover there is just as much likelihood or Iraqis as oi non ^ritish foreigners being appointed to posts which His majesty s Government will require to be reserved for British subjects. 4. Further point raises out of paragraph 1 of Yasin Pasha's letter of September 11th in which he refers to the constitution of taxed Board, rhe latter is of course to be appointed by Iraqi Government. It is however most desirable if possible to ensure that Board will be entrusted with effective and not merely with nominal management of railways, cf. paragraph 2 of enclosure in your letter of September 12th to Mr. Rends!. You should therefore take note in your letter of statement that^ railways administration would be under a department of the Iraqi Government and express presumption that while it is no doubt necessary for constitutional reasons that a particular minister should be ultimately responsible, railway board will have irkrssssrs*. *« o “»’ ra Boa8 'J^This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] hr om SWITZERLAND . jecode.

Nuri is of course trying to drive as hard a bargain as possible on both railway and Assyrian questions. But his attitude is also explained by elements of mistrust and rivalry in relations between Yasin and himself. Substance of telegrams v/hiah have passed between the two have been communicated orally to Mr. Bennett by Nuri in the presence of Mr. Edmonds and it is clear from this telegraphic correspondence that objectionable conditions did originate with Nuri and that the latter made them in order to get Yasin to accept unpalatable figure of (?£250,000)o Nuri is of course most reluctant in the circumstances to go back upon his own conditions unless and until he is not only sure of Yasin’s concurrence but has his prior sanction. Bagdad telegram No.233 arrived while meeting of Fourth Committee of Assembly (reported in Geneva telegram No.150) was in progress^ Nuri was at once informed ol the nature of the telegram from Yasin which was on its way to him.

Prime Minister confided to me that Nuri is feeling sore because he (Nuri) is sticking strictly to his original in structions and trying to keep Iraqi end up, it now appears that Yasin is letting him down owing to continued pressure from me. Prime Minister saw that Nuri had not yet appre ciated that the new railway proposals had made all the dif ference end had put Assyrian question completely in the shade.

In accordance with the verbal arrangement then made, I have pleasure in giving Your Excellency the jollowing eonfirmation:- (1) His Majesty’s Government propose that the Iraqi Government should be placed in absolute possession of the existing railways as a going concern, ihis means that, on the entry into force of an agreement designed to replace the relevant provisions of t e inancial Agreement attached to the Treaty of 1930, the Iraqi Government would taice over inter alia all railways lands, reserve anu renewal funds, and all railway debts and credits of whatever nature. (2) In return. Hit.

(b) Make to His majesty’s Government an immediate cash payment of £650,000, and (c) Assume responsibility for any liabilities connected with the railways which have arisen or which may arise in the future# The ai'Ove proposals arise out of the desire of His majesty’s Government to assist the Iraqi Government to the utmost extent consistent with the obligations and interests of both Governments* They s ould not be taken to mean that His majesty’s Government ac ept the contention that the arrangements for the future of the railways provided in the Financial Agreement attached to the Treaty of 1930 ai'e impracticable or unworkable, but only that they are willing to m et the objections of the Iraqi Government as far as possible As I explained in the course of our conversation, His Majesty’s Government will look to the Iraqi Government , if and a,ter the new arrangement comes into force, to give preference as far as possible to British materials for the railways.

He hinted also that sum of £10,000 (? grp. omtd.) paid by Iraq in 1954 towards capita basis. Nuri attempted to justify this by a somewhat involved argument to the effect that unless they were going to be rid of the whole Assyrian problem Iraci Government would not wish to contribute to Gharb reclamation scheme but only to actual sevtie- men t, oi costs of whatever number of Assyrians left Iraq. Mr. Bennett raised strongest objection to all these complications. He pointed out that what was required for success was maximum amount of new money.

The # treQi Government empress their satisfaction foreignforeign subjects, could be considered sufl icient, and the terms set forth in the letter in question were followed. It is understood that the administration of these Railways would be a government administration under the ^inistry concerned. The ’Iraqi Government would be content with the formation of the fixed board from among senior officials of the Railway Administration, provided that the majority thereof are ’Iraqi officials. 2. The ’Iraqi Government are sure that in their 'participation’' (? interest) in the Railways His Britannic Majesty’s Government do not aim at material benefit, since their interest is restricted to the maintaining of organised administration for this concern as declared on several occasions by their representatives and therefore they appreciate the reason which made His Britannic Majesty’s Government to demana 650 thousand dinars. In order to facilitate the question of reaching a settlement the ’Iraqi Government agree to cede to the British Government the oney accumulated in the 'Renewal Fund' (sic; (Renewal, Replacement and Betterment Account) in stead of the above mentioned sum. 3. The ’Iraqi Government have no other observations to make on the other conditions set forth in your above mentioned letter. The ’Iraqi Government will be pleased to know as early as possible whether His Britannic Majesty’s Government agree to the above comments in order to have the new agreement drafted accordingly.

Financial settlement of Iraqi Railways and Assyrian questions). It is not possible for His Majesty’s Government, during present crisis, to reach final decision on Prime Minister’s proposals by tomorrow, but following are my preliminary observations. 2. Kis Majesty’s Government have hitherto considered £500,000 minimum cash payment which they could accept for railways. It appeared from your telegram No.228 (of September 13th) that there was reasonable prospect of obtaining this sumo 3. Meanwhile it is clear that Iraqis will find themselves in impossible position at Geneva, besides being faced with a continuance of Assyrian problem, unless their contribution towards Assyrian settlement is very substantially increased. 4. Prime Minister’s present proposal appears merely to be equivalent to reduction by £25,000 of minimum payment required by His Majesty’s Government for railways coupled with no increase in Assyrian contribution. 5. I realise that if Iraqi Government are to be induced to pay £250,000 required'from them for Assyrian settlement03h 2s Bettlement it may be necessary for His Majesty’s Government to contemplate accepting some reduction in payment for railways, but it would clearly be impossible to consider accepting such a reduction unless iraai contribution towards Assyrian settlement were increased to full amount of £250,000 required* Any deficiency on this amount would have further drawback of correspondingly reducing any amount payable by His Majesty's Government which 5 as you are aware, cannot exceed Iraqi contribution* Effect would probably be to wreck last hope of Assyrian settlemente 6« In these circumstances if any such reduction in railways settlement as that now'proposed by Prime Minister is to be considered, it seems essential that Iraqi contribution towards Assyrian settlement should be increased to at least £250,GOO. 7* Further condition regarding Iraqi contribution to Assyrian settlement not exceeding £10 per head is open to serious objection that it may, in event of total funds proving insufficient to move total numoer of Assyrians, prevent any move being made at all. On previous occasion when this condition was applied it led to serious difficulties and there are obvious objections to hampering discretion of organisations entrusted with task of Assyrian migration by conditions of this kind. 3o In view of above it seems clear that His Majesty's Government could not consider joint solution on lines suggested unless, without any further reduction of sum offered for railways ? Iraqi contribution towards Assyrian settlement were raised to at least £250,000 and condition were abandoned. Addressed to Bagdad No*228, repeated to Geneva No.131.^ — (7, V J HO DISTHIBUTTOK .

I towards am not aware of attitud possibility of linking e of His Majesty's Government up Assyrian question with that oi railways and I understand that a telegram from the Foreign OH ice on this point is on its way to you. I feel oound, however, without delay to point out extreme urgency of a decision and difficulties which will be created unless the Iraqi Government double their contribution. His Majesty's Government's offer depends on attitude of Iraqi Government and of the League. If a decision regarding a League contribution is to be reached at present Assembly a vote by competent Commissions vail have to be given oefore the end of present week. A favourable vote is unlixely unless Iraqi Government double their contribu tion and onus of failure in that event will lie upon Iraqi Government anti not upon the Le&amp;gue, An offer on a per capita basis will not be helpful owing to over-head expenses. His Majesty's Government's offer stipulates that Iraq shall pay an equal emnunt, i.e. ,-| expense devolving on Assyrian Committee up to a maximum of £250,000. Offer of less then this maximum will (134) only • « •only complicate matters.

I have now received personal letter from Prime minister dated September 11th embodying financial suggestions in your telegram l:o. 226 and making the following additional proposals. (a) Length of Service of retained British personnel should be fixed in accordance with third letter of June 30th 1930 attached to treaty of Alliance. (b) Management Board should be iormed from senior railway officials with Iraqi majority. Text left here by Air mail yesterday. (2). I immediately saw the Prime Minister and pointed out that offer of fluctuating reserve sums which bore no relationship to sum fixed by financial agreement was most, inappropriate and quite inconsistent with principle ox y our proposals in which he had expressed general concurrence. As regards length of service? if his letter was taken literally it would mean retention oi British personnel for 22 years. Did Iraqi Government really mean that? (3) prime Minister was bewildered and said that both ideas had originated with Muri Said. He himself was not enthusiastic about handing over reserve fund as payment ana was quite ready to pay His Majesty’s Government £400,000 new cash. I said that even this was no great advance on Muri • • •2 the o • • 9 Said’s ridiculous proposal but that if he would - . raise it to £500,000 I would recoiiiindnd his oifer for your favourah 1 e consideratioiio I gained distinct impression that furi Said is the nigger in tnis wood pile and that his offer is simply a 'try on'. The Prime Minister has apparently left the transaction largely to him and I feel fairly certain that if British delegate at Geneva insists on a payment of at least £500,000 Puri Said will heat a retreat and the Prime fillister will he amenable. Nuri Said based his plea on discussions of 1955 in London when he alleged he v/as told that His majesty’s Government did not expect any pecuniary gain from railways. I have disillusioned the Prime minister on this point. (I). as regards A above, prime minister explained that reference to third letter attached to Treaty of 1950 was probably an error as he had not really understood Puri Said's point, Puri Said's aim is to limit the period of new treaty to 15 years on the analogy of the old Treaty contracts of 1922. I pointed out that you obviously intended rhat proposed agree ment should run for approximately the same term as Treaty of Alliance and that I could hold out no hope of your giving way on mhis point. (5) . I strongly urge that British delegate at Geneva should make it clear to Puri Said that prospects of rapid settlement will be ruined if ho persists in attempts at oriental bargaining. (6) If Iraqi Government in future co-operate whole heartedly and allow management suificient power and latitude to run the railways efficiently they will in fact be getting(37 5. the system for nothing as interest and amortization charges on capical sum paid would easily be covered by annual profits if the rate over the last few years is maintained.

Letter to the French Government, dated July 13, 1935, concerning the Settlement of the A ssyrians of Iraq in the Gharh District.—(Received in Foreign Office, July 18.) M. le Ministre, Geneva, July 13, 1935. IN a letter dated the 22nd March last I had the honour, as chairman of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, to address an urgent appeal to your Government to accept as permanent colonists in the mandated territories of the Levant not only the Assyrians, who have already settled there provisionally, but also such of those still remaining in Iraq who desire to leave that country. The French Government, while pointing out the difficulties which, as Mandatory Power, it would encounter in the settlement of the Assyrians, was good enough, in its letter of the 14th April, to give a favourable reply to this appeal and to submit proposals to the committee relating to three different districts. In agreement with the French Government the committee considered at the time that it should endeavour to promote the third scheme referred to in your above-mentioned letter, which provided for the settlement of the Assyrians in groups spread over the Upper Khabur and the Middle Khabur. However, it also agreed with you that the first of the three schemes submitted, providing for settlement on the edge of the Gharb marshes presented considerable advantages over the other two. It was essential to determine the districts in which the Assyrians were to be settled in order to be able to fix the number who could be established there and the cost of the operation. A first study was prepared by the competent services of the High Commissariat (docs. 116 and 117), which, by restricting the scope of the original plan, made it possible to save a considerable amount of time and expense. In the course of the conversations at Beirut between the High Commissioner and the competent services of the Grand Seraglio and the mission over which I have the honour to preside, the superiority of the Gharb scheme was again demonstrated, and this was confirmed by the visit of inspection made to the Khabur and Gharb districts. The committee of the Council, after hearing the report of my visit to Syria and Iraq, and bearing in mind the considerable advantages of the Gharb over the Khabur scheme and the problems to which the adoption of the latter might give rise in future, and also the fact that, according to the preliminary consulta tion carried out by our mission in Iraq, the number of Assyrians desirous of leaving that country exceeded the number who could be settled in the available districts of the Khabur, decided to turn its attention to the Gharb district and to take immediate measures with a view to settling the Assyrians in that region. Among those measures the committee unanimously agreed that the most urgent was to obtain, if possible, before the 15th August next, a detailed and complete study of the scheme for the settlement of the Assyrians in the Gharb. This study should contain such technical and financial data and recommendations as States, which might offer contributions, will doubtless desire to possess regarding the application of the scheme. It should also enable the local committee in Iraq to reply to the numerous questions raised by the Assyrians who are anxious to leave the country. In particular this study should examine theA ‘ * •« 2 possibility of cutting down the budget submitted by the Grand Seraglio (docs. 116 and 117) in view of the following considerations :*— 1. The fact that to a large extent the Assyrians will be employed as labourers; 2 The material situation of the refugees; and 3. The subsequent repayment of the expenditure by the Assyrians. C 4 In order to save time and to avoid the necessity for consultations by correspondence, the committee considers it advisable for this document to be prepared on the spot by the competent services of the High Commissariat in consultation with two representatives of the Council Committee—M. Cuenod, who is at present in Iraq as the committee’s representative and has had exceptional experience of the transfer of populations, and a financial expert whose name will be communicated to you very shortly.

Letter, dated July 13, 1935, from the President of the Committee for the Settle-^ ment of the Assyrians of Iraq to the Government of Iraq, concerning it* contribution towards the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in Syria.— (Received in Foreign Office, July 18.) gj r Geneva, July 13, 1935. ON my return to this country I duly convened a meeting of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, and rendered to it an account of my recent mission to Iraq and to Syria. The committee has asked me, in the first place, to express its great apprecia tion of the manner in which the mission was received in Iraq, and to convey its sincere thanks to the Iraqi Government for the facilities which it so freely gave for the accomplishment of the mission’s task. The local experience thus game cannot fail to be of considerable value, and it is the hope of the committee tnat it will contribute materially to an ultimate solution of the Assyrian problem satisfactory to all concerned. . . , . , T I have reported more particularly to the committee the discussions wnicn 1 had the honour of conducting with his Excellency Yasin Pasha regarding the financial contribution of the Iraqi Government towards the accomplishment ot a scheme of settlement in Syria, and the committee has had under consideration the letter which Yasin Pasha addressed to me on this subject on the 26th May The committee desires to express its thanks for that letter, from which it takes note that it can count upon a contribution from the Iraqi Government ot 125,000 Iraqi dinars (£125,000), calculated on the basis of 10 dinars for every Assyrian who desires to leave Iraq up to a maximum of 12,500 persons Ihe committee is happy to learn that of this sum the Iraqi Government have already paid into the Banque de Syrie et du Grand-Liban at Beirut £60,000, representing an advance to facilitate the transfer of the first 4,000-5,000 Assyrians, and that this advance has already enabled a preliminary transfer of about 1,400 persons to take place with the prior agreement of the Iraqi Government The Iraqi Government will readily understand that the committee, whi e recognising that the contribution of £ 125,000 represents m itself a not inconsiderable effort on the part of Iraq, is, nevertheless, bound to examine it m relation to the magnitude of the problem to be solved to the undertakings given by the Iraqi Government, and to the resources which that Government commands. After considering my report, the committee is convinced that of the ^ riou ;&gt; possibilities of settlement in Syria offered by the French G ^ ernment ’ scheme, in the modified form which has resulted from my discussions with the French High Commissioner at Beirut, alone offers real hope of a definitive solution of the Assyrian problem; and it has accordingly reached the conclusion that it is desirable to aim at the realisation of the Gharb scheme rather than to pursue the idea of permanent settlement in the region of the Khabur. . , ., . The committee is now taking steps to work out a plan m all its details i collaboration with the French authorities m Syria. The precise cost of the modified Gharb scheme must depend on the result of this work, and also upon the number of Assyrians who may have to be transferred from Iraq. In the estimates provided by the French authonties dnrmg my recent visit to Syria, the settlement of 15,000 persons m the Gharb area (including the necessary outlay for the draining and irrigation of the land) was put at £800 &gt; 0 00, This figure did' not, of course, make allowance for eventual repayment by the settlers, the principle of which has since been accepted by the committee. It is [456 s—6]2 true, also, that there is reason to hope that some reduction in the estimate may be eventually effected in the course of detailed negotiations. On the other hand, any reduction may be counterbalanced to some extent by the prospect, which my preliminary consultation with the Assyrians has led me to believe a real one, that more than 15,000 Assyrians will eventually elect to leave Iraq. It is evident, therefore, that a very considerable financial effort will be required if the Assyrian question is to receive more than a partial and temporary solution. The committee desires me to recall, also, the speech made by Yasin Pasha to the Council of the League on the 14th October, 1933. Yasin Pasha then said : “ In the interests of all concerned, the happiness of the Assyrians themselves, and the reputation of Iraq, it was essential to find a new home elsewhere for the Assyrian immigrants who wished to leave or were unwilling to settle peaceably, and to be incorporated finally into the Iraqi State, a home where they could make a fresh start. The Iraqi Government was prepared to make its contribution, as generous a contribution as its resources permitted, to help them on their way. There was one thing it could not do, and that was to find land.” The committee appeals to the Iraqi Government to reconsider the matter in the liberal spirit of Yasin Pasha’s declaration. It feels that the contribution already promised is, in the first place, out of proportion to the total sum required. It notes, moreover, that the sum already promised is a contribution towards the emigration of 12,500 persons only. The committee cannot help feeling that the unwillingness of the Iraqi Government to contemplate any payment except in relation to this limited number is difficult to reconcile with the declaration of Yasin Pasha, which I have quoted above. The committee is anxious to continue to do everything possible to assist the Iraqi Government in accordance with the latter’s request to the Council of the League, to work out a solution of a problem which, if left unsolved or only partially solved, is bound to give rise to untold difficulties. It lies with the Iraqi Government, however, to make it practicable for League co-operation to be exercised with fruitful results. In order to do everything possible to help in finding a solution, the committee has unanimously decided to renew forthwith the appeal made by the Council in its resolution of the 19th January, 1934, “ to the generosity of Governments and private organisations to consider participating in the financing of a settlement scheme, having regard, more especially, to its humanitarian aspect.” I have, in addition, addressed a special appeal to the United Kingdom Government. The committee has, however, grave doubts whether a contribution from the Iraqi Government of less than a sum of £250,000, which I had the honour to suggest to you in Bagdad as a reasonable amount, will be sufficient to attract contributions from other sources, and it fears that, short of the augmentation to that amount of the sum at present promised by the Iraqi Government, there is a serious risk that a comprehensive solution of the Assyrian problem by the settlement outside Iraq of all those who desire to leave the country, may prove unattainable.

VII.) League of Nations : Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq. A weal by the Committee of the Council—{Received in Foreign Office, ^ July 18, 1935.) AT the request of the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq, the Secretary-General has the honour to address to the Govern ments of the members of the League the following communication, in which the committee, referring to the Council’s resolution of the 19th January, 1934, makes an appeal for funds for the financing of the proposed settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in the French-mandated territories of the Levant:— It will be remembered that the Council of the League, at its meeting of the 17th April, 1935, approved the attitude of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq in relation to the possibilities of settlement in Syria, and authorised the journey of the chairman of the committee to Syria and Iraq, which, it was felt, would be likely to facilitate negotiations and to contribute effectively to the realisation of a plan of settlement. The chairman of the committee and the secretary of the committee duly proceeded to Beirut, where they had preliminary discussions with the High Commissioner of the French Republic for the Mandated Territories of the Levant. They then went to Bagdad, and, after establishing contact there with the Prime Minister of Iraq, thev had the opportunity of visiting Mosul and many Assyrian villages in the north of Iraq. Further discussions with the Iraqi Government followed in Bagdad, as a result of which the Iraqi Government offered a contribu tion of £125,000 towards the realisation of a scheme of settlement in Syria. This contribution was calculated on the basis of £10 for every Assyrian who might elect to leave Iraq up to a maximum of 12,500 persons. Subsequently, when the mission had returned to Beirut, it was arranged with the Iraqi Government that the latter should make an advance of £60,000, and that part of this sum should be utilised for the immediate transfer to the Khabur region of Syria, where a provisional settlement of over 2,000 Iraqi Assyrians is already in being, of some 1,400 of the more necessitous of the Assyrians in the Mosul area. Phis preliminary operation has since been completed. The persons transferred included the inmates of the Mosul refugee camp, which has thus now r ceased to exist. From the report which the chairman has now presented to the committee and which will be circulated to all the members of the League, two important conclusions appear. On the one hand, the mission is convinced by its conversa tions with Assyrian spokesmen that a greater number of Assyrians may wish to leave Iraq than can be accommodated in the Khabur area; on the other hand, a visit to the two areas in question has confirmed the mission in the belief that the Gharb area possesses in any case important political and economic advantages. The discussions which the mission conducted in Beirut have resulted in important modifications of the Gharb scheme as originally put forward by the French Government, and, as these modifications go far to remove the difficulties which had originally appeared to preclude the adoption of the scheme, the committee has now decided to direct its efforts henceforth towards settlement in the Gharb, rather than in the Khabur, area. It has informed the French Government accordingly and proposed the immediate elaboration of a detailed plan by means of discussions in Beirut between the services of the French High Commission and technical representatives of the committee. It is, of course, impossible to produce a final plan without consulting the Assyrians individually regarding their desire to go to Syria, but the committee T456 s—5J EASTERN (Iraq). CONFIDENTIAL. [E 4409/2/93]‘2 feels that it cannot take the responsibility of authorising such a consultation at the present stage. The commitee has, in fact, reached the conclusion that no further material progress can be made until it has some more definite assurance than at present that sufficient funds for carrying out a settlement scheme will be available. According to estimates provided by the French authorities during the visit of the mission to Syria, the settlemejit of 15,000 persons in the Gharb area (including the necessary outlay for the draining and irrigation of the land) may cost as much as £800,000. This figure does not make allowance for ultimate repayment by the settlers, the principle of which has since been accepted by the committee. It is true, also, that the French representative on the committee has informed it that the above estimate was based in part on calculations made some years ago, and that closer estimates at the present date may be expected to result in a fairly considerable reduction. On the other hand, any reduction may be counterbalanced by the fact that a greater number of Assyrians may elect to leave Iraq than was contemplated when the figure of £800,000 was quoted, so that the committee thinks it prudent still to regard this figure as the sum which may be necessary to finance the operation. Against this it has so far only the promise of £125,000 from the Iraqi Government, of which, as stated above, £60,000 has actually been paid. Faced with this serious problem, the committee has decided in the first place to urge the Iraqi Government substantially to increase its contribution, and a reasoned note to this end has been addressed to the Iraqi Government. It is clear, however, that, even taking into account the possibility of reduc tions in the existing estimates and of an increased Iraqi contribution, a considerable balance will remain to be found. In its resolution of the 19th January, 1934, the Council of the League, fore seeing such a situation, issued a general appeal ‘ ‘ to the generosity of Governments and private organisations to consider participating in the financing of a settlement scheme, having regard more especially to its humanitarian aspect.” The failure of the project for settling in Syria those Assyrians who may wish to leave Iraq would be attended by serious risks which it is in the interests of all members of the League to avoid. The committee feels bound, therefore, to recall to each individual Government the above-quoted appeal by the Council and to request that Government to inform the Secretary-General as soon as possible whether and to what extent it is prepared to contribute to this work of appeasement and humanity. The committee trusts that each Government will also take steps to bring this appeal to the notice of any private organisations within its territory which might be in a position to assist financially in the solution of the question.

BiMEDIATE. My telegram No. 166 (of June 26th: Assyrian question). Consideration has now Been given to the attitude to he adopted by His Majesty*s Government towards the appeal addressed to them by President of Assyrian Committee to make independent contribution towards Assyrian settlement. His Majesty’s Government must still adhere to their view as to the collective responsibility of the League for financing the scheme apart from the contributions of the Iraqi Government and of the Assyrians themselves. ' But on purely rractical grounds they are now prepared in certain circumstances to contemplate a limited independent contribution. Though no exact figure can be fixed at this stage, His Majesty’s Government could not hope in any event to obtain from Parliament a larger contribu tion than that which may be made by the Iraqi Governments His Majesty’s Government would also require to be satisfied that the scheme of settlement is satisfactory in itself, and that the iunds forthcoming from other sources, when combined with their own contrioution, will be suflicient to ensure the success ol tile scneme. At the present moment the estimated cost of settlement is 82 million francs, of which some 22 million franc won!a be tound by the State of Lattakia, leaving 60 million to be lound oy Hie Assyrian Committee. His Majesty's Government see little prospect of so large a sum being raised by the Assyrian Committee, but they hope that the amount may be susceptible\ 2 . susceptitle of reduction. Before a final decision is reached by His Majesty's Government they propose to enter into infonaal discussions with the French Government with this end in view. They also propose at a later stage to urge that, tne League shall make as large a contribution as possible, and it may be that something may be forthcoming from charitable sources, 2 * You ma y inf °rm the Irani Prime Minister and Kuri Pasna in the strictest confidence of the position as described above. While there are still many uncertain factors, it is clear that a contribution of £125,000 from the Iraqi Government and a similar contribution from His Majesty's Government will not suffice to ensure the success of the scheme. You may inform the two Iraqi Ministers that if the Iraqi Government will agree to increase their contribution, I am prepared to re comae ad His taajesty s Government to invite Parliament to authorise a corresponding contribution within certain limits, on a pound for pound basis, subject always to the general proviso, mentioned above, that a satisfactory scheme of settle ment^ elaborated and there is reasonable assurance that the remainder of the money required will be forthcoming.

As regards expenditure on the Assyrians since October 1933 the position to date is as follows; Up to the end of April 1935 the Iraqi Government had already expended about £40^000 (in eluding a payment of £10,000 to the Kigh Commissioner in Syria)* Following the visit of the President of the Committee to Baghdad a further payment of £60,000 was actually made,together with promisee to pay a further sum of £65,000 and also the expenses of transferring the migrating Assyrians as far as the Syrian bound ary*, The Iraqi Govex'nii) ent has thus already incurred, or committed itself to incur, expenditure to a total of £d&gt;out £l‘75j&gt;000 P v. xereae, as far as the Government is aware,not a single penny has yet been made available for the resettlement from any other source,, That again is a situation which nobody can have contemplated at the time of the meeting of the Conner 11 in October 1933 0 It is perhaps desirable/(Mircble to V§Q9ll 9 vtot in frequently forgotten, that the ere act an autochthonous element of the population of Iraq; they entered the country ee refugees froe aeighbourlng states during and after the eorld ear. fhey therefore represent not a domestic Iraq hut an Intametional problem* It should be observed also that investigations by the 7 reel Committee Into the etendard of prosperity of the emigrants who left Iraq recently, revealed that they are by no means desti tute.

As regards the second part of the question, the general appeal for funds addressed to all States Members of the League, and the special letter on the subject from the President of the Assyrian Committee of the Council to His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom are receiving urgent consideration, but I am not yet in a position to indicate what decision His Majesty’s Government are likely to take in regard to them.

[E 3737/2/93] Sir A. Clark Kerr to Sir John Simon.—(Received June 17.) (No. 309.) Si*, Bagdad, June 5, 1935. WITH reference to my despatch No. 297 of the 29th May, I have the honour to inform you that His Majesty’s acting consul at Mosul reports that the visit of M. Olivan to his consular district aroused great interest among the Assyrians there and gave rise to much speculation as to their future. Some were convinced that their departure to Syria would take place in a few weeks, while others were openly doubtful of any concrete outcome to the efforts of the League Committee to find a new home for them outside Iraq. 2. The Assyrian groups not well disposed towards Mar Shimun submitted a petition to M. Olivan, in which they set out a number of questions regarding the conditions of their resettlement in Syria and expressed doubts whether the scheme was likely to provide a satisfactory solution of their difficulties. I enclose herein a copy of this petition^ 1 ) You will observe that it is signed, among others, by Malik Khoshaba, Bishop Sargis and Bishop Yawallah, all men of influence and importance. 3. During the last days of May, after M. Olivan’s departure, I learned from the Ministry of the Interior that deputations from the Assyrians now living in Mosul town had visited Major Thomson and had asked whether M. Olivan, before leaving Iraq, had given any message for the Assyrians concerning their future. Major Thomson explained that M. Olivan had left no message, but would, no doubt, make known his plans after further consultation with his committee at Geneva. This news was received with marked ill-humour and some members of the deputations became openly abusive, upbraiding Major Thomson as the cause of all their recent misfortunes. 4. The incident was of no great importance in itself, but I felt that it was indicative of the disappointment which was being felt owing to the fact that M. Olivan’s visit had not been followed by the announcement of a plan for the early removal to Syria of all who wished to leave Iraq. The representatives of the League had at long last come to Iraq, had been told that the Assyrians were all impatient to be up and going, and yet had left without a word as to the future; without even a comforting assurance that all would soon be arranged. This was the attitude of mind which the Assyrians were apparently tending to adopt, and I felt some misgivings lest, through the spread of disappointment, a spirit of desperation might again develop and fresh acts of folly occur. 5. I discussed the situation with the Prime Minister, and he agreed with my view that a reassuring message from M. Olivan and some slight revival of the activities of the local committee might do a great deal to allay the misgivings of the Assyrians. I accordingly telegraphed to M. Olivan on the 3rd June suggesting that, if he thought fit, he should send, through the Iraqi Government, a message to the Assyrians enjoining continued patience until his committee should be able to take further decisions in the light of the information which he had obtained during his visit to Syria and Iraq; and also that he should propose to the Iraqi Government that the local committee should be reformed to collect statistics and carry out such other preparations as would be required to facilitate 'their transfer, if the Council Committee succeeded in organising their removal from Iraq. M. Olivan has replied to-day noting my proposals, but reserving his comments until he has seen M. de Martel, who returns to Beirut on the 6th June. I should perhaps mention here that though Major Wilson’s contract as an Administrative Inspector has been terminated, his services are [431 r—3] (ONot printed.2 being retained for another year to enable him to continue to deal personally with the Assyrian question. 6. I have also persuaded the Prime Minister to study the possibility of finding special employment on public works for the unemployed Assyrians in Mosul town. This would be a further useful palliative if it can be arranged. I have, &amp;c. ARCHIBALD CLARK KERR.Department. P A R y MI I N JT1R Y NOTICE.

April 24, 1935 CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 2610/2/93] (C.167.1935.VII.) League of Nations : Settlement of the ^Yssyrians of Iraq. Report by the Representative of Spain.—(Received in Foreign Office, April 24.) FOR reasons that will be set out in a detailed report, to be circulated to the Council shortly, the Committee of the Council for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq has been forced to realise, much to its regret, that the settlement of the Assyrians in British Guiana, as proposed by the United Kingdom Government, is impracticable. The other offers made in response to the repeated appeals of the Council and the committee do not afford all the guarantees of success that the committee regard as indispensable, and have, therefore, had to be abandoned. With regard to the possibility of a more extensive settlement of Assyrians from Iraq in Syria, the French Government, as mandatory Power, explained, as soon as the committee was formed in 1933, the difficulties of various kinds which it thought would be involved. Since, however, the committee has not been able to find a place in which to settle the Assyrians anywhere else, and since it is essential that the question should be dealt with urgently, the committee has been obliged to revert to the idea of a settlement in Syria. For reasons both humanitarian and political, therefore, the committee' has pressed the French Government to accept, as permanent settlers in the mandated territories of the Levant, not only those Assyrians who are now provisionally settled there, but also those for whom the committee has to find a place of settlement—always on the understanding that they will be in no degree a charge upon the budget of the States of the Levant under French mandate. In response to this appeal, the French Government has supplied the committee with a variety of material relating to the question under consideration, and has intimated what material possibilities of settlement have already been recognised, and on what others no final opinion can be formed without further investigation. By a letter dated the 14th April the French Government has informed the chairman of the committee that, from the information available, it is now possible to contemplate, subject to arrangements to be made, enlarging the existing settle ment of 2,200 persons to 6,500. The investigations now proceeding will doubtless reveal wider possibilities which would be of benefit to such other Assyrians as may express a desire to leave Iraq. Nevertheless, the French Government in its above-mentioned letter said that it could not in practice respond to the appeal addressed to it without an official assurance by the Council that no burden would be placed either on the French budget or on the local budgets on account of the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria, and without a plan setting forth the means to be employed to obtain the sums required for this settlement.” The committee has always considered that the work of settlement could only be undertaken and carried out if sufficient sums were available as and when required. The committee will as soon as possible establish a detailed plan on this basis, in close co-operation with the Iraqi Government and the French Government. As regards the wish expressed that “ no burden should be placed either on the French budget or on the local budgets on account of the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria,” the committee has always held that no financial obligation in respect of the capital expenditure involved by the proposed settlement Geneva, April 17, 1935. [381 aa—1]2 operations or in respect of the subsistence of the settlers until they should be able to provide for themselves should be laid either on the French Government or on the States of the Levant under French mandate. In order to meet the wish expressed in the last paragraph of the French Government’s letter of the 14th April, 1935, I would request the Council to approve the attitude taken up by the committee in this connexion. I also ask the Council to authorise the Secretary-General to draw a further sum not exceeding 40,000 Swiss francs from the Working Capital Fund in accordance with article 33 (2) of the Financial Regulations; the total advances approved by the Council would thus be brought up to 110,000 fr. This credit of 40,000 fr. would serve to cover, among other expenditure preliminary to the carrying out of the plan, the cost of the journey of the chairman of the Council Committee to Iraq and Syria, which it was decided to undertake on the Bagdad Government’s invitation and which is regarded by the Iraqi Government and by the Council Committee as likely to facilitate negotia tions and contribute effectively to the realisation of the plan of settlement. It is understood that this advance will be refunded to the League of Nations out of the funds which are made available for the financing of the proposed action as a whole.* INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote , ,, No «^ &amp;o/ ana address— not to any ’person by name, mit to— “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. *' Sj . v.

CONFIDENTIAL. ! r p r , Section 3. ^ 1 - U O [E 2980/2/931 No. 1. Notes of the 43rd and 44th Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held in Berne on April 10 and 11, 1935.— (Received May 14.) (Confidential.) A MEETING had been called at the Spanish Legation at Berne for 10-30 a.m. on the 10th April. In a private conversation before the start of the meeting, the French representative gave M. Olivan a message from M. de St. Quentin to the effect that if the French Government failed to obtain satisfaction from the United Kingdom Government in a matter concerning the Egyptian debt, they would feel unable to give satisfaction to the United Kingdom Government by proceeding with the offer regarding the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria. The French representative made it clear that he was not personally in sympathy with this message, but had no choice but to carry out his instructions to deliver it. M. Olivan declared that he could not agree that the French Government could go back upon a firm offer made to the Council Committee and transmitted officially with the agreement of the French Govern ment to the Iraqi Government. The fulfilment of the agreement reached between the French Government and the Council Committee could not be made dependent upon negotiations which did not concern the Council Committee in any way. He must regard the understanding as still in being, and proposed to continue the work of the committee on that basis. The French representative then suggested that M. Olivan should telephone direct to M. de St. Quentin in Paris, and the formal meeting of the committee was adjourned to allow this to be done. M. Olivan then telephoned to M. de St. Quentin in the presence of the United Kingdom and French representatives and of M. Arocha and expressed his surprise at the message which had been communicated to him. M. de St. Quentin confirmed the message, and denied that any agreement could be said to exist between the French Government and the Council Committee pending the receipt of the French reply to the committee’s appeal of the 22nd March. M. Olivan strongly dissented from this view, and said that in his view a binding agreement had been reached in Paris, the confirmatory note being a mere formality. He pointed out that the French Government had communicated to the committee in Paris a memorandum which was to form the basis of the confirmatory note, and M. de St. Quentin had himself agreed that the committee could go ahead on the basis of this memorandum as though the note had been received. Furthermore, M. de St. Quentin had approved in principle the idea of issuing an immediate communique to the press, and the issue of such a communique had only been postponed in order to allow M. de Martel to return to his post in Syria and to take certain precautionary measures. Furthermore, with the consent of the French Government, the Iraqi Government had already been informed in confidence of the scheme for settlement in Syria, and the French memorandum on the subject had been communicated to that Government. In these circumstances it was impossible to conceive that the French Government could go back upon their offer. M. de St. Quentin said that he did not mean to imply that the French Government would go back upon it. At the same time he could not agree that any binding agreement yet existed. So far as the French Government were concerned, the matter was connected with other international questions. Also, the French Government had evidence of fresh Turkish objections to Assyrian settlement in the Khabur region. The whole matter therefore needed further careful consideration, and his advice was that M. Olivan should adjourn the meeting of the committee indefinitely. M. Olivan pointed out that it had been open to the French Government to suggest postponement of the meeting before the committee met. Instead they had sent their representative to attend a meeting, and the other members of the committee had come to Berne at some inconvenience to themselves. As regardsTurkish objections, they had been fully taken into account during the Paris conversations, and M. de St. Quentin had then stated that the Fi'ench Govern ment would proceed even in spite of possible Turkish objections. As to other international questions, M. Olivan repeated what he had already said. He added that if the French Government persisted in the view that no agreement existed, he might have no alternative but to refer the matter to the Council at the forthcoming special session in order to explain his own position and that of the committee. M. de St. Quentin’s attitude at this point appeared to change, and, while again stating that he could not agree with M. Olivan’s view, he said that he hoped to be in a position to send off the French reply to the committee’s appeal of the 22nd March in three days’ time. A formal meeting of the committee was held at 4 p.m. on the 10th April, when M. Olivan, without going into the details of his conversation with M. de St. Quentin, indicated that the situation was not much clearer, but that M. de St. Quentin had foreshadowed the receipt of the French note in three days’ time. The arguments which M. de St. Quentin had used had not convinced M. Olivan that the basis of the agreement reached in Paris had changed, and he thought that the committee was justified in continuing its work on that basis. This was agreed to, and, in view of the presence of Mr. Bieler, of the League Treasury, the committee proceeded forthwith to discuss a draft of regulations for financial control which had been prepared by the League Treasury. Mr. Bieler explained that the draft had been drawn up on the basis of regulations prepared in connexion with the Saar plebiscite. The first part of the draft concerned the presentation and approval of estimates. The United Kingdom Representative took the opportunity of stressing the necessity of reducing as far as possible the estimates which the French Govern ment had so far put forward. He pointed out that the present estimates were in excess of those contained in the scheme for settlement in Brazil, including sea transport. The committee was not, of course, in a position itself to estimate what expenditure would be necessary, but he hoped that the French Government would realise the difficulty of collecting the amounts which they had so far indicated, and would cut down expenditure to essentials. A point which he thought it necessary to establish at an early date was the minimum sum which must be paid down before any settlement could take place. The President asked whether the 10 million francs which the French Govern ment had mentioned as the probable cost of settling the first 4.300 persons must be paid down before anything could be done. The French Representative did not think so. M. de Martel was most anxious to avoid any charge on the Syrian budget, and had therefore stipulated that no settlement could take place until the necessary funds were actually available. He did not think, however, that M. de Martel intended it to be understood that the minimum sum must be 10 million francs. The President said that he thought the committee ought not to be too much hypnotised by the global figure quoted for settlement. His idea was that settle ment should be a continuous operation as and when the funds were available. A partial settlement might be better than nothing. The draft regulations were then considered in detail and a number of suggestions made. Objections were raised in particular to articles 2 and 3. Article 2 stated that the Secretary-General of the League would examine the estimates furnished by the French High Commissioner both for the immediate extension of the existing settlement and for the remainder of the operation when the necessary surveys had been conducted. The Secretary-General would then submit the estimates for approval to the Council Committee. The fear was expressed that this procedure would involve too much delay, and it was agreed that a provision should be inserted allowing the president of the committee, during his forthcoming journey, to approve on the spot if possible, after obtaining the concurrence of the Secretary-General by telegram, the estimates for the first phase of settlement, and to authorise this part of the operation to be put into effect. Article 3 as drafted stated that the settlement funds would be[406 o—3] b 2 3 furnished in the first place by the Government of Iraq and by other Governments r and also by contributions from private sources. It was agreed that this article should be worded so as to take into account the fact that no obligation rested upon other Governments, as it did upon the Iraqi Government, and that other ^ Governments and private organisations would only be called upon to furnish the balance which might be required to supplement the contribution of the Iraqi Government. It was agreed that a modified draft of the regulations should be considered at a later stage. It was also agreed that when the modified draft had received the provisional approval of the committee, it should be sent before its official adoption to the French High Commissioner in Syria through the French Government. It could be intimated to the French High Commissioner that the committee was prepared to take into account any observations which he might wish to make. The secretary of the committee was then asked to draw up a list of the points of detail which it remained to consider, and the committee adjourned till the following afternoon to give time for the private consideration of some of these points. The list drawn up by the secretary is annexed. When the committee met to consider it, its first act was formally to approve the action of the president in accepting the invitation of the Iraqi Government to proceed to Bagdad. It was agreed that it would be in the first place advisable for the president to go to Beirut so as to arrive in Bagdad armed with the fullest possible information regarding the views of the French High Commissioner on various points. The question of the powers of the president was discussed, and on the proposal of the United Kingdom representative it was agreed to give M. Olivan the widest discretion to reach decisions so far as possible on the spot. It was recognised to be impossible for the committee to give anything like definite instructions, and it was agreed that the utmost which it could do was to give the president certain indications of its provisional views on various points for his guidance, in the shape of a memorandum, the terms of which would be considered at the committee’s next meeting in Geneva. The President then explained the procedure which he proposed to adopt vis-d-vis of the Iraqi Government regarding its financial contribution. He would, of course, endeavour in Beirut to secure a reduction of the present estimated cost of settlement. Assuming, however, that on his arrival in Bagdad he could still only quote as the estimated cost of the whole operation the 60 million French francs now mentioned by the French Government, he would propose in the first place to ask the Iraqi Government, how much of this hypothetical total they would be prepared to pay. He would recall the undertakings which Iraq had given in this respect, and also her practical interest in seeing that the scheme was rapidly carried out. No doubt Iraq ought to pay the whole cost, but the difficulties were obvious. M. Olivan proposed, however, to press for a contribution of 50 per cent, of the total cost, though he would be prepared to bargain. Having fixed in this manner Iraq’s total hypothetical contribution, M. Olivan would then endeavour to obtain from the Iraqi Government, in the form of a lump sum payment, the amount which he might have agreed upon with the French High Commissioner as necessary for the commencement of the first phase of the settle ment operation. The difference between this lump sum payment and the total hypothetical contribution might be expressed in the form of a percentage of the cost of the remainder of the operation, and the Iraqi Government would be asked to promise to pay that percentage of whatever the remainder of the operation might, in practice, cost. The committee indicated its approval of this general plan of action. A discussion then took place on the question whether the Assyrians should be asked to contribute to, or to refund eventually, the cost of their settlement. The committee was united in doubting whether it would, in practice, be possible to obtain substantial sums from the Assyrians either as reimbursement or in the form of initial contribution. The president took the view that it was unfair, on account of the special circumstances leading up to their resettlement, to ask those Assyrians who elected to migrate to pay the cost. Furthermore, the Syrian scheme varied from the schemes hitherto examined in that for various reasons it was unlikely that land could be allotted in permanent ownership to individual Assyrians for at least four years.Doubt was expressed by some members of the committee whether the prospects of reimbursement were in any case sufficiently good to justify the administrative measures which they would involve. The Mexican Representative raised the question whether by waiving reimbursement the committee might not be setting up an undesirable precedent which might lead to trouble with other minorities or refugees. The Italian Representative suggested that a percentage of the taxes collected from the Assyrians might be devoted to reimbursement. The President thought, however, that for some time at least the Assyrians would probably be exempt from taxation. The Italian Representative took the view that to waive a contribution or reimbursement would be unwise when it was uncertain where the funds for settlement were to come from. The United Kingdom Representative expressed the view that the points raised by the Mexican and Italian representatives were of considerable importance and deserved careful examination. The factor of reimbursement might be an important one in the raising of the necessary funds. After further discussion it was decided to leave the whole question of Assyrian financial participation open for the time being, and to invite the president to study it locally in all its bearings and to make a reasoned recommen dation to the committee after obtaining the best available advice. The composition of the local commission in Iraq was next discussed. The President took the view that changed circumstances might necessitate modifica tions in its composition. Apart from the question whether its present composition was the most suitable for the purpose now in hand, the French Government desired that a representative of the High Commission in Syria should join the committee. Moreover, when the participation of a Nansen representative had been originally contemplated, the Nansen Office had in mind for this office M. Cuenod. M. Cuenod was now available, but was no longer serving the Nansen Office, and the Nansen Office had apparently no suitable substitute. In these circumstances it seemed best, in view' of the degree of responsibility which the committee had taken for the Syrian scheme, that M. Cuenod should join the local committee as the direct representative of the Council Committee, rather than of the Nansen Office. M. Olivdn proposed to attempt to arrange this. The French Representative confirmed that the French Government attached importance to the participation of a French delegate—possibly the French consul at Mosul—in the work of the local committee. The French Government feared that otherwise there might be admitted into Syria a number of Assyrians who were not indigenous to Iraq but had come into the country from Persia for this purpose. It was agreed to ask the Nansen Office to lend the services of M. Burnier to co-operate with the French High Commission, and a letter to the chairman of the Governing Body of the Nansen Office on this subject was approved. M. Arocha read out a draft communique which might be issued upon the arrival of the French reply to the committee’s note of the 22nd March. It was agreed to postpone the consideration of this communique until the next meeting at Geneva.[406 o—2J b THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT f * M M 4 * S A EASTERN (Iraq).

ON the circulation of the French note referred to by the president at the previous meeting, it had been found that in the final paragraph the French Government had stated that they could not in practice respond to the appeal of the Council Committee without an official assurance by the Council that no burden would be placed either upon the French budget or upon the local budgets on account of the settlement of the Assyrians in Syria, and without a plan setting forth the means to be employed to obtain the sums required for this settlement (see Document C 165.M.91.1935.VII). The president of the committee had there fore decided to take advantage of the extraordinary session of the Council to obtain the necessary approval, and at the last meeting of the extraordinary session on the 17th April the Council had approved a report on the subject by its rapporteur (Document C 167.1935.VII). The present meeting of the committee was held immediately after the close of the Council meeting. The committee agreed that, in view of the publicity given to the Syrian scheme at the Council meeting, there was no longer any need for the issue of a communique. The draft message to the Assyrians was then considered. Certain amend ments were suggested, and it was left to the president to approve the precise wording of the message which the United Kingdom representative undertook to prepare. A copy of the message as eventually approved by the president and communicated to the Iraqi permanent delegate is attached as Annex A. The committee then adopted the following documents: (1) A reply to the French Government’s note of the 14th April (Annex B); (2) a note to the United Kingdom Government regarding the results of the investigation into British Guiana project (Annex C); (3) a resolution authorising the president’s journey to Syria and Iraq, and covering a memorandum for his guidance (Annex D). To this memorandum were attached the draft regulations for financial control already approved provisionally by the committee at its preceding meeting. M. Shabandar, the Iraqi delegate, attended a part of the meeting and was acquainted with the terms of the note addressed to the French Government and with the substance of the proposed message to the Assyrians. It was arranged that the message in its final form should be communicated to him as soon as possible, and he was asked to forward it to his Government, making it clear that the committee had, as in previous cases, prepared it solely in order to assist the Iraqi Government, and that it was left to the latter to decide upon the utility of its communication to the Assyrians.

The committee appointed by the Council of the League of Nations to deal with the resettlement of the Assyrians of Iraq who may wish to leave that country is now able to announce that the French Government, as mandatory Power in Syria, has consented in response to a pressing appeal by the committee to provide certain lands for the purpose of permanent settlement in Syria.

League of Nations, Sir, Geneva, April 18, 1935. I have the honour to invite a reference to the letter of the 22nd September in which your Excellency was good enough to draw the attention of the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq to the prospects of settlement in the Rupununi district of British Guiana. The committee has recently had under consideration the report submitted by the mission which, in accordance with the suggestion made in the above- mentioned letter, it sent to investigate the area in question. Unfortunately, this report reveals the existence of serious difficulties which render it impracticable to form a reliable opinion as to the number of persons who could eventually be settled satisfactorily in the area in question and which, in the judgment of the mission, would make it necessary, in the case of the Assyrians, accustomed as they are to very different conditions of life, to proceed in the first place, by way of an experiment of very limited scope, over an uncertain number of years. The committee has thus been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that settlement in British Guiana cannot be regarded as offering a solution of the large and urgent problem which it has been asked to assist in solving. The committee appreciates the spirit in which the offer of settlement in British Guiana was put forward by the United Kingdom Government and it greatly regrets that it should be impossible to proceed further with the matter. I would ask you to be good enough to communicate its conclusion to the Government of British Guiana, together with an expression of the committee’s sincere appreciation of the attitude of that Government and of the Legislature of the Colony towards the project of Assyrian settlement. In particular, the committee desires to record its thanks for the unsparing assistance which' was afforded to General Browne and Signor Giglioli in the execution of their difficult task. I have, &amp;c. J. LOPEZ OLIVAN. President of the Committee for the Settle ment of the Assyrians of Iraq. Annex D. Resolution adopted by the Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq April 17, 1935. The Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq authorises his Excellency M. Lopez Olivan, its president, to proceed at his earliest convenience to Syria and to Iraq for the purpose of making on its behalf, in direct consultation with the High Commissioner for the French mandated territories of the Levant and with the Iraqi Government, all arrangements necessary to facilitate the rapid realisation of a scheme for settling in Syria those Assyrians who may wish to leave Iraq.V 4 For the guidance of its president, the committee adopts the attached memorandum as an indication of its views regarding various points with which he may have to deal. It recognises, however, that decisions on these points and on any others which may arise in connexion with the settlement operation contemplated will depend upon a variety of local considerations which the committee is not in a position to weigh in Geneva. While recommending M. Lopez Olivan, therefore, to be guided so far as possible by the attached memorandum, it entrusts him with the fullest discretion to take such decisions as he may consider necessary in the light of local conditions. Memorandum regarding the Impending Visit to Syria and Iraq of M. Lopez Olivdn, President of the Council Committee for the Settlement of the Assyrians of Iraq. The Council of the League of Nations by its adoption on the 14th October, 1933, of its rapporteur's report on the Assyrian question delegated wide powers to the committee provided for in that report, and directed that, if the committee found it possible in practice to settle outside Iraq those Assyrians who might wish to leave that country, it should take, in consultation with the Iraqi Government, all such steps as it might think fit with a view to the preparation and execution of a detailed scheme of settlement. The main object of the journey which the committee has now asked its president to undertake is to collaborate with the Iraqi Government with a view to the fulfilment of this part of the committee’s task. The Iraqi Government will doubtless expect the president of the committee, on his arrival in Bagdad, to be in a position to furnish full details regarding the projected Assyrian settlement in Syria from both the material and financial stand points. The committee considers, therefore, that it would be advisable for M. Lopez Olivan to proceed in the first place to Beirut for the purpose of consulting the French High Commissioner on the following points :— Mode of Settlement. Information is required in the first place regarding the precise situation and extent of the lands which the French authorities are prepared to place at the disposal of the Assyrians. Details concerning the physical characteristics of the lands in question and their agricultural and pastoral potentialities would be valuable, as it will be necessary to place the local committee in Iraq in a position to give full explanations to the Assyrians when the time comes to consult their wishes regarding migration to Syria. It will be desirable to ascertain also in what manner it is proposed to settle the Assyrians, that is to say whether the various tribes will, so far as possible, be kept together, whether land will in the first place be allotted in common to groups of Assyrians or whether it will be allotted provisionally to each individual family, pending the completion of arrangements regarding permanent ownership, and how much land will be allotted to each group or family. Provision of Agricultural Implements, Seed and Stock. An important point to be settled with the French authorities is whether arrangements should be made for the Assyrians to bring with them from Iraq, so far as possible, the animals and agricultural implements which they now possess. If so, it will be necessary to consider the means of transporting these possessions and of ensuring their security in transit. In the contrary case, it will be desirable to ascertain what provision the French authorities propose to make for furnishing each Assyrian family with the means of gaining an agricultural or pastoral livelihood. The committee notes, in passing, that if the Assyrians bring with them from Iraq their own animals and implements, the result should be to decrease considerably the estimated cost of settlement in Syria, though against this saving would have to be set the greater cost of transport.5 Provision for Women and Children without Support. There are at present in Iraq a number of women and children whose supporters were killed in the troubles of 1933. So far as the committee is aware, these women and children without support are for the most part, at present, in a camp at Mosul, maintained at the expense of the Iraqi Government. ^ The committee assumes that the segregation of these women and children will not be continued in Syria, and it is for consideration whether it would not be possible, after their transfer to that country, to distribute them among villages allotted to the tribes to which they belong and to make special arrangements for their support by the future inhabitants of those villages. 'Non-Agricultural Employment. The majority of the Assyrians are stated to be agricultural or pastoral people who have a traditional love of the land and whose ambition it is to become landowners. A certain number, however, follow other occupations—such as carpenters, blacksmiths, builders and weavers of cloth, and it will be prudent to consider what prospects of a livelihood exist in Syria for such persons. It will be noted that these occupations are for the most part connected with village life and it is to be hoped that arrangements can be made for those who follow them to be usefully employed in connexion with the development of the proposed settlement. Medical Services. It will be desirable to enquire what arrangements the French authorities propose to make for the care of the health of the Assyrian immigrants. Status of the A ssyrians in Syria. It may not be possible to settle immediately the question of the eventual nationality of the Assyrians after their migration into Syria and perhaps this point will not in any case possess the same importance as it would have done in, for instance, the Brazilian scheme. Nevertheless, a preliminary and non committal discussion of the question with the French High Commissioner may be valuable. It would be useful to ascertain the position in this respect of other members of minority communities who may have migrated into Syria from adjacent countries. (Note. —The national status of the Assyrians in Iraq appears to be somewhat obscure. While some, and perhaps even the majority, undoubtedly possess Iraqi nationality, others do not appear to have fulfilled the necessary conditions for its automatic acquisition in virtue of the provisions of the Treaty of Lausanne, or to have taken steps to obtain it since by naturalisa tion. Technically, therefore, a number of the Assyrians of Iraq may be stateless. On the other hand, the committee understands that in practice all of them are treated by the Iraqi Government as Iraqi nationals, with the exception of those who possess Persian nationality (with whom, it is to be noted in passing, the committee is not concerned, since it is open to them to return to Persia if they desire to leave Iraq). It is desirable, therefore, that if the question is broached at all with the Iraqi Government, it should be broached with great discretion, lest the result may be to lead the Iraqi Government to repudiate all responsibility for the migration of those regarding whose Iraqi nationality any technical doubt may exist.) Civil and Religious Rights. The existence of the mandate for Syria should be a sufficient assurance to the Assyrians in regard to these rights. This instrument provides for complete religious liberty and gives to each community, subject to general control by the mandatory authorities, the right to manage its religious affairs and to maintain its own schools for the instruction of its members in its own language. No doubt the Assyrians will be treated on an equal footing with Syrian nationals in matters such as access to law courts, public education and taxation, but it may be desirable for purposes of information to clear up the position in this respect and to ascertain in particular how far the Assyrians will be able to employ their■■■■ ■■■■■ G own language in the law courts and for other official purposes; whether they will be allowed to continue to settle personal status matters in accordance with the customs and usage of the community, and whether it is the intention of the French authorities to embody these points in a special law regulating their status. Organisation of Settlement Operation in Syria. It will be desirable to ascertain the intentions of the French authorities regarding the organisation of the whole operation in Syria, i.e., whether they propose to entrust it to M. Burnier alone, working under the direct supervision of the High Commissioner, or whether they propose to establish a committee analogous to that which, in virtue of the committee’s resolution of the 31st October, 1933, will make the necessary arrangements for the departure from Iraq of those Assyrians who wish to leave. Whatever the organisation in Syria, it will be necessary to make arrangements for effective liaison with that set up in Iraq. It would facilitate the consideration with the French authorities of all the above technical details if M. Lopez Olivan could be accompanied by someone with personal knowledge of the present situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. The committee recommends, therefore, that arrangements should be made, if possible, for Major Thomson to be available for this purpose in an advisory capacity. Finance. This will be the most important point to discuss in Syria as it will be in Iraq. Up to now the French Government have given only general indications of the cost both of the first phase of settlement, i.e., the transfer of 4,300 persons, and of the total operation. The committee recommends that M. Lopez Olivan should impress upon the French High Commissioner {a) the vital necessity of scaling down the estimates to the lowest possible limit owing to the evident difficulty of obtaining the necessary funds; (b) the importance of the strictest control over expenditure in order to be able to satisfy on this head those who will be asked to subscribe to the scheme. In connexion with the first point, it will be necessary to establish the minimum sum which, in the view of the High Commissioner, must be subscribed before any part of the operation can commence, and it is desirable that M. Lopez Olivan, on his arrival in Iraq, should be in a position to place before the Iraqi Government an estimate of this preliminary sum showing in detail the various items which compose it. In connexion with the second point, the Council committee has, in consulta tion with the Secretariat of the League, drawn up the attached draft regulations for financial control. A copy of these draft regulations has already been transmitted to the French Government for communication to the High Commis sioner, and it is hoped that the latter will be in a position, on the arrival of M. Lopez Olivan at Beirut, to formulate any observations which he may have to make on this subject. The draft has been provisionally approved by the Council committee, but the latter is fully prepared to take into account the observations of the High Commissioner before the final adoption of the regulations. Meanwhile, it draws attention to that part of article 2 of the draft which authorises M. Lopez Olivan, in certain circumstances and after obtaining the prior concurrence of the Secretary-General, to approve forthwith the estimates put forward by the High Commissioner for the first phase of the settlement operation. M. Lopez Olivan will no doubt think it well to obtain, for the infor mation of the Treasury of the League of Nations, details of the manner in which expenditure on Assyrian settlement will be controlled (see articles 9 and 10 of the draft regulations). The committee leaves it to M. Lopez Olivan to decide whether a visit by him to the area proposed for Assyrian settlement would be advisable before he proceeds to Iraq. In Iraq the main tasks will be— (1) To press the Iraqi Government to make the largest possible financial contribution towards the Assyrian settlement scheme and to arrange the manner in which that contribution is to be paid.(2) To arrange, in consultation with the Iraqi Government and the president of the local committee set up by the Council committee’s resolution of the 31st October, 1933, the manner in which the scheme for settlement in Syria is to be laid before the Assyrians and the wishes of the latter ascertained as regards migration to Syria. (3) To fix in the same way the general principles on which the transfer to Syria of those Assyrians who elect to leave Iraq shall be carried out, including arrangements for the liquidation of that part of their property which is not to be transferred with them to Syria. Financial Contribution of Iraqi Government. The Council’s rapporteur in his report to the Council of the 19th January. 1934, stated rightly that: “There can, indeed, be no doubt that the Iraqi Government’s contribution will be the most important factor in the success of any emigration plan.” It is to be anticipated that a great many difficulties will be encountered in obtaining a substantial contribution. Such a contribution will be unpopular with nationalist opinion in Iraq and that the Iraqi Government will be obliged to take this opinion into account. Considerable persuasion will no doubt be necessary, therefore^ to induce them to make a reasonable contribu tion, and it may be that they will be unwilling to commit themselves to any definite sum until the number of Assyrians desirous to migrate has been ascertained, the necessary surveys in Syria completed and the total cost of the whole operation thus definitely established. Again, it is possible that the Iraqi Government may attempt to defer a decision regarding their own contribution until some idea can be obtained of the amounts likely to be forthcoming from other sources. To take the last point first, it is important to distinguish clearly between the Iraqi contribution and that which may be forthcoming from other sources, since the two are by no means on the same plane. The efforts which the Council committee has made to find a destination for the Assyrians of Iraq have their origin in a request by the Iraqi Government that the League should help them to solve this problem by finding land on which the Assyrians could settle. The task is one which the League was under no obligation to assume, and, in fact, in accepting it, the Council went outside the ordinary sphere of the protection of minorities. No doubt the Council will be glad to take such measures as it properly can to assist in the raising of funds for a work of humanitarian importance. But, again, it must be emphasised that no obligation lies upon it in this respect, whereas the Iraqi Government not only has a moral obligation arising from the circumstances in which the transfer of the Assyrians from Iraq came to be envisaged, but also is definitely committed by promises which its representatives have made in Geneva. Yasin Pasha closed his speech to the Council on the 14th October, 1933, with the following words : “ In the interests of all concerned, the happiness of the Assyrians themselves and the reputation of Iraq, it was essential to find a new home elsewhere for the Assyrian immigrants who wished to leave or were unwilling to settle peaceably and to be incorporated finally into the Iraqi State, a home where they could make a fresh start. The Iraqi Government was prepared to make its contribution, as generous a contribution as its resources permitted, to help them on their way. There was one thing it could not do, and that was to find land. That could only be done by the League of Nations, and to it his Government appealed.” This promise of a generous contribution has since been reiterated several times by the representa tives of Iraq in Geneva. M. Lopez Olivan will no doubt also think it well to base his representations on the fact that the solution of the problem is, above all, in the interests of Iraq herself. This, again, was recognised by Yasin Pasha in his speech to the Council from which the above quotation was taken. In any case, it is impossible to give the Iraqi Government any indication at present of the amount which can be raised from other sources. The Council, in its resolution of the 19th January, 1934, appealed to the generosity of Govern ments and private organisations to consider the possibility, more particularly on humanitarian grounds, of participating in the financing of a settlement scheme. This appeal, however, has necessarily remained in abeyance in the absence of a detailed scheme, and, though it is the intention of the Council committee tomam 8 reinforce it at the proper moment, it will, of course, require some little time to collect funds in this way. It is most desirable, however, that there shall be no avoidable delay in the commencement of the settlement of the first 4,300 Assyrians whom the French Government are prepared to receive as soon as the necessary funds can be obtained. But it is clear that there will inevitably be delay unless the Iraqi Government are ^ prepared to finance this first phase of the operation without assistance from elsewhere. To sum up, the objects to be aimed at in this part of the negotiation are :— (d) To avoid delay in the commencement of the initial phase of settlement; (b) To ensure, if possible, that the Iraqi contribution shall not be limited to the cost of this initial phase; and (c) To overcome the possible contention of the Iraqi Government that they cannot reach any decision whatever as regards their own financial con tribution until the cost of the entire operation and the amount likely to be contributed by other sources are definitely known. The manner of approach can only be decided by M. Lopez Olivan in the light of conditions as he finds them on arrival in Iraq. The committee suggests, how ever, that he should, in the first place, ask the Iraqi Government, on the assumption that the whole operation will cost 60 million French francs, to indicate how much of this total they would be prepared to pay. It will be borne in mind that Iraq is relatively prosperous, having no debts and receiving in addition to ordinary sources of revenue, substantial annual pay ments from oil companies operating in the country. The committee considers, therefore, that the Iraqi Government could reasonably be asked to bear at least 50 per cent, of the total cost. It recognises, however, that considerable bargaining on this point may be necessary and that it may not be politically practicable to obtain a contribution of this size. At whatever figure the total hypothetical con tribution is eventually fixed, however, the committee suggests that M. Lopez Olivan should then endeavour to obtain, from the Iraqi Government, in the form of a lump sum payment, the amount which he may have agreed upon with the French High Commissioner as necessary for the commencement of the first phase of the settlement operation. The difierence between this lump sum payment and the hypothetical total amount which the Iraqi Government would be prepared to contribute could be compared with the estimated total cost of the remainder of the operation and expressed in the form of a percentage. The Iraqi Government might then be asked to give a formal promise to pay that percentage of whatever the remainder of the operation might, in practice, cost. It will be necessary to arrange for the payment of the initial contribution of the Iraqi Government either direct to the League of Nations or into an account to be opened by the League with some bank in Syria. It will also be necessary to reach an understanding as regards the time and manner of the payment of subsequent contributions. Consultation of the Wishes of the Assyrians and Arrangements for their Transfer. As a preliminary to the detailed consideration of these points, it will be necessary to fix the composition of the local committee which is to execute this part of the work. According to the Council committee’s resolution of the 31st October, 1933, the local committee was to consist of— (1) The Land Settlement Expert (Major Thomson), as president. (2) An Administrative Inspector (hitherto Major Wilson). (3) A representative of the Nansen Office, appointed by that office in agree ment with the president of the Council committee. (4) The interested kaimakam or Nahiya mudir. (5) The Assyrian village headman concerned. When the composition of this committee was agreed upon with the Iraqi Government, it was anticipated that once a destination had been found, the work of settlement would be entrusted to the Nansen Office. For various reasons this is not now the most expedient or practicable course, and it is considered desirable that the third member of the committee should, if possible, be the direct repre sentative of the Council committee. The latter would propose to designate for'8 9 the position M. Guenod, a technical expert until recently employed by the Nansen Office. It will be necessary, however, in the first place, to obtain the concurrence of the Iraqi Government in this change. It is understood also that the French Government wish to be directly represented on this committee, probably in the person of the French consul in Mosul. Having agreed upon the revised constitution of the local committee, the first objective will be to agree, in consultation with its president and with the Iraqi authorities, on the manner in which the committee shall consult the wishes of the Assyrians. An important point for decision is whether this consultation must be entirely carried out before any conclusion can be reached as to which of the Assyrians shall first be transferred; or whether the wishes of a certain group can first be consulted, and that group transferred so far as it wishes to leave, while the consultation of the remainder of the Assyrians is simultaneously carried out. It will be remembered that M. Burnier has recommended that, if possible, the first group to be transferred shall belong to those tribes already represented in the provisional settlement now existing in Syria. If this plan is adhered to, it may be that those Assyrians now in the refugee camp at Mosul, or in a semi-destitute condition in the town of Mosul, may be eligible for transfer in the first place, and their immediate transfer might greatly relieve the situation in Iraq. Once the manner of consultation has been decided, it will be desirable to draw up, again in consultation with the Iraqi authorities and Major Thomson, the terms of a document, explaining the Syrian scheme in detail, which could be placed before the Assyrians by the local committee when consulting their wishes regarding emigration. The Council committee considers it important that, inter alia, this document shall make it clear that all the Assyrians of Iraq, other than those of Persian nationality who are thus free to return to Persia should they be dissatisfied with conditions of life in Iraq, are entirely free to choose whether or not to take advantage of the facilities offered by the French Government in Syria. On the other hand, it will equally be necessary to make it clear, as provided in the report adopted by the Council on the 14th October, 1933, that while those Assyrians who elect to remain in Iraq will be regarded as a minority to which the provisions of the Iraqi declaration of the 30th May, 1932, on the protection of minorities will be applicable, they will further be bound to Iraq by the obligations of loyalty to the State recalled by the Assembly in its resolution of the 21st September, 1922. (Copies of this resolution and of the Iraqi declaration of the 30th May, 1932, are annexed^ 1 )) The committee suggests that M. Lopez Olivan should take the opportunity of his visit to Bagdad to lay down in principle a programme of transfer, i.e., the size of the various groups to be transferred, the order in which they are to leave and the intervals between their departure, taking into account that for climatic reasons emigration is said to be impossible for six weeks in the summer and again after the end of September. There remains the important question of the liquidation of that part of the property of the Assyrians which it is not practicable to transport into Syria. The committee does not feel able to give any guidance on this point or on the actual details of transfer, as these must naturally depend entirely on local conditions and M. Lopez Olivan will wish to be guided by the advice of the members of the local committee and by that of the Iraqi Government. The committee notes that a point which will require special consideration is the disposal of the arms which the Assyrians at present possess. Possibility of a Financial Contribution by the Assyrians. In the earlier stages of its work, the Council committee contemplated that part of the funds required for the settlement operation might be obtained from the Assyrians themselves in the form of an eventual reimbursement or even, in the case of the more prosperous members of the community, in that of an initial contribution. The principle of reimbursement, it may be noted, is normally applied by the Nansen Office in settling refugees, and in the committee’s resolution of the 31st October, 1933, it was contemplated that one of the tasks of the local committee in Iraq set up by that resolution would be to take measures with a view to the participation by intending emigrants in the cost of their p) Not printed. Ctransport and resettlement. In the Council committee’s report to the Council in January 1934, the following passage occurred :— The committee also agrees with a suggestion made by the representative of Iraq that the Assyrian population itself might provide part of the necessary funds. In any scheme of settlement it is customary to arrange for the expenses to be repaid by the settlers in the more or less near future. Since, however, according to the committee’s information, the Assyrians are not all destitute, those of them who own some property could undertake to defray part of the expenses from the outset. The committee proposes to go carefully into this question at its later meetings. It would point out here and now, however, that such participation by the Assyrians themselves cannot be contemplated unless guarantees can be obtained that the Assyrians will be able to dispose of their property in Iraq at reasonable prices. Such an operation will necessarily involve active and generous intervention on the part of the Iraqi Government.” The report from which this extract is taken was adopted by the Council, together with a report by the Council’s rapporteur, which said that: “Moreover, the Council will certainly agree to authorise the committee to study carefully the question of the payment of part of the expenditure by the Assyrian population itself.” The question of an Assyrian contribution has recently been re-examined by the committee, when it was recognised that it must be considered in the light of certain changes in the situation. In the first place, the Syrian scheme varies from those hitherto explored in that, owing to the need for a detailed survey, it is unlikely that land can be allotted in permanent ownership to individual Assyrians for some four years. In the second place, the upkeep of a section of the Assyrians who have been in a needy condition in Iraq for the past eighteen months has presumably constituted a serious drain on the resources of the more prosperous members of the community. It is perhaps doubtful, therefore, whether initial contributions at all events can reasonably be demanded, and the feeling of the committee is that it is probably not practicable in any case to assess and collect them. On the question of eventual reimbursement, two currents of opinion have manifested themselves in the committee. Some members incline to the view that it is unfair on account of the special circumstances which have led up to the resettlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq, that those who elect to migrate should be required to pay the cost. Others, on the contrary, feel that such charity amounts to pauperisation, and is not in the best interests of the Assyrians themselves. They feel, also, that it would create an undesirable precedent, which might be the beginning of trouble with other minorities or refugees, not only in Syria but elsewhere. In the circumstances, the committee has decided to leave the whole question of Assyrian financial participation open for the time being, and to invite M.

Situation of those Assyrians who may remain in Iraq. The report adopted by the Council on the 14th October, 1933, provided that, in addition to arranging the settlement outside Iraq of those Assyrians who wished to leave that country, the committee might examine, in consultation with the Iraqi Government and on the basis of reports furnished by the latter, the measures taken by that Government in order to give full effect to the Council’s resolution of the 15th December, 1933, in the case of those Assyrians who might wish to remain in Iraq. Though specific action in this sense may be premature at the present stage, the committee would appreciate any information which M. Lopez Olivan may be able to obtain as to the intentions of the Iraqi Govern ment in regard to this aspect of the Assyrian problem.

ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. 22 3 0MAY1935 FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AND SECRET DEPT. INDIA OFFICE Simitar letter se7it to &lt; 2 ^.*. 14—6130 10950(2)THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT Record of the Qbth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held in Geneva on Afrit 16, 1935.— (Received May 14.) THE President announced that the French reply to the committee’s note of the 22nd March had now been received. The reply would be circulated as soon as possible, but, so far as the President could see from a hasty perusal, it followed the lines of what had been agreed upon in Paris. He asked the French representative to communicate the thanks of the committee to his Government. The President suggested that the committee should now discuss the draft communique which had been read out at the previous meeting. The French Representative explained that he had sent a copy of the draft to Paris on the previous day, but the Quai d’Orsay had thought it necessary to refer it by telegram to Beirut. The view of the Quai d’Orsay appeared to be that the communique was too detailed in its references to Syria, and they would probably suggest a shorter draft. He hoped to have an early definite reply, but must ask in the meantime for the discussion to be postponed. The United Kingdom Representative then read the draft of a message which the committee might send to the Iraqi Government for communication, if the latter thought fit, to the Assyrians, in order to insure against any premature movement on their part while the details of settlement in Syria were being worked out. As the terms of this message depended to some extent on those of the draft communique, it was decided that its consideration must also be postponed. A redraft of the regulations for financial control, prepared in accordance with the observations made at the meetings of the committee in Berne, was considered. The United Kingdom Representative drew attention to articles 5 and 6 of the draft, which provided that the advances made by the Secretary-General of the League to the High Commissioner could at any time exceed the funds available for settlement, and that the funds of the League could not be used either for recoverable or irrecoverable expenses. The United Kingdom representative expressed the view that these provisions were too rigid. Circumstances might arise where settlement funds might be perhaps temporarily lacking, whereas the emergency might be one which the League could not well ignore. M. Bieber strongly opposed any modification of these articles, and no support was forthcoming for the suggestion of the United Kingdom representative. The President said that he did not think that suggestion should be pressed. The Council could, of course, in case of need, override existing regulations. The draft was accordingly adopted provisionally, and it was agreed that it should form an annex to the memorandum which was being drawn up for the President’s guidance during his visit to Syria and Iraq. The President then withdrew, and the remainder of the committee proceeded to draw up recommendations to the Secretary-General regarding the financial aspect of the President’s journey, with particular reference to the allowances to be paid to the President and to M. Arocha, and to the stenographer who would accompany them. CONFIDENTIAL. EASTERN (Iraq). May 14, 1935. Section 1. [E 2981/2/93] No. 1. [406 o—l]3:n5 1000 12,34 IV Department. PARLIAMENTARY NOTICE.

Sir J. SIMON : The project of settling Assyrian refugees in Syria is about to be further explored locally by the President of the Committee of the League of Nations Council which is dealing with the matter, in consultation with the kiench authorities and the Iraqi Govern ment. As regards British Guiana, the President of the Council Committee has addressed to His Majesty’s Government a letter in which he explains that the report of the League of Nations Mission of Investigation sent to that Colony has revealed the existence of serious diffi culties. These rendered it impossible to 01 m a reliable opinion regarding the number of persons who could be settled satisfactorily in the area contemplated, and m the judgment of the mission would make it necessary, seeing that the Assyrians are accustomed to very different conditions of life, to proceed in tie first place by way of an experiment 0 veiy limited scope over an uncertain number of years. The President added that the Committee has therefore been reluctantly forced to the conclusion that settlement in British Guiana cannot be regarded as offering a solution of the large and urgent problem which it has been asked to assist in solving.

The matter was laid before the Council of the League at its session of April 17 when the Council approved the action of the Committee and the steps which the latter now proposes to take in co-operation with the French cuid Iraqi Governments to prepare a detailed scheme.

French note received last night follows general lines agreed, upon in Paris hut contains a final paragraph to the effect that the French Government could not in practice respond to the appeal addressed to them without (a) an oificial assurance by the Council that no burden would be placed either on the French budget or on the local budget, and (b) a plan showing the steps to be taken to collect the necessary funds. It was therefore arranged for Assyrian question to come before Council to-day. The rapporteur, after informing the Council that British Guiana scheme had been found impracticable and that other offers had had to be abandoned, announced oyrian scheme in words given in my immediately following telegram. He then dealt with final paragraph of French note. He stated Committee’s view that work of settlement could only bo ’ undertaken and carried out if sufficient funds were available as and when required, and said that Committee would as soon as possible establish a detailed plan on this basis in co-operation with Iraqi and French Governments. Furthermore' the Committee held that no financial obligation in respect of. the capital expenditure involved by the proposed settlement operations, or in respect of the subsistence of the settlers until • &lt;r • • e/ 'N. 2 . until self-supporting 3 should he laict either on nVench Government or on mandated territories.

I expressed regret that suggested settlement in British Guiana should have come to nothing, hut alter paying tribute to work of mission of investigation said that in the light of its report it v/^s impossible for His majesty’s Government not to agree v.dth the conclusion of the Council Committee that the region in question, whatever its potentialities of ultimate development, could not be regal dad as offering sufficiently assured or sulliciently rapid solution of the exceptional problem whicn the .a-Syrian question presented. This problem had not diminished in importance or urgency with the lapse of time anu I there!oro expressed gratitude to French Government for their readiness to do their utmost to assist the League in its solution in spite of local difficulties. Finally, I wished success to m. Olivan in his mission to ..,yria and Iraq. Turkish representative, who had at first eeen inclixiod to demand that there should be no settlement within one hundred kilometres of Turkish frontier but had been persuaded to say something less categorical, then stated, altei expressing appreciation of Assyrian Committee's efforts, that it would be desirable in the interests oi the A Syrians themselves and of the populations of neighbouring countries that settlement should take place at a distance o± one hundred kilometres from the frontiers of neighbouring countries....5. couiiorios, the place of final settlement 'being in any cas^ iiot less tnm xiity kilonietres from these frontiers- French representative referred to bon voisinage treaty v/ith furkey, which contained provision regarding estaiolishment or political refugees on either side of frontier. r'rench Govei'nment desired faithfully to discharge its obligations under that treaty and could not ol course agree to any settlement plan which would imply any derogation from the treaty except with the approval of Turkey.

Following is oassage from Rapporteur’s report concerning Syria referred to in my immediately preceding telegram ■ith regard to the possibility of a more extensive settle ment of Assyrians from Iraq in Syria, the French Government, as mandatory Power, explained, as soon as the Committee was formed in 1955, the difficulties of various kinds which it thought would be involved. Since, however, the Committee has not been able to find a place in which to settle the Assyrians anywhere else, and since it is essential that the question should be dealt with urgently, the Committee has been obliged to revert to the idea of a settlement in Syria. For reasons both humanitarian and political, therefore, the Committee has pressed the French Govorirment to accent, as nermanent settlers in the mandated territories of the Levant, not only those Assyrians who are now provisionally settled there, but also those for whom the Committee has to find a place of settle- merit - always on the understanding that they will be in no decree a charge upon the budget of the States of the Levant under -Tench mandate. In response to this appeal, the French Government has supplied the Committee with a variety of material relating to the question under consideration, and has intimated that material9 &lt;01 • material possibilities of settlement have already been recognised and on wha.t others no final opinion can be formed without further investigation. By a letter dated April 14th, the french Government has informed the Chairman of the Committee that, from the information available, it is now possible to contemplate, subject to arrangements to be made, enlarging the existing settlement of 2 ,20C persons to 6,500. fhe investigations now proceeding will doubtless reveal wider possibilities which would he of benefit to such other Assyrians as may express a desire to leave Irac. addressed to foreign Office ho. 45 caving, repeated to Bagdad in R jo. 8: copy sent to aris.^ INDEXED A» In any further communication on this subject, please quote V No. ^ jj ly person by/name, but to— and address —not to any “ The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London,fe.W. 1.

CONFIDENTIAL. [E 2206/2/93] Record of the 41^ Meeting of the Assyrian Committee held in Paris on J\larch 20 at 11 a.m.— (Received in Foreign Office, April 4.) The President explained that as all the members of the committee, with the exception of the Mexican representative, happened to be in Paris, he had thought it advisable to call them together to report the gist of the conversations which he and the United Kingdom representative had had at the Quai d’Orsay since the last meeting of the committee in Geneva. M. de Saint-Quentin had drawn attention to the difficulties in the way of settlement in Syria, but had indicated that if pressed by the committee the French Government might be disposed in spite of these difficulties to consider the matter favourably. M. de Saint-Quentin had promised to try to give a definite reply by the 19th March regarding the conditions on which the French Government would be prepared to accede to an appeal from the committee. Unfortunately, this reply had not yet been received as the examination of possible places of settlement in Syria was still proceeding. The first place thought of, astride the River Orontes. had had to be abandoned owing to the cost of the work involved and the time which it would take. The French authorities, however, were studying alternative schemes. Without wishing to press them unduly, the president expressed the hope that their reply would be forthcoming before the end of the present week as it was naturally difficult for himself and the other members of the committee to remain in Paris indefinitely. The French Representative said that he regretted that the French authorities * had had to abandon the Orontes scheme, as it had promised to be most suitable in every way, and had the advantage of being far from the Iraqi frontier and unlikely therefore to cause complications. While the Jebel Ansariya would provide ample grazing facilities, it was not suitable for agriculture. For the latter purpose the Ghab Valley, which was at present marsh land, but a potentially rich agricultural area, would have to be drained. The first estimate of cost had been 30 million francs, but when the relevant dossier arrived from Beirut it was seen that it would be necessary to erect a barrage and construct a tunnel at the northern end of the Ghab Valley, and to create an artificial lake to the south of it. The land which would have to be turned into a lake was at present under cultivation, and the necessary expropriation of the existing landowners would be costly. The total cost would be in the region of 120 million francs, and the whole operation would in any case take twelve years to complete. M. de Martel and M. Burnier were now working on an alternative scheme for settlement on the Lower Khabur River. But this scheme raised political questions, both external and internal, and demanded very careful consideration. Nevertheless, the French Government realised the need for speed and their reply might be expected any day. The President drew attention to various questions which would have to be discussed if the French reply, when received, was favourable. The first problem would be the provision of the necessary money and the composition of the local committee, which under existing arrangements would be charged with the task of consulting the wishes of the Assyrians. There was some doubt about Major Thomson's position on that committee, and it might be that the committee would have to be reconstituted. In any case, before anything further could be done, the Iraqi Government would have to be approached. M. Shabandar, who was now Iraqi Charge d’Affaires in Berlin, had been asked some time ago to be in Geneva so that the committee might consult him as soon as it was in a position to do so. M. Shabandar had now been for nearly a fortnight in Geneva, and the committee could not keep him waiting much longer. The important question of publicity would also require consideration. [381 d—1] &lt; 5, iu— 19 April 4, 1935. Section 1. No. 1.2 The United Kingdom Representative asked whether the study of the alter native plan was sufficiently advanced to enable the committee to warn M. Shabandar that his presence in Paris might shortly be necessary. The French Representative was unable to give a definite opinion. He said, however, that the French Government desired as soon as practicable to go ahead at full speed. The President said that as regards procedure, it was proposed that if the French Government were willing to pursue the scheme, there would be an exchange of letters between them and the committee, and probably a resolution by the committee and a resolution by the Council would also be necessary. M. Arocha observed, with regard to what the president had said about the local committee, that Major Thomson had not actually left his post. He was, so the secretariat understood, on leave without pay. The President expressed the view that it was necessary to clear up with the Iraqi Government whether Major Thomson was still a member of the committee or not. So far as he recollected, the resolution of the 31st October, 1933, by which the committee had been set up did not specify the members of it by name. It referred to them by their office. The president of the committee was to be the land settlement expert, employed by the Iraqi Government, but Major Thomson was no longer employed in that capacity. The second member of the committee was to be an administrative inspector, but he did not know whether the competent administrative inspector was still Major Wilson. The United Kingdom Representative said that it was quite true that the resolution of the 31st October, 1933, referred to the members of the committee not by name but by their offices. It was clear, however, that the Iraqi Government did intend to recall Major Thomson to Iraq when the moment came to resume the post of president. Major Wilson was still administrative inspector in Mosul. The President said that he, personally, was not satisfied with the present composition of the committee. Major Thomson and Major Wilson and the third member of the committee, i.e., the local kaimakam, were all Iraqi officials. For present purposes he thought that something less entirely Iraqi in composition was required. On the other hand, if it was the Council Committee's desire that the present local committee should be replaced by a new committee, it must consider very carefully what reasons it could adduce in trying to persuade the Iraqi Government to accept the change. He would like the views of the United Kingdom representative on this point. The United Kingdom Representative said that he found himself in some difficulty in expressing a view on this point, since Major Thomson and Major Wilson were both British subjects and he had no reason to believe that they would fulfil their duties otherwise than conscientiously and efficiently. He was fully aware of the criticisms which had been directed against them, and it might well be that these criticisms did militate against keeping the committee constituted as at present. On the other hand, the task of the committee was an extremely difficult one, and the United Kingdom representative, for his part, felt that no one who had been in the position of Major Thomson and Major Wilson on the committee could have hoped to escape criticism. With this view there was general assent. The United Kingdom Representative continued that he would prefer to leave it to his colleagues to decide whether an attempt should be made to change the composition of the local committee. There might be difficulties with the Iraqi Government, and it might also be difficult to find other officials who had the necessary experience and knowledge, and who could take over from Major Thomson and Major Wilson, so to speak, in mid-stream. But he had no desire whatever to insist on the retention of Major Thomson and Major Wilson. The sole object of the Council Committee, he thought, ought to be to choose, regardless of personalities, the course which was most likely to lead to a speedy and satisfactory solution of the whole question. The President said that the situation had changed greatly since the resolution of the 31st October, 1933, constituting the local committee had been passed. If adestination had actually been found, the Council Committee would be in a position to exercise much more pressure on the Iraqi Government. After all, the committee was working to rid Iraq of a tiresome problem, and if the Iraqi Government made difficulties for the committee in the execution of this task, the responsibility cuold be fixed upon them. Nevertheless, the committee naturally did not want an unnecessary struggle with the Iraqi Government. If the majority of the committee was satisfied with the present composition of the local committee, it would be better for the committee to reserve its ammunition for the greater purpose of inducing the Iraqi Government to make a substantial financial contribution. He proposed that the committee should for the time being leave the question unsettled and reflect upon it. The United Kingdom Representative said that a point which might have a bearing on the composition of the local committee, and which in any case needed urgent consideration, was how the necessary discussions with the Iraqi Govern ment .which must precede the transfer of the Assyrians to Syria was to be conducted. M. Arocha observed that it had been assumed in the resolution of the 31st October, 1933, that a Nansen Office representative would join the local committee as representative of the Council Committee. But could he also represent the Council Committee in negotiations with the Iraqi Government ? The United Kingdom Representative said that the work of preparing and executing the Syrian scheme would fall into two categories—political and technical. The technical work could perhaps be left to the present local committee, with the addition of a Nansen Office representative, provided that all questions of principle were decided beforehand between the Council Committee and the Iraqi Government. It was the machinery for laying down these principles which was of immediate importance, as unless some special machinery could be set up there seemed a prospect of endless discussions in Geneva with an Iraqi representative, who might have to refer at every stage to his Government, whose decisions might be long in coming. The President said that this was a very important point. He would propose that, as soon as the French Government had agreed in principle to accept the Assyrians in Syria, M. Shabandar should be asked to come to Paris so that, at a meeting of the Council Committee, the whole position could be explained to him. It should then be pointed out to him that whereas the Iraqi representative had hitherto been called to meetings of the committee for the most part to receive or to give information, a new phase had now been reached, where it was necessary to negotiate a definite settlement with the least possible delay. It could then be suggested to M. Shabandar either that he should himself obtain full powers from his Government, or that the Iraqi Government should send to Geneva a plenipotentiary to conclude a settlement with the minimum of reference to Bagdad. This proposal was approved. Before the meeting ended, the French Representative said that he would like to refer to one point which was causing the French Government some anxiety. They feared that if they declared their willingness to accept the Assyrians in Syria, they might find themselves saddled not only with the Assyrians of Iraq, but also with Assyrians at present living in Persia. The French Government had information that recently there had been an influx of Assyrians from Persia into Iraq at the instigation of Assyrians already in Iraq; he thought that the reluctance of the Assyrians to take part in the recent census in Iraq might have been due to a desire to keep up the existing uncertainty as to their numbers and status, so that it might be easier to introduce into any settlement scheme Assyrians who were not really habitually resident in Iraq. At the close of the meeting, the United Kingdom Representative said that he felt he ought to give his colleagues some idea of recent political developments in Iraq, as these naturally had an important bearing on any future programme. He then explained briefly 1 the recent unrest in the Diwaniyah area, leading up to the formation of the new Cabinet with Yasin Pasha as Prime Minister.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). April 4, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 2207/2/93] No. 1. Record of the ASnd Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held in Paris on March 22, 1935, at 11 a.m. — (Received in Foreign Office, April 4.) The President described a conversation which he and the United Kingdom representative had had the previous day with M. de Saint-Quentin. Briefly, the French Government considered it possible to receive up to 15,000 more Assyrians in Syria. For the moment they could only receive some 4,000, at a cost of 10 million francs. These newcomers would be added to the existing settlement on the Upper Khabur River. For the rest, before details as to numbers or cost could be given, a close survey of other areas, also on the Khabur River, would be necessary, and this survey was expected to take about three months. M. de Saint- Quentin had emphasised the difficulties which the French Government found in accepting the Assyrians at all. Their readiness to proceed as described above depended, in fact, on their being urged by the committee, and if possible by the Council, to proceed in spite of the local objections. M. Olivan had said that on this point he could not, of course, give a reply without consulting the whole committee. Assuming that the committee wished to go ahead, the first point to consider was what form was to be given to the proposed arrangement. The suggestion was that the committee should at once send to the French Government the appeal which had already been drafted and on the basis of which M. Olivan had been negotiating. The French Government were in possession of the draft of that appeal, and had prepared an interim memorandum in reply to it. (The memorandum was then distributed—see annex.) It was now proposed that the memorandum should be expanded into a formal note, and that the committee should then send to the French Government a further note, to the effect that it had taken into account the objections raised, but, nevertheless, felt bound to decide in favour of Syria. The question was whether the committee could proceed further without obtaining the approval of the Council. The French Government would prefer to have the authority of the Council, and the forthcoming special session of that body, which had been arranged to consider the German attitude towards the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles, seemed to provide a suitable opportunity. It was agreed that the second note from the committee to the French Government should conclude by saying that although the committee had been invested with wide powers by the Council, they thought it best, in all the circum stances, to obtain the approval of the Council at its forthcoming extraordinary session. The French Representative pointed out that the memorandum which was now before the committee spoke of three possible projects for settlement in ^yiia. The committee must decide which of these projects to adopt. After some discussion, it was agreed that the first and second schemes, i.e., for settlement in the Orontes area and on the Lower Khabur, offered no solution for the urgent Assyrian problem, and that the committee would probably have to fall back, on that ground and on grounds of finance, upon the third proposal, i.e., for settlement on the Upper Khabur. The President said that one point way still not clear to him. He had under stood that the French were prepared in principle to accept 15,000 more Assyrians, but that while 4,000 could be accepted at once, the exact figure of the remainder must depend on local surveys. The paragraph numbered 4 on p. 7 of the Iiench memorandum, however, made it appear that the French weie actually onl\ agreeing at the moment to accept 4,000 Assyrians, and that their consent to receiving any more depended on local surveys. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that, on the other hand, paragraph C on p. 3 of the French memorandum said definitely that, subject to 5 [381 d—2] Bverification on the spot, the settlement of about 16,500 Assyrians in all, including those already admitted into Syria, could be anticipated. The French Representative said that it was this latter passage which certainly represented the intention of the French Government. They were prepared in principle to receive 15,000 in all, if, as they thought probable, the areas which they had in view would accommodate that number. They were prepared at all events to receive 4,000 as soon as possible, as they knew that the existing settlement would accommodate that number. The exact total of the remainder must be left to be determined in the light of the surveys, which would take three months to complete. The President asked that the French representative would arrange that this point might be made clearer in the note which the French Government were preparing on the basis of the present memorandum. The French Representative said that at an earlier meeting, the United Kingdom representative had enquired whether the Assyrians would be given land in ownership, or whether they would be merely tenants. He had referred this point to the authorities concerned, and it now appeared that some time would be necessary before land could be given in permanent ownership to the Assyrians. A detailed survey would have to be conducted in the first place, and the French authorities thought that some four years would have to elapse before the land could be finally parcelled out and title-deeds given. The President said that before summoning M. Shabandar, there was one point arising out of the conversations with M. de Saint-Quentin which required settlement, namely, the question of publicity. It was obviously difficult to keep silent much longer about the failure of the British Guiana scheme, and the question was whether a communique should be issued at once and, if so, in what terms. M. de Martel had left Paris on the previous day and would be back in Beirut on the 30th March. He had been very anxious that nothing should be said about settlement in Syria before his arrival, as he wished to take certain measures in anticipation of local opposition. M. Olivan had felt that nothing could be decided on this point without consulting the whole committee, and it had merely been arranged that if it were decided to issue a communique at once, the terms as prepared by the committee should be discussed with M. de Saint-Quentin before publication. Since then, the president had had conversations with the United Kingdom representative and with M. Arocha, and all three were now in favour of issuing no communique for the moment. It was obvious that the Syrian scheme could not yet be announced as a fait accompli. It would have to be rather cryptic. If, therefore, the object in issuing the communique was to enlighten people about what was being done, this object would not be achieved. On the other hand, any obscure communique would lend itself to varying interpretations, and might have unfortunate repercussions both in Syria and in Iraq. On the whole, therefore, delay seemed best, and he would suggest that at all events nothing should be said until M. de Martel had arrived at his post. The French Representative explained that M. de Martel had not wished the French Government’s decision to be announced before his arrival in Syria. If, however, the committee merely wished to say that they had approached the French Government, there would be no objection. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that this might have just as bad an effect in Syria as an announcement that the scheme had been decided upon. It seemed likely to arouse Syrian opposition to an equal extent. The President agreed. In fact, he thought it would have a worse effect in Syria to say that the French Government had been approached than to announce eventually that they had agreed to take the Assyrians. If the Syrian Nationalists thought that the scheme had not yet been decided upon, and that there was a chance of upsetting it, they would be all the more active. After some further discussion, it was agreed that as the French Government would prefer that the scheme should, if possible, have the approval not only of the committee but of the Council as a whole, and as a special session of the Council in connexion with German disarmament seemed likely to be held about the beginning of April, the best course might be for the committee to present/ lo% 3 a report to the Council at that session, and to postpone any announcement until the report was considered by the Council. This decision was subject to the reservation that the issue of a communique prior to the meeting of the Council would be reconsidered should there be any leakage or any further development which might make an official pronouncement desirable. ^ The Danish Representative asked whether the committee might not at least publish immediately a short communique to the effect that it had met both in Geneva and Paris and was about to present a report to the Council. The United Kingdom Representative said that perhaps a reply to that effect might be returned to any direct enquiries. Issued in the form of a communique, however, it would only lead to speculation, and he would be in favour of issuing no communique. He added that he anticipated that there might be enquiries in the United Kingdom. Perhaps these would be in the form of parliamentary questions, and he proposed to recommend that the answer to such questions should be that the committee was about to present a report on the whole question to the Council, and that pending that report no statement could be made. The same answer would be returned to ordinary private enquiries, but there might be enquiries from ecclesiastical quarters, to which it would be desirable to reply more frankly. Where there was reason to believe that confidence would be respected, he proposed to explain the exact situation. M. Shabandar then joined the meeting. The President offered the apologies of the committee to M. Shabandar for any inconvenience which might have been caused to him by the delay in asking him to attend a meeting of the committee. The committee had, however, wished to be in a position to make some definite statement of the position to him. The report of the Browne-Giglioli Mission to British Guiana had already been communicated to M. Shabandar. The committee had examined this report, and had come to the conclusion that it offered no chance of success. It would involve the League of Nations in altogether too great a risk in which the Iraqi Govern ment would be associated. The committee was, however, impressed by the necessity of finding urgently some alternative which could be announced at the same time as the failure of the British Guiana scheme. The committee had therefore turned to the French Government as mandatory in Syria, and he . himself, as President, had come to Paris to discuss the matter with the French Government on behalf of the League. As a result, the French Government had prepared a memorandum regarding the possibilities of settlement in Syria. This memorandum was then read and a copy handed to M. Shabandar. M. Shabandar thanked the committee, and announced that he was entirely at its disposal for any co-operation. He would communicate the French memorandum the same day to the Iraqi Government, and would at once telegraph a summary of it. The President said he wished to emphasise the strictly confidential nature of the memorandum. If the fact that Syria was under discussion was published at this stage, there were grave risks of developments which might hinder the success of the plan, and these risks were of the greatest concern to the Iraqi Government as the primarily interested party. The committee must therefore ask the Iraqi Government to make every effort to guard against any leakage. The President then pointed out that the French Government were prepared for the first contingent to move into Syria at an early date, and the committee was anxious to make progress as quickly as possible. There was much to discuss with the Iraqi Government. M. Shabandar had hitherto always shown readiness to co-operate with the committee, but hitherto his co-operation had necessarily been on a different plane. Everything had been tentative. Now there was a new situation; decisions had to be taken rapidly, and he ventured to suggest on behalf of the committee that either M. Shabandar himself or some other Iraqi represen tative should be furnished with wide powers to arrange the whole operation with the committee in such a way that it would not be necessary to refer every point to Bagdad. He did not, of course, mean to say that there should be no reference; that would be asking too much, but the Iraqi representative ought to be in a. position to do more than simply to take note of and pass on communications made to him by the committee. If that method were followed, there would be [381 d—2] b 24 unending delays. The committee would have to adjourn each time pending a reply from the Iraqi Government. Among the questions which had to be settled were the manner in which the wishes of the Assyrians should be consulted, and the very important question of finance. He would therefore ask M. Shabandar urgently to persuade his Government to delegate a representative with adequate powers. M. Shabandar promised to urge his Government to do this at once. The President said that if the Council met at the beginning of April, as seemed likely, the question could be placed on its agenda. If not, the committee hoped to be able, during the first few days of April, to proceed without delay in consultation with an Iraqi representative fully empowered to take decisions. The committee wished to be in a position to begin the actual operation of transfer from Iraq to Syria towards the end of April. M. Shabandar then left the meeting, and M. Burnier joined it. The President said that the committee had been anxious to see M. Burnier because it appreciated how much he had done in connexion with the existing provisional settlement of Assyrians in Syria and with the French proposals for permanent settlement which were now before the committee. He invited M. Burnier to make any observations he wished on these proposals. M. Burnier said that of the three proposals put forward in the French memo randum. the first two were clearly preferable to the third. He realised, however, that from the financial point of view and from the point of view of time it would be necessary to concentrate upon the third. The main question which concerned him was the manner in which the first batch of Assyrians was to be chosen. He wmuld prefer that they should be selected from the same tribes as were already represented in the provisional settlement. These tribes were the Tkhuma and Upper Tiyari and Diz. He would propose that the whole settlement should be on a tribal basis. A discussion followed as to whether this would be practicable. It was realised that no conclusion could be come to on the material at present available, but that the tribes which M. Burnier had mentioned were those who were chiefly discontented with their lot in Iraq, and that it might not be difficult and might indeed facilitate matters generally to take first he remainder of those tribes in so for as they wished to leave. M. Burnier expressed an inclination to combine the third French proposal with the second. He thought that the construction of a barrage on the Lower Khabur, which was an essential part of the second proposal, might be of great benefit to the country as a whole, might make more land available for Assyrian settlement and could, in part at least, be carried out by the Assyrians themselves at much less cost than had actually been allowed for in the second proposal. M. Burnier said that he himself would be back in Syria about the first week in April and he thought it should be possible to begin the movement of the first batch at the end of that month. It would take most of May and June to transfer that batch. They would be, first of all, accommodated in tents, and more permanent dwellings would have to be prepared before the winter. In July and the first half of August no movement would be practicable on account of the heat, and the whole operation for the present year would have to be finished by the end of September, when the cold weather and snow would render further movement difficult. M. Burnier urged that if the operation were to be completed, or anything like completed, during the present year, no time must be lost. The United Kingdom Representative said that he had already enquired whether the Assyrians would be given land in permanent ownership, and under stood from the French representative that this would be done after a certain interval. Another question which he would like to put was, what would be the status of the Assyrians in Syria, e.g., what would be their nationality? The United Kingdom representative recalled that some of the Assyrians had acquired Iraqi nationality under the Treaty of Lausanne, but some had taken no steps to acquire it, and were, in fact, stateless. M. Burnier and the Trench Representative both said that they were unable to answer this question at once, and it was agreed that it should be examined further. M. Burnier then left the meeting.5 7 he French Representative then urged the necessity for speed. He hoped that everything would be done to induce the Iraqi Government to appoint a qualified representative as quickly as possible, and that if the meeting of the Council were delayed, the committee should find means of making further progress before the Council assembled. In this connexion he saw a great danger of delay in the proposal which the President had put forward tentatively that the composi tion of the local committee should be changed. Did the President in the circum stances really wish to proceed with that proposal ? If so, he thought it ought to he discussed with the Iraqi Government forthwith, without waiting for the appointment of a special Iraqi representative. The President said that he still maintained his objections to the present composition of the local committee. The question of changing it, however, was a delicate one, which required a considerable amount of thought as to procedure, &amp;c. He did not think that the committee could take any immediate decision or take the matter further in any way pending the appointment of an Iraqi repre sentative. He proposed that the committee should now adjourn, and that in the meantime the secretariat should prepare a list of points which would have to be settled with the Iraqi representative. The French Representative still persisted in pressing the President either to approach the Iraqi Government at once about the local committee, or to withdraw his objection to it. The President, however, maintained his attitude. The United Kingdom. Representative suggested that the question of the local committee might perhaps be allowed to stand over until it was clear in what way the direct discussions between the committee and the Iraqi Government would be carried on. It might be that if some expeditious procedure could be devised for settling the main lines to be followed regarding the consultation of the wishes of the Assyrians and their subsequent transfer, the work left to the local committee would be purely technical in character, and could safely be delegated to the present committee without change. It was agreed to await the Iraqi reply to the suggestion that they should appoint a special representative, before proceeding further with the matter. It was further decided that a reply should be sent by the President on behalf of the committee to the note which the French Government had under preparation. This reply should be to the effect that the committee had taken note of the objections to settlement in Syria raised by the French Government, but that, impressed by the dangers of not reaching a solution, it felt bound, in spite of the objections, to decide in favour of settlement in Syria. The reply would go on to say that the Iraqi Government had been informed of the position and invited to appoint a plenipotentiary to discuss details, and that while the committee had ample powers delegated from the Council, it thought it best in all the circum stances to report the position to the Council with a view to obtaining its approval if the opportunity of an early special session, as now seemed likely, presented itself. It was left to the President and to the secretary to agree upon the exact terms of this reply; and to the President to decide the date of the next meeting of the eommittee. Annex.

In view of the dangerous situation which might arise in Iraq if an announcement were made of the abandonment of the Guiana scheme unaccompanied by the hope of any feasible alternative scheme for settling the Assyrians outside Iraq, the Assyrian Committee have avoided taking any formal decision/ 3330 1000 12.34■ decision on the Guiana scheme pending the final outcome of the consideration of the possibility of settling^Assyrians in Syria. The Committee have therefore referred the matter to a sub-Committee in order to give the impression that the Guiana scheme is still being actively considered ( vide the attached extract from 'The Times' of 16th March). For the same reason the Iraqi Government themselves have not yet been informed of the real position. been regarded as a pis aller. The main objections to resettling the Assyrians in Syria are (a) that it might only be a temporary solution of the problem since the French ) Government only hold a mandate over the country and a similar situation to that at present existing in Iraq might arise after the termination of this mandate, (b) that the land which could probably be made available in Syria is not really suitable, and (c) that the Assyrians if settled en bloc in Syria would probably, in view of their past history, provide a continual source of friction between Syria and Iraq. On the other hand there now appears to be some hope that the French Government may be persuaded to provide a home in Syria for all the Assyrians who should be removed from Iraq^ and Sir Francis Humphrys has argued with much force in his despatch of 9th January (P.Z.1943/35) that the objections 1o the Syrian scheme are outweighed by the much more serious objections to the Assyrians remaining indefinitely in Iraq. With regard to the first objection mentioned above to the Syrian scheme it seems safe to say that there is no prospect of the French abandoning their mandate over Syria for some considerable time to come. The vague proposals for the settlement of the Assyrians in various French colonies seem now to have been abandoned. 1 understand that negotiations with the French Government in regard to the Syrian scheme are 2.

On the other hand Sir Francis Humphrys seems to have done everything he could to impress on the Iraqi Government the importance, from own point of view, of preventing the Assyrians from being molested. Sir Francis Humphrys appears to be opposed to any idea of intervention by the R.A.F. in Iraq in the evaa t of disorders taking place^and he refused even to discuss in the despatch the possibility of H.M.G. resuming physical control ofthe country considering that aaay massacre of Iraqi subjects, however cruel and unprovoked, could justify such a step (paragraphs 22-25 of the despatch). 7.T oIN v In any further communication on this subject, please quote No^' jXe tstpr/^/ * and address —to any person by mme, hut to — “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office.

United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, Record of the fortieth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee held in Geneva on March 7, 1935, at 4 p.m. The President said that it appeared fairly clearly from the Browne—Giglioli report that British Guiana could not be regarded as offering a solution of the Assynan problem. lie did not think it was necessary to go further into the details of the difficulties, though it would be necessary to do this at a later stage in order to present a reasoned report to the Council. What the committee now had to consider was the line of action to be taken in the new situation created by the breakdown of the British Guiana scheme. Since yesterday’s meeting, private conversations had taken place between the United Kingdom and French repre sentatives, and subsequently between those two representatives and himself. Briefly the position w T as that the United Kingdom representative had put forward the suggestion that the possibility of settlement in Syria should now be le-examined. I he French representative had indicated that his Government still saw considerable difficulties in accepting the Assyrians in Syria, but that they were prepared to re-examine the question on certain conditions. They felt that they could not consider the idea unless presented with an appeal to that effect f rom the committee as a whole, and then only if the appeal stated the number of Assyrians who would have to be provided for, and also guaranteed the French Government against financial responsibility. The J P ? siti ° n was that every destination which the committee had so far examined had proved for one reason or another impracticable. The United Kingdom representative had drawn attention to the serious dangers which micrht arise if the committee was compelled to the conclusion that the Assyrians must remain m Iraq. What else was open? There was the suggestion made by the International Organisation for Inter-Church Aid regarding Abyssinia and there was the new possibility of Syria. Abyssinia might have to be considered m ceitam circumstances, more particularly as the ecclesiastical organisation concerned had apparently already taken steps to sound the Abyssinian Govern ment. At the same time, the difficulties in the way of settlement in Abvssinia were evident, and, while the committee should reserve it for subsequent considera tion, if necessary, the President felt that it oug-ht to he left, nn n™ ^ EASTERN (Iraq).

Assyrian Question.2 representative had privately indicated, and, before the committee definitely decided to pursue the idea of Syria, the President felt that it would be prudent to obtain privately an assurance from the French Government that that Government would not merely examine but would accede to an eventual appeal from the committee, provided that it conformed to certain specified conditions which ought to be more — closely defined. The President said that the private discussions between the United Kingdom representative, the French representative and himself had been entirely without commitment, and he had felt that before any definite action were taken he ought to lay the matter before the committee as a whole, and he would be glad to hear the views of each member. The Mexican Representative said that he entirely agreed that the British Guiana scheme could not be pursued and that the committee should now concentrate upon Syria. It was clearly right as a first step to obtain an assurance from the French Government on which to base subsequent action, and he suggested that it should be left to the President to take the necessary steps to obtain such an assurance. The French Representative said that it must, of course, be understood that the French Government had not yet changed their point of view about settlement in Syria and could only agree to reconsider the matter if certain conditions were fulfilled. He would like to explain the reasons why they had indicated their readiness to reconsider it. A few days previously they had been approached confidentially by the Foreign Office in London, who had drawn their attention to the serious dangers which might arise if the British Guiana scheme broke down and no alternative could be announced. The Foreign Office had expressed the hope that, in the common interest of avoiding these dangers, the French Govern ment should not reject out of hand any suggestion which might be made regarding settlement in Syria and that, if such a suggestion were made, the French Govern ment should agree to consider it. The United Kingdom Representative said that he would like to explain the reasons which prompted the Foreign Office to take the informal step to which the French representative had referred. Since the troubles of August 1933, the situation in Iraq had been relatively and surprisingly calm. This might be attributed to the fact that both the Iraqis and the Assyrians had been proceeding on the assumption that the early settlement of the Assyrians outside Iraq was assured. There was, however, reason to fear that, if hopes of such settlement were dashed, serious trouble might very quickly arise. It was quite clear that the Assyrians would not settle down as loyal subjects of Iraq on precisely the same basis as other communities. They would demand special tieatment and special privileges which could not be granted to them in a country of mixed communities like Iraq without endangering the structure of the whole State. Any attempt to secure special privileges threatened to lead not only to a serious internal situation in Iraq, but possibly also to a serious conflict between Iraq and the League. There were, however, more immediate dangers. Although the Assyrians still possessed a certain number of arms, there was probably no great danger of any open rising on their part. At the same time, they were a simple and impetuous people, and if it were announced that the British Guiana scheme had failed and no alternative were visible, some of the more hot-headed among them might easily commit some act of folly which would provoke retaliation and lead to a situation of much the same kind as had occurred in August 1933. The Foreign Office were impressed by the seriousness of the danger, which seemed to them also to affect the French Government closely on account of the proximity of Syria and the lepeicussions m the mandated territory which anv further inter racial conflict in Iraq might have. The Italian Representative said that he entirely agreed with the President. It was obvious that Syria was the most suitable place and would cause the least disturbance in the lives of the Assyrians. The only alternative appeared to be Abyssinia, and he reserved the right to go further into the objections to that scheme if it became necessary for the committee seriously to discuss it But quite apart from the present political situation, he was able from his own personal experience of Abyssinia to say that the proposal would be open to very serious objections. JThe Danish Representative said that he entirely agreed with the President. He summarised some of the points which seemed to him to make the British Guiana scheme impracticable and said that he was of opinion that an effort should be made to reach a settlement in Syria. The United Kingdom, Italian and Danish Representatives all associated themselves with the proposal of the Mexican representative that the task of sounding the French Government and of defining the conditions on which they would be prepared to accede to an appeal from the committee should be entrusted to the President. The President said that the French representative had indicated to him the advantage of a visit to Paris for this purpose since the French High Commissioner for Syria was at present on leave in Paris. Obviously, any ostentatious visit might lead to a premature disclosure that the British Guiana scheme had been abandoned in favour of one in Syria. The President thought, however, that he could arrange a short private visit to Paris at the beginning of the coming week, subject, of course, to the consent of his Government, which he would have to obtain. The French Representative said that he had just received a telegram from his (Government to the effect that they had information, which they believed reliable, that the Mar Shimun had been engaged in instigating those Assyrians who still remained in Iraq to prepare an unauthorised mass exodus across the frontier into Syria. The French Government were making representations in Bagdad to warn the Iraqi Government of the danger and to request them to make investigations. This announcement produced a considerable impression on the committee, and it was agreed that no time ought to be lost in pushing on with the Syrian scheme. The hope was expressed that the President might be able to begin discussions in Paris on the 11th March. The President explained that he would have to be in Berne on the 9th March and that it would be impossible for him to leave there until the 10th March. A further difficulty was that the Chaco question was to be discussed in Geneva on the 11th March and his Government would probably want him to be there for that discussion. He would, however, do what he could to convince them of the necessity of an early visit to Paris. The President added that, in Paris, questions of detail might be discussed and, owing to the multiplicity of the tasks which had fallen upon him, he was scarcely in a position to discuss details. He would therefore be very grateful if the United Kingdom representative could make an opportunity of being in Paris independently at the same time in order that his assistance might be available. The United Kingdom Representative said that he would be glad to give any assistance in his power. The President then said it was necessary to consider what action should be taken to keep up the illusion that the British Guiana scheme was still under consideration. The members of the mission of investigation were still in Geneva, and he thought that the best course would be to set up a sub-committee, which, in collaboration with the members of the mission, would prepare a short paper for eventual embodiment in a report to the Council summarising the mission’s report and indicating the reasons why the committee had not felt it possible to proceed with the British Guiana scheme. The composition of this committee and the fact that the committee as a whole would meet again when the report of the sub-committee was completed could be announced and would serve to keep the press quiet. p This was agreed to, and a committee, under the presidency of the Danish representative, and consisting otherwise of the Italian, Mexican and United Kingdom representatives, was appointed.

THE United Kingdom delegate to the League of Nations presents his compliments, and has the honour to transmit copies of a record of the thirty-ninth meeting of the Assyrian Committee on the 6th March respecting the Assyrian question, of which a copy has been sent to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad. United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva, March 13, 1935. Enclosure in No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of the Thirty-Ninth Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, held in Geneva, March 6, at 11 a.m. THE object of the meeting was to fix the procedure for the session. The President said that, as the report by Brigadier Browne and Signor Giglioli was a long and complicated document, it was desirable that plenty of time for its consideration should be given. He proposed, in the first place, to take advantage of the presence of the mission to obtain orally any supplementary information which they might be prepared to furnish. Brigadier Browne and Signor Giglioli then joined the meeting and were welcomed by the President, who expressed to them the sincere thanks of the committee and paid a tribute to the excellence and impartiality of their report. He asked whether the mission would wish to supplement the report by any oral statement. Brigadier Browne observed that he and Signor Giglioli realised that they had been sent out to deal with a very urgent problem. The conclusions embodied in their report were all of a general nature, and they were conscious that the report scarcely provided the means of dealing with the whole problem. The area which they had visited could only be colonised gradually. The mission were unable to say what total number of Assyrians could eventually be taken there, but they realised that the area was only capable of affording a partial solution of the Assyrian problem. Signor Giglioli said that it was difficult to give an exact idea of the importance of the difficulties. To take, for instance, the question of malaria. This disease was of no great importance at present, but if large numbers of new colonists went to the area, it might present a serious problem. If the work could be done gradually, the difficulties could be combated, but it was quite impossible, except in the light of experience, to express any opinion as to how far it might be possible to accelerate the work. There was also the question of animal diseases. The presence of rabies was not officially admitted, but, as he had pointed out in his own section of the report, there was evidence of cattle disease which strongly resembled rabies. Much further study of this aspect of the question was evidently necessary. The United Kingdom Representative observed that Brigadier Browne had said that it was impossible to say how many persons the territory could eventually accommodate. Was it right to assume, however, from a section of Signor Giglioli’s report, that, even under the most favourable conditions, and if all the [356 o—l]2 measures which the mission recommended were successfully taken, the territory was not capable of supporting more than 1,000 families? The United Kingdom representative understood also that, while the mission was of opinion that the first batch of settlers must be limited to 250 persons, it could give no idea of the interval which must elapse before the success of the preliminary experiment could be judged or how many people could be sent out in subsequent batches. It looked, therefore, as if only a few hundred persons at most could be settled within the next few years. Brigadier Browne said that, while the size of the first batch had been stated in the report and an estimate given of the total number of persons who could be accommodated in the area for the purpose of cattle-ranching, it was impossible to say anything more definite or to give anything like precise figures. The United Kingdom Representative said that he noted that even the despatch of the first batch was to be dependent on the outcome of further preliminary enquiries, e.g., into the cattle situation and cattle diseases, and also into the causes of the alleged decline of the Indian population. In reply to a question, Brigadier Browne and Signor Giglioli said that they could not give an estimate of the time which these preliminary enquiries would take. As no other member was immediately prepared to put any questions, the meeting was adjourned to give time for further consideration of the report and to see a film of the Rupununi district which Signor Giglioli had made.

R. 10.30 PoiB., 6th March, 1935 P Following from Mr. Sterndale Bennett This morning’s meeting of Assyrian committee was confined to welcoming General Browne and Signor Giglioli and to giving them an opportunity to supplement their 1 report s orally H . Their remarks tended to emphasise the fact that British Guiana scheme affords no solution of the problem, and while meeting was ostensibly adjourned to give time for detailed study of their report it was really to provide an opportunity for private discussion as to what should be done nex^. After the meeting I had a long conversation with French representative who was aware of informal approach made to French Ambassador in London regarding pos sibility of settlement in Syria. He made it clear that French Government were very willing to be helpful but that they must safeguard themselves againsu Arab national opinion in Syria and against financial responsibility. He has authority to transmiu to them a proposal for settlement in Syria lor favourable consideration provided:- (a) that it is s in the* form *of* a pressing appeal • • •2. appeal from Assyrian committee as a whole to French Government as mandatory in Syria (this in order to meet possible Arab opposition); (b) that it states total number of Assyrians whose transfer is desired; (c) that it shows how necessary funds will be provided and makes it clear that French Government is guaranteed against financial responsibility. As regards condition (a), French representative and I both felt that there was no reason to anticipate difficulty in committee though from mv general conversa tions with Secretary it appears possible that question may be complicated by scruple regarding necessity for consultation with Permanent Mandates Commission. As regards condition (b), I pointed cut that number could not be definitely stated until Assyrians had been consulted. We seemed in fact to be once more in the old vicious circle of net being able to consult Assyrians in the absence of a detailed plan and not being able to draw up a detailed plan without consult ing Assyrians. French representative appreciated this and said that it would be sufficient to indicate maximum number of Assyrians who might be expected to go or else draw up a kind of sliding scale to show what total cost would be of settling e.g. 10.COO s 15,000 or 20,000 Assyrians (he is prepared to help in preparing figures on basis of estimates by Nansen office representative in Syria). As regards condition (c), I pointed out diffi culties of any immediate decision on the question of finance. • 9 •3 \ ^ finance„ We agreed, however s thaij expense ought to he homo primarij.y by Iraqi Government and French represent a 1 hive said that ^the~ Government would probably oe satisfied if proposal made to them could state amount of Iraqi contribution. It is their desire that this contribution should be paid in cash before any transfer takes place, on analogy of transfer of families last summer e They would then probably be prepared to proceed with settlement without further delay on the understanding that any expenditure over and above Iraqi contribution would be refunded to them within a reason able time by means of League of Nations appeal to individual Governments and charitable organisations* Committee is fully alive to danger of announcing breakdown of British Guiana scheme without some indica tion that an alternative is under consideration. Much will depend therefore on possibility of securing early concurrence of Iraqi Government in suggested settlement in Syria and on amount which Iraqi Government are prepared to pay. I presume that as soon as committee decides in principle to pursue Syrian scheme Kis Majesty's Government will be prepared to exert strong pressure j in Bagdad to extract maximum contribution,, Addressed to Foreign Office No. 43; repeated to Bagdad No 0 2 S copy to Paris No. 2 Saving by bag.COPY 1530/8/93) NO DISTRIBUTION Cypher telegram to His Majesty’s Consul (Geneva).

Situation is delicate as French representative yesterday gave impression that the French Government might not he so forthcoming as at first indicated. French High Commissioner for Syria who is at present in Paris and by whose advice the French Government will he guided, was said to he wavering on account of fresh indications of probable Arab opposition. This was before receipt of information contained in my telegram No.45 which may redress the balance. Task of sounding French Government has been entrusted to the President of Committee and present arrangement is that, subject to consent of his Govern ment, he shall pay unostentatious visit from Berne to Paris at the beginning of next week and take an opportunity to discuss the question with M. de Martel. This is at the instance of French representative and the French appear to attach importance to such a visit, no doubt for eventual window-dressing purposes, though at present it is to be kept strictly private. President has asked me to go independently to Paris to be available if necessary. I have agreed and will let you know dates as soon as possible. I shall of course keep in touch with Embassy.

Following from Mr. Sterndale Bennett for Mr. Rendel: Olivan and I had conversations separately and collectively throughout March 14th with St. Quentin, de Martel and Chauvel. Vfe urged importance and urgency of question and produced text of appeal which Assyrian committee would propose to address to the French Government if assured of favourable response. French representatives emphasised difficulties e.g. finance, Arab agita tion and Turkish opposition to further settlement in Khabur region, but appeared ready, in Chauvel's phrase to me, to have their hands forced by the League on wider grounds. After private consultation among French representatives, collective meeting was held in evening at which St. Quentin said that, while unable as yet to commit French Government, he thought personally that their attitude was likely to be favourable and he hoped to be able to be in a position by March 19th to formulate precisely the conditions on which they v/ould be prepared to accede to proposed appeal by Committee. Conditions seem likely to be: (a) that neither French Government nor mandated territories incur financial responsibility; (b) that moral and financial co-operation of Iraqi Government is assured and (c) that settlement in question is supervised by some independento &lt;£) e / independent person or organisation on behalf of the League, e.go Nansen office, 2. hhile existing Xhabur settlement would not necessarily be scrapped, place which French have in mind for main permanent settlement is an area consisting of Ghar valley, astride the river Orontes and of eastern slopes of Jebel Ansariya. Development of this region which is considered suitable both by local Nansen office representative and the French authorities, has already been examined in another connexion and estimates worked out. Full details are being sent from Beirut and should be here on March 18th. Monsieur Burnier will also be in Paris then. 5. Monsieur Chauvel spoke to me somewhat bitterly of close relations maintained by the Iraqi Government with Syrian nationalists. He urged that the Iraqi Government were in a position to put a stop to any nationalist campaign which might develop against settlement scheme and that the French Government would expect His Majesty's Government at the proper moment to exert pressure on the Iraqi Government to this end. 4. The French representatives asked Monsieur Olivan and myself to remain here for any further discussions which might be necessary pending decision of the French Government, Monsieur Olivan was compelled to return to Geneva last night for Chaco question but expects to be here again on morning of March 18th, 5, I suggest that this telegram and Geneva telegram Noo 48 should be repeated to Bagdad for confidential informa tion.

All members of Assyrian Committee except Mexican Representative are now in Paris and mot March 20th for informal exchange of views on future procedure in anticipation of favourable French reply. First step wi11 be to inform Iraqi Government of position and invite their close cooperation in preparation and execution of detailed scheme. Marly public announce ment is then contemplated. 2. Various details will have to be worked out in Syria and Iraq and operations in both countries co ordinated. Some of this work will be purely technical but especially in initial stages it will have important political aspects. Moreover Committee feels that as it is pressing French Government to take the J Assyrians and is thus assuming a more direct responsi bility on behalf of the League than contemplated in previous schemes it ought to retain a closer control over whole operation than is provided for in arrangements so far made, 3. Majority of Council Committee have always2 regarded present local committee as makeshift which they would prefer to see replaced hy some independent international organisation or at least hy one on which they would he more adequately represented than hy official of Nansen Office who will he merely technical expert and may not always fully appreciate political considerations involvedo Though my colleagues realise that any attempt to replace or modify composition of local committee may lead to difficulties with Iraqi Government and serious delays I cannot, for reasons indicated in preceding paragraph, guarantee that this will deter them 0 It may he however that they would he content to leave present local committee as it is if it were reduced to subordinate position of purely technical body to advise upon and carry out operations whose principles and main lines would he agreed upon in ; detail between the Iraqi Government and Council Committee before they were put into effect. This presupposes however a much more direct contact than exists at present between Iraqi Government and Council Committee. Such contact might he ensured hy presence in Geneva of Iraqi representative of sufficient authority to take or obtain speedy decisions. But most expeditious course might be for a representative of the Committee (preferably its President, if Spanish Govern ment would consent) to proceed both to Beirut and Bagdad, as soon as possible after French agreement in principle has been given, with wide delegation of power from Committee, to coordinate whole operation and to satisfy himself of adequacy of arrangements proposed in „ *«^hO Q-ji) So in both countries^ 4 :&gt; This idea has not yet been put forward in Council Conrnittee but I have reason to believe that it appeals to M„ 01ivan although he has not discussed it with meo I am aware of objections to visit to Iraq of a League representative. As however purpose would be not to conduct an enquiry into the situation of a minority but to expedite arrangements for its removal and thus to rid Iraq of a tiresome problem, objections may not have so rnuch force and may be outweighed by advantages. Apart from other considerations it would emphasise League responsibility for whole operation and this would be a useful safeguard to everyone concerned including Iraqi Government„ From British point of view advantage might be considerable as it would mean that it would not be left to His Majesty’s Embassy alone to exercise necessary /j pressure on Iraqi Government e.g. to extract substantial II financial contribution. 5 0 1 should add that M c Olivan speaks Arabic and is already known to His Majesty’s Ambassador. He would I feel sure be very receptive of any advice from the lattero 6 C It would be most useful for me to have Sir A. Clark Kerr’s observations on above suggestion. If it appears to him feasible Iraqi Government might perhaps be advised at suitable moment to take initia- , tive in inviting visit.

Olivan and myself on evening of March 21st M. de St. Quentin recounted efforts made hy French authorities to find place of settlement in Syria. He said that most suitable area was undoubtedly that described in paragraph 2 of Paris telegram No.39. But as Jebel Ansariya offered no scope for agriculture reclaiming of Ghar valley wou;d be essential part of scheme. This, however, would involve construction of a barrage and a tunnel, and the creation to the south of the area of a lake on land from which present owners would have to be expropriated. Work would take twelve years to finish and would cost about 122 million francs in addition to ordinary settlement expenses. Scheme could therefore not be regarded as solution of urgent Assyrian problem. Another plan for mass settlement on Lower Khabur river near its junction with Euphrates had had to be dismissed since it would take ten years and be even more costly. 2. French Government had now considered whether more • # emore practicable alternatives existed. 2, They were prepared in spite of possible Turkish objections to extend to its full capo.city existing settlement on Upper Khabur u 4,500 more Assyrians mould be accommodated in that area as soon as the necessary funds were forth coming, making with those now installed a colony of 6,500 persons at an estimated cost of 11 million francs* In addition available land existed for settlement in three separate areas lower down the Khabur, and for pasturage on the Jebel Abdul Aziz, It was estimated that in these areas a further 10,000 persons could eventually be settled but it was impossible without detailed examination, which would take three or four months, to give exact figures or reliable estimate of cost* Latter might be considerable owing to necessity of irrigation work, and by way of indication 3VL de St, Quentin mentioned 60 million francs as possible cost of whole operation (i 0 e o including enlargement of existing settlement) 0 5* Mo de St, Quentin added that he felt bound to point out drawbacks of settlement on the Khabur 0 Addition to minorities in that area meant increased risk of trouble with the Arabs and protection of Assyrians would be more difficult than in coastal region. Moreover settlement so near frontiers of Turkey and Iraq might lead to trouble with those countries. It rested with Council Committee to decide whether to proceed with scheme in spite of thesethese drawbacks, 4 C Tuere is little doubt that Committee will proceed, but it may decide to obtain prior approval 01 ^ouiicil at xcrthcoming special session.

I HAVE the honour to offer the following observations on your despatch No. 842 of the 6th December last, in which you discussed three main issues (1) What alternative solution to the Assyrian problem can be devised if the scheme now under examination for the resettlement, in British Guiana, of the ex-Ottoman Assyrians now in Iraq should prove abortive ? (2) What measures can and should be taken to minimise the danger ot an outbreak of disorder, similar to that which occurred in 1933, either pending the departure of the Assyrians for resettlement outside Iraq, or at some future date if they should be compelled to remain in Iraq owing to the failure of the League of Nations to find any other suitable country to which they could be transferred? (3) What action should be taken by His Majesty’s Government in general and by the British forces in Iraq in particular, if, in spite of all possible precautions, a fresh outbreak of Assyrian disorders should occur ? 2. I will discuss these issues in the above order. As I have already informed you in my telegram No. 277 of the 19th December, I consider that if General Browne’s Commission report unfavourably on the prospects of resettling the Assyrians in British Guiana, or if British Guiana is not accepted as a new home by those Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq, the possibility of finding accommoda tion for them in Syria should be carefully examined. In your despatch this proposal is dismissed on the grounds— (a) That there appears to be no real hope of a satisfactory resettlement ot any large number of Assyrians in Syria (even if the French could be persuaded to accept them); and (h) That in any event, their resettlement in Syria is open to many serious objections. 3. As regards the first of these points, I would suggest that any solution of the problem which comes under examination should not only be judged on its intrinsic merits or defects, but should also be weighed in the balance with the alternative on which it will be necessary to fall back if this or that solution is not adopted. In this particular instance I submit that the defects of resettle ment in Syria must be set against the insuperable obstacles which now lie m the way of satisfactory resettlement in Iraq. Is there, in fact, any greater hope of a more satisfactory future for the Assyrians in Iraq than in Syria. It that question cannot be answered with confidence in the affirmative, it will be prema ture to abandon the search for a new home for the Assyrians somewhere m the territory under French mandate. I do not think that we have yet airy very conclusive evidence of the attitude which the French Government are likely to adopt towards a proposal for the resettlement of a large number of Assyrians in Syria. The impression which I have gathered, however, from the observations of the French representative at the earlier meetings of the Council Committee, is that they have never categorically refused to consider the possibility ot s | lc h a settlement. In fact, I am disposed to take the view that if they were approached by the League Council with a definite request and suitable means for financing the transfer could be devised, they would actually welcome a solution on these lines. As you are aware, when Major Wilson, the Administrative Inspector at Mosul, visited Syria about two months ago in charge of a large convoy of Assyrian families, he gathered from the local officials that the mandatory [306 p—1]authorities were not at all averse from the idea of enlarging still further the Assyrian settlements which had been established in the basin of the Khabur. 4. There are, it would appear, a number of possible advantages to be gained by the French from the presence of a large Assyrian settlement in this area. It would hasten the economic development of a potentially fertile, but at present little cultivated, area; it would break up the Arab bloc and be a balance to the Kurdish element; it would provide valuable recruits for the local military forces, and would constitute an impotant factor in the organisation of defence against aggression, both from the direction of Nisibin and from the Sin jar. Politically, the presence of the Assyrians as the result of League action would be of great value in justifying the indefinite prolongation of French mandatory control, and would go some w'ay to justify France in continuing to play her historic role of protectrice of the Christians in the East. 5. Bearing all this in mind, I feel that the French attitude is largely a matter of approach. In the event of the Guiana scheme proving impracticable, I believe that if a tactful appeal were made by the Council Committee, the French Government would, subject to the satisfactory adjustment of the pecuniary side of the question, be willing to receive in Syria a large number, if not all, of the Assyrians who wish to leave Iraq. 6. From the point of view of the welfare of the Assyrians themselves, the chief objection of their resettlement in Syria would be the fact that at some future date the French mandate will presumably come to an end. The Assyrians may therefore once more be left an alien Christian minority under a Mahometan Government amid a potentially hostile indigenous people. Actualities in Syria do not suggest that the termination of the French mandate is at all imminent; and even if the present French proposals for a treaty with the Syrian Government were to be put into effect, the situation then created would resemble that of Iraq under the treaty of 1922 with Great Britain rather than that under the Treaty of Alliance of 1930. The Assyrians could rest assured of adequate protection for their lives and property. It is true that the Khabur basin (the area in which any settlement is most likely to be undertaken) is a flat plain and may not be ideal for mountaineers. If, however, nothing better can be found, the best use must be made of what is available With the gloomy prospect in their minds of remaining indefinitely in this country, I have no doubt whatever that, if given the choice between Iraq* and Syria, a large number would elect to go to the latter country. 7. From the Iraqi standpoint, the objection might be raised that a large Assyrian settlement in the basin of the Khabur would be a potential menace to the north-west frontier of Iraq. Whatever the real extent of this danger might be, it should. I think, be possible to convince the Iraqi Government that active and discontented Assyrian elements in Iraq constitute a far greater menace than a contented and prosperous enclave in Syria, even if it were used at the spear head of French penetration or as the fulcrum of French diplomatic leverage. S. From your confidential telegram No. 230 of the 18th December, I gather that the final report of General Browne’s Commission may not be so unfavourable as was anticipated when your despatch was written, and that it may prove possible to resettle the Assyrians in British Guiana by slow stages. At the same time it seems to me that the scheme of settlement which is likely to be advocated by General Browne’s report may give rise to dfficulties in regard to the time and expense of settlement, for which the league Committee may not be able to find a solution, and may in consequence, as you suggest, be tempted to revert to the id f ea of the resettlement of the Assyrians in Iraq itself under specific safeguards. I must strongly urge that every possible expedient should be employed to divert the committee from such a course, and that, as a constructive alternative, the committee should be invited urgently to examine the possibility of resettlement in Svria. 9. In spite of the objections to which I have referred above, Syria does, in fact, offer a number of advantages not to be found in Guiana as a new home for the Assyrians. The idea of removal to so remote a place as Guiana is not popular among the Assyrians, and I understand from Major Wilson that propaganda against this proposal has alreadv been fostered by the patriarchal house. Svria. on the other hand, is a country familiar to many of the Assyrians, and the Mar Shimun proclaimed himself in favour of it in 1933. Furthermore, the lone delays inseparable from any scheme for transferring and establishing3 the Assyrians in Guiana, and the dangers to which such delays would give rise, would, to a great extent, be obviated by resettlement in Syria. A or would there be such serious difficulty over the provision of sufficient money to provide ior settlement in Syria as there would be in the case of settlement m Guiana or other similarly remote country.^ ^ of &amp; ^ of d 0 „ the Assyrians. There are two mam factors to be considered . the Assyrians and the Iraqi Government. In regard to the former, I agree generally with the opinionstressed in your despatch that the chief menace lies m the possibility of their committing some desperate act of folly, which might lead c rue am promiscuous retaliation such as occurred in the summer of last £ ea ^ J. ao-ree with your appreciation of the importance of the influence of the Patriarch in this regard, and I consider that the chief risk of the occurrence of an act o[ folly of this kind lies in the intrigues of the Patriarchal party, and possibl) m the direct incitement of Mar Shimun himself. The penury of some of the a ^vrians at the present time may provide a favourable atmosphere for intriguer bu P .«?»of lb. tribal type are „to„ U, m&amp;totoegS f 0 “ when their bellies are full than when they are empty. It will be recalled, tor instance that it was those who were settled in the most prosperous villages wh were the most readily influenced by the Patriarch’s political propaganda m 1933^ The exacXarmg on the question of the political danger of fresh disorders of the present admittedly exceeding unsatisfactory and unstable economic situation of many of the Assyrians is therefore somewhat difficult to appreciate. 11 ^ The position of the Iraqi Government m this matter is more easily calculable As I have already affirmed in my telegram No 277 I am as confident now as I was in 1932 that, so long as the Assyrians abstain from some recUess act suggesting the threat of an armed movement against the authority of thv. Government, the Iraqi Government will neither initiate nor encourage any form of terror or active oppression against the Assyrians. Without provocation, their ntt tude would normally be one of comparative indifference I am equallv cunfidentMu spiteTthJ events of 1933, that neither the Kurdish nor the Arab tribes nor the townspeople of Mosul would, even under provocation, undertake anv large-scale action against the Assyrians without some sort of a lead emanating from authoritative quarters. If, fowever, the Assyrians should once again organise a considerable armed movement or » n “ ntr f V?’ t ^Td^llow^geneml the Government may again, in panic, permit or at W not disMlow g j and indiscriminate retaliatory measures, in which the tribes mat be encoi g t0 These are the elements of the danger. What are the preventive measures which can be adopted? In paragraph 16 of your despatch under reply you snowst that the Iraqi Government should make it clearly and generally understood 'in the Kurdish districts that no be allowed even in retaliation for Assyrian provocation. Apart trom tne great difficultv of persuading the Iraqi Government to make a public pronouncemer of lhis'knid' eXr tfrough th\ distribution of ^ r Xr °ttn similar means I am certain that such a step would disturb ratnei tna tranouilHse the situation It would inevitably give rise to the wildest and most SeiaSd nL^ and, by creating an atmosphere of excitejnt migM TArJqrfitate a crisis In dealing with tribal peoples, the best aid to tranqumm Fs an P atmosphere of normality; anything suggesting the imminence of unusual and impotent events must be avoided. Moreover, as I have endeavoured to make clear in paragraph 11 above, the danger of reprisals lies not so much in the tribes themselves, as in the temper and attitude of the Government follows therefore, that mv efforts should aim at bringing home to the Iraqi f ’ ent, • (a) the dangers inherent in the situation so long as the transfer of thp V Assyrians ioa new home outside Iraq is deferred; and (b) the necessity for considering and bringing into effect, without delay, suitable measures to minimise these^dangers. ^ from ^ tele No. 8 of the 4th January. that I have already taken preliminary action on these lines. On the e\e of the departure of the Prime Minister, to present at Geneva the case of Iraq in the Ser dispute with Persia. I discussed the Assyrian question in detail with hi™ Treminded him. incidentally, of the necessity for the goodwill of the League ^ n B 2 [306 p—1]mm ■■■■■■■ Mi 4 in this dispute, but warned him that if, as a result either of Iraq’s indifference or encouragement, the Assyrians were to be subjected to molestation, Iraq would forfeit the sympathy of many of her friends at Geneva. His Excellency was quick to seize the point, and promised to leave, before his departure, definite instructions to the Mutessarifs of Mosul and Erbil to prevent the Assyrians from being molested even if their behaviour were provocative. I had purposely postponed action on these lines until I had had an opportunity of discussing the whole matter with Sir Kinahan Cornwallis and the Air Officer Commanding I will report later on the actual steps taken by the Iraqi Government in this matter. In this connexion it is gratifying to know that the reports I have received of the new Mutessarif of Mosul, Umar Nazmi Beg, are most satisfactory and leave nothing to be desired. 14. In discussing preventive measures, you have stressed the need for action by the Iraqi Government, and I have accordingly given my first attention to this aspect of the question. It seems clear, however, that the disorders which we fear would arise mainly from a desperate act of folly by the Assyrians, and that, although there are other possible contributory factors, the principal danger lies here. 15. As you point out in your despatch, Patriarchal influence has already prevented many Assyrians in straitened circumstances from accepting monetary help from the Iraqi Government and from resuming their normal life pending emigration. As you also suggest, the Patriarch and his followers would not be averse from inciting a recurrence of the troubles of 1933, if it should appear to serve their personal aims to do so. It is therefore possible that some of the extremists among the Mar Shimun’s supporters may create trouble if their departure from Iraq is much longer delayed. Bearing the above facts in mind, it appears reasonable that attention should not be directed exclusively to the palliative and preventive measures to be taken by the Iraqi Government, but that consideration should also be given to the possibilities of action calculated to curtail the intrigues of Mar Shimun and his party. I confess to some anxiety over that portion of your despatch in which I was informed that there are no means of influencing the Patriarch to change his attitude. 16. I understand that the Mar Shimun is at present in England enjoying the hospitality and protection of many men prominent in public life. He is supported by the charity of his English sympathisers. Elis family are political refugees on British territory in Cyprus. In short, he is at present almost entirely dependent on the goodwill .and favour of His Majesty’s Government and the British people. If he persists in abusing this favour by violating the conditions of his residence in England, he is doing the worst possible disservice to his people. It is freely said in Bagdad that he will never learn the meaning of discipline until he joins the Church of Rome. I should like to see this theory disproved. 17. I have limited my observations in the main to the dangers of an outbreak of disorder pending the removal of the discontented Assyrians to a new home outside Iraq, since, in my view, it is neither expedient nor possible at this stage to attempt to appreciate in detail the situation which would be created if the Council of the League were to abandon their present policy and were to fall back on schemes for resettling the Assyrians in Iraq. You have already pointed out in your despatch that, in such an event, a serious dispute between the League and the Iraqi Government would be likely to arise, with results that might be far-reaching. I need only add that these results, apart from the embarrassment which they°would cause to His Majesty’s Government, might be disastrous to the Assyrians, and might destroy all hope of safeguarding the religious, economic and cultural future of this pathetic remnant of a once mighty Church and people. IB. If, as the result of the further reports from General Browne, to which vou refer in your telegram No. 229 of the 18th December, it becomes apparent that the British Guiana scheme has broken down, I most strongly advise that any public pronouncement which may be made in this sense should be accompanied by a statement to the effect that the possibility of further resettlement in Syria is being actively explored. If this is done, I do not anticipate that the news of the ^failure of the Guiana scheme will cause any very grave despondency among the Assyrians themselves, or serious complications with the Iraqi Government. Indeed, it may be that many, in both quarters, would be relieved. I feel, however, that every effort should be made to avoid the exceedingly5 disquieting situation which might arise from an announcement of the abandon- j ment of the Guiana scheme unaccompanied by any hope of feasible alternative // settlement outside Iraq. 19 - 1 now come to the third issue raised in your despatch, viz., the action which should be taken by His Majesty’s Government if, in spite of all the precautions which it may be possible to take, a fresh outbreak of Assyrian disorders should occur. 20. I agree with your view that an outbreak is more likely at the outset to take the form of an isolated incident than of another effort to effect a large armed concentration, though, if it were made known that the League had given up hope of finding a new home for the Assyrians outside Iraq, the latter contingency would be by no means improbable. In any event, however, once disorders began, the danger of their spreading and of the Christian minorities in Mosul and the surrounding villages becoming involved would be very much the same in character, though liable to vary considerably in degree. 21. It is exceedingly difficult to make detailed recommendations in advance as to the policy which His Majesty’s Government should follow in the event of an outbreak of disturbances of this kind. So much would depend on an appreciation of the elements of the situation existing at the time when the outbreak occurred, and on the various courses of action which these elements might make possible, that I find it practically impossible to say now what policy it would be most appropriate for His Majesty’s Government to adopt. 22. I am, however, convinced that any impulsive intervention by the personnel of the Royal Air Force Squadron and Armoured Car Section at Mosul, such as is contemplated in paragraph 13 of your despatch, could only lead to the most disastrous consequences. Such intervention would almost inevitably provoke the wildest possible outburst of fanaticism and frenzy throughout the country, from the fury of which the existing British forces would be quite inadequate to protect the Christian minorities, or, perhaps, to escape themselves. The lives of British and other European residents would also be endangered, and, long before the necessarily large ground force of all arms could be concentrated and transported to Iraq to undertake the operations and establish the physical conti ol envisaged in paragraph 1/ of your despatch, the situation would ha\e got out of hand. . ... , , T i 23. There is no need to paint a drab picture m alarming colours, and I have no wish to do so in this despatch. I would, however, propose that, should the necessitv arise, all ranks of the Royal Air Force in Iiaq should be warned that individual or collective intervention without orders constitutes a grave offence against discipline, and will not be tolerated. As regards authorised action by units of the Royal Air Force, I presume that no authority would be given except at the instance and in accordance with the wishes of the Iiaqi Go\ eminent, and after a decision by His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom. 24. Nevertheless, I fully appreciate the gravity of the dilemma with which His Majesty’s Government might be confronted should an outbreak such as is now under consideration take place, and it is because I fear that the abandonment of all schemes of resettling the bulk of the Assyrians outside Iraq might lead to a dangerous impasse, that I feel it in the highest degree impolitic to contemplate such a change of policy. . , . , , , , • ,| 25 I do not propose to discuss, m this despatch, the possibility of resuming ; physical control in this country. No massacre of Iraqi subjects, however cruel and 11 unprovoked, would justify so vast an outpouring of British blood and treasure which such a policy would involve. Physical intervention on behalf of a minority against the Central Government would eventually result m the total extermination or expulsion of the Christian minorities. We committed oursel\es fourteen years ago for better or for worse to an independent Iraq. We cannot now reverse this policy without injustice to the Arabs, the minorities and ourselves • • • 26. The Assyrian problem is difficult and complicated, but. in my view is susceptible of a reasonable solution on the lines advocated in this despatch, if the League resolutely carry out the policy of finding a new home for those Assyrians who^ desire one, and we are prepared to share with the Iraqi Government the relatively small expense involved. ^ have &amp;c F.

Section 1 . [E 672/2/93] No. 1. Record of the Thirty-Seventh Meeting of the Assyrian Committee, January 17, 1935, at 11 a.m. — [Communicated by United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva; received January 30, 1935.) THE committee first considered the letter of the 5th January from the Office centrale d’Entr’aide des Eglises (C. Min. Ass./94). The President said that he had not felt able to take a decision on his own responsibility regarding the action to be taken as a result of this letter. As the Iraqi Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were in Geneva, it might be useful, if the committee decided to take up any particular attitude, to proceed orally with the two Iraqi Ministers rather than by correspondence. Before the committee discussed this matter, however, M. Olivan wished to explain that he had recently received a visit from a deputation headed by Professor Keller. The deputation had explained their concern regarding the present situation of the Assyrians in Iraq, and their desire to have this situation investigated by some impartial body. M. Olivan, on his side, explained the efforts of the Assyrian Committee to find a settlement of the question and the difficulties in the way of carrying out the proposals put forward by Professor Keller’s organisation. He had'promised, however, that the letter of the 5th January would be examined. The deputation had gone on to say that if a home were found for the Assyrians of Iraq, they hoped that the committee would also find a home for all the other Assyrians scattered throughout the world. M. Olivan had explained that it was sufficiently difficult to find a home for the 20,000 Assyrians of Iraq, and he asked the deputation not to complicate the committee’s task. Turning to the letter of the 5th January, M. Olivan said that if it was practicable to carry out the proposals made in the letter he personally would be extremely glad, as he could not help feeling considerable anxiety regarding the situation of the Assyrians. The United Kingdom Representative said that it was, of course, unlikely that the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq should be, at the moment, completely satisfactory. The Assyrians themselves were living in a state of uncertainty, not knowing whether they were going to be removed from Iraq or not, and were in consequence reluctant to resume their normal life and work. The Iraqis, on their side, were uncertain whether the Assyrians would leave Iraq. While it was impossible for the United Kingdom representative to give any authoritative information, the opinion which the United Kingdom Government had formed as a result of information from unofficial as well as from official sources was to the effect that, though the situation could not be regarded as satisfactory, there was no reason to suppose that there was at present actual destitution. Such distress as might exist was due in the main to the fact that the Assyrians had refused the assistance which the Iraqi Government had offered to enable them to return to their villages and restart cultivation. As regards the methods proposed by Professor Keller’s organisation, the first, i.e., the despatch of an official commission of enquiry, had frequently been discussed by the committee, who had in the past fully realised the difficulties and dangers involved. In the first place, Iraqi consent would be necessary, and even if that consent were given there was always the chance of local disturbances if a commission went out. The despatch of a private relief committee might conceivably be less objectionable, but even that might only complicate the problem. It seemed probable that, if it were known that relief were going to be distributed, those Assyrians who had already returned to their villages would leave them again and flock into Mosul, where the distribution of relief would probably have to be centralised, and the problem would be rendered still more acute than it was at present.r 2 The President said that, with all respect for the information which the United Kingdom representative had furnished, the situation must, in his personal point of view, be very serious. In the letter of the 5th January the churches had given certain facts and had suggested certain procedure. It seemed very difficult to discourage the proposals made in the letter, unless the committee could say definitely that the facts on which they were based were incorrect. He understood that the opinion which the United Kingdom representative had given was to be regarded as a private expression of view. If the committee could state definitely, on the authority of the United Kingdom Government, that the situation was as described, the answer to the letter of the 5th January would, of course, be easier. The United Kingdom Representative said that naturally the United Kingdom Government were not in a position to give an authoritative statement. That the Iraqi Government alone could do, but he had given the committee in good faith the opinion which the United Kingdom Government had come to on the information available to them. They had been very anxious about the situation, and had taken such steps as were open to them to ascertain what the situation was. He could not say more. It was, of course, impossible for the committee to express any opinion of its own, as it had no means of acquiring the necessary information. He suggested, however, that the committee could at least say that it had no information to confirm that the situation was as Professor Keller’s organisation described it. M. Olivdn said that he did not think that the committee could go so far. He thought it would look very strange if the committee used any wording to the effect that it was unaware of the nature of the situation. It had, after all, been entrusted by the Council with the task of looking after the situation of the Assyrians pending migration. The United Kingdom Representative reminded the committee that it had not, in fact, been entrusted with the task of looking after the situation in Iraq. In the terms of reference contained in the original report of the rapporteur, the Iraqi Government had merely been asked to furnish the committee with periodical reports regarding the situation of the Assyrians. The committee had been entrusted with no task other than receiving these reports. The President said that he thought the committee must be presumed to have power to take any necessary action or make any recommendations on the reports. One way of dealing with the present letter would, of course, be to ask Professor Keller’s organisation to state on what the information contained in paragraph 1 of their letter was based. Another alternative was simply to put the whole matter before the Council and ask the Council to decide what action should be taken. In answer to an enquiry from the Italian representative, the President said that he had not yet been in touch with the Iraqi delegation. He wished first of all to have this private exchange of views between the members of the committee. The Danish Representative thought it might be wise to see Professor Keller and ask him orally from what source his information was derived. It might be that it came simply from the Mar Shimun. The President was reluctant to take this course. The committee must be presumed to have opportunities of satisfying itself that the situation of the Assyrians was satisfactory, and it had a responsibility in this sense. He did not think it possible to throw doubt on the facts given in the first paragraph of the letter, or to pass over that paragraph in silence. The United Kingdom Representative said that he would like the committee to consider another aspect of its responsibility. Its main task was to find a permanent solution for the Assyrian question, and it must be careful not to take any unnecessary action which might interfere with that main task. He also felt bound to say that there was a certain section of the Assyrians which did not desire to see a satisfactory solution and which was bent on creating trouble. Due allowance must be made in the reports which were current about Assyrian destitution for propaganda directed to this end. It was natural that those of the Assyrians who wished to create further embarrassment should paint the picture in its blackest colours.jAp) [306 gg—1] B 2 3 The President said that he thought the committee had in fact been extremely careful to discount propaganda, and had been extremely patient and moderate in its dealings with the Iraq Government in regard to the situation of the Assyrians in Iraq. Taking into account, however, the various views which had been expressed, he thought that the best course for the committee to follow would • be to send the letter to the Iraqi delegation saying that the committee would like a reply from the Iraqi Government on the statements made in the first paragraph, and also a declaration of the Iraqi Government’s point of view on the proposals made in the letter. Provisionally a reply might be sent to Professor Keller saying that his letter had been sent for such action as might . be possible to the Iraqi Government, and that the reply of that Government would be transmitted to Professor Keller on its receipt. If the committee decided to adopt this course, he himself would propose, in conversation with the Iraqi delegates, to emphasise the importance which the committee attached to this matter. The Danish Representative asked the committee to consider whether it was in fact prepared to accept the responsibility involved in the first of the two proposals made in Professor Keller’s letter. The Mexican Representative said that he thought that Professor Keller ought in the first place to be asked to give the source of his information. The President thought that this would be an unusual course to adopt in regard to a document which was in the nature of a petition, and he thought that in the case of a letter from the Churches it would be, in addition, somewhat ungracious. The United Kingdom Representative said that he had been about to suggest a course very similar to that which M. Olivan had proposed. He thought, however, that the observation made by the Danish representative was very important. The committee had hitherto realised that in proposing the despatch of a commission of enquiry, the League would be taking upon itself what might be an extremely embarrassing responsibility. He thought that that objection still held good. But the second proposal was also somewhat dangerous. He knew that the question of sending out relief had been very carefully considered by ecclesiastical organisations in Great Britain. After hearing such evidence as was available, however, these organisations had apparently come to the conclusion that no special effort was necessary at the moment. He believed that they had also felt that any appeal for funds at this stage would probably militate against the success of the larger appeal which they contemplated should any settlement scheme come into being. But while special measures were not absolutely necessary, it was fairly obvious that any charitable contributions which could be sent to Iraq would be of great value, the ecclesiastical organisations in Great Britain realised this, but they also realised that any relief, if it were not to make the problem immensely more difficult and perhaps insoluble, must be distributed with the utmost discretion. He personally thought that anything like a special relief mission was bound to end in trouble. At the same time, that was only his personal opinion. He was not there to state the Iraqi case. The Iraqi Government must themselves decide, and he quite agreed that the letter should be transmitted to the Iraqi delegation for comments. He suggested, however, that M. Olivan in his subsequent conversations with the Iraqi delegation might indicate that the committee was fully aware of the difficulty of sending out any official mission of enquiry, but would be very glad in particular to know the views of the Iraqi Government on the second proposal made in the letter, namely, the despatch of a private relief organisation. The Danish Representative asked what precisely were the dangers which the United Kingdom representative apprehended in the case of a private relief mission. The United Kingdom Representative said that he thought that any mission would probably find it necessary to centralise its efforts in Mosul. Any attempt to go round the country distributing relief in various villages might be a matter of difficulty. But there were two difficulties which he foresaw. In the first place the Assyrians had grown accustomed during the past fourteen vears to expect aid from outside whenever they were in difficulties. They had unfor-JHBHi 4 tunateiy developed a refugee spirit. He felt that it was certain, therefore, that if any relief organisation were opened it would be the signal for the majority of the Assyrians to desert their normal work and homes and flock into whatever place was chosen for the distribution of relief. He feared also that there might be actual conflict between the Assyrians and other communities. It must be remembered that the standard of living in Northern Iraq was very low, and that while the committee had in mind particularly the distress of the Assyrians, there were other categories of Iraqis who were extremely badly off and who had no relief. If these saw the Assyrians singled out for preferential treatment they might also clamour for it, and even vent their feelings on the Assyrians them selves. Apart from this, he thought that the question of responsibility ought to be carefully considered. If a relief mission went out to Iraq, the Iraqi Govern ment would very probably consider themselves absolved from all further obligation towards the Assyrians. If the Assyrians flocked into Mosul, a semi permanent problem might be created. So long as funds lasted there might be no difficulty, but there might easily come a time when the funds of the Churches were not sufficient for the task in hand and the Churches might find themselves in a very invidious position. If the mission had gone out, so to speak, under the auspices of the League, and if its despatch had been arranged by the League, the consequent responsibility would devolve upon the League. He did not know whether his colleagues were prepared to accept this position. The President said that, judging from past experience, he did not think that there was any danger of the Iraqis accepting the despatch of an official mission. In view of what had been said, however, he was inclined to think that the best course would be for the committee to transmit Professor Keller’s letter to the Iraqi Government, saying that the committee was not in a position to express any opinion either on the facts alleged in it or on the proposals suggested, but that it would be glad to have the Iraqi Government’s views. This course was agreed to, and it was also agreed to send a reply to Professor Keller on much the same lines, i.e., that the committee was not in a position to express an opinion on the facts alleged or on the proposals suggested, but that they had thought it best in the first place to send a copy of the letter to the Iraqi Government in order to obtain their views. The President mentioned that at the last meeting of the committee the Iraqi representative had promised to obtain further information (1) regarding what had happened to the persons sent away from the Mosul camp; (2) regarding the incidents which had taken place on the occasion of their removal from the camp; (3) as to whether the measures taken by Iraq in October in relation to the Mosul camp were definitive, or if they were to be followed by others. M. Olivan said that when he saw the Iraqi delegates he proposed to mention these specific points and try to hasten the reply to them. He would also emphasise generally the concern which the committee felt about the whole Assyrian question and would try to induce the Iraqis to be more forthcoming. This line was approved by the committee. M. Arocha then mentioned that there were still certain countries, namely, Turkey, Canada, the Argentine and Columbia, which had not replied to the enquiries sent by Tim committee in June last regarding the possibilities of settlement in the respective countries. It had been suggested that the committee ought to take steps to clear up the attitude of the Governments concerned. The President and the Danish Representative suggested that letters should at once be sent to the four Governments asking them to reply without further delay. The United Kingdom Representative pressed for the reminders to be sent by telegram in spite of the expense to which M. Arocha had meanwhile referred. The United Kingdom Representative pointed out that it was urgently necessary to clear up the attitude of these Governments. Assuming for a moment that General Browne’s report was unfavourable, the committee might be compelled to wait for an embarrassing length of time before it could present a definite recommendation to the Council. M. Olivdn said that in such circumstances he for one would certainly not be in favour of any further delay. He would propose to take silence as refusal andr,Y‘ 94^ to report accordingly to the Council that settlement outside Iraq was impossible. However, he agreed that it would be well to get replies if possible, ihe proposal to telegraph was accordingly approved. The French Representative then said that he had been struck by the passage ^n General Browne’s preliminary report of the 11th December which indicated 'hat a home could not be found immediately in British Guiana lor ail tne Assyrians, and that in General Browne’s opinion it would be necessary to send out a first contingent as a practical experiment. Settlement might thus be spread over considerable time. There was a great similarity between this view and thao taken by the administrative authorities in French West Africa. In tact, tne settlement of all the Assyrians at the same time and at the same place seemed impossible and, in view of the fact that the removal of the Assyrians from Iraq appeared to be urgent, he wondered whether the committee ought not to mlorm the Council of the changed basis on which it was working. The President said that as a general principle he was always m favour of keeping the Council as fully and as frequently informed as possible. It a report were now furnished to the Council it would have to contain the substance ot General Browne’s telegraphic report of the 11th December, which was, ^weYer of a provisional nature only. If the committee were to tell the Council of the difficultv to which the French representative had referred, the rapporteur would have to accompany the report with views as to what action should be taken, tie suggested that at the present stage this might be distinctly prematuie. He thSSght, therefore, it would be preferable to wait Once the more detailed report from General Browne arrived, the position would be carefully studied by the committee and a report prepared for the Council. He wished, however, to go to the Council with definite recommendations. The Danish Representative said that he was entirely in agreement with the President, and all the more so, seeing that General Browne ha d n ot given e reasons for his views nor yet the numbers who he thought could be settled m the first contingent. The question raised by the French representative was, however, an important one, since it seemed likely that the Council might not meet after the present session until next May. Before then important questions might have to be settled; for instance, the option which the United Kingdom Govern ment had obtained to acquire the assets of the Rupununi Company expired on the 20th April. M. Arocha pointed out that in the first instance the Council had specifically delegated wide powers to the committee, which could, m fact, regard itself as having carte blanche in this question. The French Representative said that he had not meant to suggest an immediate report to the Council on the information so far available^ What he fX however, was that settlement, if it proved practicable, would not be precisely on the basis which the Council had contemplated, and he felt that the decision as to whether it should be proceeded with on the slower and more gradual msis should be a decision taken by the Council itself. The President said that it would be preferable if the Council could take a decision He was reluctant, however, to place the matter before the Council unless there was a realisable project or, in the absence of such a project, a clear situation He felt, however, that matters could not be allowed to drag on and in the absence of any concrete scheme he would feel bound to lay the whole position before the Council at latest in May next. The Danish Representative enquired whether, if General Browne suggested tbit T start should be made with, say 1,000 Assyrians, the committee would fee abte k proceed on that basis without putting the matter before the Council in May. The United Kingdom Representative said the answer depended on a factor which was perhaps in danger of being overlooked, Before the committee could express a definite opinion on the British Guiana scheme, it would be necessary t discuss General Browne’s opinion (perhiips waiting for his detailed report foi this ourpose) with His Majesty’s Government. So far His Majesty s Government werekotcommitted to the British Guiana scheme. They had merely indicated t6 possibilities for investigation, but it was only natural that General Browne’s reports should be discussed with His Majesty’s Government in the first place, so that the latter might have an opportunity of considering whatever difficulties there might be and whether they could, in fact, be surmounted, and in the light of the discussions His Majesty’s Government would have to decide definitely whether they were prepared to receive the Assyrians in British Guiana. The President agreed. The United Kingdom Government were in this respect in much the same position as the Brazilian Government had been a year ago. The French Representative recalled that the committee had asked for further information regarding French Guiana. A preliminary despatch has now arrived and further details were on their way by air mail. M. de Panafieu read an extract from the preliminary despatch which showed that land could be offered at three points in the territory, that at each point water was plentiful and that the cost of the land would be in the region of 10 fr. a hectare. In all some 50,000 hectares were available. The local administration calculated that room could be found for 40,000 persons, but that settlement would have to be progressive. But while there was no difficulty about the provision of land, the climate was tropical and the local authorities could not take the responsibility of deciding whether it was suitable for the Assyrians. It was for this reason that they had suggested that Genera] Browne should visit French Guiana. M. de Panafieu thought that it should be possible for General Browne to settle this question as to whether the climate was suitable by a very brief visit to the colony without exhaustive investigation. In reply to questions, the French representative said that the land offered was low-lying. There were plateaux in French Guiana, but it was not possible to make them available for Assyrian settlement. A discussion then ensued as to whether General Browne should be asked to visit French Guiana or whether he would be able to express an opinion as to whether the climate was likely to suit the Assyrians from information available in British Guiana or from his experience of the coastal belt in British Guiana, which probably did not differ very much from the area suggested by the French. It was felt that for General Browne to pay a short visit to French Guiana merely to judge whether the climate was suitable was not a very practical proposition, and that in any case, if he thought it suitable, it would still be necessary for him to make a detailed investigation of the areas proposed. It was recognised also that the question must turn to some extent on the nature of his reports about British Guiana. A suggestion was made that a telegram should be sent to General Browne at Georgetown indicating the possibilities of French Guiana and asking for his views as to the desirability of proceeding there. Objection was seen, however, to placing the responsibility on General Browne in this way, and it was eventually decided to do no more for the time being than to make sure that he did not leave Georgetown for Europe without giving the committee a chance to send him further instructions in the light of his reports. M. Arocha was accordingly instructed to send a telegram to General Browne asking him not to leave Georgetown pending the receipt of further instructions. o[306 gg-2] THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Iraq). January 30, 1935. CONFIDENTIAL. Section 2. [E 673/2/93] No. 1. Assyrian Question. Record of 38£A Meeting of Assyrian Committee, January 22, 1935. 10-30 a.m.— (Communicated by United Kingdom Delegation, Geneva; Received January 30.) THE President said that at the last meeting the question of the extension of General Browne’s mission to French Guiana had been left in suspense, as the members of the committee had felt that the decision must depend on the nature of General Browne’s report regarding British Guiana. The French representative had communicated confidentially to the secretariat certain information regarding the points of view of the local administration and of the colonial authorities in Paris. Although the local administration were apparently prepared to welcome the Assyrians, the view of the French Colonial Ministry on the possibilities of settlement was rather pessimistic. The President had thought it necessary to convoke the committee, therefore, to take a decision, and also to discuss the position of the British Guiana scheme, which seemed somewhat uncertain in the light of General Browne’s last telegram. The question was whether the mission should now be told to go to French Guiana, or to return at once. The United Kingdom Representative said that the question appeared to turn on the interpretation to be given to General Browne’s last telegram. The telegram did not appear very favourable, but he thought that the position would be clearer if all four telegrams from General Browne were read together. He pointed out that in the telegram of the 11th December General Browne had explained that the mission had examined the area to the south and north-west of the mountain of the Clackmannan area. The United Kingdom representative had been unable to identify this name on the map, and thought that it must refer to the Kanuku mountain. The area to the south was that in which the land of the Rupununi Development Company lay, and it was this area which His Majesty’s Government had had principally in mind, though they had promised the investigation of the whole area marked purple on the map attached to the Upited Kingdom Government’s memorandum on the subject. General Browne, in his telegram of the 11th December, had expressed the view that in the areas north-west and south of what might be presumed to be the Kanuku mountains settlement promised success, but would have to be carried out by gradual expansion. The telegram said that the mission was then proceeding to the northern area. The next telegram said that in the northern area the mission had divided, and that, as regards the area which he had seen personally, General Browne held the same opinion as previously expressed, namely, that the prospects were favourable, but that settlement must be progressive. The next telegram said that the mission had joined up again, and that as regards the north-west area, i.e., the one seen by Signor Gigholi, their opinion was again the same. The further telegram just received seemed, however, to denote a slight modification of this opinion, but only regarding that part of the territory which had been seen by Signor Giglioli. He did not think that the last telegram could be read as referring to the whole area which the mission had investigated, and as modifying the opinion three times expressed in earlier telegrams regarding the greater part of that area. The President said that the effect of General Browne’s telegram was not clear, and while the interpretation might well be that placed upon them by the United Kingdom representative, obviously the committee could not come to any authoritative interpretation. He thought that the whole matter must be allowed to rest until the mission itself had stated its views exactly in a detailed report.2 The position appeared to be that all the mission now wanted was instructions as to its future movements. The committee must therefore decide about French Guiana. The fact that there was uncertainty in British Guiana and also uncertainty in French Guiana made the situation difficult. Speaking personally, however, M. Olivan thought that if the French Ministry of the Colonies had expressed doubt, even though confidentially, regarding the prospects in French Guiana, his own impression was that it was dangerous for the Assyrian Committee to proceed with that scheme. He himself was frankly opposed to the expense and delay involved in sending General Browne and Signor Giglioli to French Guiana. The Italian Representative agreed with the President, and pointed out that the French representative had himself stated that previous experiments in French Guiana had failed. The French Representative said that he was bound to agree that the President’s view was a wise one. The Danish Representative said that he also had the same impression as the President, but he was bound to ask what the impressions of persons in Geneva were really worth. What concerned him was what reasons the committee could give as to why it was not proceeding with the French Guiana scheme. The information given by the French Government could not be quoted. He therefore wondered whether it would be worth while to ask General Browne whether he could obtain in Georgetown such information regarding conditions in French Guiana as would enable him to say whether investigation there was likely to be worth while. The United Kingdom Representative said that he did not think the difficulty raised by the Danish representative really serious. After all, the committee had examined various possibilities in the course of its work, and had in each case required to be satisfied that conditions were, prima facie, such as to justify detailed investigation, with all that that entailed. This plan had been followed in Brazil, and also been followed in British Guiana. It seemed to him perfectly easy for the committee, when eventually reporting to the Council, to say that French Guiana had also been considered, but that, on the information available, the committee had felt that there was not a prima facie case to justify the time and expense involved in detailed investigation. The President concurred, and it was agreed that any report to the Council which might mention French Guiana should be on the lines suggested by the United Kingdom representative. . . The President said that he thought the committee was m agreement to tell the mission to return to Europe without going to French Guiana. It remained to decide whether its task in British Guiana was completed. The last telegram from General Browne had spoken about the necessity of experiment and an enquiry on health as regards the north-western area. The President felt that the telegram could not be interpreted as referring to any but the north-western area. ButAhe question was whether the mission should be allowed to return without an investigation into health conditions in that area. It might be necessary to ask General Browne whether it was possible for this enquiry to be completed by the local British authorities. The United Kingdom Representative said that if there were any doubt about General Browne’s telegram it might be best to clear it up by a further telegram to General Browne before the mission left. The Danish Representative said that it seemed to him that General Browne’s last telegram obviously did not contemplate an immediate enquiry into health conditions, and it inferred that any enquiry could be conducted by the Colonial administration. The President suggested that it would be sufficient simply to telegraph to the mission to the effect that if it considered its task concluded it should now return to Geneva. The United Kingdom Representative suggested that this might be prefaced with a sentence to the effect that the committee assumed that the last telegram referred solely to the north-western area, which had apparently been visited by3 Signor Giglioli alone, and that the mission’s opinion on the area as a whole still remained as expressed in the telegram of the 11th December. The President said that he saw no advantage in clearing up this point at this stage. He felt it would be better to await the detailed report. He thought that the committee was agreed that the meaning of the various telegiams was that just placed upon them by the United Kingdom representative. It was agreed to send the following telegram to General Browne. “ Committee, concluding from your telegrams that, after visit to Trinidad, mission will consider its task completed, request that you return as soon as possible to Geneva. Please telegraph details of your movements.” The President suggested that when Brigadier Browne’s report had been received, it should be distributed and a few days given to the members of the committee to consider it before a meeting was held at Geneva at which Geneial Browne and Signor Giglioli would be present to gi^c peisonal explanations.

It contains papers regarding the Assyrian Crisis in Iraq during 1933-1935. The papers cover the proposed scheme to resettle the Assyrians of Iraq in British Guiana, on land to be purchased from the Rupununi Company. Following a report by General Browne and Signor Giglioli of the League of Nations Assyrian Committee, which concluded that the British Guiana scheme was unworkable, the League considered a scheme for resettlement in the French-mandated territories of the Levant [Syria]. The file contains details of the trip made by the President of the Assyrian Committee (J Lópaz Oliván) to Iraq and Syria, as well as details of the negotiations over the division of costs between HM Government (HMG), the Government of Iraq, and the League of Nations. The purchase of the Iraqi Railways by the Government of Iraq is also discussed in the file, with HMG and Iraq eventually reaching an agreement to lower the cost of the railway in return for a higher Government of Iraq contribution to the Assyrian resettlement in Syria.The file primarily consists of: correspondence between the Foreign Office, HM Consul at Geneva (J C Sterndale Bennett), HM Minister at Baghdad (Charles Harold Bateman), and the Government of Iraq. It also contains a number of reports and memoranda circulated by the League of Nations, including minutes of the 37th through to the 61st meeting of the Council of the Assyrian Committee.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the end of the correspondence (folio 2).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>British Guiana</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Assyrians</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>League of Nations</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000602.0x0001a1#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
