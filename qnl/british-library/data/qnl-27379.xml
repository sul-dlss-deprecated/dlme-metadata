As the enemy property in Bahrain is not administered ^ 1 r-v*-v 4 - 1 - r* _ _ _ ^ ^ the British Indian Custodian, it is not for the Government of Inoia to decide as to how the proceeds of enemy bills under reference should ultimately be disposed of. This question would seem to be the sole concern of the authorities in Bahrain. 3 « As regards enemy property in India, the Government o: India have decided that property belonging to the liberated Allied countries should be released on conclusion of Debt Settlement Agreements with those countries. The amount of ^•47-14-0 held by the Eastern Bank on account of a firm in Holldnd is very small it would seem unnecessary for the authorities in Bahrain to approach the Dutch authorities on the lines of Debt Settlement Agreement being negotiated in India. It is suggested, therefore, that the amount may be released to the Netherland firm. 4. As regards the other bills given in the list forming enclosure to the memorandum from the^Political Agent, Bahrein to the Residency, No.C/712, dated the 20th June, 1947, which apparently belong to German owners, it is desired that their proceeds should not be released. All German property in India is to be utilised towards the satisfaction^of Indian reparation claims against Germany. In fact all German external assets are to be utilised towards the Reparations claims of the Allies. Sd. J.N. Dhamija.
