If any despatch of ^ troops m that direction be contemplated, it will ' doubtless be under cover of an invitation from ' the Arabs themselves, and it may be worth while &lt;c to consider whether there is any likelihood of ' such an invitation being given.' He thought that such a thing might arise out the relations between the Sheikh of Aboothabee and a section of his tribe settled at Odeid, and there was, in his opinion, no doubt that the Turkish Arabian authorities considered both Aboothabee and Bereymee as portions of the pro vince of Nejd, and that they would gladly seize anv favourable opportunity of possessing themselvfij of them. In a subsequent letter (19th September),! re - ferring to some correspondence which had passed between Yussuf Effendi, the Assistant of Ferek Pasha, and the Chiefs of Debaye and Aboothabee, Colonel Ross observed that, while the letters iid not themselves prove any intention of the Turk^ interfere politically in Oman, yet, coupled with thb generally received reports, there seemed ground to view their operations in that quarter with distrust. On the 5th September 1874, the Resident re ported to the Government of India that the 3000. I. 905. A30 Bedouin tribe of the Beni Hajir had made a serious attempt to cross from the mainland and attac Bahrein, that the attempt had been defeated by the movements of Her Majesty s vessels on the spot, but that it was likely to^ be renewed from one of the ports under Turkish authouty. In replv. Colonel Boss was ordered* to take effective steps to defend the island against aggression by any Chiefs or tribes of the Gulf. flic Govern ment of India, at the same time, suggested to the Secretary of State that Her Majesty s Ambassador at Constantinople might be instructed to represcu to the Porte that, if the tribes in question were under the authority of Turkey, they should be re- strained by the Government of the Sultan, t ticy added, ' If, however, Bahrein is attacked, action ' on the part of the British authorities in repelling ' the tribe will not be delayed.' From Colonel Ross's detailed report (12th Sep tember 1874).f it appeared that the Beni Ilajir had obtained boats at B1 Bidaa and were making for Bahrein, but that, disconcerted by the appear ance of the ' May Trere ' gunboat, they abandoned their boats and marched to attack Zobarah, a place on the Guttur peninsula held by the Nairn tribe, ' allies, and in some degree dependents, of the Bahrein Chief.' Zobarah was saved from capture by the arrival of the gunboat 'Hugh Eose,' the commander of which, by exercising his men at gun practice and firing two rounds of shell, apparently over the heads of the combatants on shore, so intimidated the Arabs that they retired inland. This proceeding of Captain Campbell was made the subject of a formal diplomatic remonstrance by ilj« Tii*k«ih Government, through Musurus Pasha,{ who gave a veiTsion of the transaction, according to which twenty4wo naan of the tribe had been killed by the fire of the %x Hugh Rose.' The Turkish note concluded as follows:—' T1 est a ' peine besoin d'ajouter que, si le commandant avaifc des griefs contre qui que ce soit, il pourrait &lt;c ct devait s'addresser aux autorites Imperiales ' pour en poursuivre le redressement par leur &lt;£ entremise—a distinct claim to jurisdiction over the Guttur coast opposite Bahrein. this point Colonel Ross, in his report (12th -SeptAmber 1874) to the Government of India, ob- serve|l?V- ' By the Tteity of 1861 with the Chiefs of Bahrein the British Gsovernment undertake to give their support to tpe Chief in the maintenance of the security of /rfis possessions against maritime aggres sions dirjAed against them by the Chiefs and tribes of ttie^l/orsian Gulf. It becomes a duty, therefore, firstly&gt; to prevent as far as possible any Chiefs or tribes finding the opportunity of embarking in such aggressive enterprises; and, secondly, if such a naval expedition should be found at sea by a British vessel of war, it would be the duty of such vessel to employ force against it. * Political Letter, No. 173, dated 22nd Sept. 1874. f Political Letter, No. 191, dated 23rd Oct. 1874, Enclosure No. 7.

In a further letter, dated 19tb December 1874,f pointing out the complete falsehood of the Turkish version of the affray at Zobarah in the previous August, Colonel Eoss observed ' The portion of u the Nairn tribe residing at Zobarah had not ' either avowed allegiance to Turkey nor been re- ' duced to subjection, so that it is impossible they ' could be in the position of revolted subjects. As ' regards Zobarah, that place has been hitherto ' considered by the Sheikhs of Bahiein, past and ' present, as a dependency of the island, and used ' as a summer residence. Without entering on the ' Bahrein claim, it is at least certain that the Amongst preventive measures we have hitherto counted on the assistance of the various local 4rab Chieftains of the Guttur coast in preventing boats )emg obtained or seized by marauding or piratically inclined Arabs, such Chieftains being ffiven to understand that they will be Wd responsible in taese matiers for their immediate coast line. ihe Chiefs in question, including those of El aa, have always hitherto acknowledged their lesponsibilities, and it has been customary to deal with them all direct for such purposes, and to this no demur has been made in any quarter. • j ' ^ is somewhat peculiarly situated as regards its political status. The old Chief, Mahomed bin Thanee, himself uses the Arab flag, whilst his son, Jasim, has put himself under 1 uikish protection, and a guard of Turkish soldiers is kept at Bidaa. It has not been declared, how ever, as far as I can ascertain, that the Turkish authorities have assumed the government of the place. It is very probable they are not prepared to assume responsibility for the maritime proceedings of the Chiefs or people of Bidaa. At the same time, Jasim bin Mahomed at all events, if not his father, is prepared, if pressed, to evade direct re sponsibility by pleading his being under Turkish authority. It is therefore now, I think, a matter for consideration whether the Turkish Government should not be asked clearly for what portions of the coast they undertake to be responsible.' To this the Government of India replied (21st * Political Letter, No. October 1874):—* Enclosure Xo' 1 ? 01,18 ' 4 ' ' ^ le P resen ^ aspect of affairs it is not desirable that you should have any communications with the local Turkish officials regarding Bahrein, Any necessary representations can, under present cir cumstances, be made with more effect through Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople under in structions from the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Interference in the affairs of Bahrein and of the Arab Chiefs on the coast should, as far as practicable, be limited to protecting the legitimate interests of British subjects, maintaining our treaty rights, and performing our treaty obligations. When these are affected it will be proper to take steps to put matters right; otherwise the less interference you exercise the better.'32 u Turkish Government have not assumed posses- ' sion of the place, nor openly claimed it. Their ' pretensions are put forward for the first time.' After noticing the danger to Bahrein arising from the fact that the exile Nasir bin Mobarik was on the coast as a proteg^ of the Turkish authorities, Colonel Ross concluded :— c&lt; The chief cause of embarrassment as regards the maintenance of peace and neutrality by sea between Bahrein and Guttur lies in the present un certainty as to the question with whom responsi bility rests. The various mainland Sheikhs may ^shelter themselves under Turkish protection whilst the latter power has not formally assumed Govern mental duties. Were the responsibilities more decidedly fixed the constant inconvenient anxiety about Bahrein would disappear.' Intermediately, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople,* consequent on a letter from Colonel Herbert at Baghdad, mentioning reports that the proceedings of the Beni Hajir had been instigated by a Turkish Agent at El Bidaa, and repeating his own opinion that Bedif Pasha, the Governor General, was himself encouraging in trigues, Sir H. Elliott intimated to the Turkish Government, both verbally and in writing, that Her Majesty's Government would not allow the independence of Bahrein to be placed in jeopardy,— decided language, with which the Marquis of Salis bury, then Secretary of State for India, expressed satisfaction.! At the close of 1874 a question arose as to the rights of the Sheikh of Bahrein over the Guttur coast opposite the island, and in particular over Zobarah, occupied by the El Nairn tribe. Some inquiry into the merits of this claim had been made in the previous year, when the First Assistant Resident in the Gulf reported,! as his conclusion frOm what he had heard when living in Bahrein, that in former years the Nairn, together with many other of the Guttur tribes, were in certain ways dependencies of Bahrein; but that the amount of authority exercised by the rulers of the island over Guttur seemed to have varied in proportion to the power of coercion those rulers possessed; if the Chief of Bahrein was strong the tribes acknow ledged his supremacy; if he was weak they denied it. The Sheikh of Bahrein having expressed to the Resident in the Gulf a desire to reinforce Zobarah with troops from the island, and generally to assist the Naim tribe if attacked by their neighbours, was advised§ by Colonel Boss as far as possible to keep clear of feuds on the mainland, and to carefully abstain from taking part in operations in which the Turkish Government was engaged. The Sheikh was not disposed to act upon this advice, or to abandon his right to Zobarah ; he was, however, informed by order of the Government of India[] that if he took any part in complications * L ojpatch, No. 279&gt; dated 7th Nov. 1874' Home Correspondence} Vol. 82, p. 181. f To Foreign Office, 5th Jan. 1875, No. 56.

The instructions* of Government to the Resident were: that the Chief the maMaQ d of Guttur, and that his rights there were of a very uncertain charactei, that he should not be encouraged to despatch troops to the mainland for the reinforce- il 1 1 allies; that the Government would help him to repel attacks by sea, or to frustrate a threatening movement from the mainland; that if he adhered to his treaty obligations the Govern- ment would protect him; but he must not be the aggressor, or undertake measures which might in volve him in complications. As the reports submitted by the Resident showed that the Sheikh persisted in asserting his rights to Zpbarah, the Government of India,f being con vinced that any active measures in support of those alleged rights could not fail to result in serious embarrassments, directed Colonel Ross to make the Sheikh clearly understand that if he persisted in a course opposed to the advice of the Government of India, and was thereby involved in complications on the mainland, the consequences would be upon himself, and that the British Government would hold themselves free to take such measures with respect to him as they might think necessary. While this discussion was pending, signs appeared of an intention on the part of the Turks to fix a quarrel on the Sheikh of Bahrein, on ti e pretence that he had given aid to the Wahabee Prince Abdool Rahman bin Peysul, with whom they were engaged in hostilities. Abdool Rahman had, in fact, taken shelter at Bahrein, and received the hospitable reception common amongst Arabs, but there was no evidence whatever that the Sheikh had committed any breach of neutrality. The Government of India accordingly addressed the Secretary of State as follows :—J ' Such being the state of affairs according to the most recent advices, we have to consider our position in case the Turks should proceed to overt action in pursuance of their alleged hostile designs upon Bahrein. The Chief relies on us for protection, and it has been our settled policy to aid him in the maintenance of his independence, so long as he faithfully fulfils his treaty obligations and abides by the advice which we give him. We have in fact informed the Chief through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf that, provided he fulfils the foregoing conditions, he may rely for support on the assistance of the British Government, which would if necessary be given him either to repel attacks by sea or to frustrate a threatening movement from the mainland. This assurance was given with special reference to the Chief s apprehensions of an attack from the hostile tribes near Zobarah, and to his desire that he might be permitted to reinforce his allies the Nairn tribe, who are now in posses sion of that fort; but the spirit of the assurance 3000. 13 I4&lt;&gt; \1 t is no less applicable to the case of an unprovoked aggression from any quarter, and we should consider ourselves bound by it if the Turks, as appears to be thought probable, were to use the Beni Ilajir tribe and Nasir bin Mobarik as their agents in an attack on the island. We have therefore considered it incumbent on us to be prepared for the emergency of being compelled to aid the Chief of Bahrein in the defence of his possessions, and have requested Rear Admiral Gumming to strengthen the naval force at Bahrein.' The Secretary of State (Lord Salisbury) replied: —* ^ 1 have to convey to you my approval ot your &lt;e decision to strengthen the naval force at Bahrein, &lt;£ so as to be prepared to aid the Chief in the de- &lt;l fence of his possessions against foreign aggression, ' should the necessity arise.' In November 1875 Nasir Pasha, the Turkish Governor of El Hassa, addressed a demand to the Sheikh of Bahrein, couched in rather menacing terms, for a prompt settlement of certain claims preferred by ' two respectable merchants of Guttur ' against some individuals alleged to have absconded to the island.f The Resident in the Gulf having been consulted by the Sheikh, advised him to send a conciliatory reply; but in reporting the matter to the Govern ment of India, Colonel Boss expressed a strong opinion that the demand had been preferred with ulterior objects ; he added :— ' I may here point out that in former times, before the advent of the Turk to these parts, such disputes, as between Guttur and Bahrein, would have usually been arbitrated by the representatives of the British Government; but for obvious reasons this is not longer feasible.' The Government of India replied (27th January 1876) :— ' His Excellency in Council approves of the tenor of your communication to the Chief of Bahrein, dated the 17th of December 1875, but desires me to state that in the event of the Chief consulting you further in the matter, you should confine yourself to offering friendly advice, and to urging the Chief to effect, in a fair and honest spirit, a settlement of the claims in question. ' If, however, Nasir Pasha should not be satis fied with the proceedings of the Chief in this matter, and should attempt to enforce his demands by menaces or by a display of force, you may justly, under the spirit of Article 3 of the Treaty with the Chief of Bahrein, dated 31st May 1861, intervene with the view of protecting the territory of Bahrein from maritime aggression.' The papers, on receipt here, were sent to the foreign Office J for such action as Lord Derby might deem advisable, with result that Sir H. Elliot was instructed to call the attention of the Porte to the matter. § # No. 9, Secret, dated 2nd April 1875. f Political Letter, No. 23, dated 28th Jan. 1876. f t n * J? th March 1876, No. 153. , J. ff' 0111 Foreign Office. 16th March 1876, No. 169,35 * Political Letter, No. 28, dated 4th Feb. 1876. j dicative of thr^osi^ion ^ otller e y ent occurred in- tbe Guttur coa^ T V vo b ? the Turks on Cheyla and Rama, merchants at El sub j ects » great pressure, and in snite of fi Were ' ^ polled by Mazeed Pashi fr ™ 101 r P ro ^ es t s 3 com- (Huf-huf), in the interior. 1 Up011 him at Lahsa St'' G —' »' wtoft tinned 0ld Sheikh, whom M-e have hitherto con- Su /Tir t treat , as the chief of the mstnct of EI Bulaa, has ever been sincerely friendly disposed towards the British Government and repre^ sentatiyes, and ready so far as he safely could to show his friendship when occasion offered. He has at times even made indirect communications with a view of privately sounding the Resident as to whether he might hope for the aid of the British government in any attempt to rid himself of the to him distasteful, incubus of Turkish domination! feuch overtures were necessarily discouraged. The ^ son of Mahomed bin Thanee, by name Jasim bin Mahomed, is animated by sentiments wholly opposed to those entertained by his father. J. uis Jasim has always shown a jealous and even hostile spirit as regards British authority in the Gulf, and was greatly instrumental in brin^inff the Turks to El Bidaa. t£ Consequently the compliance of Mahomed bin Thanee with our just demand was distasteful to Jasim. This person further trades himself in pearls and other merchandise, and, wishing to get the whole traffic of Bidaa into his own hands, would gladly drive the Indian merchants from the place by any means in his power. ' I have scarcely a doubt that Jasim used the affair of the indemnity, and the visit of the Resi dency steamer to El Bidaa, as a means of working on the jealous feelings of the Turkish officials, and has made such representations as to the con duct of the Hindoos as have served to excite the anger of the Governor of Lahsa, and induced him to adopt the harsh and overbearing course of or- ' dering Eama and Cheyla to be sent to Lahsa. I think then that Jasim bin Mahomed is the insti gator of the outrage. ' But whatever the springs of action, the Governor of Lahsa certainly issued the orders and is responsible for the act. It appears also that the Governor did not act solely on the reports he re ceived from Jasim, but had deputed a special officer to inquire on the spot. ' I am convinced that it has been Mazeed's deliberate purpose, for one thing, in taking so un precedented a course, to show in the eyes of theArabs a marked contempt for British power with a wish to exalt Turkish prestige at the expense of that of England in those regions. This is almost self-evident, as even had the Banyans been guilty of serious offences intimation would have been due to British authority before ordering them into the interior of Nejd, «&lt; * * * ^ n y 0Iie knowing the disposition and habits of the class of Hindoo traders will understand the extreme harshness, not to say cruelty, of forcing such persons to perform a journey through an Arab district like that of Nejd. ' The matter has excited no little astonishment, and the upshot will be watched with lively atten tion by the people of the Gulf. Whatever redress Government considers proper to enforce, I would respectfully submit that the occasion requires that it should be speedy, and as openly made known as the affront has been public.' Lieutenant Praser, the Assistant Eesident, who was sent to El Bidaa to investigate the affair, reported that at this time Mahomed bin Thanee had no power whatsoever, the local authority being entirely in the hands of Jasim bin Thanee his son, who was styled Kaimakam; that this title had been conferred on him by the Turks ; that he flew the Turkish flag, and acknowledged no other supremacy, and that the place was gar risoned by 45 irregular soldiers. In forwarding the papers on the subject to the Secretary of State, the Government of India observed—* ' The Turkish Government has, for some years past, been occupied in establishing its influence and power at El Bidaa, and that place may now be con sidered as incorporated with the Turkish dominions. The authority of the Chief, Mahomed bin Thanee, has been transferred to his son Jasim, who is favourably inclined to Turkish rule, hoists the Turkish flag, and pays revenue to the Pasha at Lahsa. El Bidaa, which is a small port on the east of the Guttur promontory, does not belong to any tribe having treaty relations with the British Government. So long, therefore, as the Chief commits no outrages by sea, and avoids inter ference with our allies, we have no valid ground to object to what extent he submits to Turkish authority, nor, in our opinion, have we any interest in objecting. Our policy is to keep clear of any complications that may arise upon the mainland. ' But whether El Bidaa is a Turkish possession or not, the orders issued by the authorities at Lahsa and the action taken thereon were, we con sider, a gross outrage upon two Indian British subjects, if the accuracy of the Assistant Resident's report is to be relied on. -Although there is no ground for supposing that they were subjected to personal ill treatment, the compulsory removal of two innocent men from their homes under the ;;; ; v * Political, No. 28, dated 4th Feb. 1876. -I37 t1Strs C hne r s e s POrted ' ai1 act of We would therefore suo^esf fhnf KoS b tr Her 01 ioreiga Affairs m order that the Turkish Government may be called oa for explanation and c o give some suitable compensation to the two men, Cheyla and Rama.'

To this day, however, neither the one nor the other has been received, the Turkish Government having, so far as appears, taken no notice whatever of the communication made to them. The fact is not without significance in connection with the proposal to trust to diplomacy for the settlement of such questions on the Arab coast of the Gulf. During the summer of 1876 there was a marked increase of piratical acts along the Guttur coast. liist. In the month of June or July the owners of an Aboothabee boat, who had sold some pearls at Guttur, took the money on board, and anchored in the harbour of El Bidaa. At night they were attacked by seven of the Beni Hajir tribe, who killed the Nakhoda, wounded two of the crew, plundered the boat, and then proceeded off in a Persian boat to Nabund, on the Persian coast. Second. About the same time, a large body of the Beni Hajir and other tribes in the neighbourhood of Bahrein attacked the Muttayer tribe near Koweit, . and suffered a severe repulse. Third. In the month of August a rumour reached the Officiating Eesident, to the effect that another party of the Beni Hajir had seized a boat belonging to the Oman pearl divers at Odeid. Fourth. In the same month the Chief of Aboothabee complained that two of his boats, which had anchored in the Bay of Odeid, had been attacked from the shore, one man being wounded, and one killed. Pifth. Again in August a section of the Beni Hajir, residing at Odeid, under the rule of Sheikh Salim bin Shafee, embarked from that port, and made an attack upon a boat belonging to Gutfcur, from which property to the value of ^400 was plundered. • The first of these outrages having been committed in waters of which the territorial possession was claimed by Turkey, and the Turkish Government having, on a previous occasion, been held responsible for the Chief of El Bidaa (with the absence of result shown above), the Government of Indiaf supported a recommendation of Jjieutenant-Colonel Prideaux that the Porte should be pressed to compel the Chief to give compensation to the sufferers from an outrage committed within his jurisdiction. On the general question Colonel Prideaux ex pressed his views at length in a letter, dated the 3000. c16th September 1876,* of which the material paragraphs were as follows :— The acts of piracy which have lately been com mitted on the Guttur coast by the Beni Hajir tribe, and which have been reported, for the information of His Excellency the Governor General in Council, render it very necessary, in my opinion, to consider the steps which should be taken to check pro ceedings which may not only seriously affect British interests, but may possibly arouse the old lawless spirit which, under overwhelming pressure, has long lain dormant among the Arabs of the Gulf, but which it would take but little encouragement to resuscitate. ' These proceedings have up to the present been confined to a small stretch of land and its neigh bouring waters, and the reason that they have been committed is that British influence is no longer paramount in that quarter, as it formerly was. Until our influence is regained, I fear there is but little chance of securing permanent tranquillity upon the Guttur coast. At the small port of El Bidaa, which properly belongs to a well disposed Sheikh, whose lawful authority has been usurped by his son, there is stationed a detachment of 30 Arab Zaptiehs or gendarmes, commanded by a Turkish Officer. Although at first sight this small force might seem to be a guarantee for the maintenance of order, it is not too much to say that if it were withdrawn, the recent piracies and murders which I have reported would not have been possible. * Enclosure No. 10, as above. * ' In a matter where our interests are so largely involved, and considering the relative positions of the British and the Turkish Governments, it would perhaps be scarcely prudent to ask the Porte 4 for e what portion of the coast they undertake to be 4 responsible; ' but I would, with much deference, su §)£&gt; es ^ that the policy which was so successfully followed in Yemen might, with advantage, be adopted in the Gulf, and that the British Govern ment should, in some formal way, recognize pre- tensions of Turkey to territorial sovereignty upon the Arab coast up to a certain point, and no farther. ' Fortunately the limits within which Turkish pretensions might be confined are capable of beino- defined with much greater geographical precision than was possible in Yemen. The Turkish ports on the Arab side of the Gulf are Koweit, Kateef and Ojair. The last is the port of !Lahsa, and is necessary to the Turks to enable them to maintain their communications with Nejd. On the other side of a deep bay extends a large promontory which is chiefly composed of stony, sandy desert and is only inhabited by.a few bands of rovins Bedouins The seaward side of this promontory fs known as the Guttur coast, and on it are situated J j j* Letter dated 8th January 1877, No. 10.

The these Government views: there of India did not concur were in their opinion m HP m meir opinion many objections to the course proposed, while, on the other hand, the state of affairs on the Arab coast did not appear to be sufficiently grave to necessitate the adoption of so important a measure as formal recognition of Turkish pretensions up to a certain point of the coast. In sending on the papers to the Foreign Office,* it was stated that the Secretary of State concurred with the Government of India on the latter point, as well as in regard to the action which should be taken in the El Bidaa case. In the third and fourth cases specified above the outrages were perpetrated by a section of the Beni Yas tribe, which some years ago revolted from the rule of its legitimate Chief, the Sheikh of Aboo- thabee. In regard to these dissidents Colonel Prideaux wrote (16th September 1876): —f ' The Chief of Aboothabee, though naturally incensed at the defection of his tribesmen, has throughout behaved with praiseworthy moderation and forbearance ; and although by frequent appeals to this Residency he continues to assert his claims upon Odeid, he has never attempted to enforce them by any act which might be deemed incon sistent with his treaty obligations. ' I do not doubt that if the question at issue were simply between the Chief of Aboothabee and his refractory tribesmen, it might be satisfactorily arranged without any great difficulty j but it is to some degree complicated by the fact that the Chief of Odeid is in possession of a Turkish flag which he occasionally hoists, and under the protection of which it is believed that he would voluntarily place himself if any attempt were made to coerce him. / I At5c • 40 . ' It has, however, now become apparent that the lawless and turbulent tribe of the Beni Hajir have taken advantage of the unsettled state of affairs on the Guttur coast to indulge in their natural pro pensity for plunder and robbery; that they no longer confine themselves to El Bidaa as a point d'appui for their operations; that they have located themselves at Odeid in order to extend them ; and that, unless speedily checked, they will commit themselves to acts which will revive the memory of those old days when the Joasmees and the Beni Yas were the terror of the Gulf.' On the 2nd February 1877,t the Government of * Political, No. 18. India reported a further, but unsuccessful, attempt at piracy committed by the people of Odeid on an Aboothabee boat returning from the pearl fisheries ; and in a subsequent letterf they reported their f Political Letter, No. conclusions and recommendations in the matter. 78 » dated loth May 1877. Their conclusions were,— (1) that the acts of piracy complained of were committed by members of the Al-Morra tribe, a tribe nominally dependent on the Turkish Government; (2) that the pirates proceeded on their expedition from ports belonging to the Chief of Odeid ; (3) that the Chief of Odeid in no way countenanced or assisted 'the pirates, but was too weak to prevent members of the Al-Morra tribe from making use of his ports as starting places for piratical expeditions ; (4) that the reason why the Chief of Odeid was weak was that he and his followers were a small colony of discontents Who have seceded from the main body of the great Beni Yas tribe of Aboothabee; (5) that the reason why the Chief of the Beni Yas tribe had not brought his refractory colonists into order was that he had been prevented from so doing by the British Govern ment. The recommendations of the Government of India were that endeavour should be made to induce the Turkish Government to take measures to restrain the piratical proceedings of the Al-Morra tribe; and that measures should be taken by themselves to prevent the ports of Odeid being used as a rendezvous for pirates. In regard to the latter point, it appeared to them to be clearly to the interests of the British Govern ment, as guardian of the peace and protector against outrage in the Persian Gulf, that each of the trucial tribes of the littoral should be strong and undivided, while it seemed but equitable that the Government which prohibited the Chief of Aboothabee from bringing his refractory tribesmen into order should secure him their submission and allegiance, either by peaceful or, if need be, by coercive measures. They had therefore in a letter, dated 7th May 1877, to the Resident of the Persian Gulf, empowered that officer to use his best endeavours to promote a reunion between the colonists at Odeid and the main body of the Beni Yas tribe, and had further authorized him to afford assistance, if necessary the Crucial Chief of Aboothabee in coercing the seceders.41 # Dated 25th June 1877, No. 436. f From Foreign Office, dated 28th July 1877, No. 548. | From Foreign Office, dated 28th Aug. 1877, No. 624. § To Foreign Office, 27th Sept. 1877, No. 624. || No. 62, dated 4th Oct. 1877.

But seeing that the British Govern- ment had received no official intimation on the thnftL^r f VAf'i WaS U0 tan g ible evidence that the Chief of Odeid was under the effective suzerainty of the Turkish Government, they appre- henaed that the mere hoisting of the Turkish flao- need in no way restrict the freedom of their action in the matter. ,, On receipt of this Despatch, a letter was sent to the foreign Office,* intimating.. Lord Salisbury's concurrence in the views expressed in it, and re questing that Her Majesty's Ambassador at Con stantinople might be instructed to call the serious attention of the Turkish Government to the in crease of piracy along the Guttur coast which had resulted from the extension of its authority in that quarter, and to intimate that Her Majesty's Go vernment would not permit the peace of the Persian Gulf to be disturbed by expeditions which either proceeded from ports, like El Bidaa,in actual Turkish possession, or were organized by tribes recognizing Turkish supremacy, and were despatched from the territories of independent Chiefs, too weak to pre vent the abuse of their ports. Lord Derby was informed that Lord Salisbury proposed to approve the instructions which had been issued to the Resi dent in the Gulf in regard to Odeid, but that his Lordship was of opinion that no reference should be made to that matter in any communication which Sir H. Layard might address to the Turkish Government on the general question, it being both doubtful whether that Government exercised any substantial authority over the Chief of Odeid, and inexpedient to provoke discussion on the point. A note in the above sense was addressed by Sir H. Layard to the Porte, under date the 9th July 1877,f to which a reply was received on the 2nd August from Server Pasha,! to the effect that the Governor General of the vilayet of Bussorah declared that nothing of the kind alleged had taken place, and that the most complete tranquillity pre vailed, but that the Porte would be gtad to be furnished with more precise particulars. These were at once furnished§ to the Foreign Office for communication to the Turkish Govern ment by Sir H. Layard. Simnltaneously, the correspondence was sent out to the Government of India,|| with an intimation that Her Majesty's Government approved the instructions^ which had been issued to the Resident in the Gulf, in May, with a vi®^ ^ prevent the port of Odeid being used as a shelter for pirates. Nothing more was heard in the matter until June 1878, when a letter' was received from the 'FWeiffn Office, aivinsr cover to a despatch from Sir H Layard, and a telegram from the Wali of 3000. DBussorah to the Porte, which had been placed in the Ambassador's hands. The telegram reported that the Sheikh of Aboothabee, with seventy l^oats, escorted by a British vessel of war and the English ' Consul ' at Bushire, had disembarked at Odeid, described as a ' dependence of the district of ' Castar,' and, after plundering the place, had carried off the boats of the inhabitants and destroyed the village. Sir H. Layard suggested that ' some ' explanation should be given to the Porte with ' reference to this descent upon Turkish territory, ' if really it occurred.' In reply,* the Poreign Office was referred to the previous correspondence on the subject, and in formed that the Grovernment of India would be called upon for particulars of what had happened. Those particulars have only lately been supplied, in Government of India Letter, No. 127, of the 22nd May last, and may most conveniently be explained in the words of that letter. It appears that, in pursuance of the instructions issued in May 1877, an attempt was made to reconcile the Aboothabee and Odeid sections of the Beni Yas, but without success, the Odeid Chief replying that at present he was connected with the Ottoman Government, from which he should never deviate. In consequence, and as the Chief also disregarded applications made to him in reference to an act of piracy committed by his people in April 1877, it was at length decided to assist the Sheikh of Aboothabee in coercing, his kinsmen. Coloriel Boss directed the British Agent at Shargah and Sheikh Zaeed of Aboothabee to meet him on the 28th March 1878 at the island of Kafai, with a sufficient force of his tribe to prevent the possibility of armed resistance being offered by the recusants at Odeid. No operations were to be undertaken until Colonel Boss's arrival. That Officer left Bushire in the 'Teazer' on the 25tli March, but, owing to bad weather and other unlooked-for caUoe&amp;, did not reach Odeid until the 30th, two days later than the date appointed. He found Sheikh Zaeed-bin-Khaleefah with his boats and followers, accompanied by the Native As-ent already at Odeid. 8 ' The bheikh of Odeid with his followers had, four days previously, quitted Odeid with their boats carrying off all their property and partially dis mantling their huts. The Aboothabee Chief had arrived at Kafai island on the 26th March, and anchored there for a day, after which he came on to Odeid, which he found quite deserted. The Chief of Aboothabee refused to permit the colonv to remain at Odeid even on condition of their acknowledging his authority. He did not trust their promises, and, though he was willing to make liberal terms with the seceders if they would return to Aboothabee, he insisted that Odeid should remain, as in former days, uninhabited. Colonel Boss supported him, but stipulated for generous treatment of those who might agree to return toJ -i * No. 6 (Political), dated 17th Jan. 1879. » w ff 22nd May „ » 77 „ „ 23rd June ,, 43 ratcriblTa wriir' 7 ' ^ Cllief of A toothabee bUDscribea a written agreement aeknowledsino- hk the P Beui Ya 7 f' 1 bell ^ Tiour ^ Ws tribelmeu of t I\ rom Khor Crheueyza to Odeid. -rislitlv ^rfJ 366 ^!.

It is necessary now to notice the succession of more recent piratical acts in the Gulf, which com menced in the summer of 1878, and has brought the question of the Turkish position in those parts to a head. The circumstances connected with them are concisely stated in the letters from India marginally noted,* and the particulars which follow are in substance extracted from those letters. On the 31st July 1878, the Resident in the Gulf repeated to the Government of India a report from Bahrein that a body of the Beni Hajir tribe of Bedouins had seized a boat belon^inff to the Turkish fort of Kateef. On the 20th September, Colonel Ross telegraphed that the Beni Hajir had seized and plundered some Persian vessels off Sheikh Shaab, an island on the Persian coast of the Gulf, and wounded two men. The same gang had also plundered another vessel, nationality unknown, carrying off a large sum in cash and murdering the master. The pirates having then landed on the Guttur coast, Colonel Ross sug gested that the Ottoman Government should be addressed regarding their proceedings. He also drew attention to the Chief of Zobara, who was said to be implicated, and inquired whether there was any objection to his dealing direct with that place and using coercive measures if necessary. Turkish rale had never been asserted there, while the claim of Bahrein to exercise authority h?d been disallowed by the Government of India; On the 24th September the .Resident telegraphed again reporting the result of inquiries made by Her Majesty's ship 'Vulture.' It appeared that re sponsibility for the outrages complained of rested partly with the Turkish districts of Kateef and El Bidaa, but in a greater degree with Zobara, whence two vessels had been despatched under the Chief's son to attack a passing boat belonging to Guttur. The Chief of Bahrein had also incurred blame by receiving the Chief of Zobara and his son as guests, and by other acts. Speedy and severe punishment of Zobara seemed to Colonel Ross the first measure requisite; the Turks would not, he thought, be able to co-operate, being fully occupied in dealing with the Wahabees. The following instructions were sent by the Go-44 L 11 vernment of India to Colonel Ross* (5tli October 1878) : —' While the Government of India will not ' permit the maritime peace of the Persian Gulf to ' be disturbed by expeditions, even though they ' proceed from ports actually in Turkish possession, ' they consider that, before any steps are taken to ^ bring Zobara to account, the Turkish local autho- ' rities should be communicated with. You are, &lt;t therefore, directed to place in the hands of the Turkish Governor the report of the officer com- &lt;£ manding Her Majesty's ship 4 Vulture,' as well as any other evidence showing that Zobara is guilty. ' You should demand that Zobara be promptly &lt;c punished, and should olfer any naval assistance &lt;c that it may be in your power to give. If the Turkish authorities decline to take any steps, you ' are to report the fact to the Government of India, ' with a detailed description of the measures you would propose to take. Should any further out- ' rages take place by sea, you are authorized to 44 punish the oifenders at once, whatever may be &lt;£ their nationality.' On the 22nd October Colonel Eoss proceeded to Bussorah in company with Her Majesty's ship ' Vulture,' under the command of Captain Pringle, who on the previous day had captured fifteen piratical dhows off Kateef as well as three other dhows and four boats from the Beni Hajir, south of Kateef, two being Bahrein vessels which had been piratically seized. He thus reported (4th November 1878) the result of his interview with Abdullah Pasha, the Governor of Bussorah :— ' On the 26th His Excellency returned my visit at the British Consulate, and informed me he had gone through the evidence referred to above, and that he was writing orders for immediate investiga tion to be made on his own part by his officers recently despatched with forces to Nejd, and that on receipt of their reports he would take steps to punish Zobara. On my inquiring if he was not satisfied with the proofs I had laid before him. His Excellency replied that the reports seemed to be true, but he must subject them to the test of inde pendent inquiry as regards the nature and extent of punishment to be inflicted Jn the case of Zobara, as there appeared to have been several persons eu^led to Turkish protection murdered. His Excellency would have to refer for orders before deciding that point. I took occasion to suggest that, should His Excellency find it necessary to employ force, it would be well to employ regular troops rather than Arab Bedouins, and that in that case the Government of India would be happy to send a British man-of-war to co-operate ; but I re marked that I did not think the Chief or people of Zobara would attempt to resist any demands His Excellency should decide to make. The Governor said he would, if force was necessary, send regular troops and Turkish ships of war, and evidently had no wish for British co-operation.'* ♦ Political, No. 6, dated 17th Jan. 1879, Enclosure No. 12.46 On® a fresh complication arose sS- w ^SfV 0 ^' n«' 55a snip ieazer. The Government of India approved this visit, mstructed Colonel Ross to keep the Chief of Bahrein to his treaty obligations, authorized him to preserve the maritime peace of the Gulf, and enjoined him to abstain from interference with land operations Further information as to the present position of Zobara towards the Turkish Government was also called for. O a - C ° lonel Ross's arrival at Bahrein, the Chief, fcheiKh Esa came on board the ' Teazer,' and pressed • tor some action in favour of Zobara; he also asked permission to accompany Colonel lloss in his visit to lat place. He urged that if Zobara were occupied by his enemies (the Sheikh of El Bidaa and Nasir bin Mo bank), Bahrein would incur constant danger, and be exposed to sudden attacks. Further, that nis failure to aid the Nairn people would turn them li r ^ iese Proposals were declined, and the Chief was interdicted, much to his dissatisfac tion, from intervention in Zobara affairs. Before leaving Bushire, Colonel Boss communi cated with Colonel Nixon at Bagdad and Mr. Bobertson at Bussorah, in order that the Wali of Bussorah on receiving information of what had occurred might be able to adopt prompt and effec tual action. Consequently, under instructions issued to the Turkish authorities at Kateef, the gun boat ' Iskanderia' was despatched to Zobara to warn the Sheikh of El Bidaa against aggression on Bahrein. The troops on board the ' Iskanderia ' r were not landed, as by the time the gun-boat arrived confidence had been restored. On the 22nd November Colonel Boss reported the results of his visit to Zobara, which had been entirely destroyed, with the exception of an out lying fort called Moreyr, in which the Naim inhabitants were closely besieged. The attack was said to be in retaliation for piracies and raids upon El Bidaa, and had not been ordered by the Turkish Governor of Bussorah. The Bahrein people were alarmed, but Colonel Ross notified that any attempt on the island would be forcibly repelled by the British ships, and precautionary measures to this end were taken. In his detailed report to the Government of India, (26th November 1878), Colonel Boss ob served :— ' It appears to me that the establishment of a regular Turkish post at Zobara or its vicinity by the Turkish Government would now be the best means of finally terminating the panics to which Bahrein has for years been periodically subject, caused by the proceedings of irresponsible Arab leaders such as Nasir bin Mobarik. The Sheikh of 3000. EBahrein, intimated to me that in such a measure lies the only safety under present circumstances for his own interests.' The Government of India ordered Colonel Ross to desist from further action, either as regards the piracies in which the Chief of Zobara was impli cated, or as regards the attack on that place by the Sheikh of Bidaa and Nasir bin Mobarik. As to the former, they concurred with Colonel Ross s opinion that the Chief had been sufliciently punished by the retribution which had fallen upon him, and, as to the latter, the expedition from Bidaa proceeded by land, so that the Government of India was not con cerned with it except so far as there was danger of the Chief of Bahrein being entangled in the dis pute—a contingency for which effectual provision was made on the spot. They, however, directed Colonel Ross to examine the position of Zobara in making his general report upon the extent and nature of the territorial jurisdiction of Turkey on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. • In a letter, No. 260, dated 27th November 1878, Colonel Ross enclosed correspondence with Mr. Melvill, Acting Commissioner in Sind. It appeared that two boats—the 4t Harsingar' and the ' Fut- tehkar'—belonging to British subjects were at tacked by pirates about two miles from Kateef, in September. The 'Harsingar' was plundered of property to the value of Rs. 200; the *' Futtehkar ' lost nothing, but was fired into. Mr. Melviil pressed for redress, as the sufferers were British subjects. In reply, Colonel Ross informed him that the offenders were Bedouin Arabs residing in Turkish territory, that the offence appeared to have l)een committed within Turkish territorial waters, and that the matter had been brought to the notice of the Turkish authorities through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. At the latter end of December 1878*, Mansoor bin Minakhir, a Sheikh of the Ejman tribe, joined with Zaid bin Muhammad, a Turkish subject, of the Beni Hajir, a ringleader in the piracies already reported, and having forcibly seized a boat be longing to a subject of Bahrein, put out to sea. They attacked two boats in the neighbourhood of Kateef, and carried off from one of them property valued at Rs. 20,000. Ten boats conveying Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Kateef were in sight, but on being appealed to, declined to interfere. Colonel Boss brought to notice the impunity enjoyed by Zaid bin Muhammad and other pirates residing at Zahran, within recognized Turkish jurisdiction, in the vicinity of Kateef, through the apathy and in difference of the Turkish authorities, and expressed an opinion that the seizure of Zaid bin Muhammad or his expulsion from Zahran was a measure of primary necessity. The Government of India thereupon desired the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to urge the Turkish authorities either to operate promptly against Zaid bin Muhammad or to accept the alternative of British action. Instead * Political, No. 55, dated 22nd May 1879.47 of carrying out these directions, Colonel Nixon asked the Wali of Bussorah whether a British ship of war should be sent to check disorder, and referred the same question to the British Ambassador at Constantinople. The Wali replied that a Turkish corvette had been ordered to cruise in the disturbed parts, and that the Mutasarif of Kateef had received stringent instructions to suppress further piracies. Ultimately the Turkish Minister of Marine directed the &lt;£ Broussa' or ' Iskandaria ' or both, if necessary, to proceed to the Nejd coast, and declared that the Bussorah authorities would be held responsible for the restoration and maintenance of order. On the 22nd January Colonel Ross reported that a Turkish force had marched by land against El Hussein, a village five miles from Zahran, and had destroyed it, but the ringleader and other persons concerned in recent piracies were not captured. The measures taken were altogether inadequate, and piratical boats continued to molest trading vessels ; moreover, both the Turkish ships of war broke down. On the 14ith Eebruary, the Resident of the Persian Gulf telegraphed that Zaid bin Muhammad's success bad led to further piracies off Kateef. A fresh gang of the Beni Hajir had started under another leader and captured two Bahrein vessels laden with dates; afterwards they joined Zaid's band, near EL Hussein, and departed with their booty into the interior. Subsequently they put to sea again in search of further prizes, and closed communication between Bahrein and Kateef. The Chief of Bahrein expressed alarm for his islands, and asked either that he might be permitted to take the necessary measures for the recovery of his boats, or that Her Majesty s ship 'Spartan' should act. In Colonel Ross's judgment the piracies were likely to attain formi dable dimensions, and to prejudice British prestige and interests; he, therefore, suggested that the Turkish Government should arrange with the Ejman tribe to coerce the Beni Hajir, who might be cut off from the sea, and that all the landing places should be occupied and the coast patrolled, a vessel of war being stationed at Bahrein for the ^ The Government of India directed Colonel Ross to order Her Majesty's ship -Spartan'' to cruise in the neighbourhood of Kateet and to protect Bahrein as required by treaty. He was authorized to suppress piracy by sea and to punish maritime offenders, whatever their nationality, but operations on the mainland were prohibited. He was also empowered to place a British Officer temporarily at Bahrein, and Captain Durand, the Eirst Assistant to the Resident, proceeded thither. On the 15th Eebruary, Colonel Ross telegraphe that on the 11th Eebruary thirty Beni Hajir, from Zahran, had committed a raid on Azaria, ten miles from Manamah, on the larger island of Bahrein, and killed one man. The Chief of Bahrein desired pei- mission to seize the boats in the possession of thepirates at Zahran, and begged either for complete protection or permission to attack his enemies on sea. Colonel Ross considered the Chief's fears to be well founded, and recommended that our ships of war should be employed against the pirates. He was desired to report his plans after consultation with the naval officers on the spot. Colonel Ross recommended the thorough ex amination of the part of the coast infested by- robber gangs, and the recovery of Bahrein vessels in their possession. The pirates were to be prevented, as far as possible, from getting boats, and he asked that a British vessel of war should be stationed temporarily at or near Bahrein. The Government of India sanctioned these proposals on the under standing that Colonel Ross's plans had been laid in consultation with the naval officers, and that no expedition would be undertaken on the mainland beyond reach of the guns of the British vessels. The two vessels stolen from Bahrein were ulti mately recovered by Her Majesty's ship ' Vulture,' and early in April the Resident reported that matters had quieted down, and that Captain Durand and his escort might leave Bahrein. The iDstructions above mentioned, which, read in connection with others previously issued, authorized naval action against pirates, whether within or be yond Turkish territorial waters, were communicated by Colonel Ross, on the 8th March last, to Com mander Wodehouse, of Her Majesty's ship 'Teazer.' The sequel is curious. Captain Wodehouse (19th March)* requested the Admiral Commanding on the East India Station to give him ' instructions as ' to his wishes on the subject.' Admiral Corbett (2nd April) applied to the Admiralty 'for their ' Lordships' instructions.' Their Lordships (2nd May) asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to cause them to be informed whether it was 'the desire of Her Majesty's Government that 14 the course desired by the Indian Government ' should be adopted.' The Foreign Office (16th May)t intimated to this Office that, in the absence of further^ explanations, Lord Salisbury felt some difficulty in expressing his concurrence in the measures proposed. His Lordship apprehended that, in the absence of treaty stipulations, Her Majesty's ships could only deal with piracy 'jure gentium' i. e., piracy committed on the high seas beyond the territorial waters of Turkey, and that any expeditions by them on the mainland, although within reach of the guns of Her Majesty's ships, might be the subject of just remonstrance on the part of the Turkish Government. Finally, the Ad miralty^ acting, it would appear, on the views of the Foreign Office, instructed the Commander- in-Chief on the East India Station that, until further instructions were received, 'no hostile ' action should be taken within Turkish territory &lt;c or its waters, without the consent or the co- ' operation of the Turkish authorities.' As matters stand, therefore, there being, as will * Letter from Admiralty, 2nd May 1879, No. 331. f No. 370.

Under these circumstances, it is not surprising that Colonel Miles, the Officiating Political Agent at Bagdad, should have had to report to Sir EL La yard, on the 18th July,^' that Zani bin Mahomed, with a band of Beni Hajir, had plundered a Bahrein pearl boat on the Guttur coast, killing one person and wounding three, and that further depre dations might be expected. The measures taken by the Turkish authorities during the period above referred to appear to have been limited to (1) the destruction in January of the village of El Hussein, five miles from Zahranjf (2) the capture of Ali bin Jabir,J the leader of the attack on Bahrein territory in February, whose extradition as one of his subjects is claimed by the Sheikh of Bahrein, and, (3) the despatch of some detachments of soldiers in native boats to Zahran. A certain number of diplomatic communications have during the last year been made to the Porte on the subject. On the 17th October 1878, § with reference to a seizure of boats near Kateef, Sir H. Layard re quested that instructions might be sent to the Turkish authorities, upon whom the responsibility of maintaining order in the disturbed parts rested. On further representations from Sir H. Layard, consequent on telegrams from the Political Agent at Baghdad, the Turkish Government promised (23rd January 1879) || to reinforce their squadron in the Gulf, and stated that the ' Maritime Prefect' at Bussorah was about to be replaced by an officer of superior grade, who spoke English, and had a good reputation. On the 26th February, the Ambassador was in- formed^ that the Department of Marine had been ordered to send immediately to the Gulf a vessel of war to keep the peace of the seas, and give chase to pirates. On the 20th May, Sir H. Layard (despatch No. 414) reported** that he had brought the sub ject to the serious notice of the Porte, and, whilst thanking it for the capture of five of the indivi duals concerned in the foray on Bahrein territory, had warned the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs that Her Majesty's Government could not permit a state of things which is a danger to British interests and British commerce, and would be compelled to interpose to put an end to it unless the Turkish Government took measures to do so. The Minister promised to call the attention of the authorities to the matter, and expressed his regret the Turkish Admiralty could not, as had F that 3000.* From Foreign Office, f From Foreign Office, 4th Aug. 1879, No. 586. originally been intended, send more vessels to the Gulf than the single one which had been despatched some time before, on account of the expense. Subsequently, on the 29th June (despatch No. 563),* Sir H. Layard reported that he was in- _ formed that the Minister of Marine had telegraphed llth ^ ul y ^ to I d quire what measures had been taken by the local authorities at Bussorah in the matter, and also to ascertain whether the state of affairs was owing to negligence or to want of means to sup press it. The Ambassador learned further that it had been decided to send to the Gulf two corvettes then in course of repair. Lastly, on the 16th July,t Sir H. Layard, in communicating to the Porte the telegram from Colonel Miles, to which reference has already been made, once more called the serious attention of the Turkish Government ' to the existence of piracy' in the Persian Gulf, and to the neglect ' or incapacity of the Turkish authorities to put ' an end to it.' Sir H. Layard added : ' It must *' be evident to the Sublime Porte that Her Ma- ' jesty's Government cannot permit the continu- ' ance of a state of things so detrimental to the u interests and commerce of Great Britain.' We can now turn to the consideration of the views of the Government of India, as set forth in their Letter, No. 127 (Secret), of the 22nd May last, in reference to (1) the status of Odeid; (2) Turkish jurisdiction along the A rab coast of the Gulf, and the extent to which the Porte should be held responsible for order along the coast over which its jurisdiction is recognized; (3) a revision of our treaties with Bahrein, the trucial Chiefs, and Muscat; and (4) the arrangement of Persian Gulf business between the Bushire Residency and the Baghdad Political Agency. It will be convenient to notice the proposals of the Government of India on each branch of the subject in turn. Pirst. The Status of Odeid .—The natural course of events there has already been told.J On the abstract question of right, the followino- remaiks ot Colonel Boss, in a letter to the Govern ment of India, dated the 20th January last,6 are important:— ' Treating this subject with reference to recent Turkish pretensions, the points presenting them selves for inquiry are :— ' Firstly. Whether Turkish authority has ever been actually exercised or established at Odeid. ' Secondly. Whether by conquest of El Hassa or by occupation of El Katr a just claim has been established. Thirdly. Whether the wish of the inhabitants can be deemed to establish a claim. 41 * cor t nection W1 th the first point, I will quote the following extract from a despatch, No. 122 P. X See ante, p. 42. § Enclosure No. 15 in India No. 127 of 1879.51 Odeid. eStablisl1 their ^mzcy at ,Jl^ 0 SU ?J? oy ert Mtion hitherto beea taken, ? no aut hority or jurisdiction has, as far as is Known, been ever established or exercised. 'As to the second point, apart from other con- flictmg claims and rights, it cannot be maintained that Odeid would, from its position, necessarily be ln T the P olitical fortunes of El Hassa or , l^atr. In the year 1871 an inquiry was made by Colonel Pelly, the result of which has a pertinent Dealing on this point. From the terms of the letters he then addressed to the Chiefs of Ab- oothabee and Odeid, copies of which I append, it will be seen that he ascertained from the person best qualified to judge that c Odeid forms no portion of Guttur territory.' t{ The third point suggested for consideration is as to the bearing on the question of jurisdiction of the action of the Odeid people themselves. The desire of the Sheikh of Odeid has all along been to be treated as an independent Chief, and admitted as such into the circle of trucial Chiefs under British protection. This privilege could not, however, be conceded without setting aside the asserted right of the Aboothabee Chief over Odeid and its inha bitants. The latter being the hereditary tribesmen and subjects of Abootbabee, their complete inde pendence could not be recognized. Under the circumstances, and considering the geographical position of the place, it does not appear to me that the Turkish Government would have the right to accept the allegiance of aliens residing beyond their frontier, nor do I see how such a tender, assuming it made, could confer right of jurisdiction in this instance. ' In addition to the considerations of a negative description which I have touched on, the positive claims of the Chief of Aboothabee in regard to Odeid must be considered. Por more than a generation the Chiefs of Aboothabee have claimed and occasionally exercised authority over the place and its inhabitants, who, according to Arab ideas and custom, were the dependents of the said Chiefs. The rights of the latter seem to have always been recognized by the British Officers in the Gulf, and the same view has, after many years of occasional correspondence, been practically approved by Go vernment. It is probable that the Turkish preten sions lately put forward at the instance of the local Sheikhs are based on ignorance of facts. I ascer tained last year that the Governor of Bussorah had never even heard the name of Odeid. ' As a matter of right, it appears to me plain that the Turkish Government has no valid claim to Odeid. Viewed as a question of policy, apart from the rights of Aboothabee, I consider it would beprejudicial to British interests and influence in the Gulf to suffer Turkish rule to extend to Odeid. The place would probably once more become a resort of pirates, for whose purposes it is admirably adapted, and some of whom have, since the abandonment of the village, transferred their base of operations to the vicinity of Kateef. Eurther claims and pre tensions would ensue, extending probably to the adjacent islands, which might be regarded^ as pertaining to Odeid, and disorders would multiply in those intricate waters which we should be debarred from repressing, and which the Turkish local agents would regard with indifference.' The conclusion of the Government of India is, ' that Odeid belongs to the Chief of Aboothabee,with « whom the British Government has maintained ' direct treaty relations for many years, and that ' the pretensions of Turkey to claim the settlement ' as a dependency of a Turkish district are vague ' and without foundation. It may be true that ' Sheikh Batay of Odeid has occasionally hoisted &lt;c the Turkish flag, tliat he has claimed Turkish &lt;£ protection, and that he has latterly paid a small ' tribute to El Bidaa. But the existence of a ' separate and independent Chiefship at Odeid has ' never been recognized, and the act of Sheikh ' Batay in establishing a settlement there was an ' infraction of the prescriptive territorial rights of ' Aboothabee. The declaration of the Odeid Sheikh, and of his colony, that they put themselves under ' Turkish protection, would not in any way, of itself, ' justify the Turks in asserting their jurisdiction ' over the place. If such a plea were admitted, it ' would be set up by every petty Chief along the ' coast who might have good reasons for desiring to ' evade control or chastisement.' Upon this branch of the question no remarks are requisite in this place, as it is closely connected with the two points next for consideration. Second. Becognition of Turkish territorial jurisdiction along the coast, and responsibility of the Porte eor order .—On the 11th September 1878, Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople (despatch No. 1121) wrote as follows to Her Majesty's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs:—-* ' Her Majesty's Consul General at Baghdad (Colonel Nixon), in a despatch to me of the 12th ultimo, relating to recent disorders on the Arab coast on the Persian Gulf, and the seizure by some Bedouins of boats belonging to the people of Kateef, suggests that I should issue instructions as to whether it would not be advisable for the (British) (sic) authorities in the Persian Gulf to refer to him in regard to the disputes that may occur with the tribes in El Hassa, which province the Turks conquered some years ago, and which they now re gard as a portion of their dominions. Colonel Nixon writes that it seems desirable that the whole respon sibility of disorders in the interior of Arabia should be thrown on the Turkish authorities, and that any■ -v I • Enclosure No. 12 in India No. 127 of 1879. 53 JoStSl be,aS f f as teibes, ^Cf^throug^th^me!^^ ^ t0 ^ *&gt; that li is desirable that we should, as far as possible Arab dlrect in the quarrels of the rab tribes on the mainland, holding the Turkish Government ^ responsible for any acts that they may commit against the liyes or property of British subjects withm territories to which the right of the rorte has been admitted.' Lord Salisbury recommended Colonel Nixon's sideration 1 Lord Cranbrook ' s fayo arable con- The papers were transmitted to the Goyernment of India,^ and by them referred to the Resident in the f /Vifx ^ ter fr 1 0m Mr - L ^ a11 ' the foreign Secre- ary (17th December 1878),* which contained the lollowmg remarks « It is recommended that the lurkish Goyernment should be held responsible tor disorders which may break out on the Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf, and that, when disputes occur with the tribes in El Hassa, the British authorities in the Gulf should refer them to the ' Political Agent at Baghdad, and should ayoid ' direct interference. 'The Arabian coast of the Persian Gulf and El Hassa are by no means conyertible terms. The £&lt; former in its widest sense extends from the ' neighbourhood of Bussorah to Has el Had; the ' latter may be said to commence not far below 44 Koweit, and terminate at a point opposite the island of Deman. And, when it is remembered ' that the portion of this coast between Deman and ' Eas el Had comprises the territory of the Chiefs of ' Bahrein and of the trucial Chiefs, as well as that ' of the Sultan of Muscat, with all of whom the ' Goyernment of India has direct treaty relations, which are superyised by the Resident at Bushire, 44 the importance of ascertaining the exact scope of ' the measure which the Foreign Office supports ' will be calculable. For, if the intention be to refer disputes in which these Chiefs are con- ' cerned to the arbitration of a distant authority at £C Baghdad, the practical effect of such an arrange- ' ment upon British relations in this region become^ ' a matter for serious consideration. ' And, eyen if it be taken that the proposal is ' only meant to comprehend the more limited juris- ' diction described by Sir A. Layard, a precise ' definition is not the less necessary. For the ' question immediately arises, what are the terri- ' tories to which the right of the Porte has been ' admitted, and what is to be the position of those ' territories which the Porte claims, but to which &lt;e its right has not been acknowledged. Until the G 'rv 3000. -I M.-air rn—. i54 &lt;{ extent of the Porte's authority has been demar- ' cated, it will be impossible to say at what point &lt;c of the coast the responsibility of the Ottoman Government ends, and that of the Resident in ' the Persian Gulf begins. The first point, there- ' fore, on which your opinion is desired is, over ' what extent of territory the Turkish Government ' does actually exercise substantial jurisdiction ? 'The next question is, What action should be ' taken by the British Government if the maritime &lt;c peace of the Gulf is disturbed by expeditions pro- ' ceeding from acknowledged Turkish ports, and which the Turkish authorities are unable or un- ' willing to put down ? This is a contingency ' which must be provided for beforehand, because ' experience sliows that such expeditions are not ' infrequent. They are likely to become much ' more common if the certainty of speedy retribu- ' tion be in any degree weakened. et Another matter to which your attention may ' with advantage be turned is the effect which the ' recognition of Turkish rights and Turkish obliga- ' tions is likely to produce upon the other two ' parties interested in the Gulf, the British and the ' Persian Governments. One result of accepting the charge of the police of these waters has been to ' render the naval power of the British Govern- &lt;&lt; ment supreme in the Gulf. The transfer of a *' portion of this responsibility to another authority will certainly diminish to some extent British 4t local prestige. And if, in consequence of their &lt;f increased responsibilities, the Turkish Govern- ' ment increase their naval force in the Gulf, ' various complications may ensue. The Persian 4( for instance, would hardly view ,f with indifference the operations of Turkish ' cruisers, and the presence of a large Turkish fleet ' in the Gulf.' Colonel Nixon was at the same time asked for his views, but his reply (12th January 1879)* con- * tamed only three remarks worth quoting. These India were, (1) that ' of course, when the Turks took | possession of the province of El Hassa in 1871, the petty tribes on the coast also became subject to their power;' (2) that the Turkish authorities, „ though jealous of our interference, are unable to preserve order in their new conquests;' and, (3) that the conquest of El Hassa by the Turks has „ heen of some benefit to us, as it checked, if it did not destroy, the ascetic influence and propagandist «ssfs is? i « ^ 0SS ex P r ?f sed his views to the Govern- ment of India m a letter dated 20th January 1879 + t '(''Ih 0Ut f u ' founded cer tein inferences ab »™. in regard to the past action of the British authori ties in the Gulf which might be drawn from Colonel havp n S , re ° ommeudations . and explaining that we tribes o?ViR' 'W- 1 ? an y disputes^ith tie trilnl ■ I t' interference in their inter- tobal affairs has been avoided, and that ererv effort has been made to hold the Turkish authoS55 (( occurring io^Wcb &lt;C QUPsf' inrl inrt^ i.* • ^ II^iSSS,, its COll- •■ MSsnax sss%i*&gt;i**i ;; is more correctly written.

It is, &lt;( therefore, well to draw a distinction between « i !/ . SS ^ 1 ai l d ^ tT &gt; an(i n ot to include the &lt;£ Iattei ' 1 . n the f( &gt;rmer. On the Katr coast, with the tf ? Xce P tK) ? of E1 Bl daa and its immediate neigh- bourhood, no steps have hitherto been taken to establish Turkish authority. * The Turkish Government may, however, with ££ s p me reason argue that their present actual posi- ' t 10n . 011 coas t does involve, constructively, domination over the entire tract lying between ' Ojair and El Bidaa. Such a claim would, of ' course, be affected by the existence of any ' British rights or obligations on the coast referred • to. But it is not held that the British Grovern- ' £ ment has engagements, as concerns this particu- ' c lar tract, of a nature to constitute an obligation ' to oppose the full establishment of Turkish ' authority therein; nor has it seemed probable ' that opposition would be offered on other ' grounds. We have, in fact, rather prepared the &lt;c way for recognition of the eventual establishment &lt;c of Turkish rule by gradually withdrawing from &lt;c active supervision and control over this portion *' of the mainland coast. The territory has, accord- ' ingly, been for some years in what may be termed ' a transition state, the exercise of British coercion ' having been abandoned, and no other control of ' a similar nature substituted. This is obviously ' an unsatisfactory condition, and one that could ' nbt be long permitted without evil results. Some ' definite responsibility is very requisite.' After stating that the Chief of Bahrein having been advised to sever his old political connection with Zobarah, and abstain from all interference in the affairs of the main land generally, the latter place need not be treated exceptionally, Colonel Boss continued: ' The conclusions to which consideration of the ' subject leads me are :— &lt;f (1.) That failing the exercise of British inter- ' ference there is no obstacle in the way ' of completion of the chain of Turkish ' occupation of El Katr as far as El ' Bidaa.56 ' (2.) That the British Government is not bound ' by any existing engagements to oppose ' that proceeding. ' (3.) That assuming that the British Govern- ' ment see no sufficient ground for re- ' assuming the supervision and control ' over the portion of coast in question, 44 it would be best that the Turkish Go- ' vernment should undertake the respon- ' sibility and take effectual measures to ' maintain good order. ' But there is a point, of course, beyond which ' it would be impossible, consistently with the due ' maiDtenance of British rights, and performance ' of our duties, to permit the further extension of ' Turkish rule or influence. This line should, it ' appears to me, be drawn not far from El Bidaa, ' the furthest point on the coast to which the ' operations of that Government have extended. ' The adjacent township of El Wakra should, I ' consider, be regarded as accompanying El Bidaa, ' and so included in the zone of allowable Turkish ' influence. The southern boundary of these dis- ' tricts might be conveniently drawn at the 25th ' degree of north latitude. Passing along the ' coast line southwards, the next habitable spot is ' Odeid.' To this place, as has been already shown. Colonel Ross did not consider the Turkish Government had any valid claim. Recapitulating the actual present frontier of the Turks on the Arabian coast. Colonel Ross ob served :—' Prom Bussorah to Ojair the whole sea- ' board continuously is fully recognized as under ' Turkish authority and administration. At El ' Kateef and Ojair are Turkish garrisons and re- 44 sponsible Turkish officials. At El Bidaa, on the ' east coast of El Katr promontory, Turkish autho- ' rity is substantially, though less regularly, esta- ' blished. Between Ojair and El Bidaa no attempt ' has hitherto been made to establish or exercise ' Turkish jurisdiction.' With regard to the practical course to be adopted. Colonel Ross suggested that the Turkish Govern ment should be invited to state the exact extent of the Arabian coast for which they are prepared to accept responsibility, and make efficient arrange ments for the maintenance of order and prevention of maritime irregularities, the British Government at the same time stating beforehand plainly the nature and extent of British paramount influence on the same coast, and the line beyond which this will be maintained, the islands of Bahrein, of course, being so reserved as well as the entire 'trucial region,' within which he thought Odeid should fall. As to the action which should be taken on the part of the British Government in case of the maritime peace of the Gulf being broken by ex peditions proceeding from acknowledged Turkish ports, and which the Turkish authorities are unable or unwilling to put down, Colonel Ross remarked - &lt;c It can scarcely be doubted thaj it is in the powerr '' minerl 6 ^n'^ 11 G , ove ™ ment ' if earnestly deter- &lt;{ mined ' to prevent such proceedings; but, with 'no 0Ul P reseilt ex Perience, it seems highly {&lt; pessary to reserve the right to suppress by &lt;f f eaas 0 { our na val force such irregular opera^ u hi^h'sea ' erfc n f0r maraudiri » Purposes on the Turning to the question of the effect which re cognition of Turkish rights and obligations would have upon the British and Persian Governments, Loionel Ross continued 'There can be no doubt {c the appearance of the Turks in the Persian Gulf ]] and their acquisitions somewhat curtailed the sphere of British control, and limited our influence u correspondingly. But practically this was un- avoidable, and as we have already for some years ' abstained from the exercise of active control over that portion of the coast actually, or potentiallv, ' under Turkish rule or influence, the transfer of ' so much of our jurisdiction may be regarded as an accomplished fact. It having been apparent ' to all, from the outset, that the British Govern ment did not mean to oppose Turkish progress where our own interests were not materially con cerned, I do not think that full recognition of ' Turkish rights and obligations now would in- ' juriously affect British influence and prestige as ' regards our own reserved sphere. Again, were a ' clear understanding arrived at, as suggested, and 44 it being plain to the Turkish Government that no ' naval interference would be tolerated where we ' exercise authority and influence, there would be cc little inducement for the Turks to increase their ' naval force in the Gulf unduly, and the British ' naval force will remain as at present paramount. ' As regards Persia, its Government and coast ' authorities have become accustomed to the pre- ' sence of British ships of war, and recognize the ' advantage accruing therefrom. They would cer- ' tainly resent any attempt of the Turks to assume ' a similar footing, but I do not think the latter ' would see any inducement to do so.' On the whole matter his opinions and recom mendations were thus summarized :— f&lt; (1.) That the present political status and rela tions of El Katr, and the arrangements for the supervision and control of its tribes, are undefined and unsatisfactory. ' (2.) That the time is ripe for a more distinct understanding as to the extent and limit of Turkish jurisdiction and responsibility on the Katr coast. '(S.) That any formal recognition of Turkish jurisdiction in El Katr should be depen dent on the reciprocal recognition of the British position in the Gulf, as that may be intimated by the British Government. ' (4.) That until some such demarcation of juris dictions is made, and until it is arranged that the Turkish Government should take steps to effectively meet the re sponsibilities they assume, the issue of 3000. H • mk'instructions in the sense recommended by Colonel Nixon would be neither necessary nor expedient. ' (5.) That the right of repressing disorders by sea should, under all circumstances, be retained.' The views of the Government of India have now to be stated. On the general question they observe (para. 11):— So far as this question relates to disturbances in the interior of Arabia, or to mere tribal feuds, which do not concern British interests, there is no reason whatever why Turkey should not undertake the whole responsibility. But in regard to disorders on the coast as to piracy in Turkish waters, the case is less simple. The maritime peace of the Gulf is not unfrequently disturbed by expeditions proceeding from Turkish ports, which the Turkish authorities are unable, or too indifferent, to prevent. Such expeditions are not likely to become less frequent when the Turks are left alone to deal with • them unaided by British co-operation, and we have to determine whether we are prepared, under these contingencies, to abstain from all direct inter position, and to be content with the indirect and not very effective procedure of representations through Baghdad. ' But even if .it be assumed that the Turkish Government will prove itself able and willing to keep order on its sea coast, there is another ^im portant consideration which we cannot prudently overlook. Any policy which encourages the ex tension and predominance in the Persian Gulf of the Turkish power, musl tend proportionately to modify the distribution of power and influence throughout those waters, and must thus affect the general situation, relatively to both England and Persia. One result of accepting the charge of the police of these waters has been to render the naval power of the British Government supreme in the Gulf, and any change in this respect might be undesirable. But we could not require the Turkish Government to fulfil its increased responsibilities m the Gulf without also obliging it to increase ?T 0n f ^ ® Iiaval force ' and ^ ma y be remarked that the Persian Government, which at present maintains no ships of war in the Gulf, would hardly view with indifference the operations of Turkish cruisers, and the presence of a strong Tuikish fleet m these waters.' After stating that they are not prepared to as sume finally, and without further inquirv that thp down a dmiaister the Arabian coast (pMa. U) ^ Government of India continue ' Such being the actual situation of affairs at the present moment, we have now to submit in renlv to vour LnrrlaliWo /u * . 7-in reply our your Lordship's despatch,* marginally cited with tbp T 01 V | le n eXpedlency of aa understanding with the Turkish Government in regard to Offr. 0 jurisdiction and responsibility foTorder ^n The *4 * 20th Feb. 1879.59 Arabian shore of the Gulf. We entertain some douhts, nevertheless whether the formal discussion 01 these questions will not suggest more compliea- 10ns than it is likely to solve, and we are disposed to apprehend that the main object of the Turkish - Government will be found to be not so much the definition of its responsibility as the extension of its nominal rule. Piistj as to territorial jurisdiction along the coast, we would admit and recognize it wherever it now practically exists. The sea line of the El rlfissa district, as far south-east as Ojair, is appa rently under some kind of established Turkish authority, and this may be recognized by accepting, with reservations to be explained presently, an understanding that the Turks desire to be held responsible for maritime disorders on that coast. But we should be averse to enter into any discus sions which might appear to countenance claims by the Turkish Government to recognition of its authority beyond Ojair, or upon any part of the coast of the El Katr promontory, except at El Bidaa, where the Turks appear to have some real influence and representation. Beyond El Eidaa and Wakra the Turks are not known to have any sort of authority, and near this point begin the territories of the Arab Chiefs who are under treaty with the British Government for the rnaintenance of peace and for the restraint of piracy. We entirely agree with Colonel lloss that the intrusion of' Turkish authority or influence within the terri tory of these maritime tribes would be inconsistent with the due observance of British rights and obligations, and would be likely to derange a system which has been most beneficial to the interests of all nations in the Gulf. ' 15. We may add that it will be essential, with regard to these treaty Chiefs, to stipulate that not only shall they be free from interference in their sea coast, but that on the mainland also their boundaries must be respected, so far as the limits of their territories are known and can be verified. Eor otherwise it might be easy for the Ottoman Government to bring pressure upon these Chiefs from the land side, and they might thus find them selves subject to a divided or double authority, which would produce confusion, would create factions, and would tempt them to hoist the Turkish or the Maritime Treaty flag as might be most convenient at the moment. This possibility is illustrated by the proceedings of the Sheikh of El Bidaa, who now declares himself subordinate to Turkey, and by the attempt oi the Otleid Sheikh to follow the example of El Bidaa. ' It may also be necessary to protect the islands of Bahrein by special arrangements, which should provide,— . i Eor the maintenance of the territories ot the Chief of Bahrein under the protection of Great Britain.ii. For the by the Chief of his treaty obligations, including abstention from all interference with the mainland. ' But, in the event of attack upon his terri tories, the Chief, acting under the sanction of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, should be permitted^ to take such defensive measures as may be neces sary, even to the extent of following up his assail ants into Turkish jurisdiction. The justification for this last provision lies in the peculiar situation of Bahrein. The islands are so near the mainland as to render them peculiarly liable to piratical attacks, while this same proximity affords the aggressors every facility for rapid escape into Turkish jurisdiction. ' Secondly, in regard to Ottoman responsibility for order. Beyond the limits of acknowledged Ottoman jurisdiction no such responsibility would, as a matter of course, exist. But, for the reasons already stated, we consider that within these limits the British Government must continue to exercise some concurrent maritime protectorate, at least until we can be better assured than at present that the Turkish Government can protect our subjects and our interests effectively. It may not be found necessary to place on record any formal agreement as to the exercise of this joint protectorate, but some understanding of the following nature might be arranged ' i. That pirates, whatever their nationality, taken at sea, as well as pirates followed up and taken within the territorial waters of Turkey by British officers, or on shore within reach of the guns of British vessels, shall be dealt with under the orders of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. That the British authorities shall not undertake operations on the mainland within the Turkish line, as the duty of destroying pirate strongholds so situated will devolve upon the Turkish autho rities. ' iii. That the necessary representations to the local Turkish authorities shall be ordi narily made by the Political Agent at Baghdad. If, however, immediate action is necessary, they may be made in the first instance by the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who should inform the Political Agent at Baghdad of his pro ceedings. ' iv. That in case of piracies committed from within their jurisdiction, the Turkish authorities shall enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of com pensation.' Referring to an apprehension expressed bv VJolonel iloss, tlie (iovernment of India dn Tinf, rainty over the whole of Arabia need necessarily be 11.' 1 ' ■ 1 ': 1 ' • * Dated No. 637. 61 r-^by a disoassiou of the question of littoral juusdictiou; if they should he put forward it is assumed that they would be negatived as firmly claim to Bafi. 38 ^ already ^ tlle Turkisl1 With regard to the effect upon Persia of such a settlement as is proposed, the Government of India observe (para. 18) The question scarcely falls within the province ot the Government of India. Colonel Eoss re marks that the Persian Government and its autho rities along the coast have become accustomed to the piesence of British ships of war, and appreciate the advantages of our operations. He adds that Persia would certainly resent any attempts on the part of Turkey to assume a similar position, nor does he think that the Turks would think it worth while to make the attempt. We may, however, observe that a determination, somewhat on the lines indicated, of the position to be occupied henceforward by the Turkish Government in these regions would not be prejudicial to Persian inte rests^ As long as the limits of Turkish authority remain undefined, plausible arguments may be advanced for strengthening the Turkish squadron on duty in the Gulf. An increase in the number of Turkish vessels in those waters would add appre ciably to the Turkish power of aggression against Persia, at a point where the Shah's capabilities of resistance are especially feeble. When once those limits have been settled, there would be less excuse for an indefinite increase to the Turkish fleet in the Gulf, such as, for instance, was contemplated in 1871. In this view, therefore, the proposed settlement would be of advantage to Persia.*' It seems desirable to quote here the views which Lord Salisbury is at first sight ^aeiposecl to take of this question, as set forth in a letter which 23rd Aug., Jjas just been received,* in acknowledgment of this Office letter of the 1st August transmitting the papers:— ' Upon these proposals Lord Salisbury will be glad to receive the further observations from Lord Cranbrook promised in your letter. It appears to Lord Salisbury, however, at first sight that the arrangement, to which it is desired by the Govern ment of India that the Turkish Government should be brought to consent, is one which would, no doubt, be convenient in view of British interests, but which offers few or no corresponding advantages to Turkey. The Porte is apparently expected to agree to a definition of its authority along the coast r as not in any way extending beyond the neigh bourhood of El Bidaa. It would be called upon to abandon the claim which, though practically re- iected by Her Majesty's Government, it has never itself in terms renounced, to sovereignty over Bahrein, to acknowledge that island as independent under British protection, and, further, to concede to the Chief, in the event of attacks upon his terri tories, the right of taking such defensive measures 3000. 1 ■Xvs ffcO62 as may be necessary, under the sanction of the British Resident at Bnshire, even to the extnnt following up his assailants into Turkish junsdictio . ' It is, moreover, proposed that, until we are assured that the Turkish Government ettec- tively protect our subjects and interests, tfutisfc cruisers should exercise the right to pursue and capture pirates within Turkish territorial waters or on shore within reach of their guns, captures so made to be dealt with under the orders of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf. io ttie Turkish authorities would be left the exclusive conduct of any operations that may be requisite on the mainland, and the care of enforcing restitution and compensation in case of piracies^ committed from within their jurisdiction. The object in \ iew, viz., the repression of piracy and the maintenance of an efficient maritime police in the Gulf, is one in which this counlry takes considerable interest, but to which the Turkish Government are admitted to be very indifferent. Lord Salisbury, therefore, fails to see what are the inducements which would lead a Government inclined to be jealous of foreign interference, and singularly indisposed to renounce claims of sovereignty or jurisdiction however shadowy, to give an explicit consent to the prin ciples above set forth. ' It would seem more practical and more in accordance with usage that, having settled for our selves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction may be admitted, and beyond which it should be rejected or opposed, we should as a general rule look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police in those limits, only sanctioning the action of British cruisers in Turkish territorial waters under special circumstances when the consent of the local authorities has been obtained. The measures adopted by the Porte have undoubtedly been as yet insufficient and ineffectual, but further exertions and fresh naval reinforcements have been promised. Until the result of these has been seen, there scarcely exists sufficient grounds for a general pro posal of joint police in Turkish waters without any reciprocal concession to Turkish cruisers.' Thtbd. Bevision of our Treaties with Bahrein, the Trucial Chiefs, and Muscat.— Upon this point the Government of India observe (para. 17):— ' It may also appear to Her Majesty's Govern ment that the present opportunity should be taken to revise our agreements both with Muscat and the Arab trucial Chiefs, including, of course, Bahrein. It is due to the policy which the British Govern ment has pursued for many years at heavy ex pense, and to the efficient naval police which it maintains, that piratical outrages have ceased on all that part of the Arab coast subject to British influence. In consequence of this condition of permanent security, the commerce of the Persian Gulf has developed to an extent which a few years63 Pnnf^ 0Uld l 1 ^, beeri (ieemed impossible, and it and p t ^/r 111CreaSe * The Arab Chiefs and the Sultan of Muscat have prospered under the prolonged and settled peace which the British maritime protectorate has secured. Nevertheless^ they contribute nothing towards the maintenance ot a condition of things so profitable to themselves, and their engagements contain no distinct acknow ledgment ot the British Government as the para* mount power. The Government of India has never exercised any right of sovereignty over these . n ' nor ' exce pt as regards maritime proceed ings, does it possess any control over them. Por t le purpose of obtaining a complete and recognized n e, and of securing, on a valid international basis, the position which the British Government has acquired by a long course of settled policy, and dt much cost, it will be very advisable to arrange that the treaty Chiefs shall render a small tribute to us m exchange for our protection.' This proposition is a little surprising, seeing that in June 1876, when the same question was mooted by the Political Agent at Baghdad, Lord Lytton's Government expressed a different opinion. In an appendix to his Trade Beport of that year, Colonel Nixon wrote:— ' There can be little doubt that it will be con ceded that the British Government has certain rights in these regions which no other nation pos sesses, and which I desire again to record, although my views have been demi-officially explained pre viously. ' Firstly, in the interests of commerce we have mapped and measured every shoal in the Persian Gulf, and thus laid bare its difficult and dangerous passages for the benefit of the ships of all nations, and this has been effected at vast expense to our Government, and a great sacrifice of life to the officers and men of our Indian Marine. ' Secondly, we have, with a strong hand, sup pressed piracy in the Persian Gulf, and our gun boats still do the police duties of that sea, and keep in check the piratical habits of the Arabs who have been robbers in the Gulf from time im memorial. ' Thirdly, viewing the Arab tribes along the western shores of the Persian Gulf as independent, we have made treaties with them in the cause of humanity for the suppression of the slave trade. At the same time we have been guilty of neglect in not having exacted tribute from the Chiefs along the coast as well as from Muscat, and I cannot ■ it • 1 • -J-Uin /^wi^cicvirvn min-Vlf AVP.n DO VV This maybe regarded as of slight importance ai present, but it will certainly be a disturbing in fluence to our Mahommedan subjects in India.64 In sending home Colonel Nixon^ paper, the Government of India informed* the Secretary of State that the 'exaction of tribute from Oman ' and the littoral Chiefs, as a safeguard against Ottoman ambition,' appeared to them to be ''a measure neither justified by necessity nor cal- ** culated to promote the interests of the British te Empire in those quarters,' an opinion in which the Foreign Office was informed the Secretary of State for India concurred.! The Secretary of State for Poreign Affairs now (23rd August) expresses himself very decidedly on the subject:—' These are proposals which, in Lord ' Salisbury's opinion, should not be entertained ' without very serious consideration. As regards ' Muscat, Lord Cranbrook is, no doubt, aware that ' this country is under an engagement with Prance ' (dated 10th March 1862) to respect the indepen- ' dence of the Sultan. The sovereignty of Bahrein ' has long formed the subject of claims advanced ' by Turkey and Persia. These claims have always ' been repudiated by Her Majesty's Government, ' but such a step as is now suggested would doubt- ' less lead to renewed controversy, and give rise to ' suspicion and ill feeling on the part of both ' these powers. It may be true that the extension ' of Turkish authority along the coast will be ' attended with inconvenience and disadvantage to ' British commerce, and that the present position of ' the trucial Chiefs does not offer the same facilities u for opposing such an extension as a more definite ' dependence on Great Britain. But the acquisition ' and maintenance of British sovereignty over this ' strip of territory on the coast of Arabia is not ' unlikely to give rise to questions equally incon- ' venient.' The circumstances connected with the engage ment with Prance in regard to Muscat—the very last place where British and Prench interests would be supposed likely to clash—were as follows. Early in 1860,| Colonel Bigby, Political Agent at Zanzibar, brought to notice that considerable activity was being displayed by the Prench at that place, and in subsequent letters he reported a rumour that a large building was in course of erection as a barrack.§ A representation was made to the Prench Government which elicited the reply that the building was intended for a mission station and hospital. Purther correspondence took place in 1860 and 1861, in the course of which the Prench Poreign Minister expressed himself as follows :||—' Le ' GouvernementdePEmpereur n'attache pas moins ' de prix, au reste, que celui de S. M.

Govertmcnt a reply was sent stating that the Secretary of State for India saw no objection to the course proposed, but at the same time pointiuff out tliat there was close counectiou between the ouUan of Zanzibar and the Imam of Muscat, the latter being the parent State, and both, until . , been under one ruler. In fact, Muscat ciamied feudal supremacy over Zanzibar, but by -Lord Canning s arbitration Zanzibar was pronounced independent, though liable to the payment of an annual subsidy. Instructions* were sent by the Foreign Office to Her Majesty s Ambassador at Paris, in accordance with which ^ Lord Cowley addressed a note to M. Thouvenel in the following terms :t—' Her Ma- ' jesty's Government would have no objection to ' extend the declaration to both the Sultans of Muscat and Zanzibar; at the same time Her ' Majesty's Government do not think it expedient ' to guarantee the said territories, which might at any time be threatened or invaded by neighbour- ' ing Chiefs, and which Her Majesty's Government ' do not consider themselves called upon to protect ' against such aggressions. What Her Majesty's £t Government propose * * * is, that they should ' join with the Imperial Government in a declara- ' tion pledging themselves mutually to respect the &lt;c independence of the two Sultans, which would ' naturally infer a pledge for both Governments ' that they would seek no territorial advantages in ' the dominions of the sovereigns of Muscat and ' Zanzibar.' The French Minister having agreed, the following declaration J was signed by Lord Cowley and M. Thouvenel on the 10th March 1872 :— 'Her Majesty the Queen of the United King dom of Great Britain and Ireland and His Majesty the Emperor of the French, taking into considera tion the importance of maintaining the independence of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and of His Highness the Sultan of Zanzibar, have thought it right to engage reciprocally to respect the indepen dence of these Sovereigns. ' The undersigned. Her Britannic Majesty's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary at the Court of France, and the Minister Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs of His Majesty the Emperor of the French, being furnished with the necessary powers, hereby declare, in consequence, that their said Majesties take reciprocally that engagement. ' Witness whereof the undersigned have signed the present declaration, and have affixed thereto the seals of their arms. ' Done at Paris, the 10th March 1862. Fourth. The conduct of Persian Gulf business between the bushire e/esidency and the Baghdad Political Agengy.-Ih reference to Colonel Nixon's proposal on this head, the Indian 3000. Kt 66 Foreign SecrGtary addressed Colonel Ross as follows (I7tli December 1878) :—* ' Witli regard to the proposal that the Political Agent at Baghdad, and not the Resident in the Persian Gulf, should be the medium of communi cation with the Turkish Government in respect to disputes on the Turkish portion of the .Arabian coast, I am to inquire what procedure is now observed. It is understood that the Resident at Bushire does refer such disputes to the Political Agent at Baghdad for disposal, having first taken any action which the circumstances may imme diately require. If this be the system, the Govern ment of India would be glad to know how it has worked in practice, and whether any rule prescribing its adoption has ever been laid down.' The Resident replied (20th January 1879) :—f ' I have the honour to state that the system of procedure has been as understood by the Govern ment of India. All ordinary disputes, complaints, or irregularities coming to notice on the Arabian coast, at places where Turkish jurisdiction is regularly established, have invariably been referred to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. Matters, however, which involved questions of international policy, or seemed to have special political signifi cance, have been reported to the Government of India only, for such action, through such channel as Government should deem best. In cases affecting the petty Chiefdoms (not trucial) whose connection with the Turkish Government has not been affirmed, or is vague and undefined, and where the local Arab Sheikhs still administer, and with whom, previous to the advent of the Turks, direct relations had existed, the practice has been to refer to the local Chiefs, in the first instance, and afford them the opportunity of themselves effecting a settle ment. Pailing that, appeal has been made, through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia, to the Turkish provincial authorities. ' As to the working of this mode of procedure, I cannot say that we have had the same success as when we were in a position to enforce our demands. But the local petty Chiefs, though to some extent availing themselves of the Turkish connection to screen themselves from the consequences of irregu larities committed by their own people, have still been reluctant to sever the long existing friendly relations with the British representatives. Direct representations have sometimes availed to obtain redress, but I can find no instance recorded in which appeal to the Turkish authorities through the Political officers in Turkish Arabia has elicited any satisfactory result.' The Government of India thus express their own views:— ' There is no doubt that the Resident in the Persian Gulf should keep the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia fully informed of proceedings which involve a reference to Turkish officials. In such • Enclosure 12 in India No. 127 of 1879. f Enclosure No. 15, as above. V67 matters it is essential that there should exist between the British Agents a constant and confidential in tercourse. The difficulty is to determine by rule at what point the conduct of correspondence should pass from the Hesident in the Persian Gulf to the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia. Generally speaking, all matters relating to Turkish jurisdic tion or responsibilities should be transferred to the Baghdad Agency as soon as possible, though on emergency the Bushire Resident would, in the first place, address the Turkish authorities direct.' ' • •• ■ : • riinp ; ,y-..j^ 7. : —— it now remains for the Secretary of State to consider what, under all the circumstances of the case, is the best course to adopt. On the main point at issue—how the police of the Persian Gulf is to be kept—his Lordship has two proposals before him; one from the Govern ment of India, another from the Foreign Office. The Government of India proposal is (1) that from Bussorah to Ojair the authority of the Porte shall be recognized as established on land, but that on sea the British Government shall for the present continue to exercise some concurrent maritime pro tectorate, pursuing pirates into Turkish waters, and dealing with them, wherever caught, through the Resident in the Gulf; (2) that south of Ojair Turkish authority shall not be recognized, except at one point—El Bidaa; and (3) that the Porte shall be required (a) to stipulate not to interfere with the trucial Chiefs, and to respect their boundaries on the mainland ; (d) to recognize the territories of the Chief of Bahrein as under the protection of Great Britain; and (&lt;?) in case of piracies from within its jurisdiqtion, to enforce restitution of plundered property and payment of compensation. The proposal of the Foreign Office is (1) that we should settle for ourselves the limits within which Turkish jurisdiction shall be recognized, and beyond which it should be rejected or opposed, and (2) that within such limits we should as a general rule look to the Turkish authorities to exercise a proper police, the action of British cruisers being reserved for very special occasions when the consent of the local authorities has been obtained. I venture, with great respect, to think that neither of the above proposals meets the practical rwiuirements of the case. The objection to the course recommended by the Government of India is, that it implies an under taking with the Porte which will be found impos sible of attainment. Apart altogether from the fact, which is illustrated by the course of events during a long series of years, and prominently at the present time, that negotiation with the Otto man Government upon any subject is extraordi- 3000. Lnarily difficult, certain to be prolonged, and doubtful result even when its own obvious interests are involved, it is impossible to follow ie coir spondence relating to the particular subject now under consideration without feeling a conviction that although the Porte may tacitly acquiesce m a limitation of its authority along the coast ot Arabia, it will never be induced to record, in even tue most informal diplomatic document, its assent either to such limitation, or to anything ike a joint maritime protectorate with the British go vernment along any part of the coast, and, sail less, to an exclusive British protectorate over Bahrein. It may further, from past experience, bo assumed with certainty that any undertaking that the Turkish authorities shall enforce from third parties restitution of plundered property and payment ot compensation would remain a dead letter. iwo cases in point have been cited in this Alemo- randum ^ The objection to the proposal of the Foreign. Office, on the other hand, is that, if carried out, it would probably be ineffective to attain the object in view. The limit of Turkish jurisdiction could scarcely be fixed, even by us, at any point north ot Ojair; but the result of holding ourselves debarred from following up pirates into territorial waters above that point would simply be that a haroour of refuge would be formed, which would be taken advantage of by all the evil doers of the coast, whom the Porte would be unable to control except by a large increase to its naval force which it has declared itself prevented from making by con siderations of expense. On this head the following remarks by Colonel Ross, in a letter to the Government of India, dated 8th May last (just received) f, are pertinent. Writing with reference to a suggestion ot Colonel Nixon that the recent piracies were a consequence of interaecine dissensions between the tribes, the Resident ob serves :— ' There is nothing now requiring special explana tion in the late proceedings of the Beni Hajir and associates, except the increase and their boldness. Por years they have been known to resort to piracy whenever they could safely do so, and they lurked about the coast watching for opportunities. They formerly operated along the Guttur coast and at Odeid, but since the break up of the latter settle ment they have chiefly limited their operations to the Turko-Arabian coast near Kateef. Here they have for some time acted with perfect impunity and con siderable profit, circumstances which sufficiently account for the continuance of the evil. The Turkish authorities have been roused by constant remonstrances to take some measures of precaution against further depredations, but it is obvious that unless severe punishment is inflicted on the real culprits, and the property these have amassed re covered from them and their tribesmen, there will be no permanent security. It would be unfortunate See pp. 37 and 43. \ ■ f Political, No. 91, dated 28th July 1879. i69 forthe'conHmln 11 auth ° l rities enco ™ged to account anvwavT»t tT, T eXtent of the disorders in officials wWl, / Ue 0nR ' 1116 failure of their loca l omcials whetlier from want of enerffy or want of CTtievr' ni 116 a ' aiDst ^ that they should be afforded pretence for disavowing if sponsibility in the matter,' There can be no doubt that the recent increase of 1 ^ ahcal acts in the Gulf is, as Colonel Ross else- w n ere states, to a very large extent a consequence of the exercise of British coercion having been aban- (ioneel without the substitution of other control of a similar nature. Punishment is no longer so certain to tollow crime as it used to be. What is wanted is that this uncertainty should cease. Seeing, therefore, that it is urgently necessary that some remedy should be found for the existing disorders, and that the political and naval officers employed _ in the Gulf should not be left in the embarrassing position ia which they have been placed by the Admiralty instructions of May last, I respectfully submit, for the Secretary of State's con sideration, whether the preferable course would not be to intimate to the Porte civilly but firmly that the existing state of things can no longer be tolerated, and that the British Government is de termined to keep the peace of the seas in the Gulf with or without the co-operation of the Turkish Government; that the British Government has no desire to question the authority of the Porte at any part of the coast north of Odeid, provided such authority be effectively established; that the main tenance of order is the only evidence of such establishment which can be accepted as conclusive, and that the perpetration of piratical acts must be held as proof to the contrary; that pirates hailing from any part of the coast will therefore be followed wherever they may go, and be captured wherever found, whether on sea, within three miles of the shore, or on land, within the range of the guns of Her Majesty's ships ; that redress for piratical acts will be exacted direct from the local Sheikhs who may be implicated in them ; and lastly, that to whatever extent the Porte may ultimately succeed in establish- in 0, its authority along the rest of the coast, no inter ference with the maritime tribes from Odeid in clusive to the eastwards, or with Bahrein, will be ^ 6 The course above suggested is, it may be at once admitted, not diplomatic, but it would probably be effectual. It might provoke a remonstrance from the Porte, to save its alleged rights and dignity, but it would preclude discussion. It could, it is sub mitted be justified, if need be, by reference to the repeated assurances of the Turkish Government m 1871 72 that it did not desire or contemplate any Srbance of the status on the Arab coast i fn fhp as o^ten repeated declarations of Brtoh Government tlmt it would not allow any sasrsssview of it, such a course would be in the best interests of the Turkish Government, which would be relieved from the necessity of undertaking costly maritime operations. It would have a further advantage, from our point of view, that it would deprive the Porte of an excuse for the permanent maintenance of a large naval force in the Gulf, which, it is presumed, is open now to the same objections as were urged against it by the Govern ment of India in 1870-71. With regard to the proposed revision of treaties with Bahrein, the trucial Chiefs, and Muscat, the Secretary of State will probably agree with the Foreign Office. There can be little question that the measure might be misconstrued, not only by Turkey and Persia, but generally; while the necessity for it is not obvious, especially if on the main issue the course above suggested be adopted. The case of the tribes round iden who receive small stipends from the British Government, and are held to be dependent on it, is scarcely similar. They are conterminous with British territory at a point where the establishment of Turkish or any other foreign authority might be inconvenient. But we have no settlement on the Arab coast of the Gulf, and no particular interest in the tribes beyond what arises from our maritime policy. We have always carefully abstained from interfering in their affairs on land, and a departure from that attitude, to which the new relations might very well lead, would almost certainly result in embarrassment. The remaining question raised by the papers—the arrangement of business between the Persian Gulf Residency and the Baghdad Political Agency—is of secondary importance. That is a matter which must necessarily depend a good deal on the orders which may eventually be passed on the other points. Speaking generally, however, it seems obvious that the actual conduct of affairs in the Gulf must in the main be left to the Resident at Bushire, who is on the spot, the Political Agent at Baghdad being of course kept informed of what passes in matters in which the Ottoman Government is interested. Colonel Miles, who is at present acting as Political Agent, is intimately acquainted with the Gulf and its politics, has served for many years under Colonel Ross, the Resident, and may no doubt be trusted to co-operate cordially with him. Colonel Nixon, whom he succeeds, had not much local knowledge, and was too much disposed to identify himself with the Turkish local authorities. The annexed map, prepared by Mr. Grey, will perhaps be of use in the consideration of some of the various questions referred to in this Memoran dum, which I regret it has not been found possible to compress within narrower limits.

To support this, the document gives a history of recent affairs in the region, making extensive use of correspondence and memoranda mostly written between 1874 and 1879. The principal correspondents are from the Government of India, the Foreign Office, the India Office, and various political and diplomatic offices in the Persian Gulf, Turkish Arabia, and Constantinople. The matters covered by the document concern events at Bahrein [Bahrain], Guttur [Qatar] - including Zobarah [Al Zubarah], Odeid [al-‘Udaid], and El Bidaa [Doha] - Lahsa [al-Hasa], and the Trucial states.The memorandum concludes by outlining the position of the Foreign Office, the Government of India, and the India Office (represented by the author) on the following four matters:1. The status of Odeid;2. The need to better define areas of responsibility and jurisdiction with the Porte, and whether to hold them responsible for order along the coast under their authority;3. A revision of Britain's treaties with Bahrain, the Trucial chiefs, and Muscat;4. The arrangement of Persian Gulf business between the Bushire Residency and the Baghdad Political Agency.The author quotes extensively from the correspondence and other sources, notes on which are to be found in the margin throughout.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Assistant Secretary to the Political and Secret Department,</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of the Ottoman Empire</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Arabian Peninsula</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Odeid</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>El Bidaa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Lahsa</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Zobarah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Sovereignty</topic></subject><subject><topic>Piracy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imperialism</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000788.0x0003dc#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
