With the exception of Calcutta [Kolkata] all of these locations are in the North West of British India (present-day Pakistan).The letters contain general discussions concerning McMahon's family and working life including news regarding the health and movements of various family members, notably his elderly father, Captain Alexander McMahon.The letters also contain McMahon's brief observations on the customs, peoples and climates of the various locations which he writes from; this is particularly true of the correspondence sent from Gilgit, in which McMahon writes in greater length about his impressions of the region.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100029784034.0x000001#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
