PERSIA. I appreciate to the fullest extent the importance of the establishment of the most friendly relations and a firm alliance with Persia. I have never met a sensible politician who held the opinion that our true policy is to await an invasion of India within our frontiers, and leave Persia to her fate. I have frequently laid down what I 1 believe to be the cardinal points of Anglo- Indian foreign policy. They may be summed up in a few words. We should establish with our Frontier States of Khelat, Afghanistan, and pos sibly at some future day with Yarkund, Nepal and Burmah, intimate relations of friendship ; we should make them feel that, though we are all-powerful, we desire to support their authority and to maintain their nationality; that when severe necessity arises, we might assist them wdth money, arms, and even perhaps in certain eventualities, with men. We ., could thus create in them outworks of our 1 Empire;* and assuring that the days of l annexation are passed, make them know j \ that ' they have everything to gain and nothing to lose by endeavouring to deserve our favour and support. Further, I think we should strenuously oppose any attempt to neutralize those territories in the European sense, or to sanction or invite the interference of any European power in their affairs. It may take years to develop this policy. It is contrary to what has been hitherto our course in India; but if it is once established, recognized and appre ciated, our Empire would be comparatively secure. It is with this view that I have, with considerable success, urged the speedy demarcation of the Persian boundary as between Afghanistan and Khelat. By the definition and security of that frontier, I hope to remove the most fertile source of enmity between the subjects of the Ameer and the Khan on one side, and those of the Shah on the other. I believe that when this is effected, a certain source of jealousy and embarrassment as between Persia and ourselves will have ceased to exist, and in this way her true interests will be permanently advanced.I am happy to think that a portion of this important work is finished. Last week I had the pleasure of signing a memorandum thanking Sir Frederick Gold§mid for the success with which he has concluded the arrangements for the definition of the Perso-Belooch boundary. But in securing the independence and good-will of States lying immediately up on our border, I in no way under-rate the importance of maintaining the inde pendence and nationality of Persia and of strengthening her power. Sir Henry Rawlinson points out with great truth that extension of territory would be to her perilous. It is therefore with peculiar satisfaction that I look for ward to the definition of her eastern boundary, and trust that before next April a line will be drawn from Lash Jowein to the sea at Gwadur, which will form the acknowledged frontier of the Empire of the Shah. With regard to the Rulers of countries lying beyond our Frontier States, our policy is equally clear, namely, that we should lose no opportunity by influence, example, and persuasion, by every art that diplomacy places within our rfcach, of showing them that their best interests lie in the direction of peace, and that any action which would materially interfere with the balance of Central and Western Asian power must involve serious risks to themselves. I believe that the Turkish expedition to the Wahabee coast is likely tp end dis agreeably for our ally; I have long ago suggested that the danger he is running in following the ambitious counsels of Midhut Pasha is considerable. As far as I can learn, the course of events has justified my prediction, for, by the last accounts, the tw r o brothers, Abdoola and Saood, are said to have come to terms—Saood is raising troops, and will probably successfully combat any attempt on the part of the Ottoman troops to advance across the howling wilderness which separates the coast from Riad and the interior of the country. We should continue to press our view r s on this subject on the Porte. With regard to Persia, w^e should advise her to leave the affairs of the Gulf alone, to define her boundaries, and endeavour, by something approaching to a decent and honest Government, to strengthen herself internally. 0 / A- - •' , \SyU- // * t'* / / - — &lt;/ ^/ — - -4r -i *.— ~Y— ” i — - —- 4 ^ L .A - C j ALvUCv / /«,- ir. h / / ^ c &lt; '/?J 'II II Intended aggressions, on the part of Russia, should be protested against as oppor tunity occurs. The party at St. Peters- burgh which is in favour of peace and of maintaining the status quo in Central Asia is very strong. The representations made by Lord Clarendon, Sir Andrew Buchanan and Mr. Forsyth have had a beneficial effect. I regret that a final opinion on many of the weighty matters which have been under discussion has not yet been obtained from St. Petersburgh. Sir Andrew Buchanan has done excellent service by the frank and consistent man ner in which he has pressed on the Rus sian Minister the views of the Govern ment of India. I feel certain that a con stant representation of the truth made in the most friendly manner at St. Peters burgh would have considerable influ ence. Ou r difficulti es with Russia are greater than wlflT the other two countries, but if a firm, decided and conciliatory tone be adopted with Turkey, Persia, and Russia, —if we could assure them that we had no ulterior designs of our own to serve,—that our only object w T as the maintenance of peace and the spread of civilization over the wide territories which they govern,— the moral influence that we could exer cise in this direction would be so powerful as to render it extremely difficult for any of them wilfully or deliberately to break the peace. But to return to Persia, I concur with Sir Henry Rawlinson as to the absolute necessity of an immediate change in the relations of the Indian Government with the British Mission at Teheran. I heartily subscribe to every word he says as to the good influence which an able and energetic Anglo-Indian statesman would exercise over the mind of the present Sovereign of Persia. The Indian Government could always supply an officer well fitted for the respon sible and important duties which he w r ould have to perform, and seeing (as I do repeat edly) the enormous influence that a straight forward, courteous, able, and accomplished English gentleman can obtain in very little time over the minds of Asiatic rulers, I cannot but believe that the recommen dation which has been repeatedly made by the present Indian Government would, if carried out, be met with certain and immediate success. Nothing that has been brought offi cially to my notice leads me to' believethat the present state of feeling in Persia is that which is described by Mr. Eastwick. I am not aware that there is any in formation in the possession, either of the Secretary of State or the Governor General, that goes to show that a sense of his inability to cope with us alone prevents the Shah from coming to an open rupture with our Government. I never heard that he w r as aggrieved by the support given to the Ruler of Cabul, which I suppose has reference to the twelve lakhs of rupees which were given to Shere Ali by Lord Lawrence. We have never discouraged Persian pretensions if they are confined to hold ing a portion of Seistan. I have no reason to believe that Yacoob Khan’s advance from Seistan to Herat was effected under the direct influence of the Persian government, though it is probable that the Ameer of Kayen openly assisted him; but the Persian govern ment have distinctly denied to Mr. Alison that they did so. It is impossible to predict for a moment what line an Afghan ruler may take, but the late reconciliation of Yacoob with his father—hollow though it maybe—and his appointment to the Governorship of Herat does not look as if the Ameer suspected him of Persian proclivities. An effort to detach Herat partially or wholly from Cabul, and the exercise of influence in favor of the dismemberment of Afghanistan, w’ould be so gross an act of treachery and impolicy on our part as regards the ruler of Cabul that it is hardly worth while to discuss it. I have endeavoured, under great diffi culties, to push forward the definition of the Seistan Frontier. I have lately had the pleasure of receiv ing at Calcutta Sir Frederick Goldsmid and Colonel Pollock. They are both now on their way to Seistan, with every hope of bringing the arbitration to as successful an issue as has recently distinguished a similar undertaking in Beloochistan. I am not aware that any difficulty at present exists as regards Bahrein; but I am convinced that the very worst enemy of Persia could not wash her a greater misfortune than that she should embark in the troubled waters of Gulf politics. j/,*— i m &lt; 6 e - • * f * A*** *i?' ■ f Ji f*' * f v ^ ^ T' ,* t / i' ^ //'*/* —^ v r A *.Ilic events now passing in the Gulf, and the tendency unmistakeably shown by 'u- ^ as .^ a w ith regard to Bahrein, anoids practical proof that its possession is greatly coveted by the Porte. Bahrein is absolutely claimed by Tur- ey, but its neutrality has been assured by the British Government, and has been supported for many years. The acquisition of this valueless island by cither Turkey or Persia, and our con sequent renunciation of our position in the Gulf, would most likely lead to a war m which, under present circumstances, the lersians would most probably be beaten. I believe that if such an officer as I could easily name (many of whom we possess in this Service) were stationed at the Court of Teheran, we should have little difficulty in showing to the Shah that the existence of the present amount of British influence in the Gulf is one of the best securities that His Majesty possesses for the integrity of his dominions and for the maintenance of peace. In the same way, I believe nothing could be more fatal than that English in fluence should induce the Shah to make a movement northwards and so bring himself into collision with Bussia. I cannot too strongly express my con currence with Sir Henry Bawlinson upon this point, and declare my opinion that it would be almost a crime upon our part, for the mere purpose of obtaining a tem porary ascendancy in Persian politics, to urge her on so perilous a course as to attempt to extend her dominions either in north-westerly direction, or by encroach ments upon Afghanistan or upon its feuda tory tribes. Though I agree generally in the views of Sir Henry Bawlinson, I have great doubts as to the expediency of the sug gested employment of Indo-British officers in the Persian service. In the first place we have not the men. M e have scarcely any unemployed officers whom we could with confidence name for such a duty. The confidential list of unemployed officers now at the India Office will show that there are very few men whom any Government in its senses would think of sending to command Persian troops.( G ) 'For such a duty picked men could only be employed —men who are Oriental scholars, and who have a good knowledge of Persian. There are 143 unemployed officers in Bengal, and about the same number in the other two Presidencies. Of these 143 officers, 1 have ascertained, from the very best authority, that after carefully considering the list, only 14 can be discovered who, by the greatest stretch, could he considered fit for duty with the Persian army. Most of these possess no knowledge of Persian, or, in deed, any Oriental language except Hin dustani. Probably 20 unemployed officers in the three Presidencies are the most that could be found fit for such a duty. The little Lushai Expedition has ab sorbed nearly every qualified Bengal officer, in subsidiary duties, such as charge of coolies, &amp;c. Good officers are not kept unemployed in India, save for a time under accidental circumstances. I do not believe that British officers can directly and permanently serve Asiatic powers with credit either to themselves or benefit to those States. Their ways are not our ways, and in peace as well as in war, officers placed in such a position must be cognisant of deeds, and participators, to some extent, in actions which no man of honor can approve. If British oflicers cannot be in supreme command, they should not enter on such service. Eurther, I doubt that Persia desires the services of British officers for the organization of her army. She has not to my knowledge expressed any wish on the subject. If she does ask for Euro pean assistance, I think it would be better given by men who are not in the service of our Government. Whether it would be possible for her to find reliable men, I am not prepared to say. Persia can only be strong by being in dependent. I cannot think that her army being placed under officers of an alien reli gion and race will raise her dignity in the eyes of nations, or strengthen her authority over her own subjects. It is probable that if the Shah accepted our offer, and English officers were sent to Persia, other powers might press to be allowed to do the same, and we mightsoon find British officers struggling in the Persian ranks for supremacy with Rus sians or Frenchmen. In our present relations with Russia, we should view with great suspicion the ad mission to the command of Persian troops a number of the officers of the Imperial Army. A similar proceeding on our part would probably call for a strong remon strance from the Cabinet of St. Peters- burgh. I am not blind to the fact that Russia does exercise considerable influence at Persia. The oriental character of her diplomacy enables her to employ means and influences which probably are beyond our reach. But I believe this can only be met, and a counter influence obtained, by the employment of able and experi enced agents, men who have spent their lives in studying oriental character, and who will represent their Sovereign more as the Ruler of Hindostan than as a Euro pean Potentate.As regards the military force of Persia, Inch is said to amount to 100,000 men, it no doubt combines, in many respects, excellent materialbut the military sys tem of the country is such as to neutra lize all the good qualities of the individual soldiers. The military grades of the Army are, it is said, filled up through favor or bribery. There is a total want of capacity amongst Officers in Command; they have neither knowledge of military afiaiis, reliance on themselves, nor con fidence in their men. They fly in the hour of battle, and defeat the efforts of the few European Instructors who have ever been, or who may ever be, attached to the Army. Although the Persian Regiments are trained somewhat after the European manner, and taught by a number of Ins tructors of different European nations, their labors are, we are told, almost wholly thrown away by the habit which prevails of granting whole Regiments, already kept years in arrears of pay, six or eight months leave of absence at a time on condition of relinquishing their claims to those arrears. In the year 1812, w hen British Officers were attached to the Persian Army, at that time actively engaged in warfare against the Russians, Sir Gore Ouseley, our representative at Teheran, ordered them not to take any further part in the operations. On the entreaty, how r ever, of the Crown Prince and his Ministers, the English Ambassador, w T e are told, permit ted two of the British Officers (Lieutenant Lindsay and Captain Christie), and 13 Sergeants, to remain in the Persian Camp. The scene that occurred almost directlv afterwards at the action of Ooslandooz is amusmgly described in Watson’s Historv of Persia. J so, and the necessity of annihilating the small number of men opposed to him, the( 2 ) prince completely lost his temper, abused the nation of the officer who was ex posing his life in his service, him self galloped to the soldiers, and seizing their colors ordered them to run away. The Persian Artillery was for a time in effective from want of ammunition, but fortunately recouped itself by the gallantry of Lieutenant Lindsay, who at the head of a few of his men made a dash into the enemy’s camp and succeeded in carrying off a few rounds of ammunition. After general defeat and confusion from the above causes, the prince ordered two guns to be taken to the top of a high hillock from which it was impossible to use them with advantage, and afterwards directed them to be brought down to the base of the Hill Port, into the ditch of which 11 out of VS guns soon fell dis abled. The llussian Troops carried every- tliing before them. Captain Christie lost his life, and the Prince’s Army was totally annihilated, the result being the peace of Gulistan, which ceded all rights of Persia over Georgia, the Caucasus, and other Provinces, and obliged her to renoimce her right of maintaining a navy in the Caspian. The instance here cited may of course be exceptional, but still at a later period in 1838, we had occasion to remove our British Officers, who had disciplined the Shah’s Army, on account of the aggres sion of Persia against Herat. And so it ever will happen. Either from fear or expediency, we shall have to withdraw our British Officers, or put them in false positions, until we can bind Persia to a totally new system of external policy or internal military administration. In Sir W. Kaye’s life of Major D’Arcy Todd is an instructive account of the treatment of our officers and the state of Army affairs generally in Persia between 1833 and 1838. Major H’Arcy Todd, who was sent to Persia in 1833 to assist in instructing the Persian Artillery, thus wrote after a year’s residence in the country:—“ I consider the “ Persian appointment as sheer humbug; “ the climate is the only desirable thing in “the country. The people, especially “those about Government, are a lying, “ deceitful, procrastinating, faithless 'race. “ I would never have left Cawnpore had “ I known, what I now know, of the pros- “ pects of Officer in Persia.”( 3 ) Sir W. Kaye adds a Note.—“ The “position of the English Officers at the “ Persian head-quarters was always very “ embarrassing, as they were only recog- “nised by the Persian Government in “ the quality of instructors, and wt're not “allowed to interfere with the interior “economy of the Regiments to which they “were attached, nor exercise any of .the “ functions of command. In the provin- “ ces, however, the local Governors, being “ independent of Court influence, and car- “ ing little for the jealousies of the Native “ Commanders, sometimes conferred much “ more extensive powers on the British “ Officers attached to their service; Major “ Earrant, for instance, having had full “ authority over the Cavalry Corps at Zen- “ jan, and Major Rawlinson having been “ placed in Military Command of the pro- “ vince of Kermanshah. In former times “ Abbas Mirza had always placed the British “ Officers in real command of his troops, “ and Majors Christie, Hart, and Lindsay “ had thus often led the Persians to battle “ against the Russians ; and in the same “ way, in 1835, the latter officer, wdio had “now become Major General Sir Henry “ Bethune, was entrusted by the Shah “ with full authority over the expedi- “ tionary force sent to the south of Per- “sia; hut these were exceptions to the “ general rule.’ , Major D’Arcy Todd’s account of the events of 1835, consequent on the death of Shah Eutteh Ali and the usurpation of several claimants to the throne, is some what amusing. He says that he and the British Detachment were at Khoi near Tabrez employed in dialling four Regi ments of Infantry and some Artillery. They were ordered to march on Teheran, and he thus describes the course of opera tions :— “We approached within five or six “ marches of Teheran without meeting with “ the slightest opposition ; on the contrary, “ our numbers were augmented at every “ step. Mahomed Shah was everywhere “ acknowledged as King, and the chances “ of opposition seemed to diminish as we “ approached the capital. The Zil-i-Sultan “was not, however, wholly inactive. A “ force of four or five thousand men, “ with seven guns and fifty swivels, was “ despatched against us under the com- “ mand of Imaum Verdee Mirza, one of “the Zil’s half-brothers. This force ad-( * ) at “ vaneed boldly until it came within one “ march of our camp, and then retreated “ before us, keeping at the same time a res- “ pectful distance. After trifling for a few “ days in this manner, whilst we were ad van- “ cing at the rate of fourteen or fifteen miles “a day, Imaum Verdee Mirza deserted the “ cause of his brother, and came into our “ camp, his safety having been guaranteed “ by the Russian and English Envoys. “ His train of artillery, ammunition, swi- “ vels, &amp;e., were given into om* hands the “ next day, his cavalry swelled our num- “ hers, and the rest of his followers dis- “ persed ! A second force, accompanied by “ a much larger train of artillery, advanced “ from the city, but gave themselves up “ without firing a shot. So much for “ Persian bravery ! In the meantime, the “ Zil-i-Sultan was seized and confined “ to his palace by one of the nobles in “ Teheran, and the gates of the city were “ thrown open to receive Mahomed Shah. “ We did not, however, enter the palace “ for some days; the astrologers could not “ fix upon an auspicious hour for the royal “ entry, and we therefore pitched our “ camp near the garden palace of Negaris- “ tan, in which the King took up his tem- “porary abode. Thus ended our first “ bloodless campaign. In former days “ this farce would have been succeeded by “ a tragedy; heads would have been lopped “ off by the hundred, and eyes would have “been plucked out by the bushel— vide “ Aga Mahomet’s conduct fifty years ago— “but the young King has behaved on the “ present occasion admirably; his late “ opponents have been dealt with in the “ most lenient manner, and many of them “ have in consequence become his staunch “ friends and supporters.” Major H’Arcy Todd describes the diffi culties of his position as follows:— “ I am the only Officer,” he wrote, “ left “ at head-quarters with the Colonel, but “my situation with the Artillery is ex- “ ceedingly ill-defined, and the duty I per- “ form is disagreeable to myself, and of no “benefit to the Government. I have “ been detained at Teheran for the avowed “ purpose of being placed in command of “ the Artillery, but week after week, and “ month after month, has passed away, and “ I am at the present moment (18th March “ 1835) precisely in the situation in which “ I found myself on my arrival at Teheran “ twelve months ago, employed in doing “nothing.”In a conference which Major Todd had with the Prime Minister, all he could get out of him was as follows :— “ The two Topshee-Pashees (Command- “ ants of Artillery) had been sent for; one “of them, ISohrab Khan, of the Irak &lt;c Artillery, was present; the other, Hajee “ Iskunder Khan, of the Azerbijan Artil- “ lery, had come, hut had shrunk away “ again when we entered the room. 4 That’s 44 4 Todd Sahib, is it?’ snivelled out the 44 4 Kaim-Makam.’ 4 Todd Sahib, you must 44 4 have charge of the Artillery, and you 44 4 must drill them well. Sohrab Khan, 44 4 you must attend to what Todd Sahib says to you; mind, you must he very 44 4 particular. Todd Sahib, you must-’ 44 Here the oration was broken off by the 44 entrance of somebody, or by some other 44 subject presenting itself to' the mind of 44 the speaker; perhaps some fond recol- 44 lection of stewed feet came across him 44 at the moment. However, Todd Sahib 44 and his concerns were consigned to ob- 44 livion. We trifled away about an hour 44 in this manner.” Major Todd mentions an amusing inci dent connected with Persian Artillery Target Practice. He says in one of his letters— 44 This reminds me of an answer given to me by Mahomed Shah’s W uzeer, one 44 Mirza Mahomed, a great oaf. I had 44 been superintending some Artillery Prac tice at leheran. A jackass having been 44 placed as the target, I remonstrated 44 against the cruelty of putting up one of 44 God’s creatures as a mark, when wood or canvas would answer every purpose. 44 The Wuzeer replied : 4 On my eyes be 44 it! I will stick up a pony next time !’ 44 As if I had specially pleaded the case 44 of jackasses !” In the autumn of 1836 Major Todd was residing at Tabrez as Military Secre tary to Major General Bethune, who then commanded in Persia the legions disci plined by the English Officers, but in con sequence of the Persian operations against Herat in 1838, which was disapproved by the British Government, the English OflE- cers were, as said before, withdrawn, and none have since that period been sent to that country. As a matter of military administration only, there is no doubt that if the Shah were induced to give British Officers hi°*h/by ( 6 ) status and absolute control in bis Army, our misgivings might be somewhat re moved ; but the llulers of Persia have not grown wiser from past experience. And that to this day the Shah’s Army is in reality less effective, either for the pur poses of defence or offence, than if it were not drilled after the fashion of European Armies at all, is a fact which, I fear, can hardly be controverted.
