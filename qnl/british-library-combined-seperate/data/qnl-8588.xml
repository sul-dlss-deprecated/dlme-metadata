The papers, chiefly exchanged between HM Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, Horace James Seymour, the Foreign Office, and the India Office, cover: outstanding points remaining to be agreed prior to the signing of any treaty, including the withdrawal of Iran’s claims to Bahrain, Tamb [Greater Tunb] and Abu Musa, and the demarcation of the Perso-Baluch frontier, between Iran and British Baluchistan, now part of Pakistan; the British Government and Government of India’s reluctance to commit to a demarcation of the Perso-Baluch frontier, in part because of the financial implications of such a project; the despatch of an Iranian technical commission between February and May 1938 to recommence a survey of the Perso-Baluch frontier that was originally started in 1932; arrangements for the Government of India’s cooperation with the Iranian survey party, with the support of the Political Agent at Chagai; reports on the Iranian survey party’s activity and progress; a confidential entitled ‘Status of the Islands of Tamb, Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri’ written by John Gilbert Laithwaite of the India Office, and dated 24 August 1928 (ff 45-48); the return of the Iranian survey party to the frontier in late 1938.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Chagai</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Iran, Pahlavi dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Surveys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000046#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000046#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000046#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
