Hevision schera® for the improvement of the conditions of service of the clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency. Sir, I have the honour to put forward for the consideration of the Government of India a sceme for the improvement of the conditions of service of the Clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency. 2. Upon taking over charge of this Residency I was struck 'by the fact that the minoterial staff were far below tho standard of the other first class Residencies and in some the respects unequal to/duties they had to perform, at the same time the senior men were considerably desir/ous of, and negotiating for, appointments that would liberate them from Gulf service without sacrificing their pension rights. At the present minute both my Registrar and the Indian Assistant at Bahrain and the two Senior Interpreters - the four senior memoers of my Indian Staff 4 are all struggling to get back to India a state of affairs which does not make for a satis- -factory service. The primary cause of this is that the terms offered areare insufficient t. recruit or to retain the type ef men requirsd. Tlie preapecto d« not compare favouratoly oven witli those exixting for Indiana in their ov/n country. 3 . Upon examining the question it appears that the failure sf the present system is duo to overlooking lour factors in the life of the Persian Gulf, namely, (1^ The unhealthinesa of the Gull J (2) The fact that all Indians here are r/erkin^ Oversea!; (3) That standards of Gulf life have changed, new enterprises have sprung up and that others kbh &amp; X will give hetter wages if Government will not; 14) That, particularly in the Vernacular Office, opportunity for corruption on a larger scale exists* i will deal with these points in order. I was astonished to find on going into the matter that out of our small cadro, in the last seven years, no less than 5 clerks with 3-21 years' service have been obliged t® resign owing to ill health, losing all pension rights; that two had died of heart failure; and that out of three who had lived to earn a pension only two are alive the other having died the year after his retirement. A third man has recently died in Karachi from cerebral trouble in circumstances which must in part be traced to his service in the Gulf. It will be realised that conditions like these, which can perhaps only be equalled on the Sest Coast of Africa demand special consideration. It is an accepted principle with Governments that unhealthy localities demand higher pay or more favourable pension conditions. The second •f these principles dees not obtain here, except it may be pointed out, in the case of the Vice-consul of the Levant Service who is employed at Bushire alongside of the officers of the Foreign and Political department and3. and who alone ceunta three years towards pension for two years service in the Gulf* For our staff our Indian Fundamental Rules apply on equal terms in every way in Bushire, Bunder Abbas, Muscat as in Kashmir and Q,uetta. 5, As regards U) it has hitherto not been recognised that all Indians serving in the Gulf are as much Overseas as the British Officer in India, and in some cases nearly as far from their homes. They have to live under conditions more expensive than India, far frora their relations, de- -'barred from participating in the family ceremonies which mean so much to the Indian mind, unable to take short leave, and finally and most important of all they are obliged to maintain two establishments for the sake of the education of their children, I have endeavoured to meet these points in my proposals by the provision a of pay on the anilogy of Overseas Pay called Gulf iillowance to be drawn as Special Pay, Persian employes serving in Arabiaor Arabs serving in Persia, have the same difficulty P though perhaps in a less degree, 6. But besides sicknesa and death there are other forces t® be contended with in keeping up our strength. During the same period of seven years before mentioned no less than twelve clerks have resigned to better themselves. In India it is almost unheard of for miiiis- -terial offictais to leave Government service, but con- -ditions in the Gulf have undergone a radical change in the last fifteen years• The advent of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has transformed standards of living. The Anglo-Persian Company rates of pay for Indian clerks range from Bs 150-790 per mensem ana in addition t© a liberal Provident Fund, free furnished quarters, ice, oil, gas current, petrol and lubricating oil for those owning a car or motor bicycle are provided. What these concessions mean can be realised when it is stated that frosh water costs 2 annac a tin at Kuwait ( a junior4. junior clerk paying •n an average Re 20/- a month ); and that electric current in Bushire is charged for at the rate of 12 annas a unit - probably the highest rate in the East® 7, The Turkish Petroleum Company are now proposing to coimnence v/ork on a large scale in Iraq and will require many Indian clerks and in addition to this firm there are many others prepared to pay high wages lor ahle men. It is surprising to me that we arc able to keep any clerks at all, 3 o Certain posts particularly in the Vernacular Office offer great scope for dihonesty. The term Vernacular Office is misleading. These men are Inter preters who are present at the trial of all cases in native courts and who have a considerable say in their determination. Their work is most important. When at Meshod and Kerman I raised this question and at Bushire I have found it equally urgent. The Political Agent in a report upon the investigation of a case at Bahrain which resulted in our having to dispense with the services of an official confirmed my opinion that when men are underpaid - the pay of the man in question was Rs 150 per mensem his opportunities great - it is not to be wondered at if they reimburse themselves by dis- -honest methods. One of my chief Interpreters himself told me he was offered Rs 5,000 or 6 months pay to assist in the altering of a judgment in the Persian Courts in a single case in which British subjects were concerned. Such means are in full accord with the customs of the countries in which these officials find themselves though not in consonance with the ideals of the Government they serve and upon whom their lapses by a paradoxial situation reflect discredit, although there5. (£' thei^e is little public opinien t® condemn them. It is •nly by a sufficient scale &lt;if pay that public •pinion ajnong ©ur own st&amp;ff can be fomed. History in India is sufficient t® prove the truth of this statement* I have then considerably improved the pay and prospects of the Venacular staff in my proposal« 9 e To remove these abuses and render the con- editions of the Gulf service such that suitable men s/ will be contented to Join it and to remain in it I have msi.de certain proposals. They are;- (a) The introduction of a Time Scale in place of Grade Pay; (b) Upper and Lower Divisions ; (c) Leave and Training Reserve; (d) Increase of two Extra Assistant Residents in the English Office; at the same time- reducing one Vernacular Office Extra Assistant Resident. This cannot be done without adding to our $ budget but I have no hesitation in saying that the present economy is bad business on the part of the Government« 10, The model that has been followed in my suggestions is that of Kajputana with which my Secretaries have been most familiar and whose system works well and produces excellent clerks. Our lowest rates proposed are considerably higher than theirs, but there is a limit below which an educated Indian caxmot exist in the Gulf, It is essential that the Confidential Clerk who deals with our most secret files on question of policy should be a Gazetted Officer but I am of the opinion that his appointment should be by selection and outside the cadre even if madefr»in it. A separate representati®n will te made en this aulsj ect. The rates propeaed f»r the Head Clerks are the .ame as Eajputana except that eur Grade II Head Clerks will net get selectien grade pay and that all eur Head Clerks will receive Ks 50 Gulf Allewance. 11. The systeia of Grade Pay hy appeintment has werked badly and causes endless difficulties, and its aucoessful administratien demands the skill •- an internatienal chess player. If clerks in a certain grade take leave they must he relieved by others of a similar grade, probably at the ether end of the Gulf, and they in their turn by the nezt available man in the next grade. This creates further vacancies and transfers. If the next most senior clerk is not given the vacancy, he loses the increments he could have earned by serving in the grade, and his claims cannot be overlooked. As the distances involved are often great, considerable coat to Governi*nt in travelling allowance is involved. I may mention that we have had 5 changes of Head Clerks in Bushire during the last 6 months owing to this system. 12. A Time Scale with, say, two efficiency bars and feur selection 1st Grade Head Clerkships does away with this difficulty and renders it possible for any clerk to relieve another without regard being necessarily had to the seniority of the post, a seniority which in practice is not always essential; in considering posti»gs more senior and better paid clerks would naturally be appointed to more arduous posts, but there would not be the disheartening bloc in pay which occurs under the present system,, As we arc new mnless senior clerks die or resign) a. mstn at the t©p ©f his grade might and in fact does through no fault ®f his own receive n® increasedT incrc pay fer years, A Time Scale rclitves this and ei an even increase of pay spread ever a term e are and is a much more attractive pr©positi©n to like., candidateso 13, An Upper Division enables 'better prospects to be held out to men with special qualifications, and al»« as 50 % of the vacancies will be open to Lower Division men who pass the examination, they have an incentive to work which does not at present exist. It is intended to adopt the Rajputana rules for recruitment to promotion/ in the two Divisions. ^4 # ^ Leave and Training Reserve ©1 two Upper Division and two Lower Division clerks is essential. Our present system of recruitment would be laughable if it were not tragic. Leave vacancies usually occur for about four months. As the fare to Karachi and back is more than two months» salary it is impossible to obtain men from India for so short a period, anu it becomes necessary to engage 4he first out-of-work English-knowing man available in the local bazaar. When a man has acted in two or three leave vacancies he gets a lien upon a permanent appointment and unless he does somethiag particularly foolishis usually automat- -ically confirmed. By this method we cannot hope to get the type of man required and it should be noted that four out of our last five recruits were obtained ai in this manner. What is required is a definite civil service known to the schools and colleges of India, 2^5 e it will be noticed that the number of clerks asked for is slightly in excess of that sanctioned for Rajputana, but the distances to men's homes are much greater, and as their leave does not commence till they reach Karachi their absence from duty is longer. ThereThere will 'be n® extra coot to Government 'by the institution of a leave reserve, since in practice it is necessary to employ temporary men to replace clerks pro- -ceeding on leave. These temporary men draw the pay of the permanent incumbents the pay of the men on leave being provided for under separate budget head. In point of fact a saving may be made with a leave reserve as it has often been found necessary to pay the temporary employe the maximum pay of the grade, whereas a permanent man would have to start at the bottom, thereby causing a saving t© Government. We are t^us able t© offer a permanent and pensionable appointment from the start, and so can import men from India who would not accept a four-monthsappoint- -ment for fear of stranded far from their home at the end of it. The practice already mentioned of employing temporary local man in our offices is also to be deprecated on other grounds which are self evident if men are not re- -employed. With reforence to the leave reserve it is proposed, should there be no objection, to post these clerks for training for six months to some Secretariat in India to obtaining a training in accounts and office work which it is not possible to impart here. For training purposes an allotment of Rs 1,200 per annum would be necessary. 16. The state of confusion which at present exists in the Town Office of Bushire is principally due to a change made in 1925 of amalgamating the posts of Registrar and Treasury Officer which has not worked well in practice. The work of Treasury Officer has increased with the abolition of rupee currency and increases with every new rule enforced by the Audit Department for the greater check of accounts. It is a whole time work and cannot possibly be combined with that of Registrar. A Registrar should be a less harrassed individual who is able to view the work of thethe #ffice as a whole and to see that everything functions smoothly and that nothing is forgotten or overlooked. At present the Registrar is so harrassed by his Treasury respons \ -ibilities that he is absolutely unable to give his best and supervise the office work in general as a Registrar should and is too overworked to be satisfactory in either place• The Secretary is obliged to work three days a week atSabzabad •* 7 miles away •• and the need for supervision by a Superintend- -ent is therefore all the greater # I regard the recreation of this post is so important that I am prepared to sacrifice the second Interpretership to obtain it and I have according- -ly omitted this post from my proposition statement though I would rather have maintained two first class Interpreters of gazetted rank - one for Persian and one for Arabic work - ©wing to the fact that apart from the duties already named they translate important and confidential letters to and irom Arab States and Persian officials. 17• The English office with only one gazetted poat as compared with the Vernacular office four has at present very poor pri»sT)ects # I would urge, therefore, that the Superintendent and Treasury Officer at Muscat should be given gazetted rank. As Treasury Officer his responsibilities are great, especially when i^t is recalled that the Political Agent is absent to recess three months in the year. It is in point of fact a matter of surprise that the post has not already been made a gazetted one. I believe I am correct in saying that Treasury Officers in India are always of gazetted rank. When the allowances of this post are taken jt into consideration the extra cost entailed by the above proposal will be small as the proposition statement will show and I would be prepared to reduce the post of Shroff at Rs 50/- per mensem towards meeting the amount necessary. 18. The resurrection of the post ®f Traesury Officer at Bushire and the enhancement of the status of the Superintendont at Muscat will much improve the pros- -pects of the English Office and go far to render it attractiveattractive t® able nen. I attach preposition statements which shew my scheme in detail. It will 'be noticed that the estimated increased average annual cost is some Bs 18,000 plus 1,200 for training reserve 'but the saving in travelling allowance will certainly he Rs 3,000 per annum, I would therefore, request tha^, in view of the reasons I have detailed, the Government of India will be pleased to sanction the pro- -posals put forward. It must be remembered that the policy i of high tariffs on necessaries ( 156 % on sugar and tea ) of the Persian Gevernment has made Persia far more expensive to live in. The need for improvement in the Gulf service cannot be denied. Such increaB© as may be necessary is the pay of the Residency Office will in time be covered by economies which I consider desirable and will propose, but in the meantime this re-organisation which I now proposed is a very urgent and immediate necessity. 19, As soon as the revision scheme is sanctioned I intend sending copies of it to the Aligarh and other % Universities in India with a view to obtaining men of intelligence and education.

Revised scheme for the improvement of the condition of service of the clerical cadre of the Persian Gulf Residency. Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Mukerji's letter He. P.25-E/28 dated the 19th November 1928 on which the requisite action is 'being taken, what 2. I am in entire agreement with/Sir Lionel Haworth has said in his letter IT©. 5-64/149 of the 3rd January 1923 In order to secure efficiency and contentment in the clerical service of this Residency it is imperative that the condition of service 'be revised. At the same time I am doubtful how far Government are desirous at the present time, when the general question of affairs in the Gulf are under particular discussion in pushing forward any scheme for revision of establishment and it seegis possible that the decision may be delayed. Meanwhile it seems imperative that something be done to alleviate the positioi and to hearten the clerical staff. 3. As the simplest solution I would propose that as a temporary measure the establishment of the Persian Gulf Residency should receive from the 1st April 1928 the Gulf aalowances proposed in Sir Lionel Haworth # s letter at thethe following rates Registrar and Treasury Officer (400-20-500 ) Interpreter &amp; Indian Asstt» Eg, LiO each P.M., Head Clerks ( 200-10-250 ) M 50 De Clerks &amp; Interpreters (, 150-10-200) M 35 I)o, Two stateraente are appended showiiig under Divisible and Non-divisihle expenditure the cost of the concession which will amount to Rs 7440 and Rs 1560 annually under Divisible anf Non-divisible respectively. In the case of the appointments of Head Clerk, Bandar Abbas and 2nd Clerk, Mohammerah to which the special pay attached at present is greater than the Gulf allowance admissible under the proposal now made I recommend that so long as the two appointments are filled by the permanent incumbents of the posts the allowances to be drawn by them should be at the rate sanctioned at present i,e« Rs 50 per mensem.

The Government of India in conveying sanction to the Eevision Scheme ( vide Foreign and Political Depart ment memorandum No, dated the 15th April 1930) have made no comments on the above request and I am con^ g&amp;iuently led to believe that they would prefer that the matter be sumbitted to them specifically showing in detail the effect of the recommendation made. The individuals affected are only four as shown below:- Name -Designation -Pate on which attained maximum under old scale 1.11.1925 Indian Attache, Kerman Indian Assistant 1.11.1925 Bahrein 1 1) Khan Bahadur Abdul Alim 2) Khan Bahadur Sey^id Siddia Hassan 3) Khan Bahadur Mohamed All Soofi 4) Mr. S.P.Pereira,Head Olerk, Mohammerah All these have over 20 years service and as Hs.400/- Rs.400/- Interpreter, -^ushire 26.6.1928 18.1.1929 Ks.400/- Rs # 2 50/- experience has shown that not many of the Kstablishment in the Persian Gulf serve their full time for pension owing to the unhealthy climate in which they serve, r it seamb^iiard to deprive these men of the benefit of the c&gt;r v(£S&gt; the service they have put in in their present appoint ments tc.mrds counting for increments under the revised scale of pay of these same appointiaents. I therefore trust that as a special case the Government of India will be please to sanction that the individuals men tioned ahove may be allowed to draw increments under t the new scale of pay from the date they reaonrd tne maximum under the old scale, i.e. the first two will d* draw Bs.450/- from 1st April 1950 while the 3rd will draw Hs.410 from 1st April 1930 and Ils.430 from 26th June 1930 and the 4th Bs.260 from 1st April 1930 and Hs.270 from 18th January 1931. Budget provision exists for this, as a total additional sum of Hs.21,200 was provided to meet the cost of the revision scheme cut of which only Bs.17,000 approximately are required during the present year. Actually, in the first instance the clerical establish ment have only benefitted hy the grant of Gulf Allowances and very slightly 'by the revised rates sanctioned though of course they will benefit by the latter ultimately.

Unfortunately on almost every occasion the transfer of a clerk is objected to by one officer or another and since only Bus hire can weigh up the relative requirements of all ten offices, prior consultation with those concerned only results in delajy. 2 # In these circumstances, unless there are very strong reasons to the contrary, I would be glad once definite orders have been issued,'^you would kindly accept the posting of clerks as a fait accompli.

The report by Haworth states that the standard of the clerical staff of the Persian Gulf Residency was very much below that of staff in other first class residencies, principally because the terms offered were insufficient to attract the right calibre of staff. Four reasons were offered for this: the unhealthiness of the Gulf; the fact that Indian clerks were working overseas; the general improvement in standards of living, which meant that employment opportunities were available elsewhere; and the fact that some posts, particularly in the Vernacular Office, offered scope for dishonesty. The main conclusion of the report and the subsequent letter from Johnston was that members of the clerical cadre should be offered improved rates of pay.The file also includes papers relating to the Government of India's approval for a reorganisation of the whole Persian Gulf Establishment under the terms of the revised scheme, including nominal rolls of staff, January 1929 to April 1931; and papers relating to the appointment and pay, both collectively and individually, of members of the Clerical (later Ministerial) Establishment of the Political Agency, Bahrain, including some nominal rolls of staff, May 1931 to March 1944.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Bahrain Political Agency, Clerical Establishment</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Clerical Establishment</namePart></name></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000213#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
