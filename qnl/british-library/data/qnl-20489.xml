As an alternative to amending the Schedule to the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order, and as a means of providing against any further alteration of the Schedule that may be required, Lord Zetland would suggest that the Order should be amended by the insertion, after the word if territory'' in the last line of Article 4, the words ''or any subsequent Order made in amendment thereof or substitution therefor.'

The reply to both points raised by the ar,y, with enclosu re « )_ ^ ^'r • : - h- '- Political Agent. Bahrein, in his telegram of the 21st October is in the affirmative. It is true that some doubt exists with regard to point (b) which could be removed by amending the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council so as to make Section 9 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act applicable to the Gulf States. But since, as will be seen from the Foreign Office letter, legal opinion is fairly confident that the prerogative powers of arrest and detention persist, and having regard to the legal obstacles in the way of any pro ceedings instituted by an enemy alien to quash a detention order, it is not considered necessary to pursue the question ■ of amending the Order in Council, 4. Attention is invited, however, to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Foreign Office letter from which it will be seen that it is open to a detained enemy seaman to take certain steps which, under at any rate British practice, will secure his release and repatriation. In these, circumstances, and subject to any views which you and the Government of India * ft 1 7 f may /may wish to express 3 it will seem that the Foreign Office are probably right in suggesting that there may be little to be gained by the removal of German seamen from neutral ships in Bahrein or Koweit, unless of course there are some exceptional reasons for such action in a Darticuiar case. The issue of the above has been authorised.

' , I j } ; 1 j jP.Z. 7630/59 . Note by Legal Advi aer, India Of fice. In the case of any ship belonging to foreigners, with respect to whom the Sheikh has consented to the exercise of the jurisdiction of His Majesty within the meaning of Article 8 (2) of the Order in Council 5 the Political Agent could certainly exercise jurisdiction in relation to any of the persons on 'board thereof s as long as the ship remained in the territorial waters of Bahrein. The only question is, what action would he be entitled to ^ take in the exercise of that jurisdiction. The power to deport under Defence Regulation No. 6 would not serve the purpose he has in mind 9 vis. arrest and detention. There would seem in fact to be no Regulation making provision for such an order as is contemplated in the last clause of _ Section 1 (2) (a) of the Emergency Pcwers (Defence) Act. (it may 3 incidentally, be noted tnat that clause has not been adapted in its application to tne Persian Gulf Territories;, as it perhaps ought to have been.) There are, however, good grounds for the Political Resident's suggestion that vis-a-vis the enemy subject no legal sanction is necessary. An alien enemy has in fact no rights whatsoever ? and, apart altogether from any statutory power specifically conferred, it is, I think, quite clear that the exercise of His Majesty's prerogative would extend to the detention and imprisonment of enemy aliens - unles's of course it could successfully be contended that the fact that specific powers had been conferred must be deemed to imply that the Crown's prerogative in such matters can no longer be exercised. (here, again, it is perhaps a little unfortunate that Section 9 of the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act is not among the sections applied to the Gulf territories ~ but I doubt whether its omission would be held conclusive on the point.) Mf the prerogative powers are retained, they will presumably be exercised by the P.D? (Intld) Mc.I.K, 13/12/39Is ■p.Z.402/40 FOEEIGK OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.W.I. OS 7998/37/91) 19th January, 1940. Dear Gitson, Many thanks for your letter P.Z.7680/29 of the 14th December regarding the exercise of jurisdiction by tlae Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein over neutral ships. 2. I enclose a copy of a minute on the subject by our Third Legal Adviser. You will see that Dean feels fairly sure that the statutory power to deport would not be held to exclude the undoubted prerogative power to intern. nevertheless, there may be some doubt about the question, and if you think it desirable that the Political Agent should exercise these powers, you may wish to consider whether it would be Y7orth while to amend the Persian G-ulf -States (iSmergency) Order in SL-l-M? Council so as to make Section 9 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act applicable to Gulf territories. S. In order to assist you in reaching a decision on the matter, it may be useful to set out the practice in this country with regard to the internment of seamen who are enemy aliens. An officer or seaman of enemy nationality has the right under the Hague Convention Ho. XI of 1907 to give an undertaking in a prescribed form not to engage in any service in connection with-'' the war while hostilities last. Anyone who signs such an undertaking must be allowed to leave if he wishes. We understand'that the authorities here do not^encourage (German sailors to make use of this right, but if any of them ask of their own accord to sign the undertaking, we honour it and repatriate them. Otherwise, the question of internment is a matter for the decision of the Security Authorities and this holds good whether the neutral ship enters British waters voluntarily or is compulsorily diverted. 4. If, therefore the Political Agent takes steps to remove German members of the crew from neutral ships, he may find himself under an obligation to repatriate some or all of them. In these circumstances you may perhaps feel that little is to be gained by removing German sailors from neutral ships in Bahrein waters. Yours ever, 3d/~ H.ivi. Jtyres, jibson, Esq.,\Z. 4-02/40, COPY '998/37/91). L The only point on which I feel any doubt is that raised by the legal adviser to second paragraph of his note. ;he India Office in the As the result of the cases in the last war it is now established beyond any doubt that where the Grown can do something by virtue of its prerogative powers but the same matter has been covered by legislation5 it is no longer possible for the Crown to proceed under the prerogative but it must make use of the statutory powers which may involve certain limitations on the exercise of those powers. It is perfectly true that an enemy alien has no rights and no status in an English court apart from any statutory rights specifically conferred upon him. If therefore an enemy alien is detained or interned under the prerogative it is impossible for him to complain or to appeal or to bring habeas corpus proceedings. The power to detain or intern enemy aliens is certainly a j^e^oga-'tive right of the Crown and was exercised in the last Y /ar - I think: in addition to the powers conferred under the fefence of the Realm Act. In this particular case I think: it could be argued that 9 by taking specific legislative powers to deport (and under Article 7 of the Regulations to refuse entry to) any person whose presence in Bahrein territory is deemed to be prejudicial to public order or security, the Crown has impliedly deprived itself of its power at common law to intern. As the legal adviser to the India Office says ? it is unfortunate that the matter has not been put beyond any doubt by the enactment of a similar provision to that found in Section 9 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, but nevertheless, although the question is in my opinion arguable, I feel fairly sure that the statutory power to deport would not be held to exclude the undoubted prerogative power to intern, (Sgd.)

It is obsenred that the practical value of the reaoval of I enemy seamen from neutral ships in Bahrain or Kuwait has been doubted, as, in the opinion of the Foreign Officer, the Political P Agent concerned may find himself under an obligation to repatriate some or all of them under the Hague Convention, Ho*!! of 1907. It is not dear how repatriation can be claimed as Article 6 of the Convention applies only to the crew of enemy merchant ships captured by a belligerent# ^neagr subjects who are bona fide members of the crew of a neutral Yeasel are apparently exempt from oapturet and if detained on other grounds # the terms of the Convention would -- J?; ■ _ ^ A . not apply# 3# In this connection attention is also invited to the Admiralty messages No.0054 of i3th October and No.1152 of 11th November 1939 (copy enclosed for ready reference) conveying certain instructions to His Majesty's Ships regarding the removal of en em/ aliens from neutral/. *..&gt;&gt; - 2 - • • i 1 neutral veiaela. From these instructions it would appear that is not the policy of His Majesty's Government to remove eneay aliens #10 are members of the crew of neutral ships simply on the ground of German or enemy nationality. Removal is allowed only in specified circumstances and in specified areas. 4. The Government of India therefore consider it desirable, subject to any further remarks by the Political Resident, that the Political Agents concerned in the Persian Gulf should be given definite instructions on the lines of the Admiralty messages enclosed regarding the circumstances in which enemy x subjects wonid be removed from neutral ships. They are of the opinion tnat it would not be proper to lay down that no arrest or detention should be made on the ground that there is little to be gained by removing Garman seamen from neutral ships in Bahrain or Kuwait. Oircumstances may arise in which it may be necessary to do so. THE ISSUE OF THE ABOVE HAS BEEN AUTHORISED.BJLlUuJ- GQPY OF SICiNALS . To •••••• All Senior Officers, Ships, FROM ....•Admiralty.

Dear Jibson, tr Please see your letter P.2, 2272/40 of the 30th April about the jurisdiction of the Political Agents at Koweit and Bahrein over neutral ships. ^ „ f .^1 2. The Admiralty signal of vmich -a copy was enclosed in the Government of India's letter~to the secretary of Btate of the 12th April applies to all Germans found in neutral ships on the high seas or brought into British ports for contraband control. Neutral ships which call voluntarily in the ordinary course of trade submit themselves to the local municipal jurisdiction and Germans on board the.:i are accordingly liable to arrest and to internment in the United Kingdom or deportation according to tae decision of the Security Service. Since it appears to be agreed that the Political Agents are armed with adequate powers for this purpose, they should be in a position to exercise a similar discretion to the Security Service in the light of local conditions. In case the point should be raised, Germans who are officers or members of the crews of captured German ships are no longer, in view of the barbarouj German conduct of the war at sea, being given the opportunity prescribed in Article 6 of the Eleventh Hague Convention to obtain release by undertakin; to abstain from hostile action against His Majesty's Government during the war. It may therefore be assumed that German sailors from neutral ships in accordance with the Admiralty signal will be similarly treated. 3» As regards the third paragraph of your letter, it was certainly not our intention to suggest that enemy aliens in neutral ships calling at Bahrein or Koweit should in no circumstances be removed. In view of the new situation created by the Invasion of Scandinavia, it will be most desirable to detain German members of the crews of i )anish and Norwegian ships. It may also be worth while to point out that Danish and Norwegian ships which we have taken over will not be neutral but allied ships, so that there would be no limitations on the right to remove Germans from them, which should presumably be done at the first opportunity.

(v) No.2 of 1940 (Exit permits for European British subjects). (vi) No.4 ol' 1940 (Black-out;. This last Defence Regulation has presumably not yet had the approval of the Secretary of State for India. 3. These Regulations have given us all the power we need ( to U s: ^2 - to deal with the various new situations created by the War and the ability of the Political Resident to issue fresh Regulations at once provided they are urgent seems to cover our future requirements. 4. The position with regard to deportations is perhaps not entirely satisfactory but so far as 1 can see no amend ment of the Defence Regulation can give us jurisdiction over ships at sea outside the territorial waters of Bahrain. In practice no serious difficulties have been encountered or need be envisaged in the future^ provided British ships continue to run between the Persian Gulf and India. British and American subjects if deported will presumably always be sent to India where facilities for dealing with them exist. Masters of mail steamers have always been found willing to co-operate and to take steps to ensure that deoortees do not leave the ships at intermediate ports. in any case the absence of valid passports and visas would make it difficult for them to land at a port between Bahrain and India. Local inhabitants i.e. Iraqis, Nejdis and Persians etc., have practically always been deported by native craft. 5. I do not consider therefore that at present any amendments to the Defence Regulations are called for. I have the honour to be Sir Your most obedient servant Political Agent, Bahrainiq utt* Cj V Confidential* Mo* G/526 Office of the iolitical Hetident in the jT'erieian Gulf, Camp Kuwait, December Sth, 1940• I-leaee refer to feel's demi-.offioial letter no* 4301/ 40 dated the 6th August 1940 and to your \ demi-official Sxpreet letter no. !)• 58il -i4 /40 dated the 2nd October 1940• ^ 2. So far as I can see no amendment to Article 6 of the Defence He gelations (Bo» i of 1939) will ^ive the Political Agent jurisdiction over a deportee once he is outside territorial waters, but I think that the addition of the words 'in such manner, by such time and by such route as may be specified in the order* to the existing article would give him powers to ensure that no deportee travelled by other than a British shij, to India. 3. At present Europeans and imericane are deported from Bahrain by B*I* steamer and Irakis, Gaudis and Persians are usually repatriated by dhow. The passport control at Bahrain ensures, at any rate in theory, that none of the latter return# As far as the former are concerned, we can always arrange for a deportee to be refused permitsion to land at an Arab port, and ersian restrictions make it highly improbable that he would be allowed to land at an Iranian port without a valid visa Yours sincerely, 5 •K* uaroe, •»!*st^uire, G.J• S•, Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Deyartment, Wew Delhi* i Vb' (Copy sent to P .a .Bahrain under P.L./7o.C/529 of 8.12.'40. )urther communication to secretary of State for India, India Office, London, S.W.1 |jg22fl/4Q. ; of the envelope as well as mjuu Sir, india office, ^ whitehall, london, s.w.1.

It is, in Mr. Eden^ opinion, immaterial whether the regulations to be amended were regulaGj.ons allowed by the Secretary of State or whether they were urgent regulations which came into force without the Secretary of utate s allowance and remain valid until disallowed. The amending regulations may either be regulations allowed by the Secretary of State, or urgent regulations according to the category in jhich the regulations to be amended fall. 2. As regards the amendment of Regulation 1 01 1939? it is suggested that, as both Article 6 and Article 11 of 'chis Regulation require amendment, a new defence regulation should^be ^ issued repealing Regulation 1 of 1939 altogether and re-enacting 1 with the amendments which have to be made to Articles 6 and 11, c^n* at -the same time making the necessary corrections to Article I* draft of a new defence' regulation for this purpose is enclosed herewith. It is suggested that it is unnecessary to make this regulation urgent said that it can therefore come into force after allowance by the Secretary of State. I am, etc., (Sd.) O.W.

It has also not been considered necessary to provide for the setting up of special courts, and the only change proposed in judicial procedure is the confirmation of death sentences by the Chief Court, i.e. the Political Resident, instead of the Governor-General in Council* Article 8 of the Persian uulf States (Kmergency) Order in Council, 1939, permits the overriding of the provisions of any Order in Council by a Defence Regulation. / lt (Signature) S. 44, MFP—1015 S&amp;P—(M.1S70)—9-2-39—20,000. {Designationxr a death sentence in the kind of caee covered ty the craft regulation is to act a 8 a ^errant to other wou^he offendere it i B essential that it should be carried out rapidly, if the proceedings have to be sent to the .ovem .ent of inuia it will te weekS if not months before confirn.tion of the sentence xs received and in fact if the Gulf is being subjected to air-raids it may be impossible to send the proceedings at all. further. ^e Government of India are likely to tove their o.n hands full . , j TK-s+h iudicia 1 cases from the and Will liardly wish to be troubled * aulf.

Section 1(3) of the Indian Special Criminal Courts Ordinance (ll of 1942)• ^ (ii) state that the order bringing the Regulation into force should be published in Bahrein in the same way as a Defence Regulation. o&gt;) The words in Article 3 which would enable the Political Residents Order to bring into force only some of the provisions Of Articles 4 to 8 seem to introduce an unnecessary complication, and might be omitted. (c) The part of the 'explanation' of 'authorised directions' in Article 4 relating to the powers of the political authorities refers to Regulations not altogether appropriate to the context^ which relates to directions for the vacation of premises. This part of the 'explanation' might be amended to read 'any power conferred by or under Regulations made in pursuance of the Persian Gulf (States) anergency Order in Council, 1939'.

Hickinbothara, C.I.E., O.3.S., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. ^ Y Sir I have the honour to attach a copy of a letter which I-have received from Haji Moharaed Tayeb Khonii and to refer to the conversation which I had with you on this subject on your recent visit to Bahrain. 2.. The two sons of Haji Moharaed Tayeb Khonji, Abdul Hazak and Abdul Hamid, are now living at Dubai. During the course ' of the last eighteen months a certain correspondence has taken place with such organizations as the Combined Intelli gence Centre, Iraq, with regard to the activities of these two young men and the Combined Intelligence Centre, Iraq, in their letter No.S.43/116 dated the 7th August 1942 stated that they would prefer that Abdul Hamid who was considered to have Japanese connections was not permitted to land in Bahraih. 3. Both Abdul Hazak and Abdul Hamid have on occasion given their views somewhat too freely on the Government of Bahrain and are alleged to have expressed a preference for a Persian regime in Bahrain. This was I believe sometime ago and cir cumstances are now very different. 4. Haji Mohamed Tayeb Khonji the father is a most respectable merchant of Bahrain who adopted Bahrain nationality in 1942. He is pro-British and has never been of the least trouble, in fact he has been of assistance to the Bahrain Government, He is well past middle age and is undoubtedly anxious to have one or both of his sons in Bahrain to help him with his business 5. My predecessor was not in favour of either of the young men being allowed to return to Bahrain and the Adviser to the /Bahrain/Copy/ Bahrain, 23rd December 1943. To Major T. Hickinbotham, O.B.E., H.B.M's Political Agent, Bahrain. Respected Sir, I beg to lay the following lines before your honour in the ardent hope that the same would not fail to meet your honour's kind, sympathetic and philanthropic actions. Sometime in the past I approached your honour and reques ted you to kindly consider as to my sons Abdul Razaque and ... Abdul Hamld to come at Bahrain and by then you advised me by writing expressing your sorrow that ^the matter is not in your kind considerations. Seeing no other alternative I seized the opportunity of expressing my never-ending sorrows both by writing and verbally to His Honourable Sir C.G. Prior, Political Resident, who very kiddly told me that he would refer the matter to your honour and when you would be going to Dubai, you would have talk with my sons there. I am glad that the matter is now resting in your kind hands.' I have been given to understand that you had been to Dubai and I hope you very kindly remembered me there and talked with my sons. ' l'beg to add here that I am an old man and my days are now numbered and because of this fact I can give no attention in my business and other affairs. The separation of my sons together with my oldage is making me more and more weaker every day and drawing me at the door of death which may come to me at any time. About a year or more, their mother died and before her death she was not suffering from any dis ease but the separation of her sons. Anticipating that you would very kindly take pity and sympathy on me at this time of my oldage and graciously be pleased to allow my sons to come at Bahrain. In order to enable you to allow my sons to come at Bahrain, if it necessi tates you to call for' any sort of securities from me, for any respect of my sons, I shall be very glad to furnish you with the' same. I am remaining in a firm hope that T shall not be deprived of your kindness in this matter. Your most obedient servant (SdO MOHAMED TAYEB KHONJI ill 1 j */ A A £\h JjD* PERSIAN GULF. NOTICE.

In paragraph 2, at page 2, at the end add the following:— ' The persons on whose complaint a Naval Court may be summoned are not the same in all cases (see paragraphs 3 and 5 below). Where therefore, a Naval Court is summoned on the complaint of a person who would be authorised to make a complaint under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (2) (6) of D.R. 48c, but the documents do not indicate that the person making the complaint was in fact duly authorised by the Regu lation to do so, doubts might arise whether the Court was properly summoned. In order to avoid such doubts, there should be inserted in any summons or other document in any such case, some such words as ' thereunto duly authorised under Regulation 48c of the Defence (General) Regulations, 1939 ' after the reference to the name and description of the person on whose complaint the Court is summoned.' 2. In paragraph 5, at the end of sub-paragraph {b) at page 2, add the following :— ' and also, as regards offences against D.R. 47AB, persons holding certain specified appointments in certain countries (see Instrument BA in Appendix II).' and after Instrument B in Appendix II, insert the following :— BA.

Leathers, The Minister of War Transport.'i 3. After paragraph 15 at page 5, add the following paragraph :— ' 15A. Jurisdiction as regards offences against the Merchant Shipping Acts.— By an Order in Council made under Section 80, M.S.A. 1906 (see Appendix VA), certain provisions of the Merchant Shipping Acts have been excepted from application to certain Government ships in the service of the Minister of War Transport which have been registered as British ships under an Order in Council made under the said Section 80 on the 14th July, 1921. The ships concerned are British ships which are directed by order of the Minister made under Section 15 of the Allied Powers (Maritime Courts) Act, 1941, to be treated as ships of an Allied Power. It follows therefore that a Naval Court would have no jurisdiction to deal with any offence alleged to have been committed by the master or a member of the crew of any such ship against any provision of the Merchant Shipping Acts so excepted. The jurisdiction of the Court to deal with any offence alleged to have been committed by the master or a member of the crew of such a ship against a Defence Regulation is not affected.' 4. In paragraph (1) of Regulation 48c at page 21 after the words ' such a court ' insert the following :— ' and for that purpose may go on board and search any British ship ' and omit the words from ' The powers conferred ' to the end of the paragraph. After the said paragraph (1) insert the following two paragraphs ;— ' ( ia ) If a provost marshal has reasonable grounds for suspecting that an offence has been committed which may be dealt with by a naval court as aforesaid and that evidence of the commission of the offence is to be found in any British ship in any foreign country, he may go on board and search the ship and seize any article which he has reasonable ground for believing to be evidence of the commission of the offence. ( ib ) The powers conferred on a provost marshal by para graphs (1) and (ia) of this Regulation shall be exercisable also by any officer, seaman, marine, soldier or airman exercising authority under or on behalf of a provost marshal.' In paragraph (4) of the said Regulation, at page 22, at the end add the following :— ' and the expression ' British ship ' does not include a Dominion ship.' and after ' No. 1373 ' add ' as amended by S.R. &amp; O. 1944 No. 744'5 5. After Appendix V insert the following : Appendix VA. Order in Council made under Section 80 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1906.

MEMORANDUM. To The Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushir I Reference your telegram No. 1749, dated the 3rd December, 1945 2. Order No.l of 1944 as amended by Order No. 10 of 1944, a copy of which is enclosed herewith, is the only order regulating the export of articles from Bahrain. In theory any commodity may be exported from Bahrain which is, in the opinion of the Director of Customs and myself^ surplus to local requirements and in practice permission is never withheld. For instance, cigarettes surplus to requirements for which there is a better market elsewhere were recently allowed to be exported; the merchant in question made a very considerable profit on the transaction. Similarly an export permit for reasonable requirements is never refused. 3. I am of opinion that the Order herewith cannot be relaxed as yet and do not consider it would be in the interest of the public to allow importers to re-export more than those commodities surplus to local requirements. 4. Possibly the Ruler had in mind, the restrictions on the export of goods from India rather than in force in Bahrain, NSORDER NO*1 OF 1944 In exercise of the powers conferred on me by Article 4 of Regulation No.2 of 1939, made under the Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council, 1939, and in supersession of the Orders recorded in Schedule I, and subject to the Exceptions noted in sub-paragraph (b) of Article 1, I hereby order that: Article 1. (a) The export from Bahrain of all goods described in Schedule II is prohibited except with the permission of the Political Agent, Permission to export articles listed in Schedule II shall be applied for on the form attached to this Order* Such forms shall be submitted to the Political Agency through the Director of Customs v/ho shall certify whether, in his opinion, the goods which it is desired to export are surplus to local requirements. Should goods be surplus to local requirements permission to export will not normally be withheld# (b) Exceptions: - (i) Travellers' personal effects# (ii) Cargoes of goods consigned from source for transhipment from or re-export through Bahrain to neighbouring countries may be exported with the permission of the Director of Customs. Article 2 . Persons infringing, attempting to infringe or abet ting infringement of the above Order shall be liable, on con- fiction, to'confiscation of the goods in respect of which they infringed, attempted to infringe or abetted the infringement of the Order, to a fine which may extend to Ks. 2,000/- or to twice the value of his goods confiscated, and to imprisonment which may extend to two years.

Export restrictions. 2. Supply of cloth of British origin is not as yet sufficient to meet local demands and in practice stocks are sold out within three or four days of arrival. Quite a considerable percentage of British cloth in cut lengths is exported by service personnel through their postal and customs facilities back to the United Kingdom. 3» Supply of Indian cloth is likewise, with one or two exceptions, insufficient to provide a surplus to local requirements, 4. To justify proclamation of a general exemption of cut lengths of cloth I consider the merchants' inability to dispose of their stocks is an essential prerequisite and that is not so at present. As stated previously, no objection is ever raised to the individual export of a person's reasonable requirements. -- POLITICAL — The issue of the above has been authorised.

Statutory provision was, however, made by the Supplies and Services (Transitional powers) Act, 1945, empowering H,M. in C. to direct that certain Defence Regulations should continue 'to have effect for certain further specified purposes connected with economic recovery and reconstruction, and Section 5(4) of that Act in effect authorised the Political Resident to exercise similar powers in so far as the Persian G-ulf States were concerned, I do not know, but I presume the Political Resident must have taken all due steps in this connection to continue in force such Regulations as were still required, 5% A further statutory provision was later made by the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946, for keeping alive for a limited period such regulations as were considered necessary in the period of transition, but were outside the scope of the 1945 Act, Under Section 18 of this Act H,H, in C. was empowered to provide for the continuation in force of certain classes of Defence Regulations having effect in any territory specified in Section 4 of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939) and -an Order in Council was duly made thereunder in relation to certain colonies etc, - see the Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) (Colonies etc.) Order J in Council, 1946, S .R.&amp; 0. 1946 No,255• Perhaps a similar Order was made in relation to the Persian Gulf States, but I am afraid I have no knowledge of any, ; .Emergency Laws (Transitional Provisions) Act, 1946. 9 &amp; io Geo. 6.

In Ordnance II of A 1942 though under Section 7 a Special Judge may pass any sentence authorised by law. Section 8 requires that a sentence of death, transportation for life or imprison ment for a term of seven years or more shall be sub mitted for review to one of the Judges of the High Court for the area nominated in this behalf by the Provincial Government. Again, there is nothing in /W60, HO Ordnances III^VII or XXIX of 1942 obviating the necessity for confirmation by the High Court of a sentence of death passed by a Sessions Court. It seems rather difficult therefore to make out a case for waiving the requirements of QjootAen 15 of the Bahrain Order in Council in cases in which death sentences are passed by the P.A. as Sessions Court under the proposed Regulation. Further, in order to enable the death penalty to be inflicted without any delay it would also be necessary to provide that such sentence can be carried out without confirmation (under the Criminal Procedure Code) by the P.R. in his capacity of Chief Court (exercising the powers of a High Court.) 20-8-42. : A. \ s tA V-J Cv pA/wt' ol ^JU a iv ml tx i &lt;- (--€A^^V hjljt &lt; (x t/OA-woL A _ Q k .

Your para.2» The effect of such a clause would be to override Sfirti nvi 15 of the Bahrain Order in Oouncil. Ordinarily the amendment of an Order in Council can only be achieved 'by an amending Order in Council and not by a King* s Regulation but Article y of the -Persian Gulf States (Emergency) Order in Council^. 193v^ provides that 'Defence Regulations shall prevail over the provisions of any Order in Council applicable. I suggest therefore that draft Article 9 should be amended to read as follows: 'Q. The Provisions of Part III of the Bahrain Order in Council, 1913, relating to criminal matters shall, save as provided below, apply in so far as they may be applicable to the trial of offences under this Regulation. The provisions of Part V of the said Order snail similarly apply in cases where the persons referredArticle 3 of the Draft Regulation but only the deletion V of the v/ords '*or such provisions ...... specified' 1 and therefore accepts the proposal that Articles 4 to 8 of the, Regulation should not come into, force at the time of its publication but as the result of a separate order as in Article z of the Draft Regulation. 14/5/4 3 it seems preferable to substitute the draft for both existing Articles 2 and 3 and to renumber the remainin Articles.
