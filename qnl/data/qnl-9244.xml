The letter demanded that the Ruler of Qatar should agree to fix the boundary between Qatar and Saudi Arabia; otherwise, Ibn Saud would be 'compelled to protest and to stop operations'. The suggestion of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (on folio 86) was that the means of preventing operations would be by fomenting tribal unrest. The papers discuss the British response to the letter, which resulted in a formal protest by His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda (Albert Spencer Calvert). The Foreign Office subsequently decided to close the matter until a settlement of the frontier question could take place.The papers include the text of Ibn Saud's letter or 'Mulhaq' (in Arabic, with English translation, folios 58-62); and correspondence from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Foreign Office, His Majesty's Chargé d'Affaires, Jedda, and the Government of India; and India Office minutes.The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Chargé d'Affaires to Jeddah</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Qatar</topic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a0#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x0001a0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
