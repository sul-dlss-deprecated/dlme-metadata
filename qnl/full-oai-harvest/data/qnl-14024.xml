                           Mekkadescribes the place, as well as the festival of ‘Sittanā Mèjmūnah’ in detail.Much of the foreground, middle ground and background is littered with tents of varying shapes and sizes. In the foreground bushes can be seen and in the middle ground and background pilgrims are grouped together. A ridge of hills rises to the left and extends into the far distance on the right along the horizon.Tradition relates that she requested to be buried at this location, where she married Mohammed. A group of pilgrims form a circle to the right of the centre of the image. At centre, the camera has captured the movement of pilgrims walking.The negative has had hand-work applied, creating a drawing-like quality in places, particularly in the background.This is the second of two photographs taken from the same vantage point, which form a panoramic view over the camp. The first is X463/7.Inscriptions:Above image, on the right, in ink: ‘VIII’Temporal Context:According to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
