His unwillingness to assoXB date himself with public affairs may in some degree be attributed to the latter. Consequently situation in Surwould appear to be symptom of the gradual disinteg ration of the Muscat state which,in these infestious times is bound to result from present conditions in state and the only means to prevent Its spread would seem to be the actual cooperation in Government of the ruler whether the p resent Sultan or his son,with adeqi uate means to entertain his subjects. I would therefon suggest a serious examination of the question of the removal of the limitation on customs dues at Muscat, It might be worth while giving some temporary assistance to enable the Sultan to recover control and consolidate his peaitkaa power iljby doing so the state * could be put on a proper financial and administrative footing otherwise any assistance so far from being temporary will only be a commitment leading to further calls If things drift on as at present. RESIDENTJ!CP./fc fc-3 Cc %A^JjutL^. , No. 40 Finance Ministry, Muscat State, 16th March 19S9. J To, The Political A.gent A: E. B. K # s Consul V. U S CAT ir, I have the honour in compliance with your request to give a hrief appreciation of the financial situation in relation to the proposal to increase State revenues. Judged purely on financial grounds, the State has in recent years enjoyed comparative stability. That is to say it has lieen paying its way without recourse to a new loan: it has without default met interest and capital refundment charges on the 1920 Government of India Loan wftlch is now almost liquidated: and it has during this time found funds to institute and maintain the following new services all recurrent expenditure:- (ij a State patrol ship, • / (ii)an Arab State sch ol at Muscat, (ill)the appointment of Qadhis to all Tmt three Oadhas in the Country. This has only 'been made poesihle hy (!) vigilant ocononi in the lean periods including reduction of the original'' strength of the Muscat Infantry, (ii) redistribution of tt Government of India Loan instalments, (iii) the starvation public works ( a half lakh could be spent with advantage o. Government forts up tna dovri, the country) (iv) the institutf of a Dhow Begistration Tax, (v) closer supervision of Custom* revenues, and (vi) absorption by the Central Treasury of Lhamailiyah 7akat and customs administration. KMI fli s U'^T\ , f © to attract powerful triTial personages from the remoter parts of the State: such expenditure would he a first charge on the means of the Buler of an Arah State run on traditional lines. Any reorientation of policy in this direction thus involves the increasing of revenues, and the State's only means of doing this would appear to he * hy increasing customs duties. Higher Customs duties, if authorised, can he collected, though some preliminary discontent is inevitable. Any increase in the cost of living, however small, will naturally lie unpopular with the general public, hut this feeling should disappear with familiarity. Two other sources of oppoaition-without considering Sur which has a century's reputation and practise of evasion-should however he anticipated. (i) 'Isa hin Salih (Sharqiyah) (ii) Yal Sa'ad tribe (Batinah) The Sultan considers the difficulties would not be insurmountable for two reasons (a) both parties having suffered in recent times at the hands of British Imperial forces are not expected to persist in obstructing a measure which they would know has only been made possible by a revision of the 1891 Treaty, with its implication of British Government assent, and (h) means would avail for placating such opposition, if not of forestalling it. Mr. G. Noel Bower (Imperial Customs Service) sent to Muscat on deputation from the Government of India in March of 1925 for the purpose of examining the State's Customs Department, addressed himself in his Beport to the question of the revision of the State's 5^ advolarem duties. He therein expressed three alternative views i afainst an increase (a) on the hypothesis that 'it is possible that imports would show a falling off to such an extent that no extra duty would he realised.' (h) on political grounds. ii an increase of l^to 6 (plus aloohal andalcohal and cigarettes tai of 15^) iii kn increase of to 7if* (-do- -do- ) As regards (i) Mr. Bower’s apprehensions of such a considerable falling off in the value of iinports would appear to be unduly pessimistic in the light of a slightly increased tax. As regards his alternatives (ii) &amp; (iii) i.e. of m revision either to a 6{% or 7if* tariff, the former would cause more trouble than it is worth. Any increase will meet with some opposition on principle. To incur opposition for inadequate results is not worth while: and it is only the yield from the 7}$ duties which may achieve, even partially, the desired ends. The result of a 7££ duty would I anticipate increase the revenue by one lakh and a quarter of rupees. Mr. Bower’s mere liberal estimate would appear to have been based on total ’customs’ receipts. In arriving at my figure I have taken into consideration two factors representating together nearly a half of the total volume of taxable trade i Gwadur ii Interior exports. ^.s regards (i) I have disregarded Gwadur as perhaps its present tariff had most profitably be left unaltered. « Gwadur is already virtually a 7^;? port ( State duties of plus Makran duties of on its borders) against other Makran ports having 4% duties, and in view of its size and position a further Increase may divert its trade. A small Indian trading ship in 1927 had onljjfco anchor and land its cargoesa few miles up or down the c.ast to circumvent our customs authorities there,and an application of the increased duty is calculated to encourage similar activities having for their result ends precisely opposite to those desired. As regards (ii) the 5% duties on dates and other produce from Interior Oman, whose yield for purposes of administrative convenience has always been brought to account as customs revenues, are not customs duties in reality, andA and would not 'be liaT&amp;le to the increased tax. The present tax (there is no wharfage as for legitimate customs transactions) is in reality in lieu of Zakat and the Treatv of 1920between the Sultan and the Interior Shaikhs followin* Shaikh ’Isa VLn Saleh ; lays down that this 6# shall not he exceeded. I hare therefore excluded export figures. i customarily lumped together as customs revenue,from my calculations. The figures which provide the basis of incidence for the H% tax are the actual impoBts along Oman Sultanate shores from overseas. The proposed additional customs duty represents a yield to the Exchequer of l/40 of the value of such imports. The total value of overseas imports (excluding Gwadur) for 1926-27 was Rs 4902:010/ and for 1927-23 Rs 5557149/ which would thus have yielded on the basis indicated, an additional revenue of Rs 1,22,575/ and F: 1,33,92 3/ in those respective years. The proposal of a customs duty is calculated therefore directly to increase State revenues by about l^- lakhs annuall 1 have the honour to be Sir, Tour obedient servant H.B.K. Finance Minister Muscat State.i i. mini y II di a. iii The general economic condition of the country has not improved during this period. The reason for this is that Oman's primary source of wealth, its date crop, has declined as a result of failing rains during the past 15 years in the Interior. Drought conditions have led to sporadic emigration from the Shareiyah province, the chief sufferer, to the Batinah and to Zanzibar. The middle Hajar has suffered to a smaller extent while the Ja'alan and the Batinah seem to have &gt;een little affected. Other lesser factors, through these are largely common to neighbours, are (i) a fall in the value of the country's produce sine the war years: (ii) a fall, in sympathy with the silver market, of the value of the tteria Theresa Dollar, Oman's , principal currency, and (iii) depressed condition in recent years of the pearl industry at Dibai and Bahrain-this reacts on the Batinah because Dibai and Bahrain besides providing a livelihood for some 400 Batinah divers constitut the chief markets for Batinah Tvet dates and firewood. The complaint of Muscat and } atrah merchants that the people of Shumailiyah and Batinah are not buying their wants from Muscat, but from Dibai because the Matter is a customs fre ^ - port is not entirely correct: it may largely be accounted for by a natural process of exchange. But while merchant and cultivator is alike less well off than he has beeny the present 5# advalorem customs duties plus a light 7akat cannot be considered to bear oppressively on him, or place a limit to the State's taxable capacity. Any desirable reforms demanding a flourishing Exchequer are conditioned by increasing State revenues. , The expenditure side of the Budget is inelastic. Its scale and scope drawn up in 19^ had relation to a dollar exchange of 200/ as against Rr 123/ today, and ^ \ margin to provide the Sultan with means spur Shaikh's guest housej-oa aix:t :?o lo nolflbaoQ oleioxtooe etiT fsrff ai aldt *to*i hossm erfT aiild' At&amp;roafpJt cl Qi&amp;ex ?■£ t8-&amp;&lt; vtid $aX*z&lt;!l) anxxn $n±tXi:* 2c fluasi &amp; sa oJt b£*zoc® c&amp; j&amp;ol 9r.srf anolJl^noo dxlaifoiXI .'lox'xoinl srJ t r.frtt'lfWB 2^tMr&gt; ©«M ; a^nivo'i'• (Ib^I i&gt;*x/Sil8 er{*t matt ttot$*'X%2:.xe . . . . &lt;: - r ‘ ’iciv xx offer .0 t oxf^ 2o , t nl a l.^t.^co 5oa£j3*Xvo(tl-t) J&amp;nr t ^on9*rx«o IsaxonlTcq .xvjb &gt;js Xtb®% odd to arsex it-fkc eaim.oe-f £t&amp;alta8 8*14 no a oa®rr t'-'l.''• xtod •3*ieY.tI' 1i ;•: tcx: v - Oo^ Moa tot baadiloviL r ^xtiJ&amp;iv-xicx . i j -/.r&gt; a CtrC'3-' zJ.i #i rt4 a-lx x.iDr .n dfrx*.-- x j&amp;ctb lo talx Cr r-ioo ■* ■.

Apparently the Imam’s Government are prepared to meet the prospect of additional customs duty in a reasonable spirit and as a matter of fact under the agreement of 1920, so long as the Zigat remains untouched, they do not seem entitled to object to an increase in customs duty.4. 1 would therefore aak that the international aspect of the increase in customs he taken up, as in the event of no additional revenue being obtained there seems little doubt that the Muscat State will eventual ly shrink into a Muscat--Mattra enclave. 5.

On the general position of His Majesty’s lovernment in Muse? t and on French, American and Dutch interests in that country since 1908, reference may conveniently be made to paragraphs 53-59 and 76-78 of the India Office memorandum s&gt;n Muscat, reprinted in P.0.13. So far as can be judged, French interests are now negligible, and although a French Consulate is still maintained, it has had no incumbent for some years. TTnited States interests in Muscat have, at any rate since the end of the war, been in charge of the Political Agent, and, while it would appear from the Department of Overseas ^rade report of 1929 on economic conditions in the Persian On If that there is a regular trade between the TTnited States and Muscat, it is in itself of little importance, and has shown a marked decrease in the last three years. 'here is no indication of any connection between Muscat and the Netherlands, and the commercial agreement of 1877 between the two countries in any case provides fer the grant of most- -favoured na,tion treatment only. HPERSECRETAP V OF STA^F, ? FOREIGN OFFICE.Me. Secretar;^ Benn if in complete agreement with the Government of India af to the importance, especially in view of the development of air corarr.uni cat lone in the Gulf, and of the reassertion of Persian authority on the Persian littoral, of maintaining the stability of the Muscat State, and he is impressed by the unanimity with which expert opinion urges the impossibility of securing this without some improvement in the financial position. Despite the presence of an exper- -ienced Eurofjean Finance Minister, this has shown no improve- -ment of late years. ’T’he budget estimates for 1929 record a decrease on actuals in the principle source oi revenue (customs) of Is. 1,39,000 between 1925 and 1928 in a total budget of some Rs. 10 lakhs; no new sources of revenue are apparently in view; and, while the 1iquidat^onin 1932 of the liabilities of the State to the Government of India, will release a sum of some Rs. 43,000 per annum for general purposes the effect of this cannot be considerable. Some improve- —ment m^^ht result from the consolidation of the Sultan s authority at Sur and the imposition there of an effective easterns regime. On this the Secretary of State is consult- -ing the Government of India; but the question presents difficultier. of its own, and even should these be surmounted, it woj Id probably be some time before any mate? ial inci ease in revenue from this source coo Id be secured. It seems clear, in the circumstances, that it is only on the lines now proposed by the Government of India that the situation can be satis- -factorily eased. 4. T he importance of eaiiy action is emphasised sy recent correspondence, which indicates that tne Sultan has renewed his threat to abdicate in txie near x utu.a t. extremely desirable on general grounds that he should continue to govern, at any rate until the heir apparent is older and has gained sufficient practical experience. It seems probable that much less difficulty would ,be experienced in dissuading His Highness from abdication, if itf ■»** if it stiould prove practicable to ease hie 'financial position oy tLe adoption of the proposals now u^der consideration (compare paragraph iv of the latter from the foscat yina^ce Tiinister enclosed with India Office letter o: 30th April, T. Sl29/a9 ). 'Prom a different standpoint, it will he rememhered (compare paragraphs 20-22 of the Inuia Office memorandum) that the arms traffic subsidy of Rs x lakh, which has been paid since 1912 in return for the co-operation of tne ruler of iluscat in the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms, expires with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. Moreover, the latter, should he abdicate, would as the Government of India point out, expect to receive an allowance commensurate with his diginty. The effect on Muscat finances of the loss of the arms traffic subsidy, coupled with the imposition of an allowance for an ex- Sultan, w )uld clearly be very serious. 35 In view of the desirabilit y of early action, one possible course might be to increase the import duties as suggested, except in respect of goods covered by the provisions of the treaties with the United States of America, France and the Netherlands. It appears that these goods are a very small proportion of tue total imports, nor does it seem probable that the trade with these three countries would receive much sliraulus from the resulting preference (excex)t conceivably in alcohol and cigarettes). It therefore does not appear likely that the differentiation would affect materially the realisation of an increased customs revenue. It may be best, however, in the first instance to o. approach the governments of the United States of America \ and France as suggested by the Government of India, In the meantime, the course referred to in paragraph 5 above can be further considered, in case it becomes urgently necessary to increase the Muscat revenue before a revision of the treaties with those countries can be effected. 7. I am accordingly t) eTiQ.uMrU'M whet tier' -a 0 whether Vr Secretary Henderson sees any objection to the Sultan being approached in the manner proposed in paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s letter. His Majesty's Government’s subsequent proposals to the French and United States Governments would be based on the strong case which exists for imprwing the financial position of the &gt;T uscat State, and could presumably be supported by the recent precedents for conceding the principle of tariff autonomy to Asiatic countries. j.

As the question of Muscat finances may become an urgent one if the present Sultan abdicates (especially if in that event the exist ing Arms Traffic subsidy were discontinued), the Secretary of State would suggest that it night be worth while to examine the question of increasing the tariff except in respect of those goods which are covered by the provisions of the treaties v/ith the United States of America, ana the Netherlands. If it Bhould appear that the desired increase in the customs revenue could be obtained while preserving the esisting treaty rights o. those three countries, and if the practical difficulties of differentiation could be surmounted, it might become desirable to impose the increased duties on other goods (which presumably at present constitute the vast bulk' oi the imports) , without waiting for the conclusion of negotiations which are likely to occupy a considerable time with Prance and the Wnited States of America. 3.

On the general position of His iiajesty*s Government in Muscat and on French American and Dutch interests in that country since 1908, reference may conveniently be made to paragraphs 53-59 and 76-78 of the India Office memorandum on Muscat, reprinted in P.G. 13. So far as can be judged, French interests are now negligible, and, although a French Consulate is still maintained, it has had no incumbent for some years. United States interests in .Miscat have, at any rate since the end of the war, been in charge of the Political Agent, and, while it would appear from the Department of Overseas Trade report of 1929 on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf that there is a regular trade between the United States and :Aiscat, it is in itself of little importance, and nas shown a marked decrease in tne last three years. There is no indication of any connection between Muscat and the Netherlands, and the conmeroial agreement The Under Secretary rta of State, Foreign Office, S.W.1.agreement of 1877 between tne two countries in any case provides for the grant of most-favoured nation treatment only* to. Secretary Benn is in complete agreement with the Government of India as to the importance, especially in view of the development of air communications in the Gulf, and of the reassertion of Persian authority on the Persian littoral, of maintaining the stability of the &amp;isoat State, and he is impressed by the unanimity with which expert opinion urges tae impossibility of securing this ana without some improvement in the financial position. Despite tue presenoe of an experienced European Finance iiinister, tiis has shown no improvement Of late years* Tne budget estimates for 1929 record a decrease on actuals in the principle source of revenue (customs) of Rs. 1,39,000 between 1925 and 1923 in a total budget some Rs. 10 lakhs; no new sources of revenue are apparently in view; and, while the liquidation in 1932 of the liabilities of the State to the Government of India will release a sum of some Rs. 43,000 per annum for general purposes, the effec of this cannot be considerable. Some improvement might result from the consolidation of the Sultan*s authority at Sur and the imposition there of an effective customs regi^**# ^ this tne Secretary of State is consulting the Government of India; but tne question presents difficulties of its own, and even should these be surmounted, it would probaoly be sam material increase in revenue from this gource could be secured. It seems clear, in the circumstances, that it is only on the lines now prqpt by the Government of India that the situation can be satisfactorily eased 4.i 4. The irrqportance of early action is emphasised lay recent correspondence* which indicates th*at the Sultan has renewed his threat to abdicate in the near future• It is extre.’nely desirable on reneral grounds that he should continue to govern, at any rate until the heir apparent is older and has gained sufficient practical experience. It seems probable that much less difficulty would be h experienced in dissuading His Highness from abdication. If it should prove practicable to ease his financial position by the adoption of the proposals now under consideration (compare paragraph iv of the letter from the '*)scat Finance Jinister enclosed with India Office letter of 30th April, P.3129/29). Proa a different standpoint, it will be remembered (compare paragraphs 20-!12 of the India Off too rae;»raraiura) that the arms traffic subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh, which has been paid since 191? In return for the co-operation of the rulsr of Muscat in the suppression of the illicit traffic in arms, expires with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. ?fareover, the latter, should he abdicate, would as the Government of India point out, expect to receive an allowance commensurate with his dignity. The effect on Unseat finances of the loss of the arms traffic subsidy, coupled with the imposition of an allowance for an ex-Sultan, would cleaiiy/ ^ very serious, 5. In view of the desirability of early action, one possible course might be to increase the inport duties as suggested, except in respect of goods covered by the provisions of the treaties with the ’Silted States of America, France and the .Netherlands. It appears that these goods are a very small proportion of the total Imports, nor does it seem probable that the trade with these three countrios would receive much stimulus from the resulting preference (except oonceivablyconceiva'bly in alcohol and cigarettes). It therefore does not appear likely that the differentiation would affect materially the realisation of an increased customs revenue. 6# It may he best, however, in the first instance to approach the governments of the Jhited States of America and Prance as suggested by the Government of India. In the meantime, the course referred to in paragraph 5 above can be further considered, in case it becomes urgently necessary to increase the Miscat revenue before a revision of the treaties with those countries can be effected. 7 # I am accordingly to enquire whether Hr. Secretary Henderson sees any objection to the Sultan being approached in the manner proposed in paragraph 6 of the Government of Indian letter. His Majesty s Government’s subsequent proposals to the French and United States Governments would be based on the strong case which exists for improving the financial position of the Muscat State, and could presumably be supported by the recent precedents for conceding the principle of tariff autonomy to Asiatic countries. 8# Copy of this letter is being sent to the Colonial Office.

I would however refer you to the French Flag qu estion. Until 1920, a list of the surviving flag holders and remaining Sur vessels entitled to fly the French flag was furnished by the French Consulate in Muscat to the British Consul. The last list furnished shows five owners entitled to fly the French flag in accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the award in respect of 5 vessels* Since the closure of the French Consulate at Muscat, _no list of such vessels has been furnished by the French au- -thorities although in 1924 efforts were made to obtain it from the French Consulate in Bombay* The French Consul replied that he had referred the matter to his Government but did not reply to subsequent reminders* In February 1929,the Wall of Sur wrote,in reply to enquiries, that the number of French flag holders is now reduced to one named Saleem bin Salim* Any differentiation in favour of French dhows and against British dhows would*in my opinion, have a bad moral effect,whilst the Finance Minister anticipates difficultiws from misuse of the French flag in outlying ports. The question seems to me to require consideration also as to whether,should such differentiation last for any considerable period* French dhows from elsewhere might not be attracted to Oman thereby interfering with the legitimate, old established tza trade of British and Oman subjects* 2* The trade of Oman is governed very largely by transport conditions* There are no roads to the interior* Goods have to be transported by pack camels or donkeys* This method is slow and consequently by no means cheap* There is practically no natural grazing in Oman proper . no anywhere near the coast consequently^hone keeps camels except for actual needs and use and these are expensive to feed* The only tribes which go in especially for rearing camels are \ # \ the Awamir Peru and al WahibehSBedouins living at the back of Oman along the fringe of the desert* Beither they nor their camels can run the gauntlet to the coast so they consequently only sell in twos and threes in their own encampments* The richest part of the country in Oman proper and the \ Semail valley* To transport the produce of this part of the country to Dubai seems out of the question* It would be expensive and would have to run the gauntlet of the marauding tribes in the Dhahirah* The camels which bring the country’s produce to the ports will return laden with commodities from these ports. The trade between Dubai and the Batinah coast ie due tothe fact that there is a belt of acacia trees behind the date belt Cirt) on the Batinah whence Dubai and the Trucial coast obtains its firewood* The dates of the Batinah being of poor quality are cheap -ed in the pearl trade* The transport,whether camels or badans, will not return i empty from Dubai but will come back laden with commodities for the Batinah coast* This trade therefore does not owe its origin &amp; to the fact that Dubai is a customs free port* The export of dried fish is almost exclusively in the hands of Khojas who live in Matrah. This dried fish is brought by badans to Matrah* The badans bringing the fish will return to the Batinah or other parts laden with commodities from Matrah* A certain part of Oman proper being equidistant from Muscat and Sur^diversion of trade from one port to the other does take place but such diversion depends very largely on tribal ques -tions* The Muscat authorities do not consider that any appre- -ciable deviation of trade or increase of smuggling would result from a small increase in duties* As regards the practicability of establishing the Suit authority and an efficient customs control at Sur,I would refer you to my report India Office B416 P6815/28* There are two questions at Sur* ( 1 ) The question of interference in affairs at Sur by the Bani Bu Ali and their attempt to establish an indepen' -dent State* (2) The lawlessness of the Jenebeh of Sur* I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant,.

This difficulty would not he lessened by the Sultan’s abdication as His Highness would doubtless take with him on retirement an allowance which would increase the burden which payments to members of the royal house throws on the Muscat State. 3. Apparently the Imam’s Government are prepared to meet the prospect of additional customs duty in a reasonable spirit and as a matter of fact under the agreement of 1920, (S. E., March 1921, Nos. 55 194). so long as the Zikat remains untouched, they do not seem entitled to object to an increase in customs duty. 4. I would therefore ask that the international aspect of the increase in customs he taken up, as in the event of no additional revenue being obtained there seems little doubt that the Muscat State will eventually shrink into a Muscat-Matrah enclave. 5. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. * 1 Lf Enclosure. Confidential letter from the Political Agent and H. B. M.’s Consul, Muscat, to the Secretary to the Hon’ble^The Political Resident in THE Persian Gulf, Bushire, No. 40-&lt;A of 1929, dated the 18th March 1929. With reference to your letter No. 4-S.^ dated 19th January 1929, I have the honour to submit the following report for the information of the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 1. Attitude of the Sultan .—In accordance with the instructions of the Hon’ble the Political Resident, I interviewed the Sultan. In view of the consistent attitude which His Highness has adopted for the past nine years, I had little hope of persuading him in the course of one interview, to change that attitude and undertake the task of actually ruling his country. I was surprised, however, at the reasonable, frank and friendly way in which the Sultan discussed the matter with me and how he suffered under no delusions either as to the weakness of the present administration or as to the necessity for the ruler to co-operate actively in the Government. He summed up the requirements in two words. Power and Money. At the same time, he declared himself a sick man and stated that the constant worry which he would experience from the tribes was more than he was prepared to undertake. He declared his readiness to give over the Government to any one the British Government might select, not necessarily to his son Saiyid Said and stated that in any case he had already made up his mind to return to Muscat twice more after which he proposed to leave Muscat permanently. He added that of course the British Government could force him to remain in Muscat. I presume this remark was with reference to the question of his allowance. As I had no wish to allow the conversation to take a definite line towards abdication, I did not discuss the question of such allowance with him. Lc99FDHis Highness assured me that he would do all he could to help the administration whilst in Muscat and he certainly is taking an interest in local affairs at present. His activities include :— . # (1) Whilst in Bombay he induced the General Electric Company to send an engineer to work out a scheme for the supply of electric light in Muscat and Matrah. It is hoped to form a company for this purpose, the General Electric Company taking a proportion of the shares and undertaking the management. (2) He has taken an interest in the improvement of the town. Some streets have been broadened under the direction of Saiyid Mohmood. Some ruined houses have been demolished and a tennis court for Saiyid Said is under construction on their site. (3) He has had new passports printed for the State in hook form. (4) He proposes making a tour of the Batineh Coast. The Sultan’s attitude towards the Arab members of his Council also seems to have undergone modification, and he does not now regard them as useless but realizes that they are of material value in carrying out the administration. He contemplates adding to their numbers to make them up to their original strength. The attitude of the interior too is more favourable than it has been for many years. His Highness the Sultan has received friendly letters recently, for the first time since the rebellion, both from the Imam and from Sheikh Isa bin Saleh. I am hopeful that it may be possible to induce the Sultan to under take the administration at least for a few years until Saiyid Said is old enough to be able to assert his authority without being in the hands of others. It would probably be easier to achieve this object by indirect rather than by direct methods. It seems possible that by encouraging his activities in local improve ments and by increasing his revenues so that he would be in a position to entertain Sheikhs and to exercise something more than a nominal authority, His Highness may become more interested and thereby in duced to take control of affairs. 2. Sur .—With the death of the Amir Mahomed bin Naser and in the absence of the Amir Ali bin Abdulla in the Hejaz, there is no influential Sheikh of the Bani Bu Ali present with whom negotiations would serve any useful purpose and it will be necessary in any case to postpone any discussion as contemplated in Foreign telegram No. 304-S., dated 22nd January 1929, until towards the end of the vear f Serial No. (74) in File No. 248-N.|28]. His Highness considers that if he went to Sur and ordered the Bani Bu Ali to remove their flag and customs post and cease from interfering in Sur affairs and then was not in a position to enforce these demands, he would merely be giving an exhibition of his own weakness. He is therefore reluctant to undertake any such discussion unless the British Government were ready to support him bv placing a sloop at his disposal with authority to bombard Aiqa should' he request them to do so. The late Amir Mahomed bin aser was a man of considerable personality and his ambitions were at the root of the recent troubles. There is therefore a possibility that his death may relieve the situation at Sur very considerably. 3. Finance.—Jhe last hundred years have seen a gradual diminution in the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat. This may be traced to (1) The loss of their sea power and OA^erseas dominions. (2) The introduction of steamers into the Gulf and abandonment of Muscat as an entrepot for the Gulf trade.(3) Abandonment by the Sultans of private trade. The earlier Sultans seem to have had strong commercial instincts and to have em ployed a large number of vessels in such trade. (4) Arrest of the prosperity of the country and gradual impoverish ment through constant unrest and strife. (5) Persistent drought in the interior. (6) Suppression of the arms traffic. (7) Expenses in connection with the rebellions themselves. (8) Loss of valuable gardens and other property in Semail which fell to the Imam under the terms of peace 1920. By the introduction of customs and other reforms and by cheesepar ing economies, the Finance Minister has been able to make his budget meet but he has had a difficult task. Trade depression and other causes have given ground for uneasiness and it has not been possible to carry out in full, the reform proposals sanctioned in Foreign telegram No. 2344, dated 6th November 1918 (Pro. No. 84 in S. E., May 1919, Nos. 24—67). Each year has seen the elimination of all items of public works from the budget whilst a diminution of the strength of the Muscat Infantry has had to be carried out in order to make the budget meet. The Sultan has found himself unable to entertain Sheikhs and keep up friendly intercourse with them as formerly. Such stringent economies in administration have caused a gradual wane in the prestige of the Muscat State with the natural repercussion that customs become more difficult to collect whilst the imposition of any other forms of revenue are out of the question. I am of opinion that a more healthy financial aspect is necessary if the State is to be put on a sufficiently sound basis to enable it to carry out a reasonably effective administration and to stop the gradual disintegra tion which is taking place. I would therefore recommend a serious examination of the question of the removal of the 5 per cent, limitation on customs dues. I attach to this report an appreciation by Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., Finance Minister, Muscat State, on the subject. I fully agree with Mr. Thomas’s views which are very ably expressed. Mr. Thomas recommends an increase in duty to 74 per cent, on the basis of Mr. Bower’s report (15 per cent, in the case of alcohol and cigarettes) and calculates that this will produce an additional revenue of 1J lakhs. / ANNEXTTBE. ^ Confidential letter from the Finance Minister, to the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Muscat, No. 40, dated the 16th March 1929. I. I have the honour in compliance with your request to give a brief appreciation of the financial situation in relation to the proposal to increase State revenues. II. Judged purely on financial grounds, the State has in recent years enjoyed comparative stability. That is to say it has been paving its wav without recourse to a new loan : it has without default met interest and capital refundment charges on the 1920 Government of India Loan which is now almost liquidated : and it has during this time found funds to institute and maintain the following new services all recurrent expendi- (i) a State patrol ship, (ii) an Arab State school at Muscat,(Hi) the appointment of Qadliis to all but three Qadhas in the country. This has only been made possible by (i) vigilant economies in the lean periods including reduction of the original strength of the Muscat Infantry, (ii) redistribution of the Government of India Loan instab ments, (in) the starvation of public works (a half lakh could be spent with advantage on Government forts up and down the country), (iv) the institution of a Dhow Registration Tax, (v) closer supervision of Customs revenues, and (vi) absorption by the Central Treasury of Shamailiyah Zakat and customs administration. III. The general economic condition of the country has not improved during this period. The reason for this is that Oman’s primary source of wealth, its date crop, has declined as a result of failing rains during the past 15 years in the interior. Drought conditions have led to sporadic emigration from the Sharqiyah province, the chief sufferer, to the Batinah and to Zanzibar. The middle Hajar has suffered to a smaller extent while the Ja’alan and the Batinah seem to have been little affected. Other lesser factors, though these are largely common to neighbours, are (i) a fall in the value of the country’s produce since the war years : (n) a fall, in sympathy with the silver market, of the value of the Maria Theresa Dollar, Oman’s principal currency, and (in) depressed condition in recent years of the pearl industry at Dibai and Bahrain—this reacts on the Batinah because Dibai and Bahrain besides providing a livelihood for some 400 Batinah divers constitute the chief markets for Batinah wet dates and firewood. The complaint of Muscat and Matrah merchants that the people of Shumailiyah and Batinah are not buying their wants from Muscat, but from Dibai because the latter is a customs free port is not entirely correct : it may largely be accounted for by a natural process of exchange. But while merchant and cultivator is alike less well off than he has been, the present 5 per cent, ad valorem customs duties plus a light zakat cannot be considered to bear oppressively on him, or place a limit to the State’s taxable capacity. IV. Any desirable reforms demanding a flourshing Exchequer are con ditioned by increasing State revenues. The expenditure side of the Budget is inelastic. Its scale and scope drawn up in 1922 had relation to a dollar exchange of Rs. 200 as against Rs. 123 to-day, and leave no margin to provide the Sultan with means to spend on a Shaikh’s guest house, or by douceurs and entertainment to attract powerful tribal personages from the remoter parts of the Sultanate : such expenditure would be a first charge on the means of the Ruler on an Arab State run on traditional lines. Any reorientation of policy in this direction thus involves the increasing of revenues, and the State’s only means of doing this would appear to be by increasing customs duties. Higher Customs duties, if authorised, can be collected, though some preliminary discontent is inevitable. Any increase in the cost of living, however small, will naturally be unpopular with the general public, but this feeling should disappear with familiarity. Two other sources of opposition—'without considering Sur which has a century’s reputation and practice of evasion—should however be antici pated. (i) ’Isa bin Salih (Sharqiyah). (ii) Yal Sa’ad tribe (Batinah). The Sultan considers the difficulties would not be insurmountable for two reasons : (rD both parties having suffered in recent times at the hands of British Imperial forces are not expected to persist in obstructing a measure which they would know has only been made possible by a revision of the 1891 Treaty, with its implication of British Government assent, and ( 7 0 means would avail for placating such opposition, if not of forestalling '•4-m 5 V. Mr. G. Nott Bower (Imperial Customs Service) sent to Muscat on deputation from the Government of India in March of 1925 for the pur pose of examining the State’s Customs Department, addressed himself in his report to the question of the revision of the State’s 5 per cent, ad valorem duties. He therein expressed three alternative views. (i) Against an increase (a) on the hypothesis that “ it is possible that imports would show a falling off to such an extent that no extra duty would be realised ”, (h) on political grounds. (n) An increase of per cent, to per cent, {plus alcohol and cigarettes tax of 15 per cent.). {Hi) An increase of 2J per cent, to 71 per cent, {plus alcohol and cigarettes tax of 15 per cent.). As regards (»), Mr. Bower’s apprehensions of such a considerable falling off in the value of imports would appear to be unduly pessimistic in the light of a slightly increased tax. As regards his alternatives (u) and (m), i.e., of revision either to a 6} per cent, or 71 per cent, tariff, the former would cause more trouble than it is worth. Any increase will meet with some opposition on principle. To incur opposition for inadequate results is not worth while : and it is only the yield from the 71 per cent, duties which may achieve, even partially, the desired ends. The result of a 71 per cent, duty would I anticipate increase the revenue by one lakh and a quarter of rupees. Mr. Bower’s more liberal estimate would appear to have been based on total ‘ customs ’ receipts. In arriving at my figure I have taken into consideration two factors representing together nearly a half of the total volume of taxable trade— {i) Gwadur. (it) Interior exports. As regards (i) I have disregarded Gwadur as perhaps its present tariff had most profitably be left unaltered. Gwadur is already virtually a 71 per cent, port (State duties of 5 per cent, plus Makran duties of 21 per cent, on its borders) against other Makran ports having 4 per cent, duties, and in view of its size and position a further increase may divert its trade. A small Indian trading ship in 1927 had only to anchor and land its cargoes a few miles up or down the coast to circumvent our customs authorties there, and an application of the increased duty is calculated to encourage similar activities having for their result ends precisely opposite to those desired. As regards (it) the 5 per cent, duties on dates and other produce from Interior Oman, whose yield for purposes of administrative convenience has always been brought to account as customs revenues, are not customs duties in reality, and would not be liable to the increased tax. The present tax (there is no wharfage as for legitimate customs transactions) is in reality in lieu of zakat and the Treaty of 1920 between the Sultan and the Interior Sheikhs (see page 104 in S. K, March 1921, Nos. 55—194) follow ing Sheikh ’Isa bin Saleh lays down that this 5 per cent, shall not be ex ceeded. I have therefore excluded export figures, customarily lumped together as customs revenues, from my calculations. The figures which provide the basis of incidence for the 74 per cent, tax are the actual Imports along Oman Sultanate shores from overseas. The proposed additional 24 per cent, customs duty represents a yield to the Exchequer of 1|40 of the value of such imports. The total value of overseas imports (excluding Gwadur) for 1926-27 was Rs. 49,03.010 and for 1927-28 Rs. 55 57,149 which would thus have yielded on the basis indicated, an additional revenue of Rs. 1,22,575 and Rs. 1,38.928 in those respective years. The proposal of a 74 per cent, customs dutv is calculated therefore directly to increase State revenues by about 1} lakhs annually. Lc99FDLetter to the Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London, No. F. 225-N., dated THE 4th September 1929. I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending with the letter No. 94-S. of 1929, dated the 2nd April, from the Hon’ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and enclosure [Serial No. (1)], of which a copy was forwarded to II. M.’s Secretary of State tor India, on the sub- ject of the finances of Muscat. 2. From the papers forwarded to His Majesty’s Secretary of State with Foreign Secretary’s letters Nos. 78-M. and 31-M., dated the 27th September 1923 and 17th April 1924, respectively [Serial Nos. (2) and (14) in File No. 749-X[23], it will be seen that in 1924 a similar proposal to that now made by the Political Resident for the raising of the tariff was not adopted by the Government of India, though they implied their prepared ness to entertain it in the last resort. Their reason was the anticipated difficulty with France and the United States of America in connection with the connnercial treaties, guaranteeing the 5 per cent, maximum rate, between those countries and Muscat. 3. Muscat affairs have of late shown a tendency to deteriorate. The integrity of the state is admittedly of great importance in view of its position at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, and the recommendation, re newed as it is after mature consideration in view of the growing danger of dissolution with which the kingdom is faced, seems now to call for more careful review. 4. There seems little doubt that the present trouble in Muscat is largely financial, and the Government of India concur with the Political Resident that the best hope of restoring the Sultan’s prestige and control lies in a permanent strengthening of his State finances. The causes of their present weakness are well analysed by the Political Agent. The principal causes are evidently permanent, and there is little prospect of an unaided recovery in the normal ebb and flow of commercial prosperity. 5. The tariff increase suggested as a remedy, namely from 5 per cent, to 7J per cent, generally, and 15 per cent, on alcohol and cigarettes, is slight, and if it were not for the international difficulty, there would seem to be little room for hesitation in adopting it. The extent to which opposition from France and the United States of America is to be apprehended is a matter on which the Government of India are hardly competent to judge. They trust however that those difficulties will not be found insurmountable ; indeed there seems reason to hope that America at least (though France may make some difficulty on political grounds) will not seriously object to a slight raising of the customs duty fixed over- three-quarters of a century ago at a rate which, in the light‘of modern tariffs, appears trivial. The financial interest of both countries in the proposal is believed to be negligible. 6. If His Majesty’s Government agree, the Resident will be asked to approach the Sultan with a view to his formally requesting H. M. G. to approach the F rench and American Governments on his behalf in the matter. . .

(4) Letter from tbe India Office, No. P. 6148, dated the 28th November 1929. ’ ^ I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 4th September 1929, No. F. 225-N.

As the question of Muscat finances may become an urgent one if the present Sultan abdicates (especially if in that event the existing Arms Traffic subsidy were discontinued), the Secretary of State would suggest that it might be worthwhile to examine the question of increasing the tariff except in respect of those goods which are covered by the provisions of the treaties with the United States of America, France and the Netherlands If it should appear that the desired increase in the cus toms revenue could be obtained while preserving the existing treaty rights of those three countries, and if the practical difficulties of differentiation could be surmounted, it might become desirable to impose the increased duties on other goods (which presumably at present constitute the vast bulk of the imports), without waiting for the conclusion of negotiations which are likely to occupy a considerable time with France and the United States of America. 3. The Secretary of State would be glad to learn whether the Govern ment of India are satisfied that the increase in the tariff which they suggest would not be neutralised by a diversion of trade to Debai and Sur, or by an increase in smuggling. He would also be glad of the views of the Gov ernment of India as to the practicability of establishing the Sultan’s authority, and an efficient customs control, at Sur. (4-A.)

With reference to the correspondence noted below, of which copies have already been sent to the Foreign Office, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter dated the 4th September from the Government of India [Serial No. (27)], on the question of an increase in the Muscat tariff :— Telegram from Viceroy, No. 304-S., dated 22nd January 1929 [Serial No. (74) in File No. 248]. Telegram from Political Resident, No. 60, dated 24th January 1929. Letter from Political Resident, to Secretary of State for India, No. 95-S., dated 2nd April 1929, with enclosures. 2. On the general position of His Majesty’s Government in Muscat and on French American and Dutch interests in that country since 1908, reference may conveniently be made to paragraphs 53—59 and 76—78 of the India Office memorandum on Muscat, reprinted in P. G. 13. So far ■-; \ i ifj fts as can be judged, French interests are now negligible, and,' although a French Consulate is still maintained, it has had no incumbent for some years. United States interests in Muscat have, at any rate since the end of the war, been in charge of the Political Agent, and, while it would appear from the Department of Overseas Trade report of 1929 on economic conditions in the Persian Gulf that there is a regular trade between the United States and Muscat, it is in itself of little importance, and has shown a marked decrease in the last three years. There is no indication of any connection between Muscat and the Netherlands, and the commercial agreement of 1877 between the two countries in any case provides for the grant of most-favoured-nation treatment only. 3. Mr. Secretary Benn is in complete agreement with the Government of India as to the importance, especially in view of the development of air communications in the Gulf, and of the reassertion of Persian authority on the Persian littoral, of maintaining the stability of the Muscat State, and he is impressed by the unanimity with which expert opinion urges the impossibility of securing this without some improvement in the financial position. Despite the presence of an experienced European Finance Minister, this has shown no improvement of late years. The budget estimates for 1929 record a decrease on actuals in the principal source of revenue (customs) of Rs. .1.39,000 between 1925 and 1928 in a total budget of some Rs. 30 lakhs ; no new sources of revenue are apparently in view ; and, while the liquidation in 1932 of the liabilities of the State to the Government of India will release a sum of some Rs. 43.000 ner annum for general purposes, the effect of this cannot be considerable. Some improvement might result from the consolidation of the Sultan’s authority at Sur and the imposition there of an effective customs regime. On this the Secretary of State is consulting the Government of India ; but the question presents difficulties of its own, and even should these be surmounted, it would probably be some time before anv material increase in revenue from this source could be secured. It seems clear, in the cir- cumstances, that it is only on the lines now proposed by the Government ot India that the situation can be satisfactorily eased. le importance of early action is emphasised bv recent corres- ponnence, which indicates that the Sultan has renewed his threat to abdicate in the near future. It is extremely desirable on general ground' that he should continue to govern, at any rate until the heir apparent is older and has gamed sufficient practical experience. It seems probable that much less difficulty would be experienced in dissuading His Highness from abdication, if it should prove practicable to ease his financial position by the adoption of the proposals now under consideration [compare para- graph of the letter from the Muscat Finance Minister Annex, re to Sorml OU enclosed with India Office letter of 30th April P 3P&gt;91 -91. From a different standpoint, it will bo remembered ('comnare rvn-n- graphs 20—32 of the India Office memorandum') that the arms traffic subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh, which has been paid since 1912 in return for the co nnotation of the ruler of Muscat in the suppression of the illicit traffic in t)Tl%r P1 T Ti^ th ? y'T of P° wer h.Y «&gt;e present Sultan. Moreover the latter, should he abdicate, would as the Government of India point out’ expect to receive an allowance commensurate with his dignitv. The effect on Muscat finances of the loss of the arms traffic subsidy coupled with the imposition of an allowance for an c.r-Sultan, would elen'rly be verv serious , 5 ; J n view of the desirability of early action, one possible course might he to increase the import duties as suggested, excent in resnTct of goods covered by the provisions of the treaties with tl,,, rr ?

It may be best, however, in the first instance to approach the gov ernments of the United States of America and France as suggested by tlie Government of India. In the meantime, the course referred to in paragraph 5 above can be further considered, in case it becomes urgently necessary to increase the Muscat revenue before a revision of the treaties with those countries can be effected. ^ 7. I am accordingly to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Henderson sees any objection to the Sultan being approached- in the manner proposed in paragraph 6 of the Government of India’s letter. His Majesty’s Govern ment’s subsequent proposals to the French and United States Govern ments would be based on the strong case which exists for improving the financial position of the Muscat State, and could presumably be supported by the recent precedents for conceding the principle of tariff autonomy to Asiatic countries. 8.

J ” g I have recently paid a visit to Muscat where I had the ideas,,™ ,,t making the acquaintance of His Highness whom I had not preGouslv mef and was glad to find him looking well and on the whole in good spi rits ’ •Original copy on File N.,. 334-N lag Lc99FD'O 10 2. On my arrival in Muscat I was informed by Major Murphy that His Highness had returned to Muscat early in November and had sine . been taking greater interest in the affairs of the state than on any previous occasion within recent times. His Highness had paid a visit m Ins yacht to the Batineli coast and another visit to Sur and was contemplating a trip to Dhofar, and Major Murphy was inclined to think that tor the moment at any rate His Highness had given up his intention to abdicate. Mr. Thomas, the Wazir, while agreeing that His Highness was taking greater interest in state affairs than formerly told me that he was con vinced that he was still firm in his resolve to abdicate at an early date and would mention the matter to me during our interview. And having regard to the statement made by His Highness to Colonel Barrett a tew months ago I went to see His Highness expecting to be confronted bv something in the nature of an ultimatum : I am glad to be able to leport, however, that these anticipations were not fulfilled and that my interview with His Highness was on the whole satisfactory. 3. As already stated I found His Highness looking much better than T anticipated and after complimenting him on his appearance and on the fact that he had been able to visit various outlying portions of his state, I turned the conversation to the subject of finance. The state financial year coincides with the calendar year ; and Major Murphy had informed me that despite the strictest economy he anticipated that the vear would close with a deficit of Rs. 7,000 or 8,000. His Highness stated that in his opinion it was essential that measures should be taken to increase the revenues of the state and expressed the very earnest hope that His Majesty’s Government would obtain the consent of the French and American Governments without further delay to the increase in the customs duty. I informed him that I did not know exactly how the matter stood but that I agreed with him that it was essential that something should be done to enable the state to pay its way and would represent his wishes to Government. 4. His Highness then went on to discuss Sur affairs. He had him self visited Sur recently endeavoured to arrive aFa*settlement with Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah, the so-called Amir of Jaalan of the Beni Bu Ali tribe, who was still levying unauthorised customs duties at Sur and flying a flag which though of the Wahabi colours the Amir has always stated is not a Wahabi flag but his own flag. His Highness stated that he had informed the Amir that he had no desire to interfere in tribal affairs in the interior of the country but that the Amir must cease all interference in the affairs of Sur. The latter however had refused to agree and the negotiations had proved abortive. His Highness expressed the view that the Amir thought that the Government of India were not ready to support the authority of the Muscat state and was convinced that he could defy the Sultan with impunity. The bombardment by H. M. S. “ Cyclamen ” last year had very little effect. The ship had simply knocked down a small fort belong ing to the Muscat state after it had been evacuated bv the Beni Bu Ali, and had then sailed away, and after its departure the Beni Bu Ali had resumed their occupation of the customs house and rehoisted the flag. I asked His Highness what measures he thought should be taken and he stated that he thought it would have a good effect if the customs house were knocked down by one of His Majesty’s ships. I then asked him whether the result would not be the same as before, namely, that after the departure of the ship the Beni Bu Ali would again impose their customs control at Sur occupying if necessary some other building for the purpose. His Highness agreed that this would probably be so and said that in his opinion it would he necessary for troops to occupy Sur for a certain period. T replied that in my opinion the Government of India would only agree to despatch troops in the last resort since the cost would be out of all propor- tmn to the importance of the matter. After some discussion His Highness admitted the force of this and stated that in his opinion it would have an enoimous effect if air action could be taken in conjunction with a naval^ ! Q kj b i 11 bombardment. The Beni Bn Ali were a very primitive people : tbe moral effect would be considerable : it would not be necessary for the aeroplane or the flying; boat to cause any casualties but if it also dropped some bombs on the customs house while the ship was knocking it down it would impress upon the Beni Bu Ali that His Majesty’s Government on the present occasion meant business and could reach them not only on the coast but also if necessary inland from the air. 5. His Highness then went on the say that before resorting to these drastic measures he thought that the negotiations that he had initiated might be continued though in a different form. In September last the Amir of Jalaan visited Aden and submitted to the Resident and Com- mander-in-Chief there a letter addressed to Colonel Barrett. In this letter the Amir claimed that the Muscat state had no right to interfere in the Ghafiri country : that if the Political Agent at Muscat wished to see him he should come to Sur for the purpose : that letters should come direct and not through the Muscat authorities and finally asked that he should be permitted to issue passjiorts and also allowed to import 300 mauser rifles. In short it virtually amounted to a demand to be recognised as independent of Muscat, and I have just received a report from the Politi cal Agent at Muscat that Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah has since his return been issuing printed travelling permits purporting to be issued by the Government of Jaalan and its dependencies. These permits have been signed and sealed by the Shaikh but have been distributed blank for all and sundry to fill in as required. A copy of Shaikh Alps letter was forwarded to the Political Agent at Muscat and he was told that in case any further enquiries were made by Sur he should reply that no represen tations would be considered unless submitted through the Muscat Govern ment. No further enquiries have, however, been made from Sur and the letter has remained unacknowledged. His Highness informed me that he thought Shaikh Ali was waiting to see what reply the British authorities were going to give and that this was one of the reasons why the discussions with him had proved abortive and the Amir had maintained his recalcitrant attitude. His Highness asked if I would send a reply refuting the claim to independence and calling on the Amir to refrain from interfering on the coast. I asked His Highness to let me have in writing the exact tenor of the reply he wished me to give and also enquired whether he would prefer that the reply should be sent through the Muscat State authorities. His Highness said he would do so and I am expecting a letter from him on the subject shortly but stated that it would be preferable that I should write to the Amir direct instead of through the Muscat authorities. I propose therefore on receipt of His Highness’ communication to address letter to the Amir calling on him to abstain from anv interference at Sur and informing him that he has no right to issue passports, etc. I am not very hopeful that this letter will have much effect but it will, at any rate, fill in the time till a definite decision is arrived at regarding the measures to be taken at Sur, and the Amir will have been seriously warned before more drastic measures are resorted to : also, His Highness will know that something is being done in the matter and will be encouraged to contain his soul in patience for a short time longer. 6. After we had concluded our discussion of Sur affairs I asked His Highness somewhat pointedly whether there were any other matters which he wished to discuss and to my surprise he stated that there were none and accordingly after a few platitudes I took my leave. 7. It is difficult to account for His Highness’ apparent change of attitude and intention and I do not think that he has altogether given up his intention to abdicate. I am inclined rather to think that in view of the tact that anew Political Resident has come to the Gulf and one who has never formerly held the post of Political Agent at Muscat or taken anv part m Muscat affairs, and who may possibly hold the post for a somewhat longer period than some of his immediate predecessors, His Highness is ’ j \12 &lt;0 disposed for the time being to adopt a waiting attitude, and to see whether the new Resident will be able to do something to remedy Ins tanaea grievances, before finally and definitely abdicating. ts c e^ire (•ate is, I believe, largely due to his alleged grievances against the British Government and their local representatives in the past. 1 c nn ^s an opportunity offered for recovering inland Oman after the repulse )&gt; Indian troops of Isa Bin Saleh’s attack on Muttrah m 1915 and that it was the British Government who refused to allow him to take advantage of it thus humbling him before Isa bin Saleh with whom and his lannB tie has a long-standing blood feud, and he further considers that he has not been adequately supported over Sur affairs. If the two matters to which he attaches importance, namely, the re-habilitation of the finances of ms state and the re-establishment of his authority on the coast, can he settled to his satisfaction, I have hopes—though it is much too soon yet to express a definite opinion—that His Highness may take a renewed interest in the affairs of his state and that it may be possible to ward off for some years at any rate the long-threatened abdication. 8. Just as I was in the course of drafting this despatch I received a copy of letter No. P. 6148 of the 28th November 1929, from the India Office to you [Serial No. (4)], and am glad that His Majesty’s Government are fully apprised of the necessity for the increase of the customs tariff. I am at once consulting the Political Agent as to the possibility of increasing' the tariff on goods other than those covered by the terms of the treaties- with America, France and the Netherlands. Should this be feasible, I would Strongly urge that the enhanced tariff should be brought into effect as soon as possible and that negotiations should then be opened with France and the United States to obtain their agreement to the levy of a similar duty on any goods which may be imported from those countries. At present the state cannot pay its way : and even the Levy Corps which is essential for its defence cannot be maintained at full strength. With the additional funds thus obtained this could be done while some money would he available to enable His Highness to entertain in suitable style and to show customary hospitality to the tribal Shaikhs in the interior, thereby increasing his influence and perhaps, in course of time, enabling him to gain some measure of authority. 9. As regards Sur, the British Government have always undertaken to maintain the authority of the Muscat State on the coast while refusing to be drawn into quarrels in the interior. It seems essential in pursuance of this policy to re-establish the authority of the Sultan at Sur. His Highness’ suggestion that air action should be combined with a naval bombardment sounds, perhaps from a purely utilitarian point of view, somewhat ridiculous : I believe however that the moral effect would be considerable. I met the Senior Naval Officer at Hen jam on the 19th of December and discussed the matter with him. He expressed the view that there would be no difficulty in knocking down the customs house established by the Amir of Jaalan without damaging the rest of the town since it was an isolated building, and was also inclined to agree that the presence of a flying boat would have a great moral effect. I could consult the Air Officer Commanding if so desired and let von know his views. If, as I anticipate, my letter to the Amir of Jaalan has no effect then I suggest that the Sultan of Muscat should proceed to Sur in his own yacht accompanied by the Political Agent on hoard one of His Majesty’s sloops and, if possible, a flying boat. The Sultan would then open negotiations with the Shaikh of the Beni Bti Ali and unless the latter agreed finally to abandon all his pretentions to interference in Sur affairs, His Hio-hness would be at liberty to call on His Majesty’s ship and a living boat, through the Political Agent, to destroy the customs house after due warning I believe the presence of the Sultan supported by the armed naval and air \ forces of the British Government would finally convince the Amir of i Jaalan that His Majesty’s Government were in earnest and that he must abandon his pretentions to complete independence of Muscat and mustLc99FD withdraw to his native hills. The Sultan, with a state that was at any rate solvent, a little money in his treasury to enable him to maintain his position as an Arab ruler, and his authority to some extent re-established, and confident that he could rely on the support of His Majesty’s Govern ment in the future, might change his whole outlook towards life, and con tinue to occupy the Muscat throne for many years to come. Even if he did not do so and we were ultimately compelled to agree to his abdication, these measures would enormously facilitate the task of his young and in experienced son and enable him to commence his reign in more favourable circumstances than would at present be the case. Both on account of the position of Muscat at the entrance of the Gulf and of the projected air route it would seem essential to maintain the stability of the state, and l would therefore urge that we should strike while the iron is hot and that an early decision should be taken on these two questions. 10.

Letter from Foreign Office, to India Office. No. E. 6207 ; 166] 91, dated the 31st January 1930. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to inform you that your letter No. P. 6567 of the 27th November [Serial No. (4-A.)], regarding the proposed increase in the tariff of the State of Muscat, has engaged his attention. 2. It is of course impossible to foretell what will be the attitude of the French and United States Governments towards a proposal that they should agree to such a revision of their treaties with Muscat as will permit of a higher duty than five per cent, being levied on goods carried in French and American vessels. Mr. Henderson, however, sees no reason to antici pate that such objections as they may raise will prove insuperable, or to fear, in the present case, a repetition*of the difficulties experienced before the war in obtaining the consent of the French Government to the regula tions for the prevention of the illicit trade in arms in the Sultanate (cf., P. G. 13, pages 45 and 46). He would, therefore, should Mr. Secretary Benn so desire, be prepared to approach the French and United States Governments in the matter, and he concurs in the proposal, put forward in paragraph 7 of your letter under reply, that the Sultan of Muscat and Oman should he moved formally to request His Majesty’s Government to take action accordingly.3. On the other hand the suggestion put forward in paragraph 5 of your letter, that the important duties on goods other than those covered by the treaties between Muscat and the United States of America, France and the Netherlands, should be raised forthwith, appears open^to consider able objection. Were this proposal adopted, France and the United States (and consequently the Netherlands) would in effect obtain a privileged position in Muscat trade as against other Powers. Any subsequent request for the consent of the French and United States Governments to an increase in the maximum duties provided for in their treaties, would there fore amount to a request for the abandonment by them of the privileged position thus obtained, and it would, in Mr. Henderson's opinion, be more difficult to approach those Governments in the manner suggested, after the tariff had been raised in respect of goods not covered by their treaties than it would be to do so while they are, as at present, in a position of equality with other Powers, and while the suggestion is merely one for raising duties all round. 4.

In the opinion of the Foreign Office there is no reason to antici pate that French and American objections will prove insuperable, and, on strength of statements by Sultan, reported in paragraph No. 3 of Biscoe's despatch to you of December 28th [Serial No. (6)], I am asking Foreign Office to make immediate representation. But please secure formal letter from Sultan inviting us to take action on these lines. 2.

We appreciate force of Foreign Office objec tion to proposal in paragraph 5 of letter of November 27th [Serial No. (4-A.)] on which we are still awaiting Resident’s comments, and until we hear from him, we will defer our final recommendations. We shall be glad, meanwhile, to be informed of reception accorded by France and America to Foreign Office representation. We are repeating to you separately for information, our reply to Biscoe’s despatch of December 28th on Sur [Serial No. (6)]. Of course we should refer to you before authorising any naval action. The object which we have in mind in questions which we are putting to Biscoe is that we are considering the experience or otherwise of post poning repayment of the four instalments of Muscat loan still due and devoting money to increase of State forces, the increase to be used to garrison Sur and to secure Sur customs revenue.( 11 ) Tfxegham P., to the Secretary of State for India, No. 752-S., dated the 9th March 1930.

M. Charge d’Affaires, Washington. No. My Lord, Sir, The State of Muscat and Oman, in South-Eastern Arabia, with which His Majesty’s Government are in special relations, has suffered for a period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. After much careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only be effected bv an increase in the rate of the tariff on imported goods, and that it is ‘ important, in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State, that this proposed increase should take effect with the least possible delay. 2. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyond a. rate of five per cent, is, however, limited by Article 3 of the Treaty between Muscat and the United States of America of 1833, and by Article 10 of the Treatv between Muscat and France of 1844. Copies of the texts ‘ of these articles are enclosed herein. Unless therefore the United States Governments will consent to waive their rights to a maximum tariff of five per cent, under these treaties, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedv. -3' J 11 c ' r c u pistances the Sultan desires that the Governments of the United States of America and France should he approached with a view to seeunmr from them at the earliest possible moment such a waiver of their rights under the articles of the two treaties referred to above as will allow of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat rate of five per cent. Since there has been no French Consular renresentative at Muscat for some years past, and United States interests there are in charge of the Government of India’s Political Agent, His Highness h requested that His Majesty’s Government should take up the matter wit the two Governments concerned on his behalf. til 4. I transmit to Your Exppllenpv you herewith a memorandum setting forth in greater detail the reasons which have impelled the Sultan to make this request, and arguments in its support, and I shall he glad if vou will address a note to the Government to which you are accredited based on the material17 contained in this memorandum, and will urge them to give the matter their early and favourable consideration. You may further consider it French Government in this matter, to desirable, in approaching the United States draw their attention to the fact that— (1) French interests in Muscat are now almost negligible. (2) United States trade with Muscat appears now to be of very slight importance. Should the Government be prepared in principle to consent United States to this modification of their treaty rights, the question of the best method of giving legal effect to the modification of the releA^ant treaty provision can be subsequently considered. 5. Instructions in a similar sense are being sent to His Majesty’s Charjre d’Affai res in Washington . Ambassador in Paris Copy. (E.-6207|166|91) United States : Article 3. “ Vessels of the United States entering any port within the Sultan’s dominions shall pay no more than five per cent, duties on the cargo landed, and this shall be in full consideration of all import and export duties, tonnage, license to trade, pilotage, anchorage, or any other charge whatever. Nor shall any charge be paid on that part of the cargo which shall remain on board unsold and re-exported. Nor shall any charge what ever be paid on any vessel of the United States which may enter any of the ports of His Majesty for the purpose of refitting, or for refreshments, or to inquire the state of the market ”. Copy. (E.-6207|166)91) France : Article 10 : No duty exceeding five per cent, shall be levied on goods imported MEMORANDUM. since the conclusion of the treaties ites and h rench governments, under s carried in American and French Ue39FDDuring the intervening period the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat have steadily diminished, owing principally to (1) the loss of their sea-power and overseas dominions ; (2) the introduction of steamers into the Persian Gulf and the abandonment of Muscat as an entrepot for trade ; (3) the arrest of the prosperity of the country and its gradual impoverishment owing to the persistent drought in the interior. In the last fifteen years, in particular, the general economic conditions of the country has deteriorated to an alarming extent. The date crop, Oman’s primary source of wealth, has greatly declined in value as a result of the continued failure of the rains. There has in addition been a fall in the value of the country’s produce since the war, and a fall in the value of the Maria Theresa dollar, Oman’s principal currency, in sympathy with the silver marker fin 1922 the dollar exchange was reckoned at Rs. 200 (two hundred rupees) as against Ps. 123 (one hundred and twenty-three rupees) in 1929]. Moreover the depressed conditions of the pearl industry in recent years has reacted unfavourably on the finances of Muscat, since Bahrein and Dibai are one of her principal markets. The following figures for the four years 1925-1928 show the pro gressive decrease in the customs receipts, which are, and must remain, Muscat’s principal source of revenue :— Rs. 1925 1926 1927 1928 774,410 677,023 651,279 .. 635,583 The result of this steady diminution in the resources of the govern ment has been that, at a time when, if the State is to be administered in accordance with the changed conditions and improved standards of the present day, considerable increase of government expenditure is required, it has been necessary on the contrary to effect the most drastic economies, and to cut down expenditure to a figure at which it is no longer possible to maintain the administration even at its present level. To such an extent has restriction of outlay been essential that, for some years past, it has been necessary to eliminate from the budget all expenditure upon public works, and the Sultan has been unable to shew to the important tribal Sheikhs of tin interior the traditional hospitality which plavs so important a part in maintaining: his authority and prestige. ,, This financial strigency is leading to an increasing deterioration of the efficiency of the administration and is exercising a marked effect upon the Sultan s control over the country. Indeed it may be said to be threaten ing the stability of the State.19 Tn these circtmistances the Sultan of Muscat has expressed to desire that the United States and French governments should be requested to release him from the limitation upon the rate of the Muscat tariff imposed by the treaties with the United States and France of 1833 and 1844 res pectively. This request, it is felt, may legitimately he considered only reasonable in view of complete change of conditions, both in regard to the revenues and economic resources of Muscat and Oman, and in regard to the necessities imposed by the improved standards and increased cost of modern administration. Moreover the removal of this limitation would be only in accordance with the changed conceptions of the conditions which should govern the relations between independent, friendly countries, in conformity with which Tariff Autonomy has recently been granted to other Asiatic States.

After compliments. The necessity has arisen for increasing the customs duties of our State for revenue purpose. These are at present limited to 5 per cent, by Treaty relations with the Governments of Great Britain, the U. S. A. and of France. We shall be grateful if His Britannic Majesty’s Government will approach the Governments of U. S. A. and France respectively on our behalf to obtain a revision of those clauses of (I) Treaty of Amity and Commerce between U. S. A. and His Highness Syyed Said, dated 21st September 1833, (II) Treaty of Commerce between the Imam of Muscat and The King of the French dated 4th Februarv 1846 that impose the present 5 per cent, restriction. A revision of the Treaty of Commerce with His Majestv The Queen of Government of Britain and Ireland dated 1839 is also desired in this sense. There is no intention on our part to differentiate in favour of or against any nation and it is intended that the Powers in question will continue to receive “ most favoured nations ” treatment. And you are aware of the actual facts which make it necessarv for treaty revision in this matter. *20 ( 16 ) (Received on 6th April 1930, with Political Secretary's letter No. 12, dated the 20th March 1030.)

This steady diminution of resources has been the cause of increasing anxiety, At a time when, if the state is to be administered in accordance with the changed conditions and the improved standards of the present day, considerable increase of government expenditure is required, it has on the contrary been necessary to effect the most drastic economies and to cut down expenditure to a level at which the efficiency of the administration is impaired to a degree which may be said even to be threatening the stability of the state.8. This situation can ottly be remedied by augmenting the state revenue* and the only means by which it appears possible to effect this successfully is an immediate increase in the rate of the import duty.

I have the honour to inform you, under instructions, from His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that the State of Muscat and Oman, in South Eastern Araoia, with which His Majesty’s Govern, ment in the United Kingdom are in special relations, has suffered for a period of several years from a condition of increasing financial stringency, and a critical situation has now arisen which calls for an immediate remedy. After much careful consideration of the problem, the Sultan and his advisers have reached the conclusion that an improvement in the financial position of the State can only be effected by an increase in the rate of the tariff on imported goods, and that it is important, in the interests of the prosperity and good government of the State, that this proposed increase should take effect with the least possible delay. The right of the Sultan of Muscat to raise the tariff of the State beyon—d a rate of five per cent, isj however, limited by Article 3 of the Treaty between the United States and Muscat of 1833, in accordance with which ’'vessels of the United States entering any port v/ithin the Sultan’s dominions shall pay no more than five per cent, duties on the cargo landed”. Unless therefore the United States Government will consent to waive its rights under this Treaty, no general increase in the tariff will be practicable, and it will be impossible to adopt the suggested remedy. In these circumstances the Sultan desires that the United States Government should be approached with- 2 - with a view to secure at the earliest possible moment such a waiver of its above mentioned rights as will allow of a general increase in the Muscat tariff above the present flat rate of five per cent. Since the United States interests ip Muscat are in charge of the Govern ment of India’s Political Agent, His Highness has request ed that Hi a Majesty’s Government should take up the matter with the United States Government on his behalf. Conditions have entirely altered since the con clusion of the Treaty of 1833. During the intervening period the revenues of the Sultans of Muscat have steadily diminished, owing principally to (1) the loss of their sea-power and overseas dominions; (2) the introduction of steamers into the Persian Gulf and the abandonment of Muscat as an entrepot for trade; (3) the arrest of the prosperity of the country and its gradual impoverishment owing to the persistent drought in the interior. In the last fifteen years, in particular, the general economic conditions of the country have deterior ated to an alarming extent. The date crop,' Omarfs primary source of wealth, has greatly declined in value as a result of the continued failure of the rains. There has in addition been a fall in the value of the country's produce since the War, and a fall in the value of the Maria Theresa dollar, Oman ! s principal currency, in sympathy with the silver market ( in 1922 the dollar exchange was reckoned at two hundred rupees as against one hundred and twenty three rupees in 1929). MoreoverMoreover the depressed conditions of the pearl industry in recent years have reacted unfavourably on the finances of Muscat, since Bahrain and Dibai are one of her principal markets. fhe following figures for the four years 1925-1928 show the progressive decrease in the customs receipts, which are, and must remain, Muscat's principal source of revenue:- 1925 ... 1926 ... 1927 ... 1928 ... Frs. 774,410 ' 677,023 ' 651,279 ' 635,583 The result of this steady diminution in the resources of the government has been that, at a time v/hen, if the State is to be administered in accordance with the changed conditions and improved standards of the present day, considerable increase of government expenditure is required, it has been necessary on the contrary to effect the most drastic economies, and to cut down expenditure to a figure at which it is no longer possible to maintain the administration even at its present level. To such an extent has restriction of outlay been essential that, for some years past, it has been necessary to eliminate from the budget all expenditure upon puo.L.ic works, and the *jultan has seen unable to show to the important tribal Shaikhs of the interior the traditional hospitality which plays so important a part in maintaining his authority and prestige. This financial stringency is leading to anan increasing deterioration of the efficiency of the administration and is exercising a marked effect upon the Sultan’s control over the country. Indeed it may he said to he threatening the stability of the State. 'fhe problem of improving the finances cf/the State has therefore received the most attentive consideration and every possible means of remedying the situation has been examined hy the Sultan and his native and European 0 advisers. As a result it has become clear that the onl^, course, which holds out any prospect of success, if to increase the rate of the customs duty, and moreover that such a step should he taken with the minumum of delay. It is understood that an increase of the flat rate of five per cent ad vc&amp;orem to one of seven and a half per cent(except upon alcohol and cigarettes, on which a tax of fifteen per cent would be levied) is at present contemplated. i t is scarcely necessary to point out that the rate of five per cent, fixed over three-quarters of a century ago is, in the light of modern tariffs, a very low one and that the new rates proposed are moderate. His Majesty’s Government feel little doubt that, having in view the complete change of conditions, both in regard to the revenues and economic resources of Muscat and Oman, and in regard to the necessities imposed by the improved standards and increased costs of modern administration, the United States Government will consider the Sultan’s request as reasonable, and will agree to release him from the limitation upon the rate of the Muscat tariff imposed by the Treaty of 1930. Should...Should the United States Government , as His l^ajesty’s Government earnestly hope, he prepared in principle to consent to this modification of their treaty rights, the question of the 'best method of giving legal effect to the modification of the relevant position can he subsequently considered. The matter, I would again mention, is regarded as one of considerable urgency. *****v ^ \ ' $£• flf » P &amp;f, dj 2y* s '^t*/ rf/t&lt;f Jtf/ Usv^Cutl^ /Wt4 / (cn^u!

DEPARTMENT OF STATE WASHINGTON, June 11, 1930. My dear Mr.Ambassador, You will recall our talk this morning about the situation in Muscat, our reference to the Secretary’s note to you on that subject of May 23, 1930, and your suggestion that the Sultan might, pending the conclusion of a new treaty, desire and almost need to make limited increases in the duties on imported goods in the interim. I have thought of that situation and it seems to the Department that in the event of such non- discriminatory increases in the interim, the Department probably would not have - and I do not see now how it could have - occasion to protest such limited interim non-discriminatory increases in duties on imported goods.

At the same time he could not conceive that the United States Government, about to raise their own tariff in so striking a measure, could possibly object to the action proposed in Muscat, therefore suggested that the Muscat Govern ment should, if they saw fit, raise their duties in the i manner suggested, in advance of treaty approval by the United States Government. He asked me whether I thought that this verbal notification should be enough to enable His Majesty’s Government so to proceed, or whether I should prefer it in writing. 2. I said that as we were dealing with formal treaty rights I thought it would be preferable to have it in some form on paper. At the same time I thanked him for the helpful attitude of the State Department,which, I said, would bring material assistance to a small and remote, but suffering community. I thought that the interests at stake being so small the technical irregularity he was proposing might iie Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., Et c •, etc., etc •,might rery possibly escape all notice. 3, Mr. Cotton said he would write to me accordingly. He thought he would probably say, in effect, that if His Majesty’s Gorernment or Vuscat chose to raise the tariff in advance of American treaty approval, the United States Government would see no reason to raise any protest.

The Treaty Division of the State Department, who have, in accordance with our request, got busy on a draft treaty, telephoned yesterday to enquire whether it should be drawn up as between the President of the United States and the Sultan or as between the President and His Majesty The King. On looking up the various treaties in 'Malloy’s Treaties, Conventions, etc., between the United States and other powers' the following situation is disclosed: The Treaty of 1833 was concluded, apparently, between a sea captain named Roberts, as Special Agent of the President of the United States, and the Sultan of Muscat (Malloy, page 1228). There appears to have been no later treaty between the United States and Muscat; but whereas in 1886 a 'Treaty as to duties on liquors and consular powers', in which reference is made to the 1833 treaty as affecting Zanzibar, was concluded between plenipotentiaries of the President of the United States and of the Sultan of Zanzibar, (Malloy, page 1899), three further treaties affecting Eastern Department, Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.affecting the relations between the United States and Zanzibar, of 1902, 1903 and 1905, were all concluded between planipotent iariee repress rting the President of the United States and His Majesty The King, acting in the name of the Sultan of Zanzibar (Malloy, pages 784 to 787 and 795) . Perhaps some change took place in the status of Zanzibar between 1886 and 1902 by which His Majesty’s Goverrment became responsible for the foreign relat ions of that protectorate, and perhaps no such change has taken place in the status of Muscat. The analogy of Zanzibar therefore gives us no clear indication as to whether the treaty now being drawn up should be concluded between the President and the Sultan or between the President and The King. The Treaty Division of the State Department are at present making out their drM'ft as between the President and the Sultan of Muscat, but we understand that they have no fixed views on the subject,that they would of course be ready to alter thdfc draft as the result of further correspondence, but that they would just as soon draw it up in the first instance in accordance with our wishes. It might therefore save trouble if you were to send us a short telegram indicating what your wishes are on this point. Yours ever Chanceryg^IIHNTIAI lA/V'JJJ Nc, 622 -3. of 1930.

No.5190/433/91) enclosing an enquiry from the Chancery of the Washington Embassy as to whether the new Treaty to replace Article 3 of ‘the Treaty of 1833 between the U.S.A. and Muscat should be drawn up as betv/een the President of the U.S.A.and the Sultan of Muscat or as between the President and H.M.the King. I now write to say that we agree with Varner's suggestion that the Treaty ought to be oetween the Pres id ent and the Sultan. His Highness is still an independent Ruler, who controls his own foreign relations, and in the present instance we are acting merely as his agents, in virtue of a written request from him, based on the absence of any Regular Muscat! representative at Washing ton and Paris. ihe analogy of uan^ibar, which has been a British Protectorate since 1920, is not of course a true one.

Much of the correspondence relates to potential issues that this proposed increase could cause with the United States of America and France due to treaties those two countries previously agreed with the Sultan of Muscat.In addition to internal correspondence between British officials, the file also contains a limited amount of correspondence with US and French diplomats and one letter in Arabic (with English translation) from the Sultan of Muscat, Taymūr bin Fayṣal bin Turkī Āl Bū Sa‘īd(folios 52-53).In addition to correspondence, the file contains the following documents:'Note on the Financial Aspect of Our Policy [in Muscat]' 1928 (folios 5-6)'List of the monthly allowances paid by the Muscat Govt. to the Frontier Shaikhs. 1927' (folio 48)Draft revised treaty between the United States of America and the Sultan of Muscat (folios 120-121).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000289#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
