The general situation may be recapitulated. Muscat is the recognised centre of the trade. The situation there is governed by the fact that the Sultan has commercial treaties with the United States of America (1833), and with France (l'S-14), both of which contain free trade clauses 0 which require amendment if the arms trade is to be suppressed linally. Also, the Dutch have a ' most-favoured-nation ^ treaty with .Muscat. Hie Sultan's international position is further regulated by the joint Anglo- French Declaration of 1862,t by which the two Governments undertook reciprocally to respect His Highness's independence. On the greater part of the Persian Gulf littoral a general prohibition of the arms tralhc is in force. The import of arms into Persia was prohibited * Extract from Treaty with United States of America (1833) :— The citizens of the United States shall have free liberty to enter all the ports of His Majesty Syud Sueed Bin Sultan with their cargoes of whatever kind the said cargoes may consist, and they shall have liberty to sell the same to any of the subjects of the Sultan . .

Aby a Decree of 188r ::: ' (re-affirmed by a law of 1900), while in 1897 the Persian Government authorised British ships of war to seize and confiscate arms destined for Persian ports. Agreements prohibiting the trade in their respective territories and conferring powers of search, &amp;c., on British ships were concluded with the Sheiks of Bahrein (1898). :i: ' and Koweit (1900),* and with the Trucial Chiefs (1902).* The import of arms into Turkey is also prohibited. The promontory of El Katr and the coast immediately adjoining it are the only exceptions to the general rule of prohibition of the trade in arms in the perimeter of the Persian Gulf west of Ras Musandim. In 1898 the Sultan of Muscat agreed to prohibit the export of arms from his territory to India and Persia (where their import is illegal) and empowered British ships to act on his behalf in enforcing this prohibition. But (1) the import of arms into Muscat, and (2) their export to other destinations than India or I 'ersia remained unchecked. The result has been to make Muscat the chief emporium for arms for the whole of the Middle East. Rifles and ammunition were till recently imported in large quantities from Europe and distributed in local coasting vessels throughout the Gulf littoral. Formerly the main channel of distribution was from Muscat to Persian Mekran, and thence up country to Afghanistan and the north-west frontier of India. Latterly, however, this route has been rendered dangerous and proportionately unprofitable by the stringency of the naval blockade, and the arms appear now to be mainly smuggled to Katr (see above), and thence across to the Persian coast of Laristan. The Persian authorities have throughout shown themselves quite iucapable of checking the traffic in their territory. The distribution of modern arms of precision throughout the tracts lying on the north-west frontier of India is a serious matter for Great Britain. Many attempts have been made by His Majesty's Government to obtain by diplomatic means a 'free hand ' at Muscat for the suppression of the arms traffic, the obvious course for securing this being the abolition of free trade in arms at Muscat. At the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-09 an effort was made to obtain the desired freedom of action. The United States delegates and the Dutch declared themselves ready to forego their treaty rights so far as the trade in arms was concerned, provided that the other treaty Powers—France and Great Britain—did the same. France, however, held out against all offers, and on 31st December 1909 the Conference broke up without any settlement in respect of Muscat having been effected. Negotiations of a fitful kind have been entered into more than once since that date on the basis of various territorial concessions and exchanges. In return for the renunciation by France of her rights under the Treaty of 1844 and the joint Declaration of 186^ the Government of India were prepared to let His Majesty's Government offer the cession to France of territory in the neigh bourhood of Pondicherry amounting in area to 138 square miles, with a population of 98,000, and a revenue of 2| lakhs (18,333^.) The Government of India made it a point, however, that any cession of territory on these lines should be part of an exchange which would give to Great Britain Chander- nagore (a dangerous centre of sedition) and the scattered loges whose value has been estimated at 20 years' purchase as Us. 85,000 (5,6602.). {See paragraph 136, and Appendix XXIII). Nothing has come of negotiations on this basis or on any other. After the failure of the Brussels Conference it was decided to take steps to suppiess the traihc so lar as we were in a position to do so without violating treaty rights, and towards the end of 1909 a rigid naval blockade was started. It met with considerable success (see Appendix XIV. of Memorandum of June 1910). Apart from the arms actually captured it reduced the dealers 1 profits to such an extent that all the European firms save one have closed their doors. It was, however, a most expensive operation, so much so that it was recognised from the first that it would only be a temporary measure to be enforced till a permanent arrangement affording satisfactory control ol the trade was made. An attempt was made early in JlO to induce I ranee to agree to a total prohibition for one year as an experiment. This project, which was not thought to be of great value by * See Appendices to Memorandum of June 1910.the officers stationed in the Gulf, failed. From time to time since then negotiations have been started to induce France to waive her treaty rights, but in view of repeated failures in this direction, attention began to turn to other means of solving the problem. In the following pages an attempt is made to furnish a history of the blockade and other measures lor the suppression or control of the traffic in arms from June 1910 to olst December 1912. A word may be ^aid here in explanation of the arrangement o.'' the record of these events. From June 1910 (at which date roughly the previous memorandum is closed), down to the early summer of 1911, the history of the arms traffic question consists of various incidents of the blockade, and various aspects of our relations with the rulers of the Persian Gulf coast districts, interspersed with recurring efforts to negotiate with France a permanent settlement of the whole question. This period, June 1910—May 1911, has therefore been treated as a whole in Chapter L, events being recorded in something like chronological order. To preserve this order the chapter is divided into three sections, the last of which deals solely with the exceptional land operations in Mekran in April and May 1911, and the causes leading thereto. From about May 1911 the efforts to arrive at some permanent arrange ment about the arms traffic at Muscat have overshadowed all other events. These have therefore been treated in a chapter apart (Chapter 11.;, the first section of which is devoted to negotiations with France and their failure ; the second to the arrangements made in concert with the Sultan of Muscat, and to certain events and questions closely connected therewith ; the third and fourth to the negotiations with France, and to the question of compensation, which both follow from the Sultan's arrangements. Other occurrences which have taken place between the early summer of 1911 and the end of December 1912 in the Gulf, e.r/., blockade incidents, are shown in Chapter 111., while matters with no definite chronological position, e.g., the financial aspect, prize money, the nature of the arms trade, are contained in Appendices, which also contain certain tabular statements, &amp;c. For convenience ol reference the numbering of the Appendices and of the paragraphs in the text has been made continuous with that in Mr. Shuckburgh's memorandum of 1910, and accordingly any reference to a paragraph earlier than 79, or to an appendix earlier than XV., is a reference to the earlier memorandum. CHAPTER I. Section I.— Events June to November 1910. 79. The proposal of the Government of India (paragraph 78), that the blockade should be continued till Continuance of the Blockade. December 1910, was referred to the Foreign Office, who concurred in it ' provided that no satisfactory arrange ment with France as to Muscat is arrived at before then/ Sanction was accordingly given on 26th September 1910, but the blockade was continued without a break in anticipation of the sanction finally given. right to 80. Two questions came up for consideration in connection with the blockade during the summer of 1910. 1 he first was with regard to our seize on Persian territory arms which were landed from vessels flying the French flag. The Government of India asked the Xaval Commander- in-Chief to give his views on the subject. Admiral Slade replied at length in a letter dated 25th July. He maintained that the question involved two issues:— (a) When the arms embarked are the property of French subjects. In this case, France 'having full extra-territorial poueis in Peisia, Right of capture of arms landed in Persian territory from vessels under the French flag. 1245/10. 3970/10.' would be quite within her rights in objecting to any British ' action which would affect property belonging to French subjects.' (h) When the arms are the property of native arms dealers who have merely embarked them in a dhow flying the French flag for the purpose of evading British cruisers. In this second case, the Admiral was of opinion that France could not ' by any possible interpretation of international law 1 claim to extend the doctrine that u the flag covers the goods to arms when once they have left the dhow flying her flag. In any case, when once the cargo changed hands, e.g., into the possession of the Afghans or their agent, the protection of the French flag would be indubitably lost. If this were not so, we could never have the right to to touch any arms, even captured far inland by, say, a column from Robat, if it could be shown that they had crossed the Gulf in a French dhow. On the grounds of expediency, the Admiral strongly demurred to refraining from seizing arms landed from French vessels. No actual case had then arisen, but to him it seemed certain that ' if we are ever forced to allow ' arms carried in French dhows to enter Persia free, as soon as this has once ' been done, and the traders have found it out, the whole trade will go that ' way without our being able to stop it, and all the money spent will then be thrown away.' Having once committed ourselves to the action of seizing arms in Persian territory we cannot ' draw back and allow the Afghans to ' come down openly and take them away before our eyes, without risking our ' prestige in the Gulf,' whose inhabitants would at once conclude that France was the greater Power. 81. Viscount Morley, while admitting the technical correctness of tlie t j■ r\(xx t T* ■ rwn oxi Admiral's view, doubted its expediency, India Othce to Foreiern Office, 8th • , • •■t.,.,. / September 1910. since such action might cause the ' whole question of our right to effect ' seizures in Persian territory to be raised by the French Government in ' such a form as would make it impossible for us to continue that most ' convenient practice.' 1 No objection however, would, it was held, be raised in the case of a seizure of arms near the Afghan frontier by, possibly, a column acting from Robat. Sir G. Barclay, His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, was consulted on the point. He thought it inadvisable even to sound the French Minister on the subject, but felt convinced that the right to protest against seizure of arms from Afghans in Persian territory must belong only to the Persian Government. On 13th September Admiral Slade issued orders to his force that when a gun-running dhow was sighted under French colours she should be followed and the arms be seized on shore as soon as they passed into the hands of Afghan dealers. The decision of His Majesty's Government was communicated to the Tr . . t .^ i &gt; j i o . Government of India, 'that it was Viscount Morley s teleeram, 3rd October u- r ^ui. i jip 1910 6 inexpedient that any arms landed from ' French dhows should be seized near ' the coast, at all events till such quantities are landed, that the success of the blockade is endangered,' and the Kaval Commander-in-Chief was instructed to act accordingly. It was felt that such action would avoid the possibility of complications with the French Government, who, however, ' would, strictly speaking, have no Locus standi ' if they did raise the question. 82. The second question of policy in connection with the blockade was • m -i. • i regard to our right of search in Kight ot Search in Territorial ^• i . t ^ m • i Waters of Trucial Chiefs. Hi 0 . ^ 11 ^ r 011 f waters of the Prucial . C hiefs.

In stating in March their conviction of the importance of maintaining Wireless Stations at Debai, Bahrein, ^ ie blockade, the Government of India and Bushire. recommended that to promote its 1(1 efficiency three wireless stations should be established at Debai, at Bahrein, and at Bushire. The cost of the actual installations only was estimated at Rs. 44,000, Additional expenditure for buildings, establishment, &amp;c., would be, at Debai, Us. 7,075; at Bahrein, Rs. 6,275 ; and at Bushire, Rs. 1,075 ; making a total of Rs. 58,425. Against this an income from public use of Rs. bOO per mensem might be expected, according to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, Ijieutenaiit-Coloriel Cox to Government who ba8ed estimate on the reee ip ts ox India, ^4tn June. i » i i i • i i at Bunder Abbas; and it was hoped that the strategic value of the stations might lead to a reduction in the cost of the blockade, by admitting the reduction of the number of launches employed. Admiral Slade could not confirm this 19tlf Juiip 11 S ' la(le 10 &lt;,,,Vei 1111611 ' ( fl IH ' ,a ' ^ 0 P e ' but urged the desirability of erecting the stations, as he anticipated that in the next 'season' the arms traffic would have been driven further up the Gulf, with the consequence that the Naval base would have to be moved from Muscat (where there was cable communication with the wireless station at Jask), and that then the three additional installations would com pensate for the loss in power of communication involved by the change of base. In connection with the station at Bushire, the question arose whether the consent of the Persian Government was Persian consent not needed. no ^ required for its ereciion ; but the Memorandum by Mr. Kirk, Director-in- difficulty was avoided by reference to Ghief Mo-Enronean Telegraph Depart- the ana j case of j ask wh th ment, 7th July i9iU. . , • n • i • • i wireless installation was erected 'iiside the limits of the Indo-European telegraph station. The Persian Government would, however, have to be informed officially of the fait accompli at least, as on them would lie the onus of protecting the station, as in the case of the riots at Bushire in 1897.

Detention. receiving an allowance; this course was deprecated by the Agent to the (rovernor-'&gt;eneral in Hiduchistan, as from either of these places the detenu could escape to Afghanistan and return to Mekran with the full support of the Afghan dealers. Suggestions of the Andamans (with an allowance) and Bagdad as places of detention were dismissed, and in July the Oovernment of India instructed the Political Resident to hand him over to the Persian authorities for detention, with a grave warning as to the importance of his safe keeping , the} undertook to pay Rs. 200 per mensem for his maintenance provided he was kept at a safe distance from his own district. The Darya Begi undertook this and selected Bushire as his place of detention. In the meantime, though his capture and removal greatly impressed the majority of Baluch chiefs for the moment, it led to reprisals in the Jask district ; Mustafa Khan was driven, by one Dadulla (sre below, paragraph 92), working on his fears of Mir Barkat, to undertake a raiding campaign with the idea of effecting Mir Barkat's return by intimidation. Mustafa Khan was, however, brought in to Jask by the middle of June in a state of contrition. 90. Towards the end of August Mir Barkat escaped from Bushire, almost certainly with the I )arya Begi's con- ii. Escape. nivance, and was reported to be making his way back to the Biyaban coast. Almost ai once his adherents in Bivaban began a series of raids and disturbances. An attack was made on the Vice-Consular guard at Lingah, but was frustrated by the timely arrival of H.M.S. ' Odin ' with reinforcements. Mir Barkat himseit was reported to be looting at Dashgun. The Persian authorities were reported by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to be absolutely incapable of any effective action, and he proposed that matters should be taken into British hands; and towards the end of Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government g e pt em ber made a proposal in which of India, -'th SepteniiuM'. Rear-Admiral Slade concurred, to make a short expedition into the country north of Jask to disperse Mir Barkat s party. 9] This was opening up a new aspect of the blockade system, and the fact that a land expedition, different in scope iii. Suggested operations against aIK i intention from the previous recon- him. naissances and arms-raiding parties, was actually carried out, was due directly to Mir Barkat and the trouble that he and his supporters created with the Afghans in the interior of the Biya )an and Mekran coast districts. {See Section 111. of this chapter). 92 Mention was made in paragraph 89 of 1 &gt;adulla as one of Mir Barkat s most active adherents, fie was apprehended Dadulla r .nd Seyyid Abdur Rahim. • n j uue all( | handed over to the Persian authorities for detention at Lingah, and about the same time Seyyid Abdur Rahim was deported by Captain Craufurd to Dera Ismail Khan, as he was supposed to be an Afghan, and 'it was admitted that Afghans could be deported more easily than Persians ' ; he was subsequently found to be a Persian Baluchi and was sent back to Jask and there released.8 93. The difficulties which were found occasionally in dealing with the Koweit. Case of the dhow, 'Fath independent Sheikhs of the Gulf coast, el Khair' and keepingthem to their undertakings! s s .

I lie .^hi'ikli liail in March (paragraph (ilj undertaken to enforce his proclamation of May 1900, and to punish any nakhoda of Koweit found dealing m arms. In April an opportunity occurred. A notorious nakhoda, one Muhammad S ji I b I i , had been arrested previousiv by H M S 'Hyacinth;' but allowed to proceed. He then apparently illegally sold or engaged to sell, his dhow, the 4&lt; Fath el Khair,' to Messrs. Gogiiyer et Gie of Muscat. Phe Sheikh of Koweit applied to Muscat for Muhammad Saleh's extradition on the ground that he had defied the Sheikh's proclamation and his orders to his Muscat agents that no Koweit boom should leave that port with arms except with a written pennit from the British Political Aoent at Muscat. s On I'.lli April the ' Fath el Khair ' arrived at Koweit with Muhammad Saleh on board. She flew the French flag, and her papers showed her to belong to yoguyer. I he arms she carried were consigned to Gognyer's agent at. Koweit. Now that the moment for showing his authority had aimed, the Sheikh began to hesitate. Captain Shakespear, the Political Urncer at Koweit, urged him to arrest the as he had a right to do. As iegai ds the arms, though he had in virtue of the proclamation of 1900, a right to seize them, the more politic course, to avoid complications with the rieneli oi Museat dealers, was either to hold them pending reference to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, or send them on with the dhow to Hussorah or even hack to Muscat. A few days later it transpired that the Sheikh had accepted certain excuses oi Muhammad Saleh and let him go with the dhow the arms had been delivered to the agent after the usual duty of six dollars Pf 1 ' ia( ' ' ieei1 levied, and a certain number had been appropriated bv the Sheikh.

The Sheikh promised to do this, and further to refuse to recognise the French firm's agent. But again he hesitated, and Captain Shakespear finally confiscated the arms (301 Gras rifles and 30 100 rounds of ammunition), and lodged them in the Agency. The Sheikh then made an attempt to escape all responsibility, and to put the onus of the attair on the British Political Oilicer by getting him to give the dealer a receipt, i.e., to admit that the confiscation was made by him and not by the Telegram from Captain Sliakespear to ( aptain Shakespear of course Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, 12th May. reiused.

In August a capture of 25 rifles, 8 revolvers, and 39,834 rounds of ammunition was effected by Captain Mackenzie at Muharrag (a small island close to Mahrein) with the assistance oi the Sheikh of Bahrein. The trader implicated was one Yusuf Fakhru, a close friend ol Sheikh Esa and a rich and prominent merchant of Bahrein; owing to his influential position Captain Mackenzie had to take more direct action in the matter than he wished. As it was not politic lo imprison so prominent a person, the Sheikh fined him Rs. 4,000 on the advice of the Political Oliicer, and the arms were destroyed ; it was not safe to let the Sheikh confiscate them, as, having enough for his own purposes, he was quite capable of returning them to Yusuf.

In August Lieutenant- Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government | olouei ( ox visited him and had a of India 18tli September 1910. long conversation with him. Owing 1484/10. financial straits he was full of resentment of his position, and com plained bitterly at ' being bound by an antiquated treaty which was become an anachronism ' and wished to ' notify to the French that the ' arms tralfic was injurious to him and so complicated his relations with ' other Powers that he had no other course than to prohibit the import ' of arms. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox suggested a small loan as a temporary relief, but the Sultan thought this incompatible with his dignity, and pressed for a settlement of the whole question of the trade. Reference was then made to the case of the dhow ' Badil ' (paragraphs 51, m , -m, «-d a^' 52, 53) captured by H.M.S. 'Fox' in e i ow a i. November 1901*. The detention of the cargo the Sultan felt to be an insult to nis position as an independent ruler; he further resented certain cases of arrest in the harbour. It was pointed out that we had by his proclamation of January 1 ^98, (paragraph 8) a right to do this, but in practice retrained as far as possible, and w T ith regard to the ' Badil that it was clearly impossible to let him have the cargo while there was a possibility of his returning it to the dealers for export, while we were maintaining the blockade at enormous expense P. 328/10. * A statement furnished by the Sultan to Mr. Holland at Muscat showed that his Customs revenue from the arms imported into Muscat only from December 190H to November 1909 was as follows ;— 17th Dec. 1906—6th Dec. 1907 . 7th Dec. 1907—25th Nov. 1908. 26th Nov. 1908—14th Nov. 1909.

S. 198. C10 just to prevent this ; he was reminded that in due course the cargo would be returned or else its money value. 98. While wounded amour yropre was partly the cause of the Sultan's resentment, the more immediate reason was his financial straitness. This rendered it impossible to let him have t he ' Badil's cargo, as under the pressure of his obligations he was certain to tall into the temptation of realizing it at once. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox therefore suggested that, as he was clearly very hard hit, and as ' if we are likely to need his co-operation ' in any approaching bargain with France, it would be unwise to give His ' Suggested advance. ^Highness an altogether categorical relusai or unsympathetic reply, he might be granted at once an advance on the value of the cargo to the extent of 10s. per rifle and bs. per 100 cartridges, about Rs. 14,250 in all. 99. The Government of India approved Lieutenant-Colonel Cox's Telegram from Viceroy, 28th October argument and suggestion, and Sllb- 1910. mitted it for approval as a suitable lo44 10 - ad interim measure, ' unless there is a likelihood of a speedy settlement with France.' In reply to this the Government of India were informed that there was Earl of Crewe's telegram, 15th No- no prospect of negotiations with France, vember. and the suggested advance to the Sultan of Muscat was approved. As a matter of fact the Sultan refused it when ^ , offered, on the ground that ' eventually Telegram from V.ceroy, 26th December. the ams ^ have to be by him to owners ' ; it was surmised that he had borrowed from dealers and was under obligations tu them {see paragraph 119). 100. During the summer the Government of India had under cou- sideration the Question of compensation State of Trade in Arms at Muscat. t0 be , liade t0 France iu the event of a settlement being reached. In August they came to the conclusion that Government of India to Viscount Morley, it was 'not possible lor 1 ranee to 11th August 1910. ' argue that serious loss will be 1149 10. ' inflicted upon French industry (by ' prohibition) and on ihat ground to request compensation/' The Muscat trade reports for the last three years showed that French manufacturers were very slightly interested in the arms trade at Muscat; the French dealers' interest (especially M. Goguyer's) was of course, great, but the arms imported were chiefly of Belgian or English manufacture. In September Major Trevor, the Briiish Agent at Muscat, had an Major Trevor to Lieutenant-Colonel interview with M. Coulon, one of the 1910 ^~ t ' 1 ' Se ^ teni ^ ei 1 ' r 'h September French dealers. Previously the dealers being much hurt by the blockade, had been willing to sell at any reasonable sacrifice; M, Coulon himself had been trying to sell oil his stock of 2,000 rilles, but was only offered Rs, 15 per rifle : but now owing to persistent rumours of an approaching c/z/enic between the British and 1'rench Governments on the subject ol arms, they were holding on to their stock and even placing fresh orders in the hope of getting compensation. M. Coulon s firm had in fact made arrangements for ' winding up, but this had been countermanded. Another agent, M, Lagasse, representative of the Belgian firm MM. Baijeot et ( ie, went further and offered to sell his whole stock at cost price, viz., 1,557 rifles and guns, 493 pistols, and 553,000 cartridges for Us. 206,000. He had received orders from his principals previously to liquidate at any price; he had in fact failed like M. Coulon to get any reasonable offer. Now, however, Aj. Goguyer was continually talking about the entente and ' grosse indemnite,' and he therefore made this offer which would probably be cheaper to Government than any compensation, but was a very profitable solution of his immediate difficulty as he could not get anything like cost price in the market.101. On 4tli October the Government of India were informed that no Telegram from Secretary of State, 4th question of compensation was under October^ discussion. But by that time the agents in Muscat were in a less dithcult position. Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit had placed a large order for titles under a permit {see paragraph ( J4), and the Afghan dealers were also buying. Trade in fact, was brisk and the tension was relieved for the time. 102.

The question of the treatment of dhows flying the French flag by .. _ . British ships of war was, however, (li.) French dhows. discussed by His Majesty's and the French Government. The French Ambassador was instructed by his Government to offer to extend to the M. Cambon to Sir h.

The regulations of 1807 further admitted the right of search of suspect vessels; but M. Cambon declared that here the distinction between vessels engaged in slave trade—'operation toujours criminelle and vessels engaged in arms traffic, ' dont I'illegitimite resulte en certains cas seulement de mesures administratives on de decisions speeiales, ' must be clearly maintained. He was prepared to admit the right of our ships to 'verify the flag,' but no more. The Admiralty when consulted did not think the suggestion worth the risk involved by giving ships of war the wide powers conferred by the regulations Sir E. (irey to M. Gambou, Ibth ^ ^ieh mi i S t of necessity be Xmemu i. reciprocal with the other nations par ticipant in the agreement; and the suggested concession was not accepted. No other attempts at negotiations of any sort were made ; indeed they were precluded by domestic events at home in the winter 1910-11, and the prospect of a rapprochement with France over the arms traffic question appeared to be no nearer than before.

Having once committed ourselves ' to the policy of stopping arms, it would only add to our troubles in the ' near future if we were to allow the Afghans to think that there is any ' difficulty in the way of continuing that policy to the end. '12 The force necessary to resume the blockade with success was. the Admiral held, four cruisers, (three subsidised and one additional) seven launches, and the R.LM.S. ' Minto. He hoped that if the blockade was very successful at the beginning, it might be possible to reduce the number of launches to three, in February or March 1911.

On the same date Captain Hunt burned a second dhow— nakhoda Abdulla (against whom there were four previous offences) which was seized in Galeg ereek after landing a small consignment near Uapch.

As there were three previous offences against the nakhoda, the dhow was burned and he was apprehended. On the same day, 29th November, a second dhow, found abandoned in the Galeg river with cartridges on board, was burned. 109. The burning of the dhows implicated in gun-smuggling was a new departure, authorised by Admiral Slade The burning' of captured dhows. early in the autumn as a deterrent to gun-running uakhodas. The reasons for burning the dhows were cleai K explained to the natives, and the action undoubtedly was successful in persuading nakhodas that gun-running was not worth the risk.

' Small consignments'' are smuggled across from time to time, but even these ' have ceased to a great extent since 1 authorised the burning of such ' dhows as were notoriously engaged in smuggling.' 110. Other evidence, however, indicates that while the blockade did practically stop smuggling on the Arms trade forced further up the Mekran coast, the traffic continued further up the Gulf, whither indeed Sir E. Slade had prophesied it would be driven. {See paragraphs 83 and 183). A lar^e body of Afghans was reported towards the end of the year • , u to have been making apparently for Sir E.

On a recent occasion, 20th December, the Sheikh had been called upon by Lieutenant Noakes, R.N., in charge of a boat party, to cause a house to be searched, and after various excuses for delay, did so, but so perfunctorily as to make ' the operation a farce.' On 24th December the commander of the ' Hyacinth,' Captain J. D. Dick, R.N., learning that Lieutenant Noakes had been deceived and arms hidden from him on 20th, called the Sheikh to co-operate with a strong landing party in searching two houses. The Sheikh did not comply, and the search was begun. The Sheikli did not actually appear until the trouble had begun, and the impression conveyed was ' that he allowed trouble to commence either by intent or apathy, but that, when ' he saw it had gone too far, he exerted himself to stop it, and showed that ' he was able to control it when he chose.' Captain Dick's full report to the Commander-in-Chief bears out this impression. 113.

Accordingly on 30th December an Ultimatum to the Sheikh. ultimatum expiring in 48 hours was presented in writing, demanding (1.) The immediate replacement of the tide-pole and its retention as long as needed by the Officer Commanding His Majesty's ships stationed there. (^.) The acceptance of telegraph installation whenever considered necessary by the Government, in accordance with the provisions of the additional article 0 of the treaty of 4th May 1853. (3.) The delivery of 400 serviceable rifles, to be collected from the inhabitants. (4.) Payment of Us. 50,000 as a tine to be considered at the disposal of Government, and the retention or restoration of any part thereof to be affected by his acceptance of the two following further conditions ' which, however, are not part of the present ultimatum pending the concurrence of Government.' (5.) Acceptance of a British officer as agent with a small personal guard ; co-operation in finding him suitable quarters and accord of protection and friendly treatment. (6.) Acquiescence in the establishment of a sub-post office of the Indian Postal Department in exchange for the existing primitive and unsatisfactory postal arrangements, as at other ports on the Persian Gulf at which steamers call. With regard to conditions (b) and (6) the Admiral and the Resident agreed that ' political, commercial, and arms traffic requirements demand ' the appointment of a British officer at Debai. A proper post office is ' required by our traders, and the appointment of an agent would necessitate ' a small personal guard and the installation of wireless.' 114. On 1st January 1911 the Admiral reported that the Sheikh had complied with the four demands of the CommaiHler-in-Clnef to Admiralty, 1st ultimatunK The Admiral added that . anuaiy the recent incident shows that he is a ' weak ruler, and, while'not intractable or unfriendly himself, is coerced by ' a faction of truculent relations strongly opposed to any inconvenient ' increase of British influence.' lie therefore pressed the importance of installing a British agent; the installation to be effected if necessary by a force of 1,000 men including artillery and sappers, and in the last event to be accompanied by bombardment. 115.

The firm at once submitted an accusation against His Majesty's ships of having prevented trade at Katr and Khassab by threatening bombardment, also ' of having hindered the navigation of the dhow to the ' extent of putting her in danger of sinking, and in want of provisions and ' water, and have prevented her trading in places where hitherto commerce ' has been free. 1 ' They claimed Rs. 60,000 as compensation for loss of trade. The question of fact was referred to the naval authorities ; and, as was to be expected, the accusations were found to be totally unfounded.

This could be checked by an extension of the blockade district without increasing the naval force, but the latter would be greatly assisted by the suggested wireless installations at Bushire, Bahrein, and Debai (see para graph 84), and the effective smothering of the traflic could be effected without the aid of a large land force ' if the scope of operations is to be confined to the prevention of the entry of arms and animunition into Persia by sea.' Sir II. McMahon had however suggested a wider policy directed to the ' endeavour to restore peace and order in the whole coast districts of Persia, and this the Admiral felt would be at once the wisest and most thorough policy as ''the continuance of the arms traffic is only possible on account of the absence of order in the coast districts.' For this a force of 1,500 or 2,000 troops was required in two transports so as to act from different points simultaneously; such a force, while never out of touch with support from the sea, would be able to control the districts round Lar and Bunder Abbas, the Minab V T alley and the Bint and Geh districts ; it would strengthen the road guards and give the local iMirs confidence to act against Afghans or local brigands. In a further letter Admiral Slade said that Islam Khan and Seyyid Khan, Sardars ol Bint and Geh respectively, might be expected to assist in preventing the Afghans reaching the Naval Commander m-C luef, Kast coas ^ ^-[ e added that after the end of indies, to Government of India, 1 Itn . • i ^ i -i i a vu j December 1910.

Some such plan as this had been suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox as a measure for dealing with Mir Barkat and his looting expeditions {see paragraphs 90, 91). ll ) 4.

The Admiral was of opinion that they meant to tight and establish themselves in Baluchistan, and he pressed for immediate action on the lines suggested above. There was ample water and forage now, but in tw^o mirths' time it would not be available ; the local chiefs were friendly but would soon be forced by the Afghans to support them.

Any objection on the part of Persia could be checkmated by inviting their Government to co-operate.

Conversations with the French Ambassador took place. The French Government were disposed to make no concessions without receiving compensation in the Gambia. An increase of territory in India near Pondicherry would not suffice, and in French public opinion, would not ^ compensate even for the cession of Chandernagore which was so closely associated with the name of Dupleix. Sir £. Grey took the line that, so far as matters of senthnent were concerned, the cession of Gambia, or any part ot it, would raise as much outcry in England as the cession of Chandernagore would in France; and that His Majesty's Government was not prepared to bring Gambia into the question at all. 138. There appeared to ensue a deadlock in the progress of the negotiations. On 30th May, however. His Majesty's Government again raised the question with the French Ambassador, l ^Nuscount Morleys telegram, Ist April urging that French consent to the suppression of the arms traffic in the Persian Gulf would naturally be regarded as a fair set-off against the British consent (then given) to a renewal of the mandate to France and Spain to suppress the contraband trade in arms in Morocco. M. Cambon's reply was that we had no real interest in Morocco, and that the question in the Persian Gulf resolved itself into one of compensation for the French Government. It may be mentioned here that in view of the fact that only about half the total stock in Muscat was in French hands at the time (see Appendix XV., Table C.), 50,000L was the sum sug- ^® ce t 0 foreign Office, liih April g es ted by the Secretary of State for . ^ India as a first offer of cash compen sation to France, if the question of pecuniary compensation arose.

An impasse in negotiations for a definite 41 deal ' had apparently been reached in April over the question of the cession of the Gambia. In September, however, a new line for possible rapprochement was opened when M. de Selves handed Sir F. Bertie a memorandum containing three alternative proposals of exchange of territory. The cessions which France ^ q • v r a . i desired were in Nigeria and the Gold 1911 Bertie to Sir E. Grey, September Coast ^ according t0 t]|e extent of the cessions made there, she was prepared to make corresponding concessions in connection with Cheik- Said, Muscat, and certain islands in the Indian Ocean, and possiblv also in the Pacific. Cession of territory in India in return for compensation in the neighbourhood oi Pondicherry was not mentioned. Ml. Nothing apparently came of these proposals which, so far as the Persian Gulf was concerned, died a natural death. All attempts at a direct settlement with France had, one after the other, proved abortive, and no choice seemed left but the course suggested by Lieutenant-Colonel Cox of disregarding France and concerting with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangement for a satisfactory control of the trade. ii-—U Ith the Sultan of Oman. 142. As early as January 1910 it had been foreseen that the probability Negotiations with Sultan of Muscat „ effe f tin f 'I 16 desired suppression at for control of arms trade. -Muscat oi the re-export of arms by- exchange of interests with France, was extremely slight. An alternative scheme, whereby control of the traffic would be^ achieved, was concerted by Lieutenant-Colonel (then Major) ( ox, when in Lngland on leave. Put shortly, it amounted to an attempt to persuade the Sultan, by an offer of pecuniary compensation, to limit the export of arms from Muscat to consignments destined for other ports in Oman or other ' non-prohibited ' ports ; these to be guaranteed by a system ol passes, the control ol which should be in the hands of a British officer. Ain dhow which failed to produce such a pass, whatever her destination, was to be, ipso Jado, liable to seizure by His Majesty's ships, even in Muscat waters. 1 he scheme was communicated to the Foreign Office by 17th January 1910. ^ir R. Ritchie demi-officially. Sir E. 2952/10. Grey was prepared to support it as not rn of t 1QA A ^ -i intrinsically opposed to the French ' y ^ „ (Article IX.), and further was 'prepared to face the be followed up com P^ amts by the French Government, should the scheme It was understood that the plan, which aimed at securing control, if not ippression, of the arms trade without the previous consent of France,should not be adopted unless all prospect of an amicable settlement with France were lost. .As has been seen, 'fitful negotiations' towards this were made from time to time, but their ultimate success was so distant that the alternative plan outlined in January 1010, of dealing direct with Muscat was definitely taken up and steadily pushed forward. The Sultan, it will be remembered, was in great financial straits, and had even opened negotiations with one of the most prominent arms dealers, Ali Musa, whereby he was to receive a lump sum and a monthly allowance in return for the lease of the Oman customs (paragraph 110). This had been prevented by the advance to the feultan of I^s. 1 o.OOO liom Indian revenues. I i3. The Sultan had complained in December 1010 to the Political Agent (Major Trevor) of the burning of two dhows in November in Galeg River (see paragraph 108). 1 he action was explained and defended on the scort of the bad character borne by the two TKilihodcis, but the Sultan s niitation made it desirable to come to some permanent and satisfactory arrangement with him. A further cogent reason for pressing on action in this direction was afforded by the Sultan's change of attitude from neutrality towards I he illicit arms trade to active participation in it. It has been shown to what an extent he was delivered into the hands of the principal arms .. . dealers, especially Ali Musa. In April Sultan's active complicity. 1011, he was suspected of lending his Lieutenant-Colonel ('ox to Government yacht for the conveyance of arms from of India, 28th April 1911. one Oman port to another, whence they could be shipped with secrecy. In August the suspicion was definitely confirmed. In April his complicity Ditto, Ist September . . j n an other direction was also exposed. On 5th, 6th, and 7th April, II.M.S. 4&lt; Espiegle ,; captured three badans on the high seas south of Sohar, carrying Commander-in-Chief, Kast Imhes, to arms an( J ammunition amounting to Government of Indm. ■lek-gmra, 1-tl, ^ ^ g,, gyQ rolm( ] s . The ^ 1)11 ' vessels flew no flags, but carried ' passes ' signed by the Sultan, who apparently gave them blank to Ali Musa, who filled up as he wished the amount of the consignment. The captured badans sank in bad weather while in tow, and the Sultan complained to Lieutenant -Colonel Cox, on the ground that the capture had l&gt;een made within the three-mile limit. This was not the Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government caS0j and even had it been SO, His oi India, 2 m 1 i Apnl 1911. Majesty's ships would have had right on their side, though to preserve the Sultan's friendship they had refrained from making captures in his territorial waters. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox replied accordingly, and the incident was made the most of by him lor Government to decide on the attitude to be adopted in future towards the Sultan, I.e., whether to proceed with the blockade and disregard him, or to make a definite effort to procure his assistance and detach him from the dealers. As has been seen, the latter course was adopted, and this coui^c of action may be said to have started from this incident. 144 As regards the line to be adopted with the Sultan, Major S. G. Knox, who had succeeded Mai or Trevor as Political Agent at Muscat, suggested that His Highness should issue a proclamation prohibiting the export and import of arms (treaty rights reserved). A clause could then be inserted in the British Treaty (then under revision) making it illegal for British subjects to engage in the arms trade. If the Major Knox to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, 'United States were to folknv this 12th May 1911. a ex a m ple, France would be left in the 'invidious position of persisting in a trade largely contraband which the 'local Government and other civilized countries had prohibited. Ihe ' Sultan might then be advised to denounce a treaty so wide in its terms ' as to allow the importation of anarchical bombs . . . and to insist on ' clauses prohibiting, or at least limiting, the entry of noxious goods. The situation could be eased by purchasing the stocks of British and native28 dealers on condition of their undertaking not to engage in the arms trade in Oman again. If the same conditions could be offered to French traders, they wonld probably refuse the offer, and their refusal would give the Sultan a weapon against any protest of his having violated the treatv of 1844. 145. The Resident in the Gulf assumed that this suggested ' pressure on the French Government ' was not practicable at the moment, and suggested a scheme which was in essence a development of that outlined early in 1910. T • , + r&gt; i t n ^ ^ own P^ a11 0 f action was 'a fresh Lieutenant-Colonel ( ox to Government „ j p it • , t , ,, of India, 11th June. and iiciiik discussion oi the outlook 1145/11. Sultan, necessitated by two new developments, the failure of a settlement with Prance, and his own abandonment of a neutral position towards the traders in favour of an unmistakeable identification of himself with the illicit trade. It should be pointed out to him that Mis Majesty's Government was determined to suppress the traffic, even if His Miglmess's change of attitude should lead them, in the course of their efforts to^achieve tins end, to inteiiupt those cordial relations which have now so lon o ' ' existed between the British Government and His Highness and his ' ancestors.' The actual proposal which Lieutenant-Colonel Cox suggested should be Proposal of a bonded warehouse at j l!!!?• ^ &gt; ' (l1 ''ip (&gt;(&gt; i^out Muscat under efficient control. to-opeiation wjs the establishment 11 ' ^ on ded warehouse in Muscat, in ; winch all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation ; the ( ^alehouse to be in cliaige ol trustworthy persons under the supervision of ' a committee consisting of a high representative of his own, associated with ' the Political Agent at Muscat or a suitable British official deputed or lent ;; a(1 hoc - A11 lssu es from the warehouse, whether for local sale or export, 11 would be conducted under a complete system of marking, registration, and ' (in the case of export by sea) certificated port clearance, carried out under ' the supervision of the above committee.' Lieutenant-Colonel Cox was ready, if necessary, to yield to a demand for recognition of equality on the committee between France and Great Britain and admit a French representative. 146.

(It would be advisable, he thought, to have the bultan liquidate all his debts before touching the new subsidy.) i s regards the stocks of arms already in the dealers' hands in Muscat, oi on commission lor sale, it would appear to be within the Sultan's p eiogative as a matter of municipal administration, to oblige the owners o ceposit their stocks in the bonded magazine, to be sold under the sa eguaids provided under the arrangement proposed.'

As regards compensation to the Sultan they suggested a subsidy of India Office to Foreign Office. 19th Jnly one . lakh of .

Aftei some delay to see whether the French Government were disposed to follow up closely M. Cambon 's letter of 25th July (see paragraph 139), Lieutenant-Colonel Cox was empowered to approach the Sultan. 149. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox reported on 11th October that he hoped to open negotiations shortly: in the Telegram from Viceroy, 18th October. mean time he asked for authority to ]712 / 11 - threaten the Sultan if he proved ' insufficiently amenable to friendly overtures. ' i « i Authority to adopt this attitude was granted, provided it was clear 4 that . o x oi . ' the Sultan' would not look to France Telegram from Secretary of State, 31st ^ Tmkey for goodw in.' On 11th November Lieutenant- U ' K) 1L Colonel Cox reported progress. 150 The Sultan expressed his desire to maintain cordial lelations \\ith the British Government so long as its Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government attitude to him was benevolent: he was of India, 11th November. ready ' to notify absolute prohibition ' in spite of the French treaty if the British Government would guarantee ' him against the consequences, or to put his interests entirely in our ' hands if we and the French Government see fit to settle the matter ' between ourselves or through the Hague Tribunal. As regards the local measures proposed, he promisea nis Sultan's attitude. co -operation if no contravention of his treaties with other Powers were involved, if he were guaranteed support against the French Government if necessary, and if the iinancial aspect were satisfactory. On this last side ot Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Government ^ queg tion. the Sultan was UOt entirely Of India, 14th November 1911. amenable : he accepted one lakh of 1968 11 rupees per annum as fair compensation for the future, but demanded a lump sum of 80,000 dollars in addition as comDensation for his direct or indirect losses during the two preceding years of blockade. Lieutenant -Colonel Cox was disposed to consider this a fair request, and not to be rejected off-hand. In order that the existing stocks at Muscat might be depleted, he suggested an inspired Neuter rumour of 'an impending arrangement for the suppression ol the trafhc, which could be defended it French attention were drawn to it, 151. Commenting on Lieutenant -Colonel Cox's reports of llth and 14th November, the Government ot India Telegram from Viceroy, 28th December were anx j ous to Stifle the Sultan's 1911. expressed desire to communicate direct with France regarding the conditions on which he was prepared to accept S. 198.30 the warehouse system, in order that he might open the way to obtaining Fiench consent to that prohibition. J he attitude to be adopted thev felt was to persuade him that the establishment of the warehouse was ' a detail of internal arrangement ' wholly within his rights, and a thing in which Franee need not be consulted. {See Foreign Office Letter 28th January 1910). As regards the question of compensation to the Sultan raised in Lieutenant- Colonel Cox's telegram of 14th November, the Government of India suggested that one lakh down with one lakh per year in monthly instalments paid in advance would be sufficient. The proposals in his letter of 11th June as to the treatment of stock already in Muskat received their recommendation. lhe\ warmly supported the suggestion of a communique to the Press. 152.

By 1st March Lieutenant-Colonel Cox had reached Muscat, and Tr . , ^i imo conversations ensued with the Sultan, trom Viceroy, 1st March Wlz. TT . i , i .. , , i r» 'a- i 1 le absolutely refused to have a British Sultan's arrangements for supervi- official to supervise the warehouse and sionofware ouse. customs, even for a time. But as alternative courses he suggested that as soon as the details of the warehouse arrangement were complete, he would try, with Lieutenant-Colonel Cox s assistance, to select a trustworthy man from among his employes or subjects, or, if this were found impracticable, he was ready to engage a man from India ' whose identity and character should be referred to the Government of India for approval before the Sultan's contract with him was concluded.' 0 Colonel Cox recommended the acceptance of these arrangements in principle, it having been made clear that neither the compensatory lakh nor the enhanced subsidy would be payable till the details were concerted. Subject to the Sultan being clearly informed that the continuance of the enhanced subsidy would depend on his Telegram, Secretary of State, 5th March abiding by his engagements and that &lt;- .9 ^ ie supervisory official finally selected 1 '' would be liable to dismissal if inefficient or corrupt, these arrangements were approved, and the communique to the Press was issued on lOtli March. 15G. Discussion of the details of the arrangement to be adopted as regards the warehouse and of the Political lies,dent, 11th May 1912. not ifi ca tion to be published, was theu prosecuted. The Sultan was very friendly in the matter, but again urged the desirability of notifying total prohibition with three months' notice, for he w^as afraid the foreign dealers would not accept the warehouse system, and that their complaints would bring down the wrath of their (governments upon himself. Sir P. Cox supported the justifiability of this course by the analogy , , , _ ,_ .*. of Persia, where, in spite of treaties Justifiability of total prohibition. with u p owers besides Great Britain, France, and Russia, total prohibition of import of arms as well as restriction of import of merchandise was enacted, and acquiesced in by the Treaty Powers. The Government of India recommended this argument, and, while admitting that in the Muscat Treaty of 1844 the clause ensuring free trade could not be overridden, suggested that the Persian precedent might be enough to silence French protests, if required. 157. On 23rd May the final draft of the notification establishing the Political Resident, 23rd May 1912. warehouse was completed together with the general regulations which would be Warehouse system concerted. followed in using it. The text of the Notification by Sultan of Muscat. notification was as follows :— 1952/12. ' Whereas large quantities of arms and ammunition are at present stored without proper control in private buildings distributed in this our town of Muscat and thus exposed to the risks of attack, robbery, or fire. We, Saiyid Sir Faisal Bin Turki, G.C.I.E., Sultan of Muscat and Oman, impressed by the serious menace to the safety of our capital arising therefrom, have resolved to remedy this state of affairs in accordance with the needs of the times and the requirements of our municipal administration by the con struction and establishment of a special Customs House, Magazine, or Arms Warehouse, for the storage of arms and ammunition under safe precautions. * In July Saiyid Kasim was appointed to be superintendent of the warehouse. He had {U'eviously been in Government employ in the Postal Telegraph Department, and had retired from his position therein as superintendent at Mombasa. He was approved by Government as a suitable person for the post at Muscat, where he is directly under the Sultan and is paid by him, though his salary is made good by Government to His Highness.32 It is proposed to introduce this warehouse arrangement from on or about 1st September next. It will be conducted on the following general lines : Firstly.—On or after 1st September next all arms and ammunition or parts thereof imported into my territories will be taken direct from the steamer to the Control, of; which a special Superintendent will be appointed. Secondly. Similarly all arms dealers in my territories will be required to deposit stocks remaining in their hands on 1st September in the said ware house. Any trader offending against this regulation will in addition to other penalties render all future consignments of arms and ammunition arriving in his name liable to confiscation unless and till he complies with Uiis regulation in full. Thirdly. No arms will be allowed to issue from the warehouse until duty lias been fully paid thereon to the Customs Superintendent in the u-uial way. Fourthly. —Tho withdrawal of arms from the warehouse will be reo-ulated by the issue of special licenses prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by myself. Fifthly.—Such licenses will not be granted to traders, but only to approved individual purchasers or their duly authorised agents, on the pro duction of satisfactory proof thai the number, quantity, and destination of arms and ammunition, &amp;c., to be withdrawn from the warehouse are tree from justifiable objection. sixthly. All arms issuing from the warehouse will be with a special warehouse mark and serial number. Seventhly. Special rules will be drawn up providing for and re-nilatin^ issue to approved traders of sample stock for exhibition in their shops. ' Eighthly. Rules providing for the collection of arms, warehouse charges on stocks therein deposited, will be drawn up on the analogy of the present Custom House regulations for the levy of such fees on general merchandise. A inthhj. Special rules will be drawn up governing transfer between traders ot stocks deposited in the arms warehouse. Tenlhly. Special relaxations will be arranged for leniency towards tlintlocks, muzzledoading guns, and caps in reasonable quantities. Lastly. Detailed rules embodying the above principles are under preparation, and will be published in due course for further information of all concerned. 1j6. At the same time the Political Resident intimated that the Sultan Conditions of publication. ^ as willing at once to publish the r&lt; i r v . • t i notification and inform the foreign the four following point^:— tllat ^ ^ giVei1 a Wri,ten aSSurance on 1. lhat the British Government undertake full responsibility to give r lm ^ ue cessai} support to dispose ol objections that may ensue irom b ranee or other Powers. 2. lhat it is understood that the arrangement does not give the British Government or officials any right to take action in his territories any more than in the past. o. lhat the British come to a friendly understanding with him as to suitable arrangements for the supply of the bond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. 4. lhat the British promise to compensate him on the terms already agreed upon is confirmed. ^ Ihe notification and the Sultan's conditions for the issue were approved Telegram, Secretary of State, 1st June ^ St 'J une , and on 4th June the 1912. bultan published it. The purport was Telegram, Viceroy, 7th June 1912. aiso to be published in the Indian and 2122/12. London Press. 2175/12.— 33 French opposition locally. applicability to French subjects Telegram, Viceroy, 25tli July 1912. 2907/12. 150. The French Consul at Muscat at once declared that he held the notification to be contrary to the treaty of 1844 and refused to recognise its without orders from his Government. The French merchants simultaneously complained to the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, whose reply was to instruct the French Consul to inform the Sultan that France could not approve the regulations unless the French merchants were compensated.' :i: ' Telegram, Viceroy, 8th August 19Z2. Fren ^ h Consul approached the bultan on these Imes ; he was authorised to say that if the Sultan agreed to compensate French subjects the French Government would agree to the enforcement of the regulations which had been drawn up in contravention of treaty rights and without consulting France at all. He pressed for the moment only the question of the principle of compensation, not any specified amount. 160. A situation of considerable delicacy at once arose. It was clearly desirable to avoid compensation of the French traders in any form. The ' question of exchange of territory and interests with France had dropped, ' and the Muscat case must therefore be fought on its merits.' On the other hand, there was the adoption of an attitude of resistance by the French traders, supported by the Consul and the French Government. The arrangements notified by the Sultan must come into force by 1st September, the notified date, as to postpone the date would indicate weakness and damage our position with the Sultan and in the Gulf generally. But unless the French Consul's attitude altered and his Govern- uient's support were withdrawn, the enforcement of the regulations on the date specified would inevitably cause friction with the French traders which might lead to the worst results. The Sultan might delegate us to treat with France ; but this was not desirable, and it seemed preferable to point out to the French Government that no compensation was to be given to British firms in spite of their larger interests ' since warehouse scheme is merely regulation of, and not violation of, legitimate trade,' and the French nationals would onlv suffer loss in so far as their trade is with countries to which the import of arms and ammunition is prohibited. 101.

I (J*) 5P JL34 ' to compensate merchants who may consider that they suffer inconvenience.' And His Majesty's Ambassador at Paris was instructed to make strong representations in the same sense. 162. The Sultan in the meantime nearly precipitated matters. On Viceroy, 20th August 1912. ^ ^ u g ust in open durbar he told the rrench merchants that ' if on 1st September they did not obey the proclamation he would have their ' shops watched and imprison all their customers, and that he had no ' intention of burdening his and liritish subjects to French profit.' His Highness was warned not to disclose his intentions thus before the moment for action came. 163. As regards the position that must arise on 1st September, future Secretary Of state, 23rd August 1912. consignments were, of course, to be deposited in the warehouse at once; it was nnalJy decided not to allow any period of grace in this respect * \s regards existing stocks it was recommended that the Sultan should place a cordon round the stores of non-compliant dealers! and refuse to allow any Viceroy, 28th August. ; irms to removed except to the ware- 3365 12. house. I he support of His Majesty's Government in this action was promised, and the early arrival of the Admiral at Muscat was advised in case of a P rench warship being sent. (It was decided, however, that the Admiral should arrive about beginning of October, which being the usual date would excite no comment, and would be especially useful, as confiscation under Rule 2 would then come into force, see Appendix XX.) The French Consul remained obdurate, and the Sultan was advised to Viceroy, 28th August. reply that he intended to abide by his proclamation and should listen to no Secretary of State, 31st August. more discussion on the matter ; any - r* . . , such discussion must now be between the P rench and British Governments. Pending their decision he undertook to hold stocks in trust. 164. The French Government showed ils hand in a note to Sir F. Bertie on 29th August. The position adopted was that by the treaty of 1844 the trade in arms should remain quite unrestricted in Muscat, and I'rench nationals should have complete freedom to buy and sell 1 hey had a right to stand by their treaty Attitude of French Government.

The suggestion was, however, overruled on giouucls of local expediency, for on 31st August a Hamburg-Amerika steamship was due with arms for Muscat and a large consignment intended for Mohammerah, which was quite likely to be landed at Muscat for disposal if it were known that 14 days were available. If the regulation, were enforced at once on 1st September, however, the risk of their being impounded at Muscat would not be taken. Again, on 10th September Strick's steamship 0 wa/ due with a large consignment of arms and it was most undesirable that these should be let slip and allowed to be disposed of by the concession of a period of grace. On 30th August therefore it was decided to bring the general regulations into effect from Appendi^XX) ^ 0f the ruleS for the mana gement of the warehouse {see all ^his 3 sto^k 6 fn \ a rf'^T man ' ^ German ( onsulate instructed a commission agent to hold *—- *this right, and were prepared to examine any proposal made by Great Biitain on the subject of compensation, on which, as on the maintenance of French rights at Muscat, they must insist.

U1K oultan at once reminded the Political Agent that he 'shifted the burden of compensation on to our shoulders,' on which point he was reassured by Major Knox. 165. Within a week an incident occurred furnishing ' a case in point.' The agent of M. Louis Dieu, one Menachi, demanded the delivery of 33 cases of ammunition ex S.S. 'Ecbatana,' for which he held the bill of lading. The Customs official refused to deliver the cases. The French Consul wrote to the Sultan, protesting and demanding delivery after payment of the ordinary customs duly in accordance with the treaty which 4 ' His Highness T7 .. oxi o x t imo ' an&lt; ^ ancestors had observed for \ iceroy. ^tti fe6pt6Tnocr l.'Jli. i ^ 0,00 qo years, and which was not m the ' least opposed to his relations with ' other Powers or to the independence ol Oman.' The Snltan was advised to reply, refusing to deliver the goods, and expressing his abidance by his proclamation, and also pointing out that what did threaten his relations with other Powers and his independence was the extraordinary way in which he was expected to regard freedom of trade in dangerous goods, ' the sale of which is carefully regulated by France and all other civilized countries.' To this the French Consul replied that the deposit of French arms in the warehouse could not be permitted, nor the regulations obeyed, and that a Viceroy, 10th September 1912. Ha 4 i ' 1 . for A compensation was being entered. A similar claim was raised on behalf of M. Elbaz ::: ' with the further plea that in his case the arms were imported before 1st September. In the meanwhile the Sultan refused to post a cordon round the French stores as suggested {see paragraph 163), but he forbade the sale of arms from them. iii.— Attempts 1o ohlohi France s acceptance of the Warehouse Regulations. 1()6. The French Government were clearly disturbed at the state of Secretary of State's telegram, 12th affairs They represented that their September i912. treaty rights were being violated ' with 3540 12 - insolence ' by the Sultan, and that unless the status quo were re-established at once they would be forced to send a cruiser to Muscat. They were willing to consider an arrangement on the basis of compensation, but till that arrangement was effected demanded the restoration of the status quo, i.e. refused to recognise the Sultan's warehouse regulations. 167.

Sir. F. Bertie presented the memorandum. The French reply was first, that arbitration between France and England would be difficult as it w ould be over a question of a treaty between France and Muscat to which England ^ as ^ P art y* To this objection it was pointed out that undoubtedly the 1844 Treaty would be brought into discussion, but as a basis for mutual discussjon was replaced by the 1862 Agreement as to the Sultan's independence.

Meanwhile action had been taken at home which made this strong line for the moment inadvisable. On Telegram from Secretary ot State, llth the November i ns t ril ctionS were November 1912. , t » • • i » i i sent to the nntish Ambassador to reassure the French Government on the subject of confiscation, as to which the French had made a demand, and to point out that no confiscations had yet taken place, and that if France would accept arbitration on the question of com pensation, no confiscations would be made ' pending rapid arbitration.' In view of this language it was felt to be impossible to proceed with any confiscation at least till the French Government had had time to reply to the rest of Sir F. Bertie's note {see paragraph 167), and accordingly the ' Nieomedia's ' consignment was merely to be detained in the usual manner, in the warehouse, the adoption of this line being explained to the Sultan as more advisable at a moment when His Majesty's Government were trying by friendly means to bring the French to agree. 171. A new line of compromise was at this time being opened, on the basis of cession of certain British transit trade rights in Morocco in exchange for French acceptance of the Sultan of Muscat's regulations. The new pro posals 0 were not at once put before the French ; the British Ambassador was first instructed to prepare the ground by getting the French to state definitely their attitude towards arbitration. 172. On 13th November Sir F. Bertie approached the French Foreign Office, in accordance with his instruc- lelegrams from Secretary of State, ^j 011s 0 f foh, and pointed OUt that llth and loth November 1912. . , , ^ x - since the regulations came into lorce on 1st September no confiscations had been made and none 'will be made ' pending rapid arbitration if the French Government accept arbitration ' without delay.' The suggestion made by M. Cambon that the import of arms into Muscat should cease was not, it was pointed out, sufficient, ' for ' unless export also is suspended, except as provided for by the regulations, ' large quantities of arms and ammunition imported by French citizens ' since 1st September would be released and distributed.'t The French reply to this was that, even if no arms had been confiscated the compulsory deposit of imported arms constituted a ' sequestration,' and that before arbitration could properly be adopted the status (juo ought to be re-established; further, that the French Government could not commit itself to arbitration without further consideration. The British Ambassador pressed for a decision which was promised as early as possible, after legal advice had been taken. 173. A threat had been made in September by France that unless the status quo were re-established she French Threat to send a war-ship W ould have to send a cruiser to Muscat to ca • , ,,0 1 to protect the rights of her nationals. l^Secretary of State, 12th September A | ew ^ it was ]earne( j ^ the despatch to Muscat of a French cruiser, which had been intended to sail for the Far East in October, was * These proposals have now (February 1913) been put before the French Government. P ._ ,Briefly, they consist in an offer on our part to '' ' cede wholly, or preferably in part, British rgihts to equal treatment with French traders in respect of transit trade through Algeria to Morocco, under Article 4 (2) of the Franco-British Declaration 1904, in return for prolongation of British rights in the cotton trade in Tunis, and French acceptance of the warehouse regulations at Muscat. t This was the chief difficulty of the situation, due partly to the irresolution of the Sultan as regards confiscation, and partly to the ineffectiveness of the cordons he finally placed round the French stores. Drastic action, viz., the seizure of dhows with arms in Muscat waters, was contemplated by His Majesty's ships, but the Political Agent prevented its being put into execution (save in one instance), as the Sultan was sure to resent such action and his goodwill was essential. It has been pointed out more than once that the decisive factor in the situation is the Sultan's personal character. S. 198. K38 being hastened. His Majesty s Government felt it necessary to have a &lt;! further naval force at Muscat ' to meet eventualities, and enquired what arrangements could be made. Admiral Bethell telegraphed on 17th September that there were four ships m , f , r . OAU c , , available at the moment in the Gulf, ^91 Jelegranifrom A ieei-oy, 20th September ^ that on 30 th Septernbcr 1,0 would himself be at Muscat with his flagship. Further, the whole of the East Indies squadron could, if necessarv be conct;ntrated at Muscat before the French ship arrived. If she were an armoured vessel the Admiral thought armoured vessels should be sent from the Mediterranean or China stations, but these could still anticipate the French when more information was available. His Majesty's Government thought it advisable to concentrate the four Secretary of State, 22nd September vessels in the Gull at Muscat at once ; 1912 - _ this was done on 25th September, and ] on 30th the Commander-in-Chief arrived there too in the ' Highflyer,' with the ' Espiegle,' ' Pelorus ' ' Perseus ' and 'Sphinx.' ^ ■ s, I A. Subsequently it was found that the cruiser detailed by the French Government was the ' Montcalm,' at I^rest. Her movements were reported by the Naval Intelligence oflicers, and every preparation was made w have a suitably imposing force ready to await her at Muscat it she eventually 4260 12 was sent ^ iere - ^ was arranged that H.M.S. ' Defence ' should proceed from the China station to Singapore, and should be ready to proceed to Muscat on receipt of further information. 175. Meanwhile the squadron above mentioned remained at Muscat. Unfortunately this concentration of the naval force at Muscat, thouo-h advan tageous politically, stopped the efficient policing of the Gulf, information m i , ix,, , showed that in the latter part of J elegram from \ iceroy, 1st December rw i i i ,. „ Vt 1912. ' October and the earlier part of Novem- 4619/12. ^ er the arms smuggling community readily understood that the ships of war were all concentrated at Muscat and that their ability to patrol the Gulf was temporarily stopped ; they at once took advantage of the fact and smuggling proceeded apace, which, undesirable in itself, was now doubly so as it promoted a market to which French arms might be profitably exported. Sir P. Cox urged that, if the state of negotiations admitted of it the strict concentration of His Majesty's ships should be relaxed to meet this outburst of smuggling. On 13th December it was learned that the ' Montcalm ' would not touch 4^17 12 at ^ 11 scat. Orders were therefore sent , . ' . instructing H.M.S. ' Defence' to return to her station, and the Persian Gulf squadron was released from its concentration at Muscat. iv. Question of Ike ( oinpcnsation of 7 raders m Muscat. 17G. When there seemed a prospect that by arrangement with the French Government total prohibition ol export and import of arms might be enforced at Muscat, it was recognised as inevitable that the traders should be compensated, and the question of compensation \vas from time to time considered {see paragraphs IGU, 134, 135, 138). Hie institution of total prohibition became undesirable, and the 'ware house system of control has taken its place. The technical justification of instituting this system—apart from its moral justification—lies in the fact that it is a measure which can be described as a detail of domestic admi nistration m Muscat As such it is the Sultan's act, and any compensation the Sultan 18 tlaaers s ^ llvo ^ ve( -l by its enforcement should proceed from In practice this could not be expected of the Sultan ; but this aspect of e situation was ol this much value, that it precluded the necessity of offering39 compensation of any sort as an accompaniment to the institution of the warehouse. It was obviously to our advantage to avoid the expense of com pensating the traders if possible (for the expense would, of course, be borne really by Government though, perhaps, ostensibly by the Sultan), and no mention of the matter was made. Since the establishment of the system, however, the French Consul at Muscat has continually insisted upon the necessity of compensating French 0 traders; indeed, he was authorised to say that France would with draw opposition to the system if the principle of compensation were admitted (see paragraph 159). The question of compensation has now, therefore, come to the front. 177. In January 1911 the Government of India reviewed the question in view of the existing possibility of effecting total prohibition. They then came to the conclusion that purchase of stocks of arms at the market price •' is the only form of direct compensation which should be entertained. If ' we begin discussing compensation to traders or manufacturers for loss of ' prospective profits we should be embarking on a very large question in ' connection with which Muscat and British dealers, and even German and ' Belgium manufacturers, might clamour for equal treatment. We should ' adopt argument that although shipment has been legal, destination of arms ' has been notoriously illicit, and that both dealers and manufacturers who u have already made such heavy profits are deserving of no sympathy.' 1 The principles contained in this statement have been adhered to in subsequent consideration of the question ; but the fact that a system of contjol of the trade has actually been instituted has given opportunity for restricting the conditions of compensation. The French firms alone need be considered, and they consist solely of Messrs. Goguyer and M. Louis Dieu, and two Armenian firms 'who consider themselves more or less under French protection ' (see Appendix XV., Table C.) 178. Sir P. Z. Cox has recently investigated the matter, and on 1-lth December 1912 estimated that there were in Muscat itself 12,000 rifles and 2,000,000 cartridges which would be the subject of compensation. On the blisis of valuation adopted in March 1911 {see Appendix XV.. Table C.), viz., Hs. 60 per rifle and Rs. GO per 1,000 rounds, the total of compensation would amount to Ks. 8,40.000—or about 60,O00L—which might be reduced by stipulating for invoice prices. This compensation would apply only to arms actually in Muscat; any which had left Muscat might reasonably be excluded from compensation. To avoid the possibility of sharp practice on this point. Sir P. Cox urged that it should be a condition ot compensation that all French stocks should at once be inspected and sealed, and within a specified time deposited in the warehouse for assessment; also, that no claim for compensation should be admitted without full documentary proof that the owner or the goods were bond fide under French protection on the date the rules were introduced, i.e., 1st September 1912. By these two stipulations we should be able to eliminate stocks which had been transferred to the recalcitrant French dealers' godowns in order to evade the warehouse rules, and also prevent arms which had been exported from Muscat for sale from being surreptitiously brought back to swell the stocks on which compensation was to be paid. (A detailed scheme of procedure on these lines was drawn up by Major Knox, and is shown in Appendix XIX.) Sir P. Cox gave his opinion that if we agree to the purchase of the French stocks which have been kept out of the warehouse in defiance of the * British dealers can be disregarded so far as compensation is concerned as they are nenendent on the Sultan's leniency if they do not comply with the regulations. The same atmlies to such local dealers as Ali Musa, and to German and other European dealers. French dealers alone require to be met over the question of compensation by virtue of the '• Free Trade ' Clause of the Franco-Muscat Treaty of 1844.40 rules * it would be advisable to purchase also the stocks of non-French dealers so far as tliey have been voluntarily deposited in the warehouse, Telegram from Viceroy, 27th December j? ^plianCC with the rules The 1912. Government of India endorsed these , , . , suggestions, and assuming that we should have to compensate all traders, not the French only, stipulated that only stocks of other traders actually deposited in the warehouse be paid i'\ , 1 'e estimate of 60,(XW. they considered not trustworthy, but presumed that naif the sura eventually found necessary would be contributed bv His -Majesty s I reasury But they deprecated ' payment of compensation in any form, except as last resort, and ' on the understanding that this finally secures 1-rench acceptance of regulations precluding further obstruction .. th ® lr P art . together, if possible, with an assurance that they (i.e., the ' el ^rnT^^' 11 d,8C0Urage 0pera,i0nS ^ French — traders 1,9. fhe I'rench Government just at this time made an offer to consider the question with a view to final settlement, provided that in the meanwhile he operation ot the regulations were suspended.

The depot of arms at Sohar, where various traders, especially Ali Musa, Sohar. |' ave beeu storil1 ' arms for issue under u , , .

CHAPTER III. Events in the Persian Gulf, 1911-12. 181. Reference has been made (see paragraph 130) in the preceding paragraphs to the 'Musaffa' incident. ' Musaffa incident.' ^ was 0 f some importance in itself. 944/11. an( ] was made the subject of commu- nications between His Majesty's and the French Governments, it is as well to give the details of the occurrence. On 12th March 1911, the boom ' Musaffa,' belonging to MM. Goguyer et Cie., left Muscat with general cargo and Major Trevor to Lieutenant-( olonel passengers for Tank* and ('harbar. Cox, 26th March (and enclosures). Her departure was reported by telegram to Jask. On 14th March the dhow, though she had a fair wind for Charbar, anchored off Has Kohlab, a desolate spot near Charbar. Mr. Midshipman Morgan, Royal Naval Reserve, was in command of the 2nd cutter of 11.M.S. ' Philomel,' engaged in patrol work on the coast near Charbar. Seeing the dhow anchor off so desolate a shore, though there was nothing to prevent her putting in to Charbar, and recollecting that there had been for the last two or three days men loitering on the shore with donkeys, he suspected that the dhow might be flying the French colours wrongly, intending to land arms under their protection. He therefore bore down on the dhow, and asked to see her papers ; this was refused and Mr. Morgan boarded her, alone. The papers were at once produced, and finding them all correct Mr. Morgan left; the dhow stayed at her anchorage till the next morning and then proceeded to Charbar. These facts were ascertained on oath from Mr. Morgan. M. Elbaz M. Goguyefs agent) at once complained to the French Consul, who submitted the complaint to Major Trevor, making the most of the fact that Mr. Morgan on boarding the dhow alone, drew his revolver from its holster, in case of emergency. M. Jeannier also reported the matter to his Government, and on 10th May M. Cambon addressed Sir E. Grey about the matter, adding that as reported to him, the English sailors had gone down into the hold and ransacked the passengers' baggage in their search for concealed weapons. 1 1 . . . . , There was no doubt that Mr. Morgan had exceeded his instructions, but the suspicious behaviour of the dhow provided reasonable justification ; on the other hand, his action had been grossly distorted and exaggerated by M Elbaz In expressing regret for the occurrence. Sir E. Grey on 20th Julv pointed this out to M. Cambon, and as has been seen, seized the opportunity to urge the desirability of an Anglo-French agreement on the general subject of the arms trade at an early date. , Further the French Consul at Muscat undertook that the names and registration marks of dhows entitled to fly the French flag should^ be painted on their sterns, so that such incidents, due to suspicious behaviour, should in future be avoided. 1 ^ The blockading force had further successes, the most notable being the ine uioc capture of a dhow off Khor Fakan on Blockade successes March—July 28th March 1911. She had on board 182 1911. _ rifles, 52 Mauser pistols, and 60,000 Commander-in-Chief to Admiralty, oth roim( | s 0 f ammunition. She was under A P liL Arab colours, was registered at Koweit and her papers showed her to be bound from Calicut via Goa to Koweit. * \ small coast village about midway between Charbar and the mouth of the Rapch River. S. 198. LThe arms were said to be for Sheikh Mubarek himself, but as there was nothing to confirm this, the Admiral proposed to destroy the arms and burn the dhow as an example. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Govern- E J showed that the dhow he- ment of India, 2ist April. i j .i . -rr i ,1 longed partly to Koweit and partly to Katr; the Sheikh of Koweit knew nothing of the arms and approved „ r of the burning of the dhow.

The blockade had been authorised till the end of November 1911 (paragraph 132), and Lieutenant-Colonel Cox and the Admiral had both represented that it must be maintained beyond that date. On 18th October 1911 the Government of India requested sanction to Continuance of the Blockade. co '' i ' ue '' til1 the ,?' d of , Ma, ; ch I 912 ; Viceroy, 18th October 1911.

Four launches were hired for the continuance of the blockade. The extension till the end of March 1912 was sanctioned towards the end Secretary of State, 22nd November of NoA'embei' 1911. 1911. Xo arrangement with either France or Muscat was in immediate sight in _ , , Februarv 1912, and accordinglv the leleerram from V icerov, 9th February ^ . f t j. j xu i. xu 5 J J (jrovernment or India requested that the ^ blockade should be extended ' during so much of 1912-13 as may prove necessary.' At the same time it was pointed out that the scope of the blockade must be enlarged to embrace the Persian coast of Farsand Laristan. The disturbed state of these districts was proving an incitement to the arms dealers to establish a market there, while, per contra, this steady supply of weapons rendered the pacification of the districts impossible. To break this vicious circle, the extension of the blockade and its indefinite continuance were essential. In view of the Imperial interests in Southern Persia, the Government of India hoped that half the increased cost would be borne by Imperial Revenues. The Admiralty, however, could spare no extra ships for the Persian Gulf, and it was argued by the Treasury that even without the increased scope of the blockade, India could not have dispensed with any of the existing blockading force. The Government of India admitted this (2623/12) and agreed on 5th July to continue to bear the cost of the blockade, even as extended. On 26th March the indefinite continuance of the blockade in an Secretary of State, 26th March 1912. extended form covering the whole g-Q/12 Persian Gulf was sanctioned by His Majesty's Government, but in view of ' the necessity of curtailing operations at the earliest possible date,' and the anticipated ' effect of Sultan of Muscat's new arrangement in this connection,' a further report 0 at the end of three months was called for. This has not yet been received, and the blockade continues.43 184 Since the Debai incident (paragraphs 112-11 o) all had be( ^ lc&gt;± ' on theTrucial coast, and the Sheikhs Incident at Rams on the Trucial had done nothing to shake our con- Coast. fidence in them.

Further, on condition that he consented to the prohibition, they suggested the payment to Abdullah of a sum of Ks. 5,000 for issue as a compassionate grant to the Katr part-owner of the dhow captured by the launch ' Miner' in March (paragraph 182) and burned, as evidence showed that her engagement for arms traffic had been an act of disobedience on her nakhoda's part, for which the owner was in no wav to blame. 187. His Majesty's Government concurred in the general proposals. It was an open question whether the bulk of the arms conveyed to Katr were for shipment to Persia, or were absorbed in the interior. If the latter, Turkey's interests would be served by the prohibition in Katr, and in any case her claim to sovereignty in the peninsula could not be admitted. The Ojair coast, however, was as suggested, to be omitted. The Government of rp i f Ar f ^ India's proposal was formallv approved leleffram from Marquess of Crewe, O/iii . ^ , , T . - , 24th August 1911. 011 -4tn August, and Lieutenant-Colonel Cox was, on 26th August, authorised to try to induce the Katr family to notify prohibition and to offer the subsidies above mentioned and the compassionate grant through Sheikh Abdulla. 188. No definite arrangement was effected on these lines. The Bin Thani family politely declined to notify prohibition, doubtless feeling that no subsidy offered by Government was likely to compensate for the loss of profit on smuggling arms, and Katr accordingly continues to be a source of trouble to us and of supply to the gun-runners. It was established that arms were conveyed freely overland—chiefly from Sohar—to the peninsula, and the impunity with which this was done infected the Trucial coast in spite of the lesson taught at Rams. In January 1912 the Naval Commander-in- Chief attributed the disorder prevailing in Fars and Laristan to the facility with which arms and ammunition can be obtained from the Trucial coast, El Bidaa, and Koweit. He recommended the employment of an additional blockading ship specially to patrol the Arabian coast,'including these points. The Trucial Chiefs do not appear to have been implicated themselves at this time, but they certainly took no effective steps to enforce prohibition in their territory. 189. In March 1912 the Sheikh oi Debai requested permission to import Trucial Coast. 70 rifles and ammunition in proportion ior his own use. In refusing the request, the opportunity was taken to express how little satisfied Government uas with his present attitude, evinced not only in his slackness in checking the aims tiallic, but in his disobliging conduct towards the promotion of general trade. 1J0. Iii Apnl IJI ^ a lettei was issued by the Sheiks of Shargah, Umm-el- Kawain, and Ajman calling upon the Chiefs of Shibkah and Katr to co-operate in stopping the Irucial coast from being used as a ' flyinir depot ' for the despatch of arms to ivatr and Persia. W hether this effort was genuine or not, it was not effective. In May 1912 the traffic through the 1 racial coast was so large that the Resident in the Gulf suggested the adv^abhty of imposing a fine on the Chiefs of Rs. 10 for every rifle and vs, o for every 100 rounds of ammunition detected to have passed through their territory. Political considerations, however, and the necessity of retaining the goodwill of the Sheikhs deterred the Government of India from approving the suggestion. 191. In September 1912 a large consignment of 875 rifles and 60 cases of ammunition was conveyed from Sohar. The ' Muscat gang ' was responsible oi its despatch, Ali Musa, Goguyer, and a German firm being chiefly concerned Near Shargah it was detected by the son of the Residency Agent and on information being given, was seized. The Sheikh of Shargah 's attituc e uas not satisfactory; while not openly aiding the smugglers he45 gave no assistance whatever in the capture, and refused to guarantee the Residency Agent's safety from any reprisals that might be made. For the future it was felt some definite measures mast be taken; either the Trucial coast must be patrolled by a man-of-war which could ill be spared for this particular stretch of coast, or a security must be obtained. Lieutenant- Colonel Cox suggested that the Sheikhs of Debai, Shargah, and Ajman should be required to deposit a security of Rs. o.OJJ or Rs. i0,0(X) for their energy in enforcing prohibition. But such a ourse would, it was feared,, alienate the Sheikhs at a time when their goodwill was required. 192. In December 1912 Sheikh Butti-bin-Soheil of Debai died. The &gt;;4(; jpresence of rival claimants to the 7( j2 j ; y succession offered a suitable opportunity for effecting a bargain. The Political Resident was authorized to take advantage of the situation to push the establishment of a wireless telegraph station ::: ' and post-office at Debai as a return for Government's support of the eventual successor to the chieftainship. The question of the succession has, however, been settled : the new chief's attitude is no more 'progressive' than his predecessor's, and the question is being considered of establishing the telegraph with or without his consent at Debai or, possibly, Zora. Of the two Debai is preferable on the ground that there we should be able to control an important centre of the arms trade. 193. The problem of El Katr and the Katif coast remains unsolved. To obtain the good offices of the Turkish Government, in putting down the traffic by the establishment of military force, was a possible solution, but involved the very serious objection that it meant the tacit recognition of Turkish sovereign rights over the district, a claim which has steadfastly been disregarded by His Majesty's Government. The converse course of landing a British force and compelling the discontinuance of the illicit trade ^ () _ 1 . ) clearly went too far in the opposite direction and was only to be adopted in the last resort. The only alternative that seemed to be at all practicable was the enforcement of a very strict blockade round the peninsula. The extent of the traffic in El Katr will be largely affected by the ultimate fate of Sohar; but there is a possibility that even the complete destruction of the depot at Sohar will be partially nullified in its effect upon the traffic in El Katr, by the contemplated establishment of El Bidaa as a direct port of call for steamers. 194. At Koweit a situation requiring delicate treatment arose in con- Koweit nection with Sheikh Mubarek's require- , c ments of arms for his own purposes. Sheikh's requirements of arms. ln the auti|mn of ^ be lO-n Vl remembered, {see paragraph 94) he had imported 2,000 rifles from Muscat under a permit. In the early summer of 1911 he wished to take further advantage of the slump in the sale price of rifles at Muscat, and to import 2,000 Martini rifles, 500 magazine rifles, with 1,050,000 rounds for the Martinis and 30,000 for the magazine rifles, and for the future he wished to import annually about 2,000 rifles and ammunition in proportion. There was clearly difficulty in giving a permit to so large a supply of weapons, and the difficulty was ^ , • , , .-i . x x t&gt; x • • enhanced by the hostile articles of Turkish hostility to Qreat Bntam m T -i tt i i • n u • i, j • ... ^ Ismail Hakki liey, which appeared m the Turkish papers, the ' Tanin,' and ' Le Jeune Turc. ' The Sheikh was specifically accused of making Koweit an arms emporium under British protection, the reference being to the arms imported under permit, while Great Britain was accused of taking one chief after another under her protection, decorating him, e.g., the Sheikh * Vide Articles (2) and (6) of the ultimatum of 30th December 1910, paragraph 113.

' Demam . . . . ^ es Anglais mettront la main sur • Unraz et sur 1 Arable persane, sous pretexte que la Turquie et la Perse ' sont impuissantes a y maintenir Tordre.' Any concession to the Sheikh in the matter of importing arms was therefore likely to increase this anti-British attitude, and an importation up the Gulf under a British 'pass' was not a matter that could be prevented from becoming public. 195. On the other hand the Sheikh's arguments were sound ; his position Sheikh's arguments- he explained thus : — (а) Koweit is an emporium for the trade from Centra Arabia. By sea trade is happily rendered safe by the dispositions ' of Pax Britannica,' but the trade by land and the freedom of travellers from molestation by Bedouins within his sphere of influence was his^ responsibility and to control the routes from North and South Nejd,he required an armed force. (б) Large expenditure in both arms and men had been involved by the hostility of the Muntafik during the last two vears, culminating in his defeat early in 1910. (c) His Bedouins got through an enormous and continual wastage of ammunition which he was powerless to check. (d) Every year his force was increased by about 1,000 youths who required to be armed. (e) Lastly, his loyal co-operation in prohibiting the import of arms for sale had closed his previous channel of supply : ' there is not a new rifle to be purchased in the place.' Lieutenant Colonel Cox was disposed to support the arguments of the Sheikh ; his attitude had been eminently satisfactory {e.g., paragraph 182) and 'ultimately he has the right and cannot be prevented from ^ettincr what arms he needs. ' The annual requirement of 2,000 rifles, Lieutenant' Colonel Cox thought, was a fair estimate. The Government of India were not so optimistic ; they recalled the Government of India to Lieutenant- Sheikh's unsatisfactorv and Varillatmir Colonel Cox, 13th May. attitude over the Fath-el-Khair' case (see paragraph 93) and wished for some means of guaranteeing that the arms were used by the Sheikh himself and not diverted to profitable export. 196. The Sheikh meantime was in urgent need of 15,000 rounds of Captain Shakespear, 9th May. Gianniicher ammunition, to replace a •j • i j i ! • i . , corresponding amount of Mauser cart- ndges included by mistake in the ' permitted ' consignment Ihis demand Lieutenant-Colonel Cox supported as quite justified, and Lieutenant-Colonel Cox, 14th May. replied also to the Government of The 1 1 1 1 1 1- 1, ,1Kiia ' s ^ 0ll bts on the general question.

His Majesty's Government were fully alive to the probability 'that the Turkish Government will strongly India Office to Foreign Office, 21st June. to ^ ^ arrangement ' as permitting the Sheikh to import the arms. The' Grand Vizier had at the end of the 0 preceding year ' complained that ' uuder British protection . . . ''Koweit was the centre of the contraband arms traffic (in the sphere ' of Turkish influence), and a source of continual conflict with her 44 4 neighbours.'' It might be therefore that the Turks would be led to view this arrangement with the Sheikh with alarm and that the genoial settle ment of outstanding questions in the Persian Gulf, among which wab the autonomy of Koweit, would thereby be imperilled. The Earl of ( rewe was disposed to disregard u Turkish susceptibilities ' and support the Govern ment of India's recommendations, but was not prepared to press the point if Sir E. Grey did not agree. The Foreign Office agreed on oth July to letting the Sheikh have the con- Permission granted. signment proposed by the Government of India for his immediate requirements, but advised that no undertaking should be made as to the annual import of 2,000 rifles in the future, as it ' would hamper His Majestv's Government in any discussion with the 1 orte on the question of contraband in the Gulf or in any discussion about Koweit. The Government ot India Marquess of Crewe's telegram, 8th July. iustructed aCc ordingly, and per- missicn to import the arms from Muscat was given to Sheikh Mubarek. 198 In Aucnist Captain Shakespear concerted with the Sheikh a system of marking and checking the arms; Arrangements for contro.. they were to be stamped with his own family mark and any so marked found by His Majesty ships in transit and not satisfactorily accounted tor. Captain Shakespear to Lieutenant- should be sei/.ed ; the Sheikh also Colonel Cox, 31st July. undertook to furnish periodical dis tribution lists. As regards the ammunition he undertook to supply periodical registers of issue, a matter in which he was very stringent, these arrangements were approved by the Government of India on 1st &gt;epteni jci 1911. • . • Sheikh Mubarek did not, however, avail himself of the permission to import arms for a year.' :: In July PJl^ Viceroy, 27th July 1912. ^ re q ues ted that he might import 6 000 rifles and 400 rounds per rifle. This request was an increase on his original demand, but was fairly proportionate to it on the basis of a year s additional requirements. The Resident in the Gulf supported the request, and the Government of India recommended that permission should be accorded on the understanding that no further demand in the near future should je considered The Sheikh was willing to agree to this, and also to postpone the import of the consignment till after 1st September 191 L when the arms regulations at Muscat came into force, and could be applied to the despatcli oAhe consignment from Muscat, thus ensuring a double check.

On the Mekran and Biyaban coasts events were comparatively quiet during the hot weather of 1911. The Afghans gradually dispersed north wards. In March a caravan of -400 had left. In May, immediately after the expedition from Sirik, about 300 left for Afghanistm via Rod bar ; in June The Mekran and Biyaban Coasts. another band ol 100 left by the same route, and b} the beginning of July only about 160 remained in the coast districts. The season had been exceptlonalh had loi the Alghan dealers; practically no cargoes of arms had been successfully run ;t they had had a severe lesson with loss of men in May, and prospects of profit on their venture were very slight. Prices had risen to a great height owing to the difficulties of import ; according to Mr. Gumbley magazine rifles that in Muscat fetched Rs. GO—90 would be sold in Mekran for Rs. 300—400, while Martini-Henrys in Muscat worth about Rs. 30, fetched in Mekran about Rs. 80. These figures were borne out b\ the estimate of the Senior Xaval Officer, lo clear a profit over such puichase prices the Afghan dealers in Mekran were forced to ask a prohibitive price ; indeed, already it was said that there were some 4,000 rifles lying unsold in Herat because of the prohibitive prices asked. Mr. Gumble\% however, felt confident that the difficulties in trade were dependent entirely 1016/13. 011 ^ ie maintenance of the blockade , . . an( l ^at any relaxation of it would involve an immediate increase of the traffic. In October 1912 a loval Mir— Cheragh of \ekdar—aided by a detachment of the 7th Rajputs from Jask arrested and despoiled a small gun-running party near Jask, with the loss of two or the Mir s men. 200. Some trouble was threatened by Khalifa Khair Muhammad who Khalifa Khair Muhammad. Proposed to settle on some land he had it imoi i i acquired at Kasimabad near Bampur. In June LI he was known to be extending his hospitality to a caravan of Atghans and, as it seemed certain that his intentions in establishing himself i!! :l 'f'.

In November 19 fl the agreement 0 with Seyyid Khan and Islam Khan was concluded and the first instalment of the subsidy was paid. A warning was at the same time given Agreement with the Sardars of Geh that unless more active co-operation and Bint. was g[ veil i n future in suppressing the arms traffic the subsidy would lapse, and that unless an improvement were seen before long ' our friendship would be turned into enmity.' Islam Khan was the more important of the two chiefs though technically the junior ; there was no doubt of his ability to put 13 a stop to the traffic through his territory, and if he could be induced to do so gun-running on the Mekran coast would cease. But the often expressed doubts as to his reliability have been justified. Mr. GumbJey has had to withhold his subsidy for the half-year ending 30th September 1912 on account of bis continued complicity in gun-running, and has warned him that it will not be renewed till he mends his ways. 202. While Captain Oraufnrd was ratifying this agreement, Mir Barkat Khan came into his camp supplicating friendship and making overtures to that end. He represented that during the last eighteen months he had had a severe lesson, and that now he was anxious to serve British interests if the existing prohibition of trade between Bashkand Mir Barkat. anc | ^le coast were withdrawn and he were allowed to collect his dues from Jask and Biyaban while retaining the position he had made in Bashkand. It was desirable to have him friendly, but the difficulty in acceding to his requests was that no check could be put on him by the local Mirs who were really loyal. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox suggested that he should be required to enter into an agreement to remain permanently at Jask, not quitting it without permission from Government, to abstain from any share or part in the arms or slave trade, and for two years or so to pay, say, Rs. 10,000 as security for good behaviour. In January 1912 these conditions were put before him. He was much dissatisfied with them and returned to his stronghold. Towards the end of April his followers were raiding in two parties through Biyaban, and a third party which reached Jask murdered a friendly Mulla and threatened the place, which was defended by the 7th Rajputs. Clearly there was no hope of Barkat becoming a loyal supporter of Government and Lieutenant-Colonel Cox suggested publishing a reward for his capture alive or dead. The Government of India would not go so far as this but agreed to the local chiefs being urged to apprehend him. So far, however, he has evaded death or capture : but he has given no serious trouble lately. D T M Political Department, 20th February 1913. * See Appendix XXI. S. 198.

These figures, as has been said, are compiled from Muscat trade returns. Other returns are available, notably the quarterly returns furnished bv the Customs House in England to the Foreign Office. The figures so obtained do not in all cases agree with those supplied from Muscat, e.g., in 1910-11, the Customs House reported the shipment of 3,44o rifles from England as against 1,650 British rifles reported to have actually passed into Muscat. The discrepancy may be accounted for in several ways; mam cargoes consigned to Muscat may be diverted to other Gulf ports or else where • much of the stuff shipped from English ports originates from abroad, and doubtless a proportion does not pass through the Muscat customs. From Antwerp also returns of a sort are available. Every cargo shipped ior Muscat is reported to the Foreign Office and to the Naval Commander-in- Chief but as it is only possible to notify the number oi cases of arms and cartridges shipped, it is not possible to calculate accurately the actual number of rifles or the value of the consignments. _ I he information supplied is, however, valuable to the officers m the Persian Gulf, and in the spring of 1910 an attempt was made to obtain regular information of the same soi from Marseilles, Hamburg, and Port Said. No information could be gleaned at Marseilles and Port Said. From Hamburg it was reported that tlie Hamburg -Amerika line had ceased to carry arms II coi iec t at the , this statement can have been true only temporarily ; for references to impoits bv Hamburg-Amerika ships are frequent-for instance, a consignment landed on 14th January 1911 ot Ji Telegram from Viceroy, 1st February cases 0 f r ifl es anc | 393 of ammunition I 911 - was reported in February. iii. From the returns furnished by the Customs House it is possible to gather other information regarding the trade. Messrs Laubenburg, o Birmingham, were shewn to be the most deeply interested of 1 utish tiuus, both as manufacturers and as export agents. Messrs, Qabrough and Johnstone Messrs. Kynoch, and tlie Birmingham Small Arms Company are the next most important makers; Messrs. Langstaff Ehrenberg and 1 ollaclf, of Liverpool, the next largest export agents, and Messrs. Stnck and Messrs Gellatly Hankey (agents for the British India Steam .Navigation Company) «- - «. -*** expected, the largest buyers, followed by M.

It will be seen that a very small proportion of the rifles were, then at any rate, magazine rifles,' the bulk being Martini-Henrys and Martini-Nletfords. Gognyer held the largest stock, twice as large as that of Ah Mnsa, who More leaving the subject of the supply of arms it should perhaps be mentioned that in December 1 ( .)10 it appeared pronable that Japan would become temporarily at least, a source of supply, owing to the huge nnmbei of disca 'rded Japanese, and captured Russian, rifles in the country Strong representations were made to the Japanese Government to stop tlie expoit f ft pir nnns at 'inv rate for sale within the zone of the Brussels Act. The Japanese' Government did not agree to this, but undertook to notify the Power concerned of the details of any exported consignment and its destination.^ ^ ^ cons i Knin eut of 3,820 discarded rifles left Yokohama c ri +• . i fnrtVipr 1H 000 in May.

MTTouis Dieu is in rather h f ^Te^d is a ' commission agent, i.e., impoi ^ i fi k t k This explains, at once, theoi&gt; vi. The importation of arms into Muscat from Europe has been in general carried on quite openly, no attempt being made to disguise the natuie of the consignments. In the summer of 1911, however, suspicion arose that to otherGulf ports, notably Koweit, arms were being conveyed by direct transit under false bills of lading. In June the Captain Shakespear to Lieutenant- S.S. ' Bulimba's cargo was suspected ; Colonel Cox, 21st .June. it was searched by the Sheikh, but nothing contraband was discovered. A consignment of 25 cases of loaf sugar from Antwerp consigned to Koweit by the Hansa and Hamburg-Amerika S.S. ' C. bord Laeisz ' next fell under suspicion. At Bombay they were transhipped to the British Indian Steam Navigation Company s Commander-in-Chief to Admiralty, 1st &lt;( Pal^^cotta.' She was Stopped and August 1911. searched by H.M.S. 'Fox,' acting on information supplied by the Master, and ten of the cases were found to contain rifles. It is noticeable that the consignment had already been to Koweit, and not having been claimed was being returned to Bombay. It was suspected that the' consignees were a German firm recently established at Koweit under Persian management. Enquiries at Antwerp elicited the information that while the fifteen genuine cases came from a chocolate factory at Antwerp, the ten containing arms were pipped from a warehouse, all, however, were shipped by the Antwerp agents (H. Regnardts cV Co.), ot a British firm, Messrs. Bertie, Richmond, &amp; Co. , A further consignment of rifles concealed in cases of sugar was discovered at Bombay in a Hansa liner from Government of India to Government of Antwerp to Koweit. The forwarding Bombay, &amp;C., 28th September 1911. agents were the same as before; the shipping agents again were British. • t t ^ Instructions were given accordingly to the Customs in India to examine carefully all goods marked for shipment to the Persian Gull. In the meantime Captain Shakespear had prosecuted enquiries at Koweit, . Captain Shakespear to Lieutenant- and discovered grounds of suspicion Colonel Cox, 18th September. against the Marati family. ic\ \ mt Lieutenant- Colonel Cox to Government a firm engaged 111 trading in foodstuffs of India, 30th September. their ships plying between Koweit ana India, and Koweit and Bussorah and theShatt-el-Arab. Till 1010 they had been the largest wholesale arms dealers m Koweit, haying in UOJ a stock ot 6 000 rifles and 1,61)0 cases of ammunition (about io0,000 roum.s) ibey were suspected of still keeping up the import of arms by bribing the Koweit Customs, and it was known that they were in close communication with Goguyer and Mirza Hussein at Muscat. Lately too they had formed a connection with Messrs. Wonckhans, who in April 1911, began to turn their attention to K0 There was reason to suspect, therefore, that the ' BulimWs ' cargo was not so innocent as appeared, and that the over-carried sugar seized 10m the ' Pahnacntta' was for Ismail Marafi, and further that two consignments of sunar (25 and 26 cases respectively), and one of hardware, landed m I pn 191l'after transhipment from a German steamer, together with -o cases o o-ar landed by the ' Palmacotta ' in July, probably contained arms. Definite informa'tion was, however, awaited, before making representations to Sheikh Mubarek on the subject. APPENDIX XVI. i Alnhan inland routes.-The active operations conducted Irom (.aleg to Bint and in Biyaban in April and-May 19 1, had their nnmedia e effect in disturbing the 'Afghans' arrangements, and encouraging the local Amirs to resist their caravans. Further encouragement in the same direction was •ilTorded by the agreement made with the Sardars of Geh and Bint. I he result however, of botli these could only be partial llie Mekran and Bivaban districts are bound to be overrun periodically by Afghan amis caravans unless the caravans can be checked far inland near their point of departure. p S. 198 r50 Major Webb-Ware, Political Agent, Chagai, drew up an interesting memorandum regarding the two main routes followed by the caravans northwards from the coast, and the possible means of blocking these. The first route was via Gurg and Nasratabad Sipeh to Baluch Ab, and thence to the Helmund, which it strikes either at Dek Dela or Band-i-Khamal Khan. From Haluch Ab to the Helmund there was an alternative route via Reg and the Shelag. In either case, however, it would be commanded by the post which Major Webb-Ware suggested should be established at Dehaneh Baghi. The second route, and the more popular, was that from either Hyderabad or Sharguz to Gurg, thence along the foot of the hills west of Nasratabad Sipeh, through Nakila to Lash Jawain. This again would be directly covered by the post at Dehaneh Baghi, which being well supplied with water and of good climate was a suitable spot to select; moreover it was connected already with Bam by telegraph. Major Webb-Ware anticipated that these two routes would be deserted by the Afghans as soon as the post at Dehaneh Baghi were established ; and they would have to fall back on (a) the route through Ladgasht, and thence either by Nok Kundi and Amir Chah, or by Isa Tahir and Manzil to the Helmund, or (6) the route via Regan to Bam and thence east of Kabis. Of these route (a) would be commanded by the fort shortly to be built at Sohtagan, while (6) lies within easy striking distance of Kerman. Both could be effectually covered by 50 men at Merni and 50 more at Mashki Chah. Altogether, with a detachment at Kacha to man Saindak and Robat with sub -detachments, with another detachment at Dehaneh Baghi, the fort at Sohtagan, and active measures at Kermau, the arms trade would receive a fatal blow. . 1 „ • n • As against the political difficulties of posting such a force in Persian territory, there was the notoriously leeble attitude? o i the I eisian a ut hoi ities and the importance to us of the telegraph to be urged. ii. Suggestions /or a cheaper method of hlodiade. Mr. Gregson, at much the same period, submitted a scheme for combating the trade on the coast under its altered conditions, for the 7th .lune 1911. smuggling of large quantities at a 1235-11. time was giving place to smuggling small consignments; and the change would be complete as soon as the large depot at Sohar was depleted. By land, Mr. Gregson suggested a levy corps oi 150 men to guard the telegraph line, with two outposts at Galeg and Sadaich of 50 men each; 25 men would be stationed at Jask and Char bar respectively, and these two stations would be connected by wireless telegraphy, Lo-operation would be provided by the troops at Jask and Char bar, and towards Gwattar on the west by the levies from Jinuri, near Gwadar. By sea, he proposed to replace the expensive subsidised ships by lour ships of about 100 tons, of the type of ' fish carriers,' with an economical speed of 10 knots, and a maximum of 15, fitted with wireless, and distilling apparatus. With these boats practically continuously on their beats the Mekran and Biyaban coasts could be effectively policed, and any additional force needed on the latter by land might be supplied by subsidised local forces from Sirik and Kohistak. The Resident in the Gulf disagreed with Mr. Gregson's hypothesis, being of opinion that any relaxation or modification, as suggested, of the blockade, would at once lead to a revival of the smuggling of large consignments. Secondly, he could not agree to the proposal for the Biyaban-Bunder Abbas tract; as an alternative he suggested the extension of the telegraph line by land from Jask to Minab (the existing line is submarine from Jask to Bunder Abbas) with line-guard levies as on the Jask-Charbar section. While confining himself to the Mekran aspect of the question he supported Major Webb-Ware's scheme, unless there were likely to be objections to it from Afghanistan. Finally, he urged the desirability of posting an agent with a strong escort to Bampur, as an encourogement to the loyal Mirs and a deterrent to the Afghan dealers.The Government of India considered these proposals, and while feeling that Mr. Greason's scheme would not be found adequate, could not support the proposal of a land line from -Task to the neighbourhood of Bundei Abbas, owing (jrstly to the expense, and secondly, to the inevitable objections that would be raised by Persia to the levy corps guarding it. Persia s objections opposed an equally insuperable objection to the posting of an agent to Bampur, APPENDIX XVIL Prize moneij for the Blockading Force. The question of prize money is naturally one ior adjustment at^ a considerable time after the actual captures are made, and in tin special circumstances of the blockade in the Persian Gulf hoie soivices were rendered by the Imperial forces largely on behalf of the Indian Government and consequently adjustments have to be made regarding the incidence of the awards, the interval between capture and issue o\ the award is perhaps greater than usual. For this reason the captures made since May 1010, have not vet been treated so far as the award of prize money is affected, and the following paragraphs deal onlv with awards for captures effected beloic o st Mav 1910. ' ' i i • i T j • i . i + ^ 'To oive a complete account of the awards to which India has contributed it is necessary to go back to a period before the institution of a regular blockade. X. On 18th April 19(\s, H.M .S. u Proserpine ' captured a consignment of arms consisting of 83G rifles and P. 3269 09. g9 Martini-Henry carbines. The Ad- miraltv in a letter dated 17th April 1909 approached the Secretary of State for India to know what he would be prepared to contribute towards the award which the Treasury were ready to approve. According to Mr. Holland's assessment (Consul at .Muscat; the value of the arms was Us. 45 per rille and Ks. 30 per cai bine. According to the Admiralty's assessment the value was Us. 41 per ntie, and Rs. 32 per carbine. The Government of India, however, to whom the weapons were or no service value, assessed them at their value after ten years' service according to Indian Army Regulations {i .e., 'breaking up value), and judged the value to be, Rs.' 3. 6. 8 per rille and Rs. 2. 10. 8 per carbine The total value of the consignment according to the thiee \aluations was ; — 1.

' Philomel' on 24th April 1910 (excluding this her captures were valued at 972L) As in nearly every case the arms and ammunition captured were sunk or otherwise destroyed, it was impracticable to calculate the amount of the award in the usual manner in prize cases, i.e., by a certain proportion of the receipts obtained from the sale of the captures in the market. In the case of captures made by ships other than the ' Philomel ' the Admiralty asked that the Secretary of State should authorize a grant from Indian reA r enues &gt;M?Ar V ^ 0 &lt; nt t ^ ie breaking-up value of the arms {see case of &lt;( H.M.S. 4 Proserpine' in 1908), and such further sum as may be agreed upon in lespect of the ammunition.' The 'Philomel ' stood in a dilferent59 category from the other ships | with the ' k Odin, and ' Alert, her charges for running and maintenance, full pay wages, and ineffective charges were a liability for India as agreed in June 1910 (P. 3609/10); the Admiralty therefore expected India to pay the whole of the award in her case. The Treasury had been consulted and gave their opinion that 2^) per cent, of the value of the dhows, arms, and ammunition as assessed at Muscat would generally be a fair award j and it was on this basis that the Admiralty suggestions were made. On this basis the total award to be made would amount to about 5,000/. j of this a portion would go to the Fox, 'Lapwing,' and 'Perseus.' But the Admiralty in recognition of the special circumstances agreed that, the actual amount to be paid by India to the awards to these three ships being dependent on the breaking-up value of the arms in the opinion of the Government of India, the 'Philomels captures amounted to 972L, or, with that of 24th April 1010 (which was not included by the Admiralty), 15,405L The whole question was referred to the Government oi India. ^ They replied that as the ' Philomel' was one of the ' additional ' ships engaged solely for blockade, and her Marine Department Letter, 22nd Au- c | iar g es W ere entirely borne by India, gust 1912. ^ they were prepared to bear the w r hole p - 3506 / 12 - of the award in her case, but suggested 10 per cent, only as a fair proportion to be granted. A\ hen pressed lor reasons for this reduction they had no valid arguments, and expressed themselves ready to accept the full Telegram from Viceroy, 28th Xovem- ^5 p ei . cent regards the breaking- ber 1912 - up value of the arms they suggested a grant from Indian revenues of Rs. 15 per 100 weapons, and Rs. 5 per 1,000 rounds of ammunition. Action was deliberated on this basis. 1 4t „ The captures made by H. M.S. 'Fox,' ' Lapwing,' and Perseus amounted to 8,03-1 rifles, and 1,296,100 rounds of ammuniUon ; their va ue at India's suggested rate was respectively Rs. V-Oo, and Rs b,500 about 51This appeared a ludicrously small amount especially when it is rpmembered that India retained the only serviceable weapons (l,4oO •303 rifles and carbines seized by H.M.S. 'Perseus 'in May 1910), whose ^ The'' i'hlbmelV^ c'pul'es amounted to 15.4051. The whole 25 per cent, of this was to be borne by India, i.e., 3,85U. In addition there were the dhows captured by the subsidized ships. 1 ie value of a dhow is apparently a minimum of 100L For the two captured by the ' Philomel' the Government of India in their telegram gave a rough estimate of 400i It was thought that 1001. per dhow would meet the case, making a ■i total of TOOL for the three subsidized ships. 25 per cent, of tins - I/at., (of which 1001. would be the ' Philomel's ' share making in all tor her shaie 3 9511 with 3.851/. tor arms, &amp;c.) would be India's share. Considering the success of the blockade, and the hardships involved by the work on the officers and men of the Koyal Navy, the Secretary ol State was not satisfied with tL proportion (514/.) which India would pay to the three ships other ,ha Xh l ( ! &lt;: Vdmiral'tv' had, however, demi-olficially intimated that they would accept 20 per cent, instead of the 25 per cent, originally suggested by the basis the ' Philomel' would get S.ICU. ; the other three ships J&amp;irJfSSU. urn (if, *'«.

QAPPENDIX XIX. Conditions of Compensation suggested in July 1 ( .)12 by Major Knox. France and Oman being in accord. A.—Only bond fide transactions which originated before 22nd July 1912 will be considered. Any transaction which appears to be a deliberate attempt on the part of merchants of other nationalities to escape effect of His Highness's proclamation will be ruled oat. {N.B. —22nd July 1912 was selected because it was the date on which French instructions reached the French Consul: it would be preferable to pat back the date to that of the Sultan's proclamation). B.—Arms of French origin in hands of French merchants will be bought outright by Sultan at market price. {N.B. —Presuming His Majesty's Government would really pay, His Majesty's Government will own them and be entitled to dispose as it pleases. His Highness would have to pay for any he wished to retain, a point for His Majesty's Government and His Highness only). C.—No compensation to be paid for arms of which origin is not traced, i.e., when French holder cannot, show by what transaction they came into his hands. D.—No arms which have remained in hands of same French holder for more than two years will be eligible for compensation. (N.B. —Presumably dead stock, unsaleable). E.—Only bond fide French subjects or proteges are entitled to compensation. (For this purpose French proteges must not include other nationals, their partners or permanent employes). F.—A distinction must be drawn between arms the actual property of French traders resident in Muscat and those for which they are merely agents. (a) If the principal is a French firm full compensation will be paid, i.e., arms will be bought as in B. {h) If principal is foreign firm {i.e., not French) only compensation for agency rights will be paid and arms will go into warehouse and be sold in ordinary way. (Jn 'sale of such arms ' French trader should repay to His Highness from the price of such arms some fixed percentage of ' agency compensation ' already paid. If arms are merely got rid of at a loss in bulk 0 by transfer between traders no agency compensation need be returned.! APPENDIX XX. Warehouse Rules. Notice by His Highness Sir Seyyid Faisal-bin Turin, (J.C.I.E., Saltan of Muscat and Oman.

The said rules will be held to apply to all arms and ammunition or parts thereof held in our territories by traders for sale on the date of the intro duction of the said rules, and to all such arms, ammunition, or parts thereof as may be thereafter imported into our territories. On, or about, but not before, the 1st September 1912, a subsidiary notice will be issued in due course confirming these draft rules and notifying the date on which the rules so confirmed shall come into operation. * Agent must be excluded from such transactions as a principal. t Agency compensation might be reckoned according to fixed per centage of ' difference between invoice \alue of' goods and market price, regard being had to trade custom in this respect.Draft Rules. Rule 1.—All arms, amnmnition, or parts thereof, held by traders for sale to the public within my dominions, shall be deposited forthwith in the arms warehouse in accordance with these regulations. The warehouse superintendent will grant detailed receipt to the depositor for all such arms, ammunition, or parts thereof in the form attached and marked A. liide 2. —After the expiry of one month from the date on which these rules come into operation, all arms, ammunition, or parts thereof found in the possession of traders (except in accordance with the provisions of llule 15 hereinafter mentioned), contrary to the provisions of Rule 1 aforesaid, shall be confiscated.

If the offending trader be a subject of any of the Powers in treaty relations with me, information will be laid against him to the Consul of the Power whose subject ov protege he may be, and the aforesaid Consul will be requested to deal with him according to law and treaty and the spirit of these regulations. Rule 3.—In addition to all or any of the penalties imposed by these rules, should any trader be found guilty in the proper forum of offending against the provisions of Rule 1 aforesaid, all arms, ammunition, or parts thereof held in the Muscat arms warehouse to the credit of such offending trader, or that may subsequently be deposited in the arms warehouse in his name under the provisions of Rule 4, will, without further sentence of forfeiture, be liable to confiscation. Rule 4.—All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof which may hereafter be imported into Muscat territory will be taken direct to the arms warehouse and there deposited. £ 1 Rule 5.—For the more effective carrying out of the provisions of the preceding rule, the masters of steamers importing arms and ammunition or parts thereof will be required to produce on arrival and furnish to the representative of the warehouse superintendent, who will attend on board, the copy of a separate manifest, in the form attached and marked B, showing all arms and ammunition and parts thereof destined for importation into my territories and carried on board their vessels. Rule G.—All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof destined for import into Muscat, but not detailed, or incorrectly or insufficiently described, in the separate manifest (Form B), especially with regard to the marks on the packages or the name of the consignee, shall, as soon as such arms, ammunition, or parts thereof have left the ship's tackles, become liable to confiscation. . i in i • Exception.- —The sole exception to the operation of this rule shall he in the case of arms, ammunition, or parts thereof landed by mistake in good faith and clearly destined for some other port to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited. The burden of proving lhat such arms and ammunition were intended for import to a port to which the import of arms and ammunition is not prohibited shall lie on the steamer s agent, importer, or consignee. No claims under this exception will be entertained after a period of three mouths from date of landing of the goods in respect of which the claim is made. . , • ^ Rule 7.—All arms, ammunition, or parts thereof, deposited in the arms warehouse in accordance with the provisions of Rule 4, shall be claimed by the consignee within a period of three months from the date of deposit in the arms warehouse. . , , -n i • ^ On such claim being made the warehouse superintendent will, subject to the provisions of Rules 8 and 8.\. immediately following, and aftei due veri fication of the bill of lading and steamer's agent's delivery order, grant a detailed receipt in Form A above mentioned. r ^ i &lt; Rule 8.—As soon as, in accordance w T itli the provisions ot Kule 4 aforesaid, arms and ammunition or parts thereof are brought to the arms warehouse to be there deposited, the superintendent, arms warehouse, shall notify the superintendent of customs of the arrival of such arms, ammu nition or parts thereof by form attached and marked C (Arabic) m order that duty may be collected thereon by the superintendent ol customs. s. 198. ftG4 Rule 8 a. -As soon as such duty has been paid, the superintendent o£ customs shall immediately return to the superintendent, arms warehouse, the form marked C, duly endorsed with a certificate that the duty has been fully paid on the arms, ammunition, and parts thereof noted in the form aforesaid, and the superintendent, arms warehouse, shall in no case grant the detailed receipt in Form A unless and until he shall have received back the form marked C duly endorsed, as already described by the superintendent of customs. Rule 9.—Failure by consignee to comply with the provisions of either of the three preceding rules shall render the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof liable to confiscation. Issue of Arms, Armnunition, or parts thereof from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 10. —Any person proposing to purchase arms, ammunition, or parts thereof from any trader, owning arms, ammunition, or parts thereof stored in the arms warehouse in accordance with the provisions of Rules 1 and 4 above, and duly claimed under the provisions of Rule 7, and on which duty and warehouse charges have been fully paid in accordance with the provisions of Rules 8 and 10 respectively, will be permitted to withdraw arms and ammunition or parts thereof on the production of, and to the extent covered by, a licence in form marked D and attached. On the application of the trader concerned, who must be present at such withdrawal, the warehouse superintendent shall draw up the licence aforesaid, and submit it for my approval and signature. Rule 11.—It shall be the duty of the warehouse superintendent to refuse to draw up any such licence, should he have reason to suppose— (а) That the purchaser whose name it is proposed to enter in form D as ' bearer ' intends to resell the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof to any other person; (б) That such purchaser is already, whether by licence in Form D previously issued or otherwise, in possession of arms, ammunition, or parts thereof, whence it may be inferred that the arms, ammunition, or parts thereof covered by the licence under question, are not required solely for the personal use or protection of the purchaser. Rule 12.—It shall further be the duty of the warehouse superintendent to ensure that— (a) All rifles issuing from the arms warehouse under the terms of any licence, issued in accordance with the provisions of these rules, shall be clearly marked on the barrel before withdrawal with the official mark, and on the butt with the serial number of issue ; (h) No more than ^00 rounds per rifle per annum shall be issued from the arms warehouse to any holder of a licence under Form D ; (c) In the event of a licence under Form D being issued for ammunition only, which must not in any case exceed 200 rounds per annum per purchaser, the purchaser produces, for the inspection of the warehouse superintendent, the weapon in respect of which the ammunition is required.

If it is found not to be so marked, the Superintendent shall, after marking the weapon with the marks and number of the Arms Warehouse, refer the question of the legality of possession of the weapon to me for orders. The burden of proving that the weapon was innocently come by and not in infringement of the rules of the Arms Warehouse, will lie on the owner and, should he fail to prove innocent possession, the weapon shall be liable to confiscation. Rule 14.—All owners of any firearms, kept in our territories for personal use and protection, are earnestly advised to briug them to the Muscat Arms Warehouse to be marked with an official number and mark as soon as possible. Within a reasonable period of the publication of these rules, it is intended to alter Rules 12 (c) and 13 in such a way that no ammunition will be allowed to issue from the Arms Warehouse except to—(a) holders of rifles or firearms marked with the official mark and number of the Arms Warehouse, (6) purchasers of new rifles or firearms issuing from the Arms Warehouse. Rule 15. To meet the needs of traders who may desire to expose in their shops a sample of arms and ammunition for sale, a trader's licence in Form E, Arabic form ( ), can be procured by them from the Warehouse Superin tendent.

Agreement with Sardar Seyyid Khan of Geh, and Sardar Islam Khan of Bint. Whereas the present annual influx of Afghan arms smugglers into Mekran and the contraband traffic in arms along the coast is found to be a ca, ' se ' lawlessness which results in damage to the telegraph line and danger to the staff, and whereas Sardar Seyyid Khan of Gaih, paramount chief of Mekian. and Sardar Islam Khan of Bint have expressed their readiness to afford their co-operation for the termination of this state of things , It is therefore agreed that, so long as the said Sardars shall act up f 0 said conditions detailed below, each of them will be granted forapmod o five years from® 1911, an additional allowance ol 800 rupees per annum which will lie paid in half-yearly instalments through the head of the^telegraph station at Charbar, on the 1st April and 1st October of each year, so^loug as the two Sardars work in harmony and act up to the conditions laid down. The conditions are :— 1 They will at once report to the officer in charge of the nearest telegrapli ' Station the arrival or presence of any Afghans in the neigbourhood of their country. Thev will do their utmost severally and jointly to prevent the passage of'Afghans through their territory, and will neither protect nor conceal them, nor assist them with transport, provisions, guides, nor in any other way. . .. Thev w ill n ot cede, sell or mortgage, or otherwise give tor occupation to' \Hians any part of their territories, nor allow Afghans to obtain a footing in their country as Khalifa Khair Muhammad sought to do. . , * &lt;1 Thev will take steps to prevent their dependents from becoming agen s for the purchase of arms, and to punish nakhodas known to have imported cargoes of arms, and will generally warn their subjects against participating in the illicit traffic themselves, or associating themselves with or using the vessels ot those so engagec. r &gt; Thev will bring to notice the names of Baluchis known to be aiding •uid abetting the traffic, and will hand over if called u P on ' f or punishment by constituted authority, any of their own dependents found to be so implicated.

For an effective blockade it was estimated by the Admiralty in their P. 4286/09. letter of 2nd December 1909 that the following force would be required :— Three ' additionar 1 ships of the Royal Navy (i.e., in addition to such ^ of the subsidised ships as might be employed). Eight launches for patrol work. One Royal Indian Marine ship to act as depot ship. The three ' additional ' ships selected were H.M.S. ' Odin ' and ' Alert,' specially commissioned from the reserve, and H.M.S. ' Philomel ' which as stated above, was already in the Persian Gulf. ' For the use of these three ships their Lordships proposed to charge 84,000/. per annum. In a subsequent letter, dated 27th June 1910, a more detailed proposal of the share to be borne by India was set forth:— (i) The employment of H.M.S. ' Odin ' was to count from Uth Januarv 1910. The employment of H.M.S. ' Alert ' was to count from 15th February 1910 (excluding the period 29th March to 25th May 1910, when she was employed elsewhere). The employment of H.M.S. ' Philomel,' was to count from 3rd November 1909 (date of arrival in the Gulf). (11) 1 he Government of India was to bear all expenses in respect of these three ships, including depreciation and special fittings for the ' Odin ' and ' Alert.' (iii) The Government of India further was to bear all expenses for the hire, running, and manning of the eight launches employed, all the Royal Indian Marine ship or ships, and the launch ' Whimbrel.' ( Manning it may be observed, includes the pay allowances and passages out and home of the ollicers and crews of the launches, and of signallers for the R.I.M.S. ships, but excludes non-effective changes for the above, and passages in the cases of ratings drawn from the East India station). These proposals as regards the incidence on Indian funds of the cost of the blockade were accepted by Lord Morley 'generally,' on 21st July 1910. H. Various estimates of the expenditure both Military and Marine to be incuired by India I uing been marie from time to time by the Government of India. In a telegram of 17th January 1910 two comparative statements were P. 3075/10. prepared of estimated expenditure for (1) a four months' blockade, (2) a twelve months' blockade. For 12 months the cost was estimated at about 250,000Z. which has proved to be rather an over-estimate. In October and December 1910 an estimate of the cost up to 31st March 1911 was arrived at,—viz., 229,532L This apparently did not include the extra subsidy to the Admiralty ^ nor did the estimate of Rs. 1,11,000 per mensem (8b,000?. per annum) which was taken as the approximate cost for future extensions of the blockade. further estimates lor the land operations in Mekran in April and May .1911, (I. 4.&gt;&gt;11), for the continuance of the blockade to 30th November 1911), (P. 1247/11), and for its extension to 31st March 1912 (P. 1709/11) were prepared in turn. 1 he last is of interest as it showed an estimated expenditure of about 37,000?. in excess of that provided for in the Budget. HI. All these estimates, however, have been superseded by the revised statement accompanying Financial letter of 12th October 1911. ^ It is set forth m some detail, as it is the latest estimate received from India. It has been necessary, however, to supplement it by estimates based on averages in order to bring it up to date.72 Estimate for 1912-13 {nine months to 3\st December 1912) At an average based on the figures estimated for 1910-11, and 1911 -12 (1909-10 is not included as the expenses owing to the commencement were exceptionally high), 1912-13 would amount to 172,4501 Qp to date, there- toie (olst December 1912), the estimate would be— 172,450 —^ x 9 = 129,340Z. rough h lvr08 t ) 5 O 00/ heblOCkade t0 31St December 1912 amo ' nts therefore to 1\ .

APPENDIX XXIII. 739/10. 1024/10. Suggested Territorial and other Concessions in India in return for the cession of her Treaty Tiights at Muscat hy ]' i (nice. The French Government has refused all attempts to come to an arrangement on the basis of territorial compensation in India ; but it may be as well to put on record what actually has been offered. The first suggestion of territorial compensation in India as a quid pro quo for French co -operation at Muscat was made in \ iscount Morley s telegram of 22nd April 1910, the general situation being only the possibility ol securing a prohibition of the trade for one year (see paragraph 71). The-Government of India replied in a telegram dated 19th May 1910 that compensation might be afforded in the neighbourhood of I ond.cherry. In a letter dated 30th June 1910 the Government of India stated that an area of 138 square iiijicb v . uxiicijih ^ ^ ^ j -.- + i,_ Rs. 2,56,091, near Pondicherry, could be ceded, but that a condition of the cession must be the surrender by France of the scattered I rench loges including Chandernagore, a dangerous centre ol sedition. Further concessions to France, if required, might be made in respect of extradition arrangements. The cession of territory, it was estimated, would mean the sacrifice of 2| lakhs of revenue. j ^ a The negotiations for a year's prohibition came to nothing, and the o er made above failed to effect any result. It was not acceptable to I rancea the surrender of Chandernagore, which was a qtia 7ion with the Government of India, could not, M. Cambon said, be put before the 1 rench PUl But as negotiations with France were still being carried on in a desultory fashion the Government of India went further into the question of what concessions in India were possible. They found themselves able to offer First an increase of the territory that might be ceded near Pondicherry viz. a total of 210 square miles containing 140 villages. This area was miles containing 85 villages, with a revenue of 663/11.522/11. 929 /11. 1192/11. 522/11. 3256 /11. comprised of 1^&gt;8 scjunie milos witli 113 villages m tlie \ ilupur&lt;iiii taluk of the Southern Arcot district—revenue Rs. 3,33,102 ; and of 28 square miles in Cuddalore taluk with 27 villages yielding in revenue of Us. CI 542 • i .e., a total revenue of Rs. 3,94,044. Second, some possible concession in respect of a railway which the l 1 1ench authorities at 1 ondicherry had long been desirous of constructing from Pondicherry to Tirupapuliyur in British territory. The construction of the line would probably involve the diversion of a certain amount of trade from Butish to French ports, the conditions proposed by the French Government regarding its construction (that the South Indian Railway should construct it at a fixed price and under French control and jurisdiction) were objection able to the Government of Madras, but not insuperable. Conditions regarding its working, especially the control of rates by the French offered a stfll more serious objection, which, however, the Government of Madras were willing to subordinate to Imperial interests, if required, if a modification of the French conditions could be achieved, by which the rates should be below the South Indian Railway Company s minimum rates, construction and juris diction should be British in British territory, and the net earnings should be shared on a mileage scale. Third, concessions in respect uf extradition, by the repeal of Article 16 of the Extradition Treaty of 1876,^ the effect of which action would be to empower the French in India to refuse the surrender of their nationals. As a condition to either the first or second concession the surrender bv I ranee of ('handernagore was insisted on. In Sir R. Ritchie's letter of 1st April 1911 to the Foreign Office it was suggested that ii any of these offers were to be made to France they should be limited in the first instance! to the smaller territorial concessions put forward in June 1010; and if this were not enough, then the railway concession, and then the extradition concession might be offered; and, lastly, tn extremis, the full territorial concession of 21C square miles. As a matter of fact, in March 1911 M. Cambon intimated that a deal confined to territorial concessions in India was inadmissible, and the question of Gambia was raised. 1 his was declared by His Majesty's Government to be outside practical consideration, and lately the question of a bargain has turned in the direction of the sacrifice of British transit trade rights in Morocco in return for equal treatment with France in respect of cotton imports in Funis, together with France's acceptance of the situation at Muscat. It is always, however, possible that some of the concessions in India mentioned in this Appendix may be revived to balance the bargain. the existing article in effect retains Article IX. of the Extradition Treaty of 1815, by which the authorities of the French settlements in India are bound to surrender any French citizen whose extradition is demanded for offences committed in British territory, on the mere production of the warrant of arrest. t 1 he first offer was also to include a money compensation of 100.000/. (later reduced to oO.OOOZ.) for the loss of trade at Muscat. c&lt;5 I N 1) E X. 100, 118 110, 111 178, 199 97 96 83 Paragraphs.
