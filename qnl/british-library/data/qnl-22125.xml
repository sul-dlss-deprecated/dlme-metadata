For thi« purpose I ahould bo grateful if you could provide mo *lth certain figures relating to labour, materials and services which will be of aaalatance In estimating the total annual value of the wealth producing activities withi* the State. This total consists of, roughly, the following items A. Total man-days of hired labour x average wage. B. Total material produced x value per unit. C. Total value of services rendered. &amp;. Much of the payments are made by a few large companies so if the companies could supply the Government with approximate figures, for the year 1947, it would be of great assistance in calculating the total national income. Payments made to the Ctovarnmant Itself are not required. 3.
