General .—Owing to the absence of reliable data giving a consecu tive record of this country its existing history cannot bnt be in complete and,-to some extent, inaccurate, as a portion of that which is available is derived from what has been passed down by word o f month from one generation to another. As regards the later history—outstanding events, in the order in which they took place, are tabulated below. The history of the Muntafiq together with that of the Sa'dun (their ruling family) is dealt with separately. General History. Date. Muntafiq History. Basrah consisted of 10,000 houses. 1604 The Shah of Persia demanded that the Pasha of Basrah should acknowledge the suzerainty of Persia, since Basrah had captured Portn- guese trade after the fall of Hormuz and its evacuation by the Portuguese. This was refused. A Persian army therefore advanced on Basrah via Arabistan, but failed owing to the intervention of Portuguese vessels on the Karun. 1624 A second Persian Army was sent against Basrah this time vid Qurnah. This also was forced to retire. 1625 Basrah came under Turkish control. 1669 12 General History. Date. Muntafiq History.

Persians evacuated Basrah, as Sadiq Khan, being: at Basrah at the time, wished to contest the Persian throne on the death of his brother Karim Khan. 1779 - Basrah eventually reverted peacefully to Turkish juris diction, but during the interim an Arab administra tion organised by the British Residency undertook tempo rary management. 1779 . 1787 (May) Basrah was seized and governed by Thuwaini, the Sa’dum Shaikh of the Muntafiq. 1787 (October) Thuwaini was expelled from Basrah by Sulaiman Pasha. Governor of Baghdad. / 1797 to 1802 Ihe Muntafiq fonned the chief bulwark of Basrah against the Wahabis of Central Arabia (of whom Ibn Saud is the present leader). 1798 The Muntafiq marched with the Turks into Hasa against the Wahabis. • 1807 The Muntafiq conquered the Qurnah tribes. % 1810 to 1817 The Muntafiq apparently in open rebellion against the Pasha of Baghdad.General History.

Humudal Thamir and was defeated and killed. This resulted in a great increase in the power of the Sa’dun and the extension of their rule up to Samawah. Baud Pasha of Baghdad tried to break up the Muntafiq by installing a rival chief. This intrisrue failed. Humud’g son, Majid, re gained the old indepen dence and ascendancy of the Sa’dun. The Muntafiq were divided against themselves re garding the paramount Shaikhship. This was claimed by Paris bin Ajil and his cousin Mansur bin Rashid. The latter, al though recognised by the Turks, was driven out by Paris. Trade suffered considerably and from this time onwards the Turkish hold on the Mnntafiq strengthened.l lo 5 General History.

Muntafiq History. 1881 The Mnntafiq tribe rose in open rebellion against the Turkish Government. They attacked Nasirlyah and were beaten off. This rebellion was never properly quelled. The Turks appear to have collected no taxes from this date. 1899 and 1902 The Muntafiq approached the British Consul at Basrah for British protec tion. This was refused. 1900 to 1905 The Muntafiq under Sa’dun Pasha harassed the Turks. Turks sent 3 punitive expeditions under Muhammad Pasha Daghestani with no good result: Madinah (under Hamud) defeated by Bani Mansur, Sharish and Nahairat under IWazya 1 : with Kubasbi as his Lieutenant. 1902 1905 The Muntafiq divided their allegiance between the two cousins Sa’dun Pasha and Falih Pasha (son of the exiled Nasir pasha).General History.

Sa’dun and his son Ajaimi held out until the Turks changed their policy, sided with the tribesmen, treacherously decoyed and captured Sa’dun, and exiled him to Aleppo where he died. 1912 After Sa’dun’s death the Muntafiq country was administered from Janu- ary—November by a Military Mutassarrif, Farid Beg, who was a staunch supporter of the Committee of Union and Progress, and on friendly terms with Ajaimi..

The Muntajiq Confederation.—Tho Muntafiq Confederation is a powerful tribal league which occupies an area on the Euphrates from Darraji to Chabaish extending as far North as Hai town on the Gharraf. At the present day (May 1920) the link between the various units of the league is slender; it being no more than a common recognition of the now nominal paramount authority of the Sa’dun. The Sa’dun are the ruling family of the Muntafiq and are descended from Mani. one of the Sharifs of Mecca, who, in about 1600 A.D., fled to the Euphrates to escape the consequences of a feud. Mani married a daughter of the ruling family of the Bani Malik and had a son from her named Shafcib. The Bani Malik were attacked and heavily defeated by the Ajwad, Mani himself being killed. The Bani Malik made their escape into Najd, and took Shabib with them since he was the grandson of their own shaikh. After an exile of 3 years the Bani Malik, reinforced from Central Arabia led by Shabib, fell upon and almost exterminated the Ajwad who were encamped at Safwan. A few men and a total of forty women are said to have been all that were spared. Shabib thus, by virtue of his military powers, became leader of the Bani Malik and over-lord of the Ajwad, this combination becoming so powerful that it was joined by the Bani Sa’id, a tribe of the Jazir&amp;h. These three divisions formed, and still form the Mnntafiq league. . 2. The Sa’dun Familt/.—The Sa’dun, or the titular ruling family of the Muntafiq are Sunnis; the tribesmen of the Muntafiq are (with very few exceptions which are noted in the tribal lists) Shiahs. Although the sedentary and “Donkey Bedouin” tribes of Meso potamia are, for the most part, of good Arab stock and can claim descent from the best old blood of Arabia, they have lost caste by settling down and becoming Shiahs. They are now despised by the genuine Bedouin who will not inter-marry with them. The Sa’dun, though they have lived in Lower Mesopotamia since the 16th century, are in a separate category. Descended from the family of the Sharif of Mecca, Sunni to this day, and Bedouin in their manner of life they are accepted as equals by the pure Arabs of Arabia.10 Up to about 1870 the Muntafiq tribes under the Sa’dun, were almost independent of Turkish rule. They paid tribute to the Sa’dun and not rent. At this time the Sbaikship was held by the Nasir Pasha (the founder of Nasirlyah) who, under the evil influence of Midbat Pasha, Wali of Baghuad, welcomed and introduced the Ottomanising in fluence among the Mnntafiq which had so long been desired by the Turkish administration. Being backed up by Nasir Pasha and, the opportunity appearing favourable, the Turks at this juncture made a disastrous bid at a regular land settlement. The Sa’dun were bribed into accepting the change by being con- verted into regular landowners in place of their original positions as chiefs, receiving tribute from the owners of the land, who were the Muntafiq tribesmen. The result of this change was that the tribesmen lost their status as landowners and became mere tenants. The whole of the arable land of Jsasiriyah and Suq ash Bkuyukh was then parcelled out by Tapu registration between the Sa’duns and the Turkish Crown. The tribes were not consulted and had no say in these arrangements. The change was naturally a most disadvantageous and degrading one to them ; and was and still is bitterly resented. We are now (May 1920) still involved in settling this legacy from Midhat Pasha. From this period both the Sa’dun chiefs and the Turkish rulers lost power over the tribes. The Muntafiq district became lawless and unsettled. There was constant fighting either against the Turks on account of the non payment of an increased rate of revenue, or amongst themselves on account of inter-family intrigues. Finally in 1911 the Turkish Government was compelled to institute a committee of inquiry to investigate the cause of the rising against Sa’dun Pasha by some of the Muntafiq tribes (mainly Abiidah, Azairij, Khafajah, Budur and Ghazzi). This committee attiibuced the trouble to the fact that “ The arable lauds of the tribes were in the hands of a few powerful shaikhs who oppressed the tribesmen.” The result of this was that the Turks withdrew all official support from the Sa’dun, completely reversed their policy and sought to enter into relations with the tribesmen in hopes of breaking up the tribal system (see under “ Policy ” in Chapter VI). Sa’dun Pasha was treacherously decoyed on board the gunboat Marmaris near Suq and sent for confinement to Basrah ; thence he was transferred to Aleppo vtd Baghdad where he died. The position of the Sa’dun therefore at this stage had become impossible. Deserted by the official backing of the Government and without power or influence over the tribes to enforce their will or evei the; 1 stre sue inti ver I ren the allc fac pro I Offi 1 us of and I an; ha( the agi or ind sw Sh m&lt; at ah rai evi K1 we ,lu As on th&lt; we Se Tb fre11 in, were ie Sa’dun isha (the at Pas-ha, nising in- ed by the and, the are made eing con- positions who were sir status le arable i out by U gements. egrading are now Pasha. ih rulers here was the non- elves on institute against Abiidah, ttiibuted s were in aen.” support )ught to g up the n Pasha near Suq t'erred to L become nent and r will or even the rights they had acquired from the Ottoman Govemment r they were left friendless, helpless, and without rents. In July 1915 Nasiriyab was occupied by us, but owing to the strong anti-British feeling among the tribes and to the activities of such men as Mizhar Pasha (a Circassian Turkish General with much influence among the tribes) and Sabn Beg (a Turkish cavalry leader) very little progress was made for some time. In order temporarily to compensate the ^a’dun for the loss of their rents and to help them, to some extent, to keep up their status as the ruling family rve have since our occupation been paying cash allowances to certain members of the family. This is an unsatis factory arrangement and will cease when a better solution of the problem is forthcoming. , Early in 1918 we opened up the Gharraf by installing Political Officers at Shatrah and Qal’at Sikar. In 1919 for the first time for many years the tribes not only paid us all the taxes we levied upon them but also paid up the proportion of the crop, levied by us, as payment of fent due to their landlords and hated enemy—the Sa’dun. Since 1903 until 1919 the Muntafiq country had paid no taxes to any Government and but little rent to its landlords, for so independent had the tribes become that they merely paid as much or as little as they pleased. Insurrection and present situation in Muntafiq .—In 1920 taxes again ceased to be paid on account of the insurrection, due to a Jihad or Holy war being preached throughout the country. The first indication of internal disorder and unrest in the Muntafiq was apparent at the beginning of May, when disturbing reports arrived from Hillah and Shamiyah of secret pacts alleged to have been sworn by the leaders of the Gharraf, Hillah, Dwaniyah and Shamiyah to tear up the railway line and otherwise resist Govern ment. During May unrest was noticeable in Shatrah and Suq and at the beginning of June the political situation gave rise to consider able uneasiness. In June and July the situation became serious, the railway line between Shamawah and Khidhr amongst other unsettling events being destroyed, whilst the Arabs were advancing on Al Khidhr, three miles from the Muntafiq boundary. The Muntatiq were still watching and waiting the turn of events. At the end oi July a rising was planned in Qal’at Sikar and on August 12th, the Assistant Political Officer was compelled to evacuate. Consequent on this the situation at Shatrah became delicate and on August 23rd, the Assistant Political Officer, Shatrah, followed suit. Such disorders were bound to affect Suq, which had hitherto remained qumt, and on September 1st, the Assistant Political Officer, Suq, left for Nasiriyah. The town of Nasiriyah was never seriously threatened, though frequently sniped by day and night.In spite of these disturbances the Muntafiq can hardly be said to have pkycd a very great part in the insniJection and Sr tL cVe«Kt wo &gt;f^ n TnT al, J, t0 . theBriti9h Politi&lt;al Oncers and one or f ,,a, y an al ‘ Ubaid » al Khaiyun and Radr ar Rnmayidh.

Geography. (1) General geographical description. The area dealt with in this report covers approximately 12.000 square miles. It forms part of the great alluvial plain of Iraq, which, except for the Arabian Desert which rises to a height of 100 feet above sea level and for the isolated hill named Jabal Sanam (10 miles south of Zubair which rises to a height of 503 feet) there is no spot which is higher than 45 feet above the sea. This altitude is attained on the Shaft al Gharraf, 3 miles downstream of Hai town. The heights, above mean sea level, of certain other localities are as under: — Suq ash Shuyukh Nasiriyah . Shatrah Qal’ at Sikar 10 feet. 15 „ 30 39 „ 'The effect of the tide reaches as far up the Euphrates as Cha- haish. (2) Physical Features. The area is one of extremes, graduating from arid unproductive desert, into desert lands suitable for the grazing of camels and sheep, into fertile and cultivated areas due to controlled irriga tion, into marsh land which in its turn merges into a vast expanse of open water. (a) Rivers. The Euphrates flows through the area from West to East, entering it at Darraji and passing Nasiriyah in one stream. Downstream of Nasiriyah the Euphrates splits up into many channels which find their way into the Hammar Lake. This Lake, especially to the North, is bordered by vast marshes in which dense reeds grow to a height of 20 feet. The Euphrates has two nufin channels. The old channel flows past Chabaish, at the eastern end of the Hammar Lake and joins the Tigris at Qurnah. This is the channel for steamer navigation.14 The new channel which winds through the shallow expanse of open water lying to the north of the Hasrah-Nasirlyah Railway, finally finding its main outlet into the Shaft al Arab at Qurmat Ali. The Tigris does not traverse this area but during the flood season from (February to the end of June) much Tigris water reaches it by means of the :— Shatt al Gbarraf which is a distributary of the Tigris. The Gharraf takes off from the Tigris at Kut al Amarah and flows from North to South entering this area 3 miles south of Hai town, finally emptying itself into the Hammar Lake by several channels. In former days it joined the Euphrates at Nasiriyah. but the southern portion of this channel has silted np and the Natural line of flow is now via the Bad’ah channel, which takes off 3 miles North of Shatrah in a south easterly direction. After traversing a series of lakes its waters join those of the Euphrates in the Hammar Lake itself. The amount of water in the Gharraf is entirely dependent on the level of the Tigris at Kut al Amarah. Except for pools, which become brackish, the Gharraf runs dry by September and remains so'till about the end of December or later dependent on the Tigris rise. The Shatt al Aral flows from Qurnah to the sea at Fao and is the name given to the fine open channel, fit for ocean going vessels, which is formed by the combined waters of the Euphrates and Tigris, aug mented, at Muhammerah, by those of the Karun. Its right bank forms the lower portion of the north eastern boundary of this area. It is tidal throughout its length. (5) Flood Area. During the season when the Euphrates and Tigris are in flood, (March to the end of June) it is estimated that 4,000 square miles, (out of the total of the 12,000 which comprise this area) are inundated and covered mostly by “ Sheet water,” the borders and other shallower portions of which are absolute marsh, with dense reeds, and intersected by many channels, known only to the local inhabitants. As the ground level rises these marshes gradually merge into dry land. As the rivers subside, so also the water level in the flood area falls, leaving the marshes to dry by slow degrees; the shallower “sheet water ” then becomes marsh, the deeper “ sheet water ” remaining in the form of permanent lakes of which the most important are the Hammar, Sudaifah, Abu ’Ajil, Ghamugah, al Hassunah, Tallyah and Butmyah. (c) Desert and cultivated areas. The remainder of the country is either desert or cultivated land, of which the latter owes its fertility to water distributed t by irrigationchannels taking off direct from the main rivers or from distributary canals. (d) Soil and Grating. The soil is of calcareous loam and of great fertility. Shortly after the first rains have fallen (usually December) large areas of the pre viously bare brown desert become green with grass affording good grazing for sheep and cattle which lasts till the end of May. After this date, except for the scrub (shok) which affords good grazing for camels, the desert is absolutely bare. (e) Rate of formation of land at the North end of the Persian Gulf. According to early Sumerian records in the form of cuneiform tablets only recently discovered, Dridim (the present “ Abu Shahrain, 23 miles south-west of Nasirlyah) was the earliest of the Sumerian cities. Shortly after its foundation about 5.000 B. C. Eridhu became an important Sumerian sea port on the Persian Gnlf. It is described in cuneiform literature as “ standing on the shore of the sea.” To-day the mounds of Eridhu, surrounded by desert, lie some 160 miles distant from the Persian Gulf. From the above and other similar cuneiform records it is possible to trace roughly the northern limits of the Persian Gnlf at about 5,000 B. C. These are as follows; from the Arabian Plateau the coast line ran approxi mately due North to Eridhu and crossed the Euphrates about 11 miles north-west of Nasirlyah, thence it ran just south 'of Shatrah and continued in a general North Easterly direction to the Tigris, turning south-east below the Elamite hills (Modem Arabistan). The above together with other details admit of fairly accurate figures being arrived at which show the rates at which, from time to time, the land has advanced southwards at the head of the Persian Gulf. Tins advance is due to the accumulation of sediment brought down in suspension by the T ; gris, the Euphrates and the Karun and deposited on the sea bed as soon as the current is checked by the Shatt al Arab reaching open water. Starting from the earliest times :— (o) Eridhu was a sea port in 5,000 B. C.) Rate of advance 121 and is now 160 miles from the sea. 4 feet per annum. (J) Muhammerah is known to have been') a sea port in the time of Alexander J the Great who died in B. C. 323, f-Rate of advance 113 Muhammerah is now 50 miles from | feet per annum, the sea. J (c) Present day tests show that the rate of advance now is 90 feet per annum.16 This gradual reduction in the rate of the formation of the land is- natural—for as the “ delta ” increases in length so the slope of the river hed becomes more level, thereby reducing the velocity of the current ^ on which the amount of sediment brought down in suspension depends. filinri Shatr water or wl (5) Lines of approach. of th£ lorrief Owing to the variety of physical features of this district, movement by any force, whether large or small, requires special consideration # Oer according to season. l m8i innum (a) By Land. In the rainy season. — (December—April, both April inclusive). During or for two days after a heavy fall cr lain the impas passage of wheeled transport, and frequently of camels, is impossible. previc Except in Basrah and its vicinity there are no metalled roads. I he the u surface of any unmetalled track when wet become one of soft sticky nullah clay, which rapidly becomes worse the more it is used. In the dry intervals between the falls of rain, generally speaking, the going is -witboi good—“good” being a comparative term. There are no actual ^ “roads,” but, when dry and away from the marsh area the surface of the land is usually suitable for light motor lorries and always so for Ffc cavalry, infantry and pack transport. Tracks which become known. southe for the time being as *• roads,” lead across it from one place to another. r pj ie The main obstacles met with are wet or dry irrigation cuts of varying . being depth and sizes. Details as regards communications will be found in southe Chapter VIII. where In the non-rainy season. —(May to November both inclusive). attack The marsh area is more extensive ; there is, however, little fear of ^ m] progress being held up on account of rain : the country therefore extren where dry, is generally speaking, traversable as before mentioned.

I* 1 'Line of approach, North and South. From the north the only land line is a (desert) road from Kut-al- Hai to Nasirlyah which in general follows the course of the Shatt-al- Gharraf, and is passable except in a few places for all arms as far as Shatrah, after which, where the bridges or lack of them over the water cuts intersecting the road do not permit the passage of motor or wheeled transport, an alternative route exists al mg the dry bed of the Shatt-al Shatrah which is suitable for all arms and heavy lorries. Generally speaking, the former road between Shatrah and Nasirlyah is passable for wheels only after considerable labour in bridging the innumerable water-cuts. In the flood season of February-March and April the whole country is liable to inundation, which makes the road impassable and is likely to nullify all the work that may have previously been expended on it. L. A. M. cars could proceed over the whole road but would be of little use tactically, as owing to the nullahs and water-cuts on each side, they would be unable to leave it. Columns operated over the whole of the road in January, 192l&gt; without any difficulty, all repairs having previously been undertaken by the local tribes. From the South there is no suitable line of approach owing to the southern boundary being the Arabian desert. The railway, metre gauge, is constructed so as to run at all seasons, being built above flood level. It runs from Basrah, South of the southern shores of the flood urea, to Darraji and Baghdad vid Ur, from where a branch line leads to Nasiriyah. The railway is undoubtedly the best lateral line of approach, but it is extremely vulnerable to attack by tribesmen, some of whom are subsidised to protect it;, its numerous bridges being points which are easy to destroy and extremely dithcult to replace. Stoppage of Railway in 1920. On the 2nd July 1920 during the insurrection the railway line between Khidhr and Samawah was destroyed. The Ur-Samawah line was therefore abandoned, but the railway camp at Samawah was not evacuated until the end of August, when the line from Samawab to Diwaniyah was also abandoned. (h) By tealer. The Euphrates affords a permanent line of approach from both West and East for any sized river craft—their draught being governed oily by the depth of the shallower part of the Hammer Lake. This pres ent time [1921] is as low as 2 ft. in the channel, but the awater is abnormally low this year and previously boats drawing up to 2 ft. 6 in. have found sufficient water at all times. The Oharraf affords a temporary line of approach from the North. 1 r om about the end of January to the end of June ships from the Tigris (up to 6 ft. draught in high flood) can reach the Bad’ah Canal take off (3 miles North of Shatrah); from where launches of 2' 6' draught have been known to reach the Hammar vi4 the Dad’ali channel and intervening lakes.

The flow from Kut mually ceases in mid-August and the water continues to drain off slowly till the end of September, a small flow normally passing down the Rad’ah till early October. At Qal’at Sikar there is always a large stretch of water in' the river bed, several miles in length. Downstream of Qal’at Sikar there are pools about every 3 ni’les. They become brackish but the larger ones are always drinkable in an emergency. The Arabs water their sheep and drink tiieniselves from any pool but owing to dead frogs and animal urine the stagnant water becomes foul. (i) Wells .— Wells sunk to the depth of a few feet anywhere in the dry bed of the Gharrhf will yield drinkable water. The following wells exist in the Shamiyah, South of the Railway line:— J Birjisiyah* 5 miles West of Zubair. There is a large number of wells in this dist'ict, the water from which is used for irrigating melon gardens. The water though cold and clear is bnckish and fit only for animals and local inhabitants although that of the lest wells has been drunk by British troops. The water is drawn from the wells by donkeys. Baswah. 26 miles South West of Shagrah. There are more than 50 wells which are of the type known to Arabs as “ Husiyan ’’—being holes 10 feet in diameter' and 15 feet deep which are dug in the sand near a river bed. The Baswah water is good and unlimit«l at all seasons.19 wing up to the North, from the id’ah Canal lunches of be Dad’ah Permanent the end of at K utal ikable. d the water r, a small At Qal’at &gt;e(l, several pools about are always and drink limal urine ay where in 3 Railway of wells :ing melon ckish and the best rawn from n 50 wells i ”—being •e dug in ■limited at Bifslyah. 6 miles South by West of Baswah.

There are only three containing drinking water, which is slightly brackish. Water is 45 feet below the surface. Wells are brick bnilt and circular with a diameter of 15 feet. Gear for drawing water is required. Supply practically unlimited and abundant at all seasons. Dafinah. 30 miles North West of Shagrah. The wells of the Husiyan type (see Baswah). They afford good drinking water throughout the summer. Supply is practically unlimited. Wells are similar to these at Khanagah (see below). Dirhamiyah. 2^ miles South of Zubair. Drinking water is supplied to Zubair from here out of temporary wells, of which appro ximately 150 are always kept open. These wells are merely pits dug to a depth of 4 ft. to 5 ft. ; digging is purposely stopped as soon as 6 inches of water is found at the bottom of the pit, since the deeper the pit the more hitter the water. Daily the pits are emptied and on the following morning the water has again risen to 6 inches. The pits are kept open for about six weeks, after which the water becomes too bitter to drink; these pits are then filled in and fresh pits dug. Old pits can he dug up the following year and used again for drinking water. The sweetness of the water depends on the rains, so that from April the water gradually becomes more and more brackish until November, when it is almost undrinkable. There are also 15 permanent wells, made of brick, abont half a mile distant. These contain brackish water used only for irrigation. In these wells water is to be found about 16 it. below the surface. Hasdmah. 8 miles South East of Jal'.bah Railway Station 1 large and 2 small wells. Water is . sweet but 90 foot below ground, necessitating use of gear. Supply unlimited at all seasons. Wells are circular and brick built. 3 A sJalib Sad’un to miles West of Tel .Tiharah Railway Station. The water i» good and perennial. Sufficient snpply for 400 men and animals. Khabrah RuJcbi. 15 miles South West of Khabrah Sufi. There is a pond here which is a natural basin in solid rook, 2 acres in size* It is low lying. There is plenty of water in winter but it is undrink able except for animals. It dries up in summer. The Bedawins have built a mound, visible for 5 miles, to mark the spot. Khabrah Sufi. 35 miles South of Kuraiz. A pond of water fit only for animals- and in winter, exactly similar to Khabrah Rukbi. Khandgah. (Afcu Ghar) 20 miles West by South of Jalibak Railway Station. There are 3 or 4 wells, but more could be dug if requiied. The ground is soft. Water at all seasons is sweet. The existing wells give a sufficient supply for 5,000 men with their transport at all ,‘easons. Wells are circular, 10 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep. Water 11-12 feet from the surface. Gear required. Wells refill very fast, and could be drawn upon continuously. Nabha. 7 miles North West of Abu Ghar. No wells exist but water is obtained by digging to a depth of 1 to 2 feet in winter and. to 10 feet in summer. Water when obtained is always sweet. There is a ruined fort here. Qratigah. 10 miles South West of Zubair. Two wells 15 feet in diameter Water at 25 feet. Lifted by donkeys and overhead whtel. Water is perennial and sweet.

The water in a well is sweet when ei her it is first opeued or when an old well has been re-opened. After a well has been used for a long time the water becomes unpleasant to taste,, the well is then filled in and an old well is re-openeJ. Shaibah. The few wells which exist at Shaibah contain brackhh water, not good for horses or mules, though they will drink it in small quantities, \*hcn necessity compels them. These wells are to be found near the fort about one mile and a half N. of Shaibah railway station. Drinking water for the garrison at Shaibah is brought along a pipe line from No. 7 Wharf, Magil. The water is pumped from Magil to Zuhair, where there is a bye-pass iu the pipe line a Imitting the water into two tanks each containing 100,000 gallons; from there the w'ater is pumped to Shaibah by means of a boosting plant, where it enters two pits of the same cubic capacity as the tanks at Zuhair. The sides of these pits are made of pnttieJ clay and reinforced brick-work. The water is chlorinated at Shaibah. Since Makina railway station has also to be supplied from the same pipe Hue, it is not possible to provide Shaibah with more than 100.000 gallons daily ; this has been frequently found to be insufficient during the summer, so that it has been necessary at times to send water by train to Shaibah. The limit which can be supplied iu one day is 180,000. The pipe line, 6 inch, is very old. Zubair. The water in the numerous wells of Zubair is so brackish as to be only of use for washing. One well in the middle of the town, contains water fit for animals but undrinkable for the inhabitants. Water for drinking is obtained from Dirhamlyah, 2i miles South of Zubair, and is carried on donkeys to the town—w r here it is bought, by the inhabitants. It is sweet only from Deceuib t to the end of March alter which it becomes more and more brackish until after the next rain falls, usually in December. (See Zubair tow n—Para. VI.) (o). Crops. 1. Winter crops or “ Shitwi ” These are sown between November and 1’ebruary and are reaped from mid-May to mid-June. They consist of wheat and barley in approximately equal quantities. 2. Summer crops or “ Sai/i .”—These are sown in June and reaped in October. They consist of rice, idhra and mash. 3.

All ri the Ea: the Wes Idhn water hi sufficien 4. D&lt; and the 5. Gt the mid The inclusiv It is winter &lt; high an3. The cultivated areas, generally speaking are:— (a) Skitwi .—From this area boundary (3 miles downstream of Hai town) the junction of the Bad’ah and the Gharraf (11 miles South of Shatrah) for a strip of an averagb depth of 6 miles on both banks of the Gharraf. On the Eastern shores of the chain of lakes from Tel Loh to Fathi (on the Taliyah Lake) thefe is a cultivated belt 6 miles wide. From Darraji to 12 miles downstream of Nasiriyah there are disconnected belts of cultivation on Jbjth banks of the Euphrates varying from 3 to 5 miles in width. From this point to one mile downstream of Suq there is a belt of Shitwi cultivation on the right bank extending for an average width of 5 miles. Shitwi is also grown on the left bank along this stretch, bat it is mainly rice land, and winter crops here are liable to be destroyed by floods. From Sbatrah to Nasiriyah the soil is suitable for winter crops but water for this area is a difficult problem for which various experiments have been tried. Winter crops cannot normally be grown here except on the lake edges unles. the ground is rendered suhable by abnormal rain, very high floods or a specially organised irrigation scheme. (J) Saif., Uice .—Along the Western edges of the following lakes:-— Sudnifah, Abu 'Ajil and Ghamugah for an average depth of 15 miles. This belt is not continuous. All round Suq ash Shuyukh to the edge of t'ne Hummar Lake on the East and to a point 12 miles downstream of Nasiriyiah on the West. Its depth is up to 8 miles from the Euphrates bank. Idhra. Mash and Simsitn.—On the edges of all lakes after the water has receded and at all other places where the soil happens to be sufficiently damp owing to recent rain, inundation or irrigation. 4. Destructive agents to crops are hail, floods, locusts, cateqnllars and the wheat disease known as “ Hamara ”. 5. General note .— The high water season may be said t) last from the middle or end of February to August inclusive. The low water season may be said to last Innn Septemoer inclusive to middle or end of February. It is clear therefore that the time of the sowing of the summer and winter crops (Saifi and Shitwi) does not synchronise exactly with the high and low' water seasons.The Sbitwi crop depends entirely on the annual rise of the river. A temporary rise cannot affect the crops, the banks being so steep that such a rise would fail to command the land. The success or failure of the Winter Crop from year to year therefore is a matter of luck dependent on climatic conditions. A year with but little rain and an abnormally low river necessitates the failure of the Winter Crop cansing much poverty and distress among the cultivators and incidentally a considerable reduction in revenue. The agriculturalist therefore, as usual, lives in a constant state of anxiety. He waits for a certain rise in water levels before he can sow his winter crop (a suitable temporary rise usually occurs in January). No sooner is this accomplished but he counts the days ahead, watching the water levels for the opportunity of sowing or planting (in the case of rice) his summer crop, often reaping the termer about the same time as he puts iu the latter. In the Gharraf district rain has very little effect; it can merely be said to assist the crops, which are in no way dependent on it. In the event of the Gharraf failing to rise sufficiently high to irrigate the surrounding country, the crops would fail however much rain fell that year. 6. In this connection see :— Appendix “ B Note on the Hammar Lake. „ “ E ”. „ „ Dates. 7. Methods of Irrigation, (a) By How. —Water being distributed over the land by means of channels cut aw ay from the main river, tbebeds of which are maintained at the required depth and slope to cause the natural flow desired. These main channels have smaller ones taking off from them which in turn feed yet smaller ones according to local requirements. (J) By Tidal action. (c) By Pumping Engines erected on the river bank, usually driven by oil. (&lt;£) By “ Naor ” or Persian wheel, usually worked by animal draught. (e) Bu Karid. —A skinful of water being hauled to the top of the river bank by animal power pulling over a wheel or pulley. By means of a simple contrivance the skin automatically empties itself into an irrigation channel. (/) By Da/ia. —This is a “ scoop ” which is hauled to the surface of a field from water level bv a man operating the pivoted i ole (weighted at the far end) to which the scoop” is'attached.(^r) By Mutba .—This consists of two persons throwing water on to cultivation by means of ropes attached to a shallow tray. Generally speaking all cultivation on a large scale is watered by “ Flow only vegetables, small patches of lucerne and occasionally date gardens are watered by “ Lift (6) Towns. The following is a short deacription (f each of the principal towns situated in this area:— AsJiar and Basrah. These two towns combined together with certain neighbouring villages constitute the Municipality of Basrah which is bounded:— On the North by the Rubat Creek. „ ., South „ „ Khaurah Creek. ,, „ East ,, „ Shatt al Arab. „ „ West „ „ Desert. It lies on the right bank of the Shatt al Arab, 70 miles by river from the Persian Gulf. r ihe population of the Municipality totals 40,997 excluding any members of the Army of Occupation. This total is made up as nnder:— Sunnis . • • • 6,620 Shiahs . • • • . 25,813 J ews . . • • 6,288 Christians . . 2.057 Others • • • • 219 40,997 Communications. Basrah is connected by witer to Muhammerah, the Persian Gulf and Qnrnah by the Shatt al Arab to Baghdad from Qurnah by the Tigris. to Nasiiiyah and beyond from Qurnal by the Euphrates. to Ahwaz by the Karun. It is connected by metre gauge Railway to Baghdad via Zubair, Diwaniyab and Hillah. It is connected by land routes, normally passable for Ford cars and light lorries, to Fao, Qurnah, Zubair and Nasiriyah.26 A powerful w itless-station exists. Telegraphic and cable com munications are dealt with in Chapter VIII. The following is an estimate of the supplies available in the town. Wheat .—There are always at least 4.000 tons of this grain available. This amount is increased in August after harvest. A small quantity is exported to Kngiand. It is grown principally at hillah, Amarah and on the Gharraf. ZfarZey.—About 6,000 tons available. The yearly harvest which conies to Basrah is about 10,000 tons. It is grown at Hillah, Amarah and on the Gharraf. Rice .—About 4,r , 00 tons are available. The amount of the harvest which come- to Basrah of rice is about 6.000 tons and is grown chiefly at Amarah. Hillah, !?Cq ash Sbuyukh and on the Gharraf.. The rice is not as good as that from India. Aerodrome .—There is an emergency landing ground at Tanuman on the left bank of the Shatt al Arab. A now aerodrome has been taken into use on the plateau at Shaibah which is 1.000 yards square and fit for landing at any season and for all types of machines. Camping grounds .—Are extensive and good. Prepared camps exist at Mabina and Ma’qil. The town of Ashar is situated on the Shatt al A rab at the take off of the creek that bears its name, basrah lies two miles distant up this creek. In pre-war days the Ashar Creek was the main line of communication between the two towns. Since then two good roads have been constructed suitable for motor traffic. Asbar, from its position, is capturing more and more of the trade, while Basrah is becoming more and more residential. Previous to onr occupation the water supply for the majority of the people was the Ashar Creek, which, at that time, being also the general cess-pool, swimming bath and laundry, was a prolific carrier of water borne diseases. The well-to-do inhabitants used to buy water which was drawn from the centre of the Shatt al Arab and carried in barrels by means of heliums to Basrah and Ashar for sale. There is now a regular water supply from stand pipes. Both towns are lit by electricity. The town has prospered greatly in wealth and civilisation since the war. Trade has been brisk and there is no lack of remunerative work for all. This, together with the fact that the inhabitants are more in touch with the outer world has combined to make them markedly progressive and more inclined to material gain than to political agitation or fanaticism. Basrah in Turkish times was notorious for its lack of law and order,, nor were murders in bread daylight uncommon or as a rule hazardous- to the murderers. The town now shows a high standard of public order anc control.

CAaJa«&gt;A.—Consists of '3.0CG reed huts and is built along the left bank of the Euphrates six mile# downstream of the exit of that river from the Ham mar Lake. It has 4 miles of river frontage, and has an average depth of 100 yfcrds. Population is 11.000 souls. The village is built up on layers of cut reeds in order to place the huts above water level when the Euphrates is iu flood in summer. It can only be approached ly water at any season, either by means of the main Euphrates channel by craft up to the size of river steamers or by masbufs from the surrounding marshes. There is no dry camping space either in winter or summer and no possible landing ground for aeroplanes. jTao .—Consists of a Customs house, telegraph office, and four or five other brick buildings with about 600 yards of river froutage. At high tide motor launches can come along side but not at low tide. Khaminyah .—Is situated 9 miles in a direct line South of Sflq ash*Shnyukh, and is one of the Desert Towns at which the Bedawin tribes call to replenish theii supplies of food and clothing. No caravan can however he supplied without our permission. Khamisiyah is an oasis in the desert with date palms. Its popula tion is 3,000. all of whom are Arabs. The town is roughly square in plan with broad streets, a bazaar, an open enclosure for grain and a “qua^e to accommodate the camels of the Bedawin visitors who either buy supplies or exchange their live stock for them. A large Mosque, the gift of Falih Pasha al Sa’dnn, with its leaning tower, is a prominent landmark. The wall that at one time surrounded the town is now very incomplete. Khamisiyah is supplied by Suq with its requirements which are mainly the food and clothing which are always in demand by the Bedawin tribes. These supplies are carried by donkey except from mid-April to the end of July when, owing to Euphrates flood, transport is by helium or mashuf. The only local industry worthy of mention is the prodnetion of salt. Camping space is unlimited. There is no made aerodrome hut there is good and unlimited space on the desert anywhere to the South and West of the town. Surface after rain would he very soft. Khamisiyah was founded by Abdullah ibn Khamis, the father of Hamad, the present Shaikh. Hamad is very friendly to the British, and is reliable; he is a Snnni and a Najid and despises the settled river-side Arabs. He is all for peace and quiet. The Shaikh of Khamisiyah is not administered, except indirectly, by the British. He is not however an independent shaikh, and holds his position solely in virtue of recognition by Government.28 'Communications. — Khamisiyah is connected with (a) Bt/ Land. Tel al Lahm 7 miles.

Although hundreds of camels come into Khamisiyah yet they can scarcely be said to be available for transport as they are usually required by the tribesmen to carry back supplies to their desert homes. Karrddi .—Is a village on the left bank of the Gharraf, 10 miles south of Qal’at Sikar. It was built in about 1895 and is populated by the Kurds and Arabs (who came from Wasit when the Shatt al Ama dried up) and by numerous refugees from Qal’at Sikar. Karradi maintains a flourishing trade and is increasing in size. Population 5,000. Madinah. —Consists of approximately 2,500 reed huts, with a mud built bazaar of 30 shops which are roofed. It is situated on the right bank of the Euphrates and about 10 miles (crow fly) south west of Qurnah. Its population is about 10,000 and it can only be approached by water at auy season. Its inhabitants are all Arabs. Madinah is a collection of numerous villages, all built very close together, which are protected from floods in the high river season by a large circular bund. 10 miles in circumference. Ndsirlyah .—Was built by Nasir Pasha about the year 1867. It is situated on the left bank of the Euphrates and, being low lying, relies for its protection from Euphrates flood mainly on the important Abu Jidahah bund, which is upstream of it and on the left bank. Masir Pasha wished to build the town on higher ground further downstream but was overruled by Sa’dun Pasha who considered that in time of trouble whoever had the control of the Abu Jidahah bund controlled the situation. In order to protect the towm from destruc tion by floods when the Euphrates is high further extensive bunds have been constructed on both banks which have to be carefully watched an height of 2' structed in intervals.

It has 3 gates, the Pulford Gate on the West, the Shatrah Gate on the iS'orth and the Gorringe. Gate .on the East.; all these are well constructed with strong wooden doors. The main building is the old Turkish fcerai, which has been much improv 2 d by the British. It is exceptionally well built. The city measures 1650x570 yards. Nasiriyah has a total of 1.000 brick houses, 500 shops, 21 khans, each capable of billeting 50 men, an electric power station, an ice factory, two good aerated water factories, two flour mills using oil engines, 10 bakeries and 3 Turkish baths. Of the 100 houses above-mentioned only 50 could be utilised for billeting troops, and then only iu small numbers. The bazaar is well stocked and the streets are unnsnally broad and straight. Owing to latrines and incinerators being used, the town is sanitary. The population in 1920 was 6,523 made up as under; excluding all members Of M.E.F.

The town is connected by meh'e gauge railway with Baghdad and Basrah ria Ur junction. Land Communications—To Ur, Basrah, Darraji and Khamislyah by Ford Car except during or after heavy rain. In all cases, except to Ur and Khamisiyah, the going is difficult. There is no road to Basrah, the best alignment is vid Khamislyah and thence close to the railway line. Water Communication. —All sea'ons with Darraji, Suq and Basrah by the Euphrates vid the Hammar Lake. Aerodrome. —There is a good aerodrome for all types of machines. Surface rather soft but very level. Xo vegetation on aerodrome. It is situated one mile south of town on right bank Euphrates. Size GDC yards by 5G0 yards. Tele graph and Telephone. —There is one telegraph line vid Shatrah and QaFnt Sikar to Kut, one line to Suq ash Shuyukh and the main lines to Baghdad and Basrah (see Chapter VII'). There is telephone communication to Sbatrah and Suq ash Shuyukh (speaking over the telegraph wire). There is telephone communication also with Ur Junction and Nasiriyah city and camp (the latter being on the rght bank of the Euphrates). There are no outstanding industries in the town. The Arabs make bricks and hubs, and weave abas. The fish industry is large and flourishing. The water supply of the town is from the river and drawn by hand. The maximum breadth of the Euphrates at Nnsirlyah is 250 yards. It is crossed by means of a bridge of boats, 24 in number ; the bridge is 13 feet wide, 080 feet long and capable of carrying motor lorries. QaVat SHear. —Is situated on the left bank of the Gharraf midway between Hai town and Shatrah. It consists of 500 houses of which 100 are of mud, the majority being brick built. There is a bazaar of 200 shops. The town has two large brick gates and is surrounded by a mud wall with two fortified posts. The population is two-thirds Arabs and one-third Kurds; the latter are actually Lurs, from Pusht-i-Kuh. Fruit and vegetable gardens flourish for 600 yards downstream of the town. Up to about 1860, according to local information, the land all round the Gharraf was the haunt of the lion and the wild pig.

The few inhabitants were almost entirely Bedawin. One Sikar bnilt a fort on the present site of Qal’at Sikar, and adopted the son of a negro woman who gave birth to him on her return after capture by the Mnntafiq under Ajil as Sa’dun. The child’s name was Haji Said. He was eventually recognised by the Sa’dun as Governor of the district. H e was a man of energy and brought merchants from Baghdad and many Kurds to settle in the district. Qal’at Sikar has been twice flooded and rebuilt. It flourished until recently when the weakness of the Turkish rule gave the tribe their chance, and made the trade routes and surroundings insecure. Large numbers of inhabitants therefore left Qal’at Sikar and settled in Karradi and elsewhere. Aerodrome .—The landing ground is not being maintained (July 1921) but the position wonld be useful in the event of a forced landing in this district. The nature of the surface was good (June 1920) and approximately 400 yards by 400 yards. The position of the landing ground is 1 mile S. E. of the town and on the left bank of the Hai river. Qurnah .—Is situated on the right hank of che Tigris just upstream of its juncion with the old Euphrates Channel. Its population is 1,941 of which 1,841 are Shiahs and 100 Sunnis. There is a well s'oeked bazaar which has recently been roofed and lit by electricity. The Qurnah water supply is a municipal undertaking and is fed by a 20,000 gallon tank. Unlimited water is also obtainable from the Tigris or Euphrates. Ocean going steamers of a draught varying from 10—15 feet, dependent on the height of the river ana the state of the tide, can reach Qurnah at all seasons of the year from Basrah, but actually seldom proceed further north than Ma’qil where all the berthing facilities exist. All river steamers can proceed up the Tigris at all seasons and also up the Euphrates as far as Chabaisli, ai d beyond to upstream of Darraji provided the channel through the Hnmmar Cake is sufficiently dredged. The interior waterways of the marshes are, generally speaking, not navigable by any craft except mashufs. Owing to the Basrah-Amarah Railway having been t ken np, the Railway bridge now spanning the Euphrates has been partly dismant led and a flying ferry, capable of carrying two Ford vans, or 1 lorry, or 45 men at a time substituted. The double journey takes ten minu tes. There is no bridge over the Tigris. Aerodrome .—A landing ground is situated approximately 1 mi'e south of the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and is approximately 5U0 yards by 400 yards. The surface is good. Shatrah, General .—Shatrah is situated mostly on the right bank of the Shatt al Shatrah and 3 miles downstream of the take off of the Bad’ah Channel. Distance by road to Nasiriyah is 35 miles. Its population is 5,500, of which 5,160 are (Shiahs, 200 are Persians, 12932 are Sunnis,10 are Jews and 10 are Sabeans. The majority of the houses aie of burnt brick. The town is surrounded by a fortified oat of repair wall built by us, 8 feet high, with rained towers at intervals of 4U0 yards. This enclosed area is divided into two by the Shatt al Shatrah, to admit of camping space within the walls on the left bank. The streets are broad. The town is built 20 yards back from the river. There is only ope mosque with a minaret, which commands the whole town. Billeting accommodation for troops is difficult to find, as the old Turkish barracks which were outside the wall to the North have been completely wrecked. There is a serai in the town which would accommodate one company. Of the Shiah inhabitants almost every man is connected with either the Sinajir or the Albu Shamkhi sections of the Abudah. These two sections are at enmity with each other. They fought it out in 1917, when the Alhu Shamkhi were beaten and their houses, in the North part of the town, wrecked ; many of those have now (May 1920) been lebuilt. Khaiyun al ’Ubaid, the paramount shaikh of the Abndah, is the shaikh of the Al Sinajir section, while Hassan al Jasim is shaikh of the Albn Shamkhi. Both these men are trying to get the upper hand in Shatrah. Khaiyun is at present the holder. Industries .—The manufacture of copper and tin coffee pots and the tinning of ghi, which is bought in large quantities by Shatrah merchants from the tribesmen for export. Supplies .—The following supplies, surplus to local requirements,. are available. Rice .—In January 2,000 tons, which gradually diminish as it is exported until September when there is very little left. Wheat and Barley .—inclusive to November inclusive, 500 tons of wheat and 2000 tons of barley. As soon as navigation via Bad’ah channel is open the whole of this is gradually exported to Basrah and elsewhere. Idhra .—At the end of October 400 tons available ; it is gradually exported till September when there is only very little left. Mash .—In October there are 20 tons surplus, which also are gradu ally exported. Ghi .—Mostly in March. April and May—during which time 500 tins are usually available. There is a further supply but not so large in October and November. Transpo 'than 30 pa Camels.- the proper obtained fr notice bein Bellums. Water S Bad’ah cha then there i June (whe Shatrah ha: bed.

Up to 2,000 camels could be obtained from the nomadic tribes at any season within 3 or 4 days of notice being given provided they happened to be in the vicinity. Bellums. —There are 12 heliums, of 3 tons each, always available. Water Supply. —At Shatrah depends largely upon whether the Bad’ah channel is open or closed by means of a bund. If it is closed then there is water in the Shatt al Shatrah from mid-January to mid- June (when the Bad’ah dam is normally broken). At other times Shatrah has to rely on about 40 wells which are dug in the dry river bed. As mauy more wells as desired can be dug. Water is found at from 6—12 feet below the surface ; one side of each well is dug sloping to admit of access to the water. This well water is always sweet, but the wells require cleaning out frequently as much saud falls in from the top and sides. The wells are unlined. There is one brick well on the left bank, 30 feet in diameter, with water which is slightly brackish. The lift of this well is worked by bullocks. Water is suitable for watering animals. Water is 25 feet below the surface. Many of the houses in the town have their own private wells. Camping space.—Left Bank. —One battalion with transport inside the wall perimeter. This might be impracticable between January and June as the river bed would contain water and no bridge exists. Unlimited space outside the perimeter wall. Right Bank. —There is no good camping ground but there is ample space for any si?ed force. Aerodromes. —An emergency landing gionnd is situated approxi mately £ mils south east of the town on the left bank of the Shatt-al Gharraf. The surface is of hard sand and the maximum dimensions for landing—500 x 350 yards. Lines of Approach. (See Chapter VIII.) From the North (a) By Land for pack only, via either bank of the Gharraf. A motor road from Kut to Nasirlyah is under consideration. (6) By Water .—Usually from mid-January to mid-July the Gharraf is navigable for stern wheelers from Kut to the Bad’ah Channel take t off (3 miles North of Sliatrah). During very high water boats of no to 6 foot draught could negotiate this, but turning for them is difficult in the Bad’ah Channel and impossible in the Shatt-al Shatrah. Motor launches can reach Shatrah from the North when the depth of the Shatt-al Shatrah permits; this is largely dependent orr whether the Bad’ah channel is open, or closed. 434 2. From the South.—In all seasons Shatrah can be approached by road from Nasiriyab. In high Hood, when water flows down the Shatrah channel and fills the disused irrigation channels, it would he a simple matter to build bunds and make a passage for transport. In high flood level, from March 1st to April 15th heliums not^ draw ing mere than 2 foot can reach as far as the junction of the Bad’ahand Gharraf; from there it is necessary to proceed to Shatrah by horse or foot. From April 15th to June 15th boats drawing np to 6 foot can reach the junction and from there,heliums drawing np to 3 foot can reach Shatrah. From June 15th to July 31st (the approach is the same as from March 1st to April 15th. For the remainder Shatrah can be approached iby horse from anywhere. In high water season, however, Shatrah can only be approached from Nasiriyah by horse and from Kut by river, the irrigation channels above Bad’ah being impassable. 3. From the East .—By water only vid the Bad’ah Channel. In even the low water season a land route would be impracticable ow ing to marsh. 4. From the West .—There is no suitable line of approach. History .—According to local history Shatrah was founded about 1872 ; it grew rapidly owing to the building of bazaars and houses and carried on such a brisk trade with Baghdad and was such an important grain centre that it became the most important town on the Gharr5f and was known as “Little Baghdad.” It was first occupied by the Turks in 1881, the local tribes consenting for the time being as they w’ere feeling the oppression of the Sa’dun ride. In 1895 the Turks made an attempt to conscript Shatrah men, with the result that the Al Sinajir section of the Abudah migrated, inter-tribal troubles began and the decline of Shatrah set in. In 1S04 Sa’dun al Mansur drove the Turks from the district and at intervals since then Turkish expeditions were sent_ from Baghdad under Mizar Pfisha, Yusuf Pasha, and Muhammad ’Ali respectively to subdue the Shatrah tribesmen, but in each case the remnants of these expeditions returned unsuccessful to Baghdad. Ihus Shatrah town and district were unique in Iraq as being the only such from which the Turks never obtained conscripts. The history of Shatrah during the early stages of the war affords a good example of how the Arab throws in his lot with the winning side. After the British captured Basrah the Turkish Kaimakam and his men were evicted from Shatrah. After the fall of Nasiriyah and Kut in 1915 the Shatrah tribes made friendly ove r tures to the British. On the re capture of Kut (in the end of 1915 by the Turks), the Turks under Mizar Pasha returned to Shatrah ; the tribesmen, then lent an ear to their prei by the ho{ Baghdad wf Assistant F tribal situat (2) Situa Sbatrah n the Muntafii first place i Administrat of it w r as authorities Political Ol arrest him, area, thus la the Muntaf fact that Ca the British days after Q the Lower the Shaikhs entered Sha Thomas.

An Assistant Political Officer was installed in June 1918, since when the tribal situation (to May 1920) was surprisingly quiet. (2) Situation during the insurrection and at the present time. Sbatrah may be considered to have held the key to the situation in the Muntafiq. In the early days of the insurrection Shatrah was the first place in this area where uneasiness in regard to the British Administration was felt. This was in May 1920 and the outcome of it ■was the order for the arrest of Khaiyun al ’Ubaid by the authorities at Baghdad. This was fortunately averted by the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, for Captain Thomas, who was sent to arrest him, wisely made an ally of this, the strongest man in the area, thus laying the foundation of an alliance, which was to carry the Muntafiq over the most critical stage of the insurrection. The fact that Captain Thomas managed to keep Khaiyun on the side of the British and that between them they held Shatrah for twelve days after Qal’at Sikar fell in all probability saved the Muntatiq and the Lower Kuphrates. Three days before the evacuation of Shatrah the Shaikhs of.Qal’at Sikar and their following of approximately 200 entered Shatrah under the pretext of making allegiance to Captain Thomas. It was later discovered that their arrival was part of a plot to raise the Gharraf as a whole and march on Nasiriyah. Tho plot, however, fell through because Khaiyun, to whom the tribes were looking to be their leader, expressed the intention of only join ing in when Nasiriyah had fallen, Shatrah was evacuated by Captain Thomas on August 23rd. This year’s situation is entirely different to that of last year, when the tribes were united by a Jihad, i.e. a religious call to offensive action against Government. At the present time there is no unity amongst the tribes but they are all of one mind in their passive^ resist ance to Government’s demands for revenue. Their objection is not ag'&amp;'inst paying revenue to either a British or Arab Government hnt to any Government, unless that Government is able to enfoice payment. Though murders and other disorders have ceased to a certain extent at the present the tribes of Shatrah and Qal’at Sikar are by far the most unruly in the Muntafiq and it is doubtful if they can be trusted for very many years. Present Muntafiq situation caused by change to Arab Government and evacuation of bulk of British troops with nothing to replace them. The Mnntafiq tribes and particularly those of Shatrah and Qal’at Sikar care little or nought what Government is ru..ng them^but on the formation of a new Government they first turn to see whau foice there is behind it. The tribes have watched with interest the evpcoa- 4 xhon of the British troops and knowing that the Arab Government has no force of its own are expecting to be able to return to their former state of lawlessness and non-payment of revenue. For this reason they are at present holding back their revenue and watching the action of the Government. In addition they have again armed themselves to a man, liecause each tribe and individual fears his neighbour if he realises that Government is too weak to protect him against maranders. Sftq ath Shat/iikh. —Stands on the right bank of the main Euphrates Channel, miles downstream of where the ’Akaikah Channel takes off. (This Channel is now closed by means of a bond 4 miles down from the main river). Suq is 17 miles in a direct line Sonth-east^ of Nasiriyah and has a population of 8,830 of which 6.000 live in the town itself and 3,000 in the gardens immediately outside. There is a large Sabean community of 800 souls all living on the left bank opposite the town. There are 30 Tersians. Before 1867, when Nasiriyah was built, Suq was the old Sa’diin capital of the Mnntafiq. The town is now divided into two antagonistic factions; the “ Hathar,’ , who are Shiahs, consisting of two-thirds of the population and the “Naj’ada ” w ho are Snnnis, consisting of the remainder. The situation in this district is the same as in Shatrah, with the exception that in the case of revenue collection these tribes nave gone further and actually fired on the collectors. Recent -combined operations of fly-boats and asroplanes have considerably improved the situation in this district. Suq is a typical Eastern town of many narrow winding streets, usually of brick. There are three Sunni and two Shiah Mosques. The town is circular in plan and situated among date palms. It is surrounded, except on the side of the river frontage, by a wall.which was completed in 1919. Suq being the «Supply Dep6tfor Khamisiyah is to the latter towm what Basrah is to Znbair, for it sends Khamisiyah the supplies required by the Bedawin caravans which call in at that “ Port.” These supplies are sent by donkey except in the Euphrates flood season (mid-April to the end of July) when transport is by bellum or mashnf. There is camping space for one Company at all seasons within the walls and space for one Brigade at all seasons 2 miles South-West of the town. There is no water available at the latter camping ground. Aerodrome.—The race course, 2 miles South of Suq town, affords a suitable landing ground at all seasons.

Suwaij. —11 miles South-east of Shatrah on the right bank of the Shatt-al Shatrah. A small tribal market with n population of 500, all of whom are Shiahs. The Shatt-al Shatrah contains that Gharraf water which does not pass down the Bad’ah Channel; it normally runs dry about mid-June and remains so till mid-January. Durifig the dry period water is obtained from wells dug in the river bed. They are from 6—12 feet deep with one side sloping to admit of access. The water is sweet and plentiful. A road fit for Ford cars with difficulty connects it with Shatrah to the North and Nasiriysh to the South. Not more than 25 mules or donkeys could be produced from Suwaij unless previous notice were given. Zubdir. —Is situated 13 miles South-West of Basrah and is one of the “Desert Ports’* into which the Bedawin caravans call to ieplenish their stock of supplies and clothing. Zubair is. therefore, a distributing centre for the trade between the Western desert and Basrah. It owes its continued existence to this fact only. Its population is about 12,000 all of whom are Sunnis. There are no Shiahs. Jews or Christians. The question of the status of Zubair has been settled. The High Commissioner informed Shaikh Ibrahim that he could remain in charge of Zubair if he accepted the following arrangements:— (o) A regular Municipality to be established. (&amp;) Government Customs post at Zubair. (c) Revenue dues to be collected at Government rates and credit ed to Government treasury. (d) All taxes not specifically ordered by GoTernment bit collected by the Shaikh to cease.38 (e) Inhabitants of Zubair to be allowed to enlist in police and levit s. (/) Tapn transactions to be dealt with in the Civil Courts and criminal cases tried in Basrah as formerly. The Shaikh in reply stated that he could not accept the conditions proposed. He was, therefore, informed by the High Commissioner on .Tune 8th, that he could not be allowed to visit Zubair except with His Excellency’s permission. Otherwise no restrictions would be placed on his'movements and he was free to live on his estates in llasrah. Zubair henceforward will be, as it was in Turkish times, a Nahiyah directly dependent on Basrah, with an elective Baladiyah collecting the Baladiyah taxes and a Mudir and staff who will collect Govern ment revenues. With the exception of the produce of a few small gardens, all kinds of supplies required for the inhabitants and for the Bedawin caravans have to be imported. Most of the trade is with Basrah, a little being with Kuwait. The lack of cultivation in the fertile soil around Znbiir is due to the great scarcity of water. The town used to be surrounded by a wall which has fallen into complete disrepair, and only a portion on the East side now remains. The houses arc of brick and, on the whole, are well built. There is practically no sanitation. Drinking Water—The water in the wells of the town itself is undrinkable even to Arabs, being extremely brackish. Nearly every house has a well, but its water can only be used for washing. There is one well in the middle of the city from which animals can drink at all seasons. The drinking water supply comes from Dirhamiyah, 2J miles South of Zubair, which is a natural basin for rain water and where some 200 wells exist. It is carried on donkeys in skins, each donkey carrying three skins, which are sold in the city for eight annas the three. The combination of the expense of water for the poorer population and the had quality of the water at certain seasons causes much sickness among the people. Water is found at Dirhamiyah at a depth of 4 feet below the ground. After the rains have fallen the wells produce sweet water, usually in December ;this supply remains sweet till the end of March ; from April onwards it becomes more and more brackish till in October and November it is almost undrink able. The Shaikh of Zubair obtains his drinking water from a well at Qratiyah (10 miles South-west of Zntair) when the Dirhamiyah water begins to taste brackish.

Communications. —Zubair is connected with the following places, all of which can be reached by Ford car except after heavy rain: Basrah, Shaibah, Barjislyah, Safwan and Umm Qasr. Camping Grounds.—There is no suitable camping ground at Zubair owing to the lack of water but there is unlimited camping space at Dirhamiyah. Trade .—All the trade of the town is done in the market. The requirements for the desert tribes are chiefly rice, dates, barley, coffee, tea, sugar and cloth. These are collected in stores bordering on the open spaces, suitable for loading caravans. The Bedawm tribes either pay cash tor their supplies or give in exchange animals, woo •or skins.

As often in this area the habitable portion is restricted to narrow palm belts or scattered places in the Euphrates marshes, it is essential that the strictest sanitary precautions should be taken by troops engaged on operations in the area. Whenever possible camps should be sited on the desert inland of the palm belt. Generally speaking the atmosphere in this area is more humid than in other parts of Iraq owing to the vast marsh areas and its proximity to the sea. For this reason heatstroke constantly occurs amongst Europeans during the summer months when they are exposed in the open without adequate protection against the sun. Epidemic diseases—The chief epidemic diseases in the area are, Malaria, Plague, Sandfly Fever, Cholera. Small-pox, Dysentery, Relap sing Fever, diseases of the Enteric group and occasionally Typhus. Malaria. It is the commonest of these diseases and is most preva lent from June to November when the floods are subsiding. Its fatality is low'. The area being so intersected with a network of irrigating canals and there being so ranch marsh land it is impossible to carry .out anti-mosquito measures with any marked measure of success. For any troops operating in mosquito infected areas such as Qurnah, the following points should be noted :— (a) Mosquito nets are indispensihle if malaria is to he avoided. (J) The compulsory taking of prophylactic quinine between the months of May and November inclusive. (c) Glare glasses and spine pads are necessary on account of the additional glare of the water. (d) Preparations of complete heatstroke precautions. (e) Work suspended between 11*00 hours and 16*00 hours when possible. Cholera — Has been the cause, in the past, of large epidemics amongst the local population of the area. Troops during the Meso potamian campaign suffered very little from this disease owing to the care that was taken in the purification of water supplies. Certain cases of Cholera amongst the troops in Basrah in 1917 were definitely traced to unpurified drinking w'ater taken direct from river. With the completion of a piped w'ater supply to the whole of the base area the disease has practically disappeared. Anti-Cholera inoculation should be carried out at the beginning of the hot weather. Small-pox .—Is probably always present in the area though epid emics are rare in the towns where the local inhabitants are fully' alive to and desire the benefits of vaccination.44 Dysentery and Dxarrhoea.—A.re common hot weather complaints. -Prevention is entirely a matter of good sanitation. The efficient destruction of excreta by burning, protection of excreta in latrines and incinerators from flies, and anti-fly measures which in the main consist m the complete removal and incineration of all refuse from camps, and thorough cleanliness in all eookbouses, latrines, stables, etc., where fly breeding may occur. J ' e getables and fruit should preferably be eaten well-cooked. If eaten uncooked they should neither be unripe nor overripe and should be well washed in Chlorine or Permanganate solution. Stable litter Irom transport or remount camps may be treated by the biological process and afterwards dried for issue as incinerator fuel, a valuable article in this country where fuel of all kinds is scarce. Dysentery carriers have been responsible for many outbreaks of the disease among troops in this country and it is important that periodical examinations of the cooks of all units should be made to discover the presence of Dysentery, Enteric or even Cholera carriers among them. Relapsing Fever is not common amongst the Arab population but often occurs during the winter months amongst recently arrived I ersian coolies. Owing to its long-incubation period other coolies in a camp are usually infected before the first case is discovered. The disease is usually very difficult to eradicate after a few cases have occurred. The disease is carried by the louse and its prevention is a matter of personal cleanliness of all personnel of a unit. Weekly hot baths, and in case of a unit susceptible to this disease, disinfection of clothing by steam or sulphur fumigation, accompanied by a bath in cresol kerosine emulsion is essential every week. Bilharziasis,' is common among the riverain population of the Euphrates, and is peculiar to that river. The great majority’ of eases prove fatal. It is said to be due to drinking Euphrates water in certain localities. Enteric group diseases, occur amongst the local population though not to a marked extent. Inoculation and good sanitation made the disease a rarity amongst troops during ’the latter half of the recent campaign. Infl uenz a was especially prevalent in 1918 when the disease spread w ith extraordinary rapidity and lo a less extent in 1919 from August to November, both inclusive, and caused a considerable number of deaths. It is frequently accompanied by pneumonic complications. Medical conditions affecting opeiations at different seasons. —The summer climate, especially in Basiah, varies Irom a very hot dry (limate ^\hen the wind is from the north to a less hot and hnmid climate when the wind is in the souvb, the latter being more produc tive of heatstroke than the former.

Ethnography. 1. General. —Almost the entire population of the area under report is comprised of Arabs ; the great majority of these are Shiahs. (For details of religion see column 7 of the Tribal Lists, Appendix A.). The Arab population conveniently falls into three groups :— (1) Nomadic. (2) Semi-Nomadic. (3) Settled— (a) Rural. (J) Urban. There are no hard and fast dividing lines between these classes; it is frequent for one type gradually to shade off into another. Nomadic Arabs. — Such as the Dhafir or the Ajman. They are pastoral tent dwellers and breed camels, sheep and horses. They are hardy, brave and v arlike and are tribally organised. They wander from one grazing ground to another according to season. Semi-Nomadic Arabs.- —Such as the Budur and the Bani Sa’id. The tendency of nomads to settle down and turn to agriculture has had the result of certain tribes living in the intermediate state between pure nomadism and the condition of wholly settled cultivators. The process of settlement of a tribe may be easily suspended or broken off owing to such causes as quarrels with neighbouring tribes or a failure in crops. In such cases a tribe may revert to its original nomadic conditions or seek a settling ground elsewhere. The semi- nomadic tribes are usually far more dependent on their live stock than on their crops. Settled Arabs .— (0) Rural. —The majority of rural settled Arabs have a regular % tribal organisation such as that of the Abudah or the Bani ’Asad. There are however many thousands who belong to so mixed a commu nity that tribal ties have become entirely or almost entirely extinct. Such conditions are found in the highly civilised areas and among the date garden population on the banks of the Shatt al Arab downstream of Basrah. They are either pastoral, agricultural or bath. (1) ZTrhan Arabs. —The Arabs who live in towns such as those of Basrah are looked down upon by their rural brethren as being mer chants and contemptible generally. Under such conditions men are found living together who belong by origin each to a separate tribe.. 8,425 (of which 530 are Mad’an). Martha The result is that the population soon becomes so mixed that no tribal bonds remain. The sedentary aud shepherd tribes of the Muntafiq are for the most part of good Arab stock and can claim descent from the best oldlblood of Arabia. They have lost caste by settling down and becoming Shiahs and are now despised by the genuine bedouin tribes who will not intermarry with them. 2.

Characteristics — (a) The Shiah Tribesman are hospitable, unreliable, excitable and unfaithful: they always wait to see how the wind will blow before com mitting themselves to any course of action. They cannot, in any way, be said to be fanatical; they take a practical view of life and are ready to adopt new inventions, such as modern ideas in agriculture, if it is proved to them that the new way is an improvement on the 4 old. They are avaricious and will do almost anytning ioi money. They are barbarous in their methods of warfare, and can in no way 00 be relied on to refrain from killing the wounded and mutilating sue gion 'which dead. (b) The Sunni Tribesmen do not vary much in characteristics from the Shiah. The Sa’duns however are more dignified than their tribesmen and more straight forw ard. ns. The Jews are not popular amongst the Arabs and are generally looked down upon as the local money makers except in large towns, such as Basrah, when the Jews are an influential community and d’an)- civilisation has altered original ’deas. The Kurds. —Are not actually Kurds at all but are almost a ways referred to as such.60 In reality they are Lurs from Pnsht-i-Knb. and as enltivators on the Gharraf in such places as ivarradi. are mainly found Qal’at Sikar and nrt- In Fe, ' s ^ ns —^ very few in number and are merchants and artisans who have immigrated to this area. The Sabeans kk found in small colonies ,in different parts of the ' r m 6 ^- ead qn *f te ” of thpir sect is at SQ( 1 Shuyukh, where 800 of them hve on the left bank of the Euphrates opposite the town. Sabeans are found at each of the following additional localities in in is area :— JSasiriyah, Chabaish, Bani Sa’id, Khas, Al Hasan, Hakkam. Bani Kbaiqan, Basrah and Bani Muslim. They are mentioned in the Quran together with Christians and Jews and a-e therefore entitled to tolerance in Muslim eyes as possessing a written revelation. This fact has not however prevented the Sabeaus from being continually persecuted by the Arabs. Their women have a reputation for beauty and, until our occupation, were constantly raided and carried off. The Sabeans are most useful to the Arabs as gunsmiths and repairers and makers of agricultural instrument* especially m the Bani Malik Division; it is largely for this reason tnat they have not been exterminated. . Tho p * act nature of their religious belief is not known, but Baptism is one of their principal rites, and frequent ceremonial ablution is enjoined. They invariably live beside running water. They venerate John the Baptist, but consider both Christ and Moses to be false teachers. They place Paradise in the Pole Star. Their ceremonies are said to be conducted in Syriac and are closed to strangers ; they possess scriptures of their own. In dress they are indistinguishable from Arabs, but have a peculiar and striking physiognomy. They do not cut their beards. Thev are neither circumcised nor monogamous. Many of them are boat build ers, but the majority are artisans who work in silver and antimony or ns mentioned above, follow the trades of gunsmiths and makers of . agricultural instruments. They do not go in for agriculture Thev have constant quarrels amongst themselves regarding their jiriesthood. 5. Relations between Races and Religions — The Shiahs and Sunnis, on the whole, get on well together. The Sabeans neither like or are liked by the Muhammadans, and used to be oppressed by them before our occujiation. The Kurds and Persians.—Are looked down opoh by the Arabs. Christians and Jews .—On the whole get on well with the Arabs although generally speaking the Arabs despise the Jews. 6. The c The 1 Arabic. The 1 of both are said The . charact 7.

In the majority of cases any troubles that arise have their origin in the Moslem side. 6. Languages — The only language worth consideration is Arabic. The Lars talk their own Luri dialect of Kurdish, but mostly know Arabic. The Persians almost all know Arabic, which is the common language of both the Jews and the Sabeans. The latter, amongst themselves, are said to speak a dialect of Syriac. The Jews when writing to one another write Arabic but in Hebrew characters. 7. Duellings .—Except for the urban population, who live in houses, the Arab of Mesopotamia here as elsewhere lives either in tents, reed huts, mud hovels or towers, the majority of the last named being fortified. (Their numbers are given in the tribal lists.) 8. Education .—Before our occupation the general level of educa tion among the Muhammadans of Mesopotamia was very low. Al though the Turkish Government had an educational system, which, on paper, was fairly extensive and quite admirable/actually the pupils were taught to repeat, read and copy the Quran in the elemen tary schools attached to the mosques, aud a few primary Government schools existed in some of the larger towns, where little beyond reli gious instruction was imparted. The Turkish school buildings were good but their teachers incapable. In 1908 Turkish was replaced by Arabic as the medium of instruction. The most important educational work done up to the time of our occupation in Basrah was that of the American. French and English mission schools, who dealt chiefly with the local Christians, and of the Jewish, Armenian aud Chaldean schools all of which still exist. Thus the native Christians aud Jews have been considerably better edacated for practical purposes, such as business, than the Arabs. Since cur occupation much has been done to improve the situation for the Arab community and schools teaching the Quran, Arabic mathematics, history, geography and, when possible, English have” been opened up for their benefit. I here are many difficulties such as the obtaining of sufficient books and equipment generally; many of the tormer, and maps being required to be printed in Arabic. The greatest difficulty’ of all however is to provide efficient teachers. Owing to these being almost impossible to obtain our efforts have been mainly directed towards securing an improved standard of education in a limited number of schools, rather than opening many schools where owing to incompetent teachers, no practical good would be achieved.62 In every school there is a Mullah who teaches the Quran and the tenets of the Muhammadan faith. A few Arab teachers of the old regime have been kept on under the new. The majority of the remainder are young men, often of considerable promise, who have been attracted to a once despised profession ; but even so the present supply of teachers is not sufficient for the schools actually in existence. Schools at the following places have been opened by us— Basrah, Abul Khasih, Znbair, Qurnah, Suq-ash-Shuyukh, Ashar, Shatrah and Qal’at Sikar, and others will be opened as soon as practicable. The average attendance is betw’een 50 and 100 so that it is obvious that education has, so far, merely begun to scratch the surface. A Training College for teachers was opened in Basrah in 1918, but it is too early to say whether the material turned out will be of a sufficiently high standard for the work required. The problem of girls schools is a difficult one, which is at present not dealt with adequately. Practically no facilities exist for the education of Arab girls. It will not at first be easy to induce them to attend, but it is likely that, in time, the desire for knowledge will overcome their natural preju dices as they see that good and not evil results. From the better classes of Basrah and the district come constant appeals for girls’ schools and improved boys’ schools. Many of those who can affiord it send their children to India, Syria, France or England for their education owing to the lack of suitable conditions at home. Professions .—The following are the more important professions of males over 16 in the area in order of priority, excluding the various types of merchants:—Fellahs, Ta’ab (planters), Mallaks, boatmen, (including balnmchis and the crews of Baghlahs and Mahailahs who cruise to the Persian Gulf Ports) dealers in reeds and mats, fishermen both sea and fresh water, buffalo breeders, government servants, weavers and coolies.

The area, as a whole, is self-supjmrting with the exception of the following articles which are imported -.— Manchester piece goods (cotton), tea, sugar and coffee. The Muntafiq area is essentially an agricultural district and is more than self-supporting as regards grain. It has a large annual excess amounting to as much again as the total local requirements. The chief exports therefore are wheat, barley, rice, mash, idhra, simsim, dates and ghi. The Basrah and Qurnah areas cannot grow sufficient grain for their needs and have therefore to be supplied by imports from the Muntafiq. Dates are the main products of the soil in the Basrah and Qurnah districts, of which there D a large excess over and above local requirements which is exported or available for purchase. Development .—Both in the towns and in the country the develop ment of trade, commerce, agriculture and the Fort (see Appendix D) since our occupation has been great; all classes concerned realise the benefits that accrue and are always ready for vet further advancement. Agriculture .—The possibilities of the future are considerable, especially as regards agriculture. The nature of the soil is such that by the supply of sufficient water at the required season it is extremely productive. In this connection however there are three difficulties, which require considerations— (i) An irrigation scheme to suit the conditions. («) A sufficient population to cultivate the new area irricated (See Chapter III, Para. 12.) (i»t) Transport facilities to carry away the Surplus grain for export. The district of Qal at Sikar affords a good example, as one havine- enormous possibilities. The tribesmen so far are without exnert imgatmn advice ; they are however making slow but sure protrres^ hv bringing more and more desert under cultivation each vear ft is possible that by extending cultivation to the Shatt al ’Ama 0 n the ^orth East and to the Shatt al Khar on the West, Qal' at Sikar would become one of the most important granaries of Iraq. The difficulties of transport for export in this area are, especially acute. For instance at the close of 1919 there were hundreds of64 tons of frrain lying stored in khans at Qal’at Sikar and Shatrah, awaiting the Qharraf flood in order to obtain water borne transport to convey it to Basrah. The Basrah-Baghdad Railway is not utilised as much as might ordinarily be expected for the transport of surplus grain, the freight charges have been raised to such a point that the cultivators have to fall back on the slower but cheaper method of transportation bv water. It is likely that with the advent of more peacefu. conditions and an increase in rolling stock, the railway authorities will be able to allot more trucks for this purposes at a considerably reduced figure. Destructive agents to crops .—Are hail, floods, locusts, caterpillars and a disease which attacks wheat known as “ Hamara. Agricultural instruments.-The Arab if left to himself needs very little apparatus. A plough is necessary for barley and wheat and is of the simplest and roughest description. The surface of '.he ground is merely scratched, deep ploughing never being undertaken. Where rice is cultivated the fallah must also have a spade for repairing or cutting channels, and a sickle. This practically constitutes all requirements for lands watered by flow. There is but little doubt that many of those who can afford it will, as soon as they have had a practical demonstration ot their merits, employ modern appliances as they become available in the country. Lire stock—Cumete are bred in large numbers mainly by the nomadic tribes of the Shamiyah {e.g Aslam and Ajinan) and also bv the nomads on the west of the Gharrat (e.&lt; 7 -Raf m and Jash am), andto a lesser extent by those on the east of the (.harraf (e.g. Al Humaid, al Arab). (See Tribal lists) Buffaloes are W m ^arge numbers by the Mad’an tribes who live m the marshes ot the Euphrates, mainly between Chabaish and Qurnah. Sheep are bred in the Shamiyah and on both sides of the Gharraf. The Budur, Zubairiyah, Shurifat, and all the nomads of the Albu Salih all breed sheep and all go into the Shamiyah for grazing after the first rains have begun, usually about December, returning about May. Horses are bred by the Bedawin tribes of the Shamiyah and by the Ban! Rikab aud Al Humaid confederations, the former being on the west of the Gharraf and the latter on the east. Over 2,UUU horses from the Gharraf are sent to India annually. II. — Industry. (a) Labour.—\s a general rule labour in large quantities is difficult to obtain with or without notice, as the rural population i&gt; fully employed in agricultural pursuits. Labour is usually most readil; where obtain theref In provis extent contro Bat the ri coolies The ii and 1 availal was a Basral regula . ( ln in the Qw diflicu In 1 would the SI Siiq the w!

A few men at a time are normally easily obtained. The Arab will do almost anything for money; much therefore depends on the price offered. In the majority &lt;&gt;f cases, unless a show of force compels, the provision of labour, even if readily available, depends to a large extent on the political attitade and inclinations of the Shaikh who control it. A Basrah District .—In the whole area between Nahr Umr and Fao on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab probably not more than 2,500 coolies could be engaged unless labour control were again started. The majority of these would be obtained from the cities of Basrah and Ashar. The following figures serve to show the shortage of available labour outside the towns. During the war, when there was an efficient system of labour control the Municipal Area of Br.srah (see Map A) produced 11.000 men. women and children for regular daily labour while the district sent 3,000. (In normal times there arc always about 700 Kurds working as coolie s in the Basrah and Ashar bazaars.) Qamah District .—In the vicinity of Quvnah town labour is difficult to obtain. In the outlying districts the demand is less and considerable numbers would offer themselves willingly. Length of noticed required by the Shaikh would depend on the numbers desire 1. Suq ash Shuyukh District .—Is the most densely populated in the whole area. The Shaikhs are always willing to provide labour at Annas 12 per day, and hands can be obtained reacily. Shatrah and Qal’at Sikar Districts .—These are far afield for normal labour requirements. For local work, however, in peace time and if onr relations are not over-strained, 2,000 willing workers from each di&gt;trict could easily be obtaine.l at any time of the year. Nasiriyah .—100 coolies are available at a l times of the year. Parties of 1,000 could be obtained with difficulty. Due notice to the controll ing Shaikhs would be necessary. (J) Agriculture. The Muntaf 'q is the grain prodi cing area, Qurnah and Basrah are the date prodr cing a eas. (See Apoendix E.) The following table for 1919 serves as in indiuation as to grain production. (For the details regarding snd tl • localities for Saifi and Shitwi «roq)S fee Chapter II.)Fruit and vegetable !.—The land below date trees in the date gar dens is almost always planted with fruit, vegetables or cereals. In order to promote such cultivation and to take advantage of the irrigated land lying fallow, the owners of date gardens which conld be and are not so cultivated have to pay a higher rate of revenue. In the Abnl Khasib Nahiyah for instance grapes, pomegranates, oranges, peaches and figs are grown successfully in date plantations beneath the trees, and vegetables of all kinds are also so grown. Melons .—Kipen by the end of June and are over by the end of July. A second crop is ripe by early September. They are prolific and grow throughout the area. There are extensive melon beds at Barjislyah, near Zubair, and in the Qurnah district. Vegetables.—Oi all kinds except potatoes thrive in Mesopotamia. The inhabitants have irrigated patches in which they grow vegetables throughout the area. Near large towns or military stations special arrangements have been made for the provision and maintenance of vegetable gardens to supply the local demand. (c) Minerals, except salt, are non-existent in the area. Salt. —Khamisiyah. Salt pans are worked in the summer and autumn to the south of the town. Work ceases in the rainy season. These consist of a number of wells which are scooped out, the water from which is ladled out by women into channels which flow into beds. After 24 hours the water evaporates and leaves a thick white sediment of salt. Each well is said to produce twenty mauuds of salt a year. Madinah. Salt pans exiss 3 milet sonth of Madinah and also at 6 in iles north-west by north of Qurnah. In both cases the output is insignificant and is not taxed. The salt is of poor quality and most of it is consumed locally; a small proportion is exported to Amarah in its unrefined state. Chabashiyah. The salt pans here are worked by certain tribes of the Madinah. .* 3 Handan is in the Abul Khasib Nahiyah where salt is collected off the ground in I’ecember and January in a fairly pure condition. It is said to be washed out of the soil by rain. {d) Manufactures .—Beyond the manufacture of mats from the re&amp;ls which are so prolific in the marshes, there are no ontsfaning manufactures in the area 6 AThe more important ones are classified as under :— silas. These are made of wool and are manufactured at_ Qurnah, Shatrah and Sfiq. This is a thriving trade especially at Suq where the weaving is done by men. Lengths of cloth are exported from here to Kuwait and Khamislyah for disposal to the desert tribes. Scat Buildina.—This is carried out to some extent on the banks of the Shatt-al-Arab, but the most famous boat builders in tdie country are tbe Sabeans. They build all types of river craft from Mahailahs down to small mashufs. Hawair has a great reputation as a boat building locality followed closely by Khas, both on the Luphrates between Madinah and Qurnah. Bricks .—Are made in numerous places. The largest production coming from the Hartha Nahiyah, from the vicinity of Qarmat All. There are 25 kilns, employing 2o0 men. 30—40,000 bricks per kiln are turned out in an eight days shift. The_ kilns vary in size. Some Arabs have been instructed in the production of bricks similar to English ones ; these are now being turned out success! ully. There are kilns also at Nasiriyah, Shatrah, Qal’at Sikar, Suwaij, Karradi and Suq. Cojfee Pots .—Are made at Shatrah and Basrah. Ghi is tinned at Shatrah. Heeds and Mats .—The manufacture of mats, baskets and other articles from the marsh reeds, in this area is mostly carried out by the Bani ’Asad and Madinah tribesmen, whose marshy habitats (east of the Hammar Lake) are eminently suited to the industry. Reeds are of three kinds; “ ehaulan ”, “bardi” and “qassab”. All are good cattle food when the plants are young and tender. Chanlan is used for the manufacture of soft mats known as “ Bassir Qassab ,—Is used for coarse mats called “ bawari ”# Bardiand QassaJ make good fuel and are much use l in kilns. .Out of the above reed mats the Arabs build their mat known as “ Sarifas ”. brick huts, Reeds and mats are collected on the rivers, formed into r»fti («‘ garah ”) and floated down to their destination.IV. Commerce. (1) Character of trade. Imvort. (a) For consumption within the boundaries of occupied territories. ( J) In transit to Persia. G5 per cent, of the total import trade is in transit to Persia. Cus toms duty on sea import trade is payable at either Basrah or Baghdad the latter only in respect of goods consigned on through Bills of Lading. Export .— (a) From the country. (J) In transit from Persia. Duty payment is optional at Baghdad or Basrah in the case of produce of the country. Transit trade for overseas export pays duty on importation into the country. Trade valuations of (a) and (&amp;) are about equal. (2) Organisation to promote trade. A British Chamber of Commerce has been established, The forma tion of a Trades Association is talked of to further the interests of traders not exclusively British. (3) Exports. Principal items.— (a) From the country, dates, wool, hides and skins and galls, {l) In transit from Persia, carpets, opium, oakgalls, gums and intestines. (4) Imports. Principal items. For the country, Manchester piece goods (cotton), sugar, coffee, tea, irrigation plants, metal, motor vehicles, oil (kerosine and lubricating). In transit to Persia, Manchestei' piece goods (cotton), tea, and sugar. (5) Customs and Tariffs. General import tariff is 11 percent, ad valorem.

The transit doty is one per cent, and is collected by charging eleven ■per cent, on all goods entering the country. Ten per cent, of tnis is refunded by the Customs House in Baghdad on proof that the goods have been actually sent into Persia. (6) Taxation. Taxation for the purposes of general revenue and also municipal taxes varies according to locality and conditions. The main items going towards general revenues are :— {1) Tax on crops. —In the Muntafiq, which is the grain producing area, the undermentioned system has been adopted as a temporary measure. (a) For privately owned land, where the landlord and tenant cannot agree as to terms; of the gross product 50 per cent, goes to the fellah, 20 per cent, goes to Government as revenue, 7$ uer cent, to the Mallak (landlord) as rent and 22d per cent, goes to the Shaikh or Sarkal. (S) For privately owned land, where the landlord and tenant are agreed as to terms. The fellah must get 50 per cent, and the Govern ment must get 20 per cent, of the gross product. The balance is split up according to the agreement, and is enforced by us unless grossly unfair. (c) On “ Miri” lands where no private ownership is claimed the distribution of the gross product is :—50 per cent, to the fellah, 20 per cent, to Government as revenue per cent, to Government as the rent due to the landlord, and 22£ per cent, to the Shaikh or Sarkal. In (a), (S) and (c) above, if the land is watered by “lift” Govern ment only collects 10 per cent, as revenue. (d) Vegetable andjruit tax. —This tax is collected by estimation ; fruit pays ^th whereas vegetables pay Rs. 10 per Jarib=£ acre. (e) Tax on date gardens. —This is normally 20 per cent, of the crops. In the Mnntatiq area date trees are 'axed at 2j annas per annum per tree if the land under the tree is cultivated, and double that amount if it is not. This arrangement encourages the cultivation of fruit trees, grapes, vegetables and crops beneath the trees, which process improves the quality of the date palms. {f) Kodak. — Usually annas 8 per head per year on each mature sheep or goat and Re. 1 per head on each mature buffalo or camel. Horses, mules, cows and donkeys are exempt. [g) Tax on reeds and mats. —20 per cent, ad valorem.72 (A) Tax on boats .—Minimum is Rs. 10 per annum for a ballum. For every ton of carrying capacity over 10 tons an extra rupee a year. Mashufs are not taxed. (*') Tax on fishing.—The fish tax in various localities is “ farmed ** out to the highest bidder. The usual term is for one year. (j) License fees .—Shooting licenses, liquor licenses, fishing licenses and licenses for sale of tobacco, opium, etc., vary according to subject. MUNICIPAL TAXATION. 1. House Tax. Rate 10 per cent, on assessed annual rental value. Note.—T his is a tax on all houses and shops, is now taken. No special shop tax * 2. Building Tax. Rs. A.

General. —Almost all types of tribal conditions are represented in the area included in this report. 1. The settled Tribal area. —Is inhabited by the Muutafiq and the Ahl Jizair confederations. ' 2. The nomadic Tribal areas. —In which all are included certain wandering tribes to the West and East of the Gharraf and the Badawin tribes in the Shamiyah, to the South of the Basrah-Darraji Kailway who wander into our administrative area. 3. The semi-tribal area. —Around Qurnah and in the vast marsh area North-West, West and South-West of it. 4. The non-tribal area. —From the vicinity of Qnrnah down to Fao. (See Tribal Chart.) 1. The settled Tribal area. —Tribes are administered through their own Shaikhs. The Shaikhship normally passes from father to son or at least remaining in the family, unless our administration have any special reason for making a change. {a) The Muntaflq. —Is not a “'Tribe ” but a large loose confeder. ation of Arab tribes. With a few exceptions, which are noted in the tribal lists the constituents of the Muntanq are Shiahs by religion. The Sa’dun who are the ruling family and the Shaikhs of the Aluntafiq, are Sunnis (for the history of the Sa’dun family see Chapter I). The tribesmen are either settled cultivators (Hadhr) or shepherds (Shawiyah). These latter use the donkey as a means of transport in place of the camel used by the Badawin. The Muntafiq fall into three main divisions :— The Ajwad The Bani Malik (pronounced Malich) The Bani Sa’id Of these the Ajwad is the most warlike but has the least cohesion. The Bilni Malik have also but little cohesion and are divided into two main confederations known as the Mnjarrah and the Bani Khaiqan. The Bani Sa’id are the most compact and the nearest to a real tribe. In case tion at Sh selves int main Div (l) Th whom are Hammar It is pr Muntafiq, it was oi weakened east of Cl The tri M N 2.

Normally, however, these three main Divisions are merely nominal. (6) The AM Jizair .—Is a confederation of settled tribes, some of whom are Muntafiq and others are not. Its location is around the Hammar lake. It is probable that at one time the whole of the Ahl J izair w as Muntafiq, for local tradition places it Bani Malik by origin; presumably it was only when the links which bound the Muntafiq together weakened with the waning authority of the Sa’dun that the sections east of Chabaish detached themselves. The tribes composing the Ahl Jizair are:— fBani Asad. | A1 Husaini. Muntatiq - - •*) ®» u i Hutait. | ’Ibadah. l^Bani .Musharraf. Non-Muntafiq . . Bani Mansur. 2. The nomadic Tribal areas.—The nomadic tribes do not go in for agriculture, but are pastoral tent dwellers, breeding either camels or sheep, and donkeys from which they obtain their livelihood. They are tribally organised. Those tribes in the Shamlyah are dependent to a very great extent for supplies of w r hat they eat, drink and wear cn the “ Desert Ports” such as Zubair and Khamisiyah. The closing of these Ports” to an insubordinate tribe is a most efficient way of punishing it and bringing suitable pressure to bear. Most of the nomadic tribes have fixed graziuj^grounds according to season, for their camels or sheep. Their settling places are determined by the amount of suitable grazing available, by the amount of water in the locality and by the conditions for security. As a general rule every nomadic tribe is at feud with one or more of the other nomadic tribes and most of these feuds are of long standing. Similarly also, they have their alliances and help each other in w r ar. Raiding .—Raiding is looked upon as a pastime by the Badawin- We have attempted to reduce it by means of cutting down tribal allow'ances and so forth, but with little result, our interferences with their national sport being resented by the tribesmen. In almost all cases raids are inter-tribal and actually affects us in no direct way whatsoever. The cause of raiding is usually a blood feud of long standing. The rules of the game are as follows, and it is quite the exception to find they are broken :—76 (a) The victors cease to fight as soon as the vanquished surrender. (b) The victors have the right to cany off all camels, live stock, arms and any loot they require. (e) The vanquished are then allowed to go free—no enemy are slain after surrender nor any prisoners taken. (d) All arms, animals or loot brought away by a successful raiding party are considered fair game by any neutral tribe through whose territory the successful raiding party may happen to be returning. (#&gt;) Unless they “Stand and deliver” all, or a portion as required, they are liable to be attacked. This difficulty is usually overcome by the raiding party taking one or two men of the neutral tribe with them both on the outward and homeward journey. These men do not however completely guarantee a safe passage in every case. This rule has on several occasion? been known to have been broken when the temptation was strong. 3. The semi-tribal area .—This is the connecting link between the tribal areas, under Shaikhs and the non-tribal areas under the Mudirs of Nalriyahs, installed by our civil administration, continued by the provisional Arab Government. Madlnah, for instance, is not a tribe but a Nahiyah, it however is under a Shaikh and not a Mudir. Sharish is similarly situated and the Shaikh there does the work of a Mudir. Dair is the most northerly Nahiyah that has a Mudir and not a Shaikh. Until 1916 there had always been a Shaikh of Dair but owing to constant strife we removed the contending parties and appointed a Mudir instead. 4. The non^Triballirea .—May be said to be from Dair southwards to Fao. This is the great date garden district and is inhabited by a population which has become so mixed on acconnt of settlers from the North and from districts on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab having migrated thereto, that tribal conditions are often non-existent. There is no large tribal organisation ; in many cases there are small communities of tribesmen who, to some extent, keep up their tribal connection, but. those tribal ties are gradually becoming more and more loose. Armed forces. The Mnntafiq, the Ahl Jazair and the Bedawin tribes are well and suitably armed and equipped for the areas and conditions in which they live. The population of the semi-tribal and non-tribal areas also possess arms, but their rifles are far fewer in proportion and the number of modern magazine rifles is very low. They, however, have suificient for their own protection and for the repulse of any raids that may be made from the v m en avails and class c The Mu most turbi about half type.

Details regarding the armed Jen available for taming out in war and also the approximate number and class of rifles with each tribe is shown in detail m the tribal lists. The Mnntafiq are a warlike people, probably the best armed and the most turbulent in Iraq. They possess some 30,000 modern rifles and about half that number of old but serviceable weapons of the Martini true They are also great breeders of horses. A large proportion of them can therefore be mounted in battle, which renders them mobile in addition.to their rifle power. In the Muutafiq there is much jealousy between the various tribes, and often between the various sections ill a tribe. It is therefore unlikely that the whole contideration would combine at any one time, provided that reasonably good diplomacy were exercised. The Ahl Jizair have not as great a proportion of modern rifles as the Muntatiq tribes—the majority of their weapons being Martinis. This arrangement suits their conditions well as, for the most V art, they live in absolute marsh, where, when fighting occurs, it takes place amongst dense reeds, the combatants being in mashufs. All shooting is done at close range when a large bore bullet is very effective against both man and boat. They however lose the advantage of magazine fire. Salim al Khaiyun (Shaikh of the Earn’ Ashad), has a considerable influence over the tribes of the Ahl Jizaii. The Radawin tribes are well armed, and must be so for their own self- preservation as they are constantly at feud with one another. They give us very little trouble as almost all the fighting they do is inter tribal and outside the area of our occupation. southwards sited by a tiers from att-al-Arab m-existent. are small their tribal more and ire well and as in which dso possess number of afficient for iay be made Possible centres of disturbance. The most likely centres for possible disturbance are : — 1. Shatrah for the Gharraf tribes. 2. Stiq ash Shuyuhh for the Majarrah and Bani Khaiqan. 3. Chabaish for the Bani Sa’id. 1. Shatrah is in the Abudah territory—The Abudah being a strong and turbulent tribe, with a Shaikh-Khaiynn al ’Dbaid who is a good military leader, a brave fighter, and an astute diplomatist with far- reaching influence on the Gharraf. It was very largely dne to his weight in the scale that the Muntafiq tribes took no active part in tbe 1S20 insurrection. In May 1920 all the Gharraf tribes were qmet. This was undoubtedly due to the fact that they were contented and prosperous as a result of enjoying the security of person and goods guaranteed them by British administration backed^ by adequate orce. It must be remembered that such a state, especially ^if prolonged, is foreign to. the warlike nature of the Gbarraf tribesmen78 and even if they adapt themselves to new conditions an outbreak on a lar^e scale is always possible in this area. The Gharraf tribe, aie powerfa!, well fed, well armed with modern rifles and well mounted wlnle they are far from the reach of troops. Their past record shows them to be good fighters ; for instance, in 1904 they fought and defeated 17 battalions of Turkish (Arab) troops which had'bee ..ordered from Baghdad by the Turks to subdue them, and again, in the cariy of , Mesopotamian campaign they did well against British last pages 8 ' yah ' F ° r ” 6 present Muntafk l ^nation see Chapter I n S&gt; !u aS *r S !

The former were always more anti-British than the latter and are still probably the same at heart. , I 3 , si .l U , a l ed ,. in the Bani ,Asad country which is ruled by the influential Shaikh Salim al Khaiyun. He commands a large a,ld j h i )n t0 , his own tribe » mainly from the tribes ot die Ahl Jizair and from Madinah. He was strongly pro-Turk, and was therefore sent to India for the duration of the war. He is now back as Shaikh and is by way of being a sincere friend of the Government. He is however, capable of raising a revolt on a considerable scale should he deem it wise to do •o# Militaty considerations. 1 he line of action taken by certain tribes, if hostile to us, would probably be as under: — The phafir would cut the Basrah—Xasiriyah railway line for the protection of which they are at present paid a monthly subside of Ks. 1,500 a month. The Budur, Jawarin, Ghazzi, and Shurifat might do the same. 5 The Dhafir would be difficult to punish as they are a desert tribe with no settled abode needing very rapid intelligence to render air action effective. They are dependent however for their stores and food supplies on the “Desert Ports” of Zubair. Nasirivah, Khami- siyah or Samawah. J The closing of these together with Xazaf and Karbala would even- tually bring the Dhafir to heel. The Ghazzi, Jawarin, etc., have cultivation and are therefore vulner. able to punitive measures. The action that would probably be taken by the Hasainat. Azairij and the al Ibrahim would be to attack Nasiriyah. The Ghazzi and Budur might assist them. These tribes would be most suitablv and easily punished by the destruction of their villages by aeroplanes, then- herds could also have heavy loss inflicted on them by air action. 1 The G1 in Sbatn which a Should a against t and woui the stron vulnerab Gharraf boats bre destroy ir Many river and as by boi The B unrepres Iraq we punitive difficult.

Should air action fail it must be remembered that punitive measures against the Gharraf tribes by land forces are a serious undertaking and would involve military operations on a large scale on account of the strong opposition that would be met and the difficulties of a long vulnerable and bad line of communication. When the Shatt al Gharraf is high much damage could be done by gun fire from gun boats breaking down the marginal bunds, so flooding the land and destroying the crops. Many of their towees and villages are within easy gun range of the river and could be effectively damaged by fire from gunboats, as well as by bombing. The Bani Sa’id are unlikely to take action against us. They were unrepresented at the battle of Shaibabwhen nearly all the tribes of Iraq were out against us.The Bani Sa’id country is most inaccessible ; punitive measures against them, except by air, would, therefore, be difficult. The probable action taken by the Mujarrah and the Bani Khaiqan would be to attack Suq ash Shuyukh and stop river traffic between Basrah and Nasiriyah. A strong punitive air action may be effective in bringing them to heel bnt they present difficult targets. The Bani’ Asad, in the vicinity of Chabaish would also stop the river traffic on the main channel between Basrah and Nasiriyah. It would be a difficult problem to punish them severely as they can take refuge so easily in the marshes, the minor waterways of which leading through the dense reeds, being known only to themselves. The town of Chabaish is the vulnerable point. The employment of aeroplanes for bombing and machine gunning, especially when working in co-operation with troops and gunboats, has an excellent effect when it is required to biing a refractory shaikh to his senses. As an example, at the close of 1918 Badr al Kumaiyidh still refused to tender his submission to ns, and no revenue was collected from the Albu Salih tiibal territory. Early in 1919-20 gunboats, 4 aeroplanes and 1.10 mounted levies were detailed to attack his camp. Badr was driven out of his headquarters at Fatbi. on the Bad’ah and took refuge in an inaccessible position in the Amarah marshes. We installed a new Shaikh, Badr then attacked the “ usurper ” and in May 1919 a larger mixed force of gunboats, aeroplanes and mounted and dismounted men was sent against him. BadV was driven out of Albu Salih country and h’s crops were burnt. The following month he started negotiations which resulted in his submission and unconditional acceptance of our terms. In the Basrah and Qnrnah districts the possibility of a rising on a large scale against ns is very remote. The people appreciate the80 benefits of settled rule and arc prosperous and contented. They are ill armed and being without cohesion have little to gain and mnch to lose by any such misguided action. Until the time comes in the future when a solution of the extremely ditficult problem of disarming the tribes is arrived at, the Government will always have to be prepared, in the Muntafiq area perhaps more than elsewhere, to back up their policy by force when necessary, • or be content at times with the mere form of Government. Policy. The Turkish system of tribal administration was based on the principle of preventing ci hesion among the secthjpsof a tribe and of dividing them up. British administration policy was based on directly opposite lines. From the outset it was held that the surest way of securing peace was by restoring the power of the Shaikhs. This policy obtains the active support of the Shaikh himself to whose interest it is to support a Government which is prepared to support him. This is satisfactory when adequate military is in reserve. The insurrection of 1920 followed by the drastic redaction of the British garrison and transition to Arab rule produced a reaction, leading to a multiplication of small Shaikhs with small followings and tendencies towards independence of action. While diminishing the chances of| combined action without serious cause, this condition increases lawless ness and minor instances of resistance to Government orders. Note on the Mad’an. The settlad districts of the vast marsh ; rea which are situated along the river and canal banks run beck into the marshes where they have no definite limits. The marshes are inhabited by “ Mad’an,” a general term, which includes all those marsh dewcllers who, although organized tribally in a small way, have no cohesion on a large scale. They are fishermen, reed gatherers and breeders of buffaloes. They are without fixed habitation and are accustomed, with the subsiding floods, to come down to the pasturages near the rivers and canals. No Mad’an Shaikh has much influence except over his own small unit; thiir groups fall under the authority of whichever Shaikh administers the territory in which, or on the borders of which they happen to be. They frequently wander from the domains of on Shaikh into these of another. By nature they are barharious, wild and lawless and do not readily submit to control. The distinction between Mad’au and non-Mad’an is indefinite and -appears to be one of calling rather than of race.They are mnch to extremely overnment haps more necessary, M.

The ‘Abudah is a tribe of great size and importance, whose territory lies in the centre of the Shatrah district; it has always been notorious for its dislike of any form of Government. Owing to the improvement in its lands during the past few years the num bers of cultivators employed, who would follow the tribe in war, have been rapidly increasing, while it owes much of its importance to Shaikh Khaiyun al ‘ Ubaid^an experienced leader in war. Khaiyun al ‘Ubaid was a constant thorn in the side of the Turks. In 1913 he attacked and plundered Shatrah, and an expedition was sent against him in 1914. In 1915 he joined the Turks against us and was appointed Qaimmaqam of Shatrah. The small Sinajir section, to which he belongs, has been raised to a much greater position in the tribe by his restless activity and by the astuteness of his wazir, Kadhim, a Kurd, now dead. Khaiyun lives at Sudaifah, east of Shatrah and at Hawi, 1 mile south of Shatrah. Khaiyun is a man of about 36 years of age and a born fighter. He is wealthy, and has all the good and bad qualities characteristic of his race, chief of the latter being his inability to fight on any but what he thinks is the winning side ; this attitude, in spite of his help to us in the past, makes him a man whom Government can never trust. In spite of this, Government owes him a debt of gratitude for his support in the insurrection of 1920, which un doubtedly saved the situation in the Muntafiq and was possibly the cause of the breakdown of the rebellion. To state the fact briefly, the tribes looked upon Khaiyun as the only man on the Gharraf who could be their leader, and a representative party was sent to ask him to lead them in an attack against Nasirlyah. khai yun refused ; had he accepted, Nasirlyah might have been taken and, as a result, the insurrection spread even further afield. From that time up to his departure in 1921 on pilgrimage to Mecca, he did everything to please, even to paying up revenue before* the date due. On his return from Mecca he found as his successor as Qaimmaqam of Shatrah an equally strong man, who naturally owing to his position, was receiving the support of Government. From the first the two men hated one anotner and each is still trying by fair means or foul to have the other deported from the district, khai yun finding the Qaimmaqam supported by Government must now look for support elsewhere. Outwardly he remains unchanged in his attitude towards Government, but he has found it necessary to fall back on his tribe for support and, to retain their affection and*confidence, he realises that he must not enforce revenue from them, with the result that Khaiyun’s revenue debt to Government at present far exceeds that of any other tribe on the Gharraf. So lonr as Khaiyun remains in the district, the ‘Abudah area tribe %to be reckoned with ; backed by him they will, when occaskr. demands, rise and follow him to a man. Khaiyun has three brothers ; two are negligible, the third 5aJuun lives at Hawi and is a sarkal in his own right. He is of a similar type to Khaiyun, but has not his strength of character.5 6 Armed mbs, Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total.

The tribe must not be confused with that of the same name on the Tigris, with whom they have no political connection, though almost certainly of the same origin. They say they are from Najd, and claim descent from ’Azraq al Shami. They were probably Ma’dan by origin, and are possibly recent comers to the Gharraf. They have an evil reputation, having adopted methods of frightfulness in order to establish their posi tion, while after the Batnijah fight early in 1916 they refused to allow Saiyids, sent for the purpose, to bury our dead. The Hawalah and Humairah sections joined the tribes against us in February 1916, and were selected for punishment; the Humairah are wholly innocent of morals. The Khudhair section used to be the ruling section, but are now almost extinct and do not recognize the autho rity of Qati’. Their Shaikh, Dhirb, was connected with the attack on us in February 1916. Many members of the tribe have migrated to other tribes in search of a livelihood, in particular Al Yusuf section, who went to the Mujarrah and'Kut in search of water. Qati’al Buti is the only shaikh in the Nasiriyah district who has any education. He can read and write Arabic and speaks Turkish. His father was selected paramount shaikh of Al Azairij on account of his cunning and fair speech.135 mo name I n, though I om Najd, I )ly recent I i, having i heir posi- I 5fused to I Hawalah K February t re wholly I he ruling I lie autho- I he attack I tribes in I 3 went to I t who has I Turkish.

The Budur are a semi-nomadic tribe, who own no camels except for a few with Sharshab. They are extensive sheep breeders, and .ossess a considerable number of donkeys. The tribe are still very wild and constantly quarrelling amongst themselves or with neigh- bouring tribes. They are well armed and reckoned to be the strong est fiahters of the Muntafiq and are said to own 1,000 horses at least. . About July 1919 a dispute arose between the two antagonistic sections, Sharshab and Nun. Theroot of the trouble was the number of unsettled blood feuds. For the last generation there had been continual inter-tribal fighting, and each side claimed ‘ fasi ’ as a result of past fights. The dispute has since been settled and law and order restored, but as both sides are well-armed it is impossible to say how long the present truce will last. The normal head of the tribe is Sharshab, who has no control whatever over Nun’s sections; any attempt to enforce Sharshab’s authority over Nun is sure to lead to trouble. As a result all questions relating to Nun’s sections are dealt with through him. During the summer months the settled sections cultivate idhrah, mash ahd simsim. Their lands are watered by the Shatt al Kai and the Mai’ah. In winter the bulk of the tribe cross over with their herds of sheep to the Shamiyah but appear to have no settled grazing centres.143 11 Armed men. Horse.

The shaikh of the tribe in Nasir Pasha’s time was Hubaib, Hubaib died, and Nasir Pasha made his son Mu’aidi shaikh, Mti’aidi held the shaikhship for many years, but he was a man of too independent a nature to be pleasing to those who looked lor subservience in their tribal dependents. He grievously offended Sa’dun Pasha who, in the cheerful fashion of the family, exterminated him and all his sons. After the death of Mu’aidi, his brother’s son, Manshad Ibn Manahi al Hubaib, was chosen shaikh and is the pre sent shaikh of the tribe. The present state of the tribe is very satisfactory. Manshad is a thoroughly good shaikh, sensible and with a sense of justice, He also has great influence with the nomad tribes, particularlv with Al Shuraifat and Al Budur. A testimony to his tact and straight dealing will be found in the fact that whenever a majlis is formed to deal with any tribal dispute of consequence in the dis trict, a request is invariably put forward that Manshad should be one of the members. The only other personality of consequence in the tribe is Husain al Shlhan, who lives near Bathah. He is a useful person to Manshad and works well with him, but be has not Manshad’s charaetsr ot «uch a reputation for uprightness.Fadhul from Fas Hubaib, lidi shaikh, as a man of looked lor ily offended xterminated rother’s son, i is the pre- r .

The tribe consists of seven independent tribal sections. Al Bisharah shaikhs of the Soran section are the paramount shaikhly family, and during the British administration attempts were made to enforce the rule of Hamudah al Mizail over the entire tribe. The attempt was not well received and the shaikh of each section is now considered as independent. In the rebellion of 1920 the Albu Jassim sectioD successfully fought Hamudah.

Nasir Pasha had in atten- dance on him a number of Saiyids, and to these he gave land in the Hassunah Muqata’ah. Later on Mizyad Pasha brought in an addi. tional number of Saiyids, in order that the Muqata’ah, which is large, might be brought properly under cultivation. Later on, some of them offended Mizyad Pasha and he ejected them. They then went and settled in the Husainat. But, after a couple of years, doubtless finding that his own income from the land was suffering, he recalled them and they have remained settled in the muqata’ah ever since. The fallahin in the muqata’ah are drawn from all the neighbouring tribes, but in particular from A1 Ibrahim and the Bani Sa’id, of which it is often believed Hassunah is a constituent. The head of the Hassunah Saiyids is Saiyid ’Abdul Husain. He is the best of them ; but this is not saying a great deal for him. The remainder of them are a sanctimonious and hypocritical set. As regards the internal affairs of the muqata’ah .there is constant intrigue and counter-intrigue between Salih al Daghir, Shaikh of A1 Ibrahim, and Saiyid ’Abdul Husain regarding the Ibrahim sections in the muqata’ah. But they are on the whole a match for each other, and no particular harm seems likely to result.159 . in atten- nd in the l an addi. which is Later on, m.

In Sa’dun and Turkish days this confederacy was in two inde pendent sections and two independent chiefs were recognized. The first section consisted of Hachcham, Bani Tamim and Toqiyah and the second of Shuwailat and Qaraghul. The Suraifiyin fol lowed the section which was the strongest at the moment, and the ’Attab tried to keep out altogether, but if they came in they follow ed the second section. About 80 years ago Sikar al Mushlib obtained a precarious hold over the whole confederacy through the diplomacy of his illegitimate son Haji Sa’id and through Tur kish Government support, he being their tax-farmer. His son Maqtuf was unable to maintain this hold ; Yusuf al Khairullah was on the rise and gradually by force of arms and diplomacy was acknowledged paramount chief of the whole confederacy. After his murder in February 1918 his son Muhan took his place and punished rebels heavily, and in spite of defiance by the tribes was supported by us. Muhan, who was barely 20, became para mount chief of the East bank of the Gharraf. He was however led by bad advisers notably one Mamud Hasani, a merchant of Qa’lat Sikar, and was always in mischief. In May 1919 he was sent into Nasiriyah for punishment. He is well mannered, good-looking and possesses strong character. The union between the constituents of Al Humaid is at the present time nominal. They would only come together in the event of trouble with Al Mayyah and ’Abudah. During the insurrec tion of 1920 they fought amongst themselves and were prevented from passing Shatrah by Khaiyim al ’Ubaid. The tribes are well mounted and their horses are excellent; (they are great breeders and fair horse masters. Their lands are well fortified but between December and June their crops could be destroyed by a gun-boat breaking down the river bunds when the water level is high. Their disposition is naturally warlike, and they have always held their own against the Turks. In the summer of 1920 the Qaraghul, amongst other tribes of the Muntafiq, were bombed for disobedience of orders with the result that the rest of the confederation is at the present (1922) peaceful .and apparently contented.5 Armed wev Horse.

They came to the Euphrates and began to cultivate settling in a semi-agricultural, semi-pastoral state near the Abu Jidadah. About 45 years ago a dispute arose between them and the Sa’dun, who at that time lived on the northern quarter of Nasirivah ; and the Albu ’Adham, one of their sections, killed Dhahir al Sa’dun. In fear of the vengeance of the ia dun the whole tribe immediately scattered, some to Khidhr, some to Samawah and some to the Bani Huchaim. After a lapse of time when they thought the matter had blown over, they began to return. A number of them, however, did not come back to the left bank, but settled on the Shamiyah side. Between those that returned to the left bank and the’Azairij there was continual fighting, because the Azairij, owing to the silting up of the Shatt al Azairij, were striving to get across to the Euphrates. I nder this pressuie the majority of the Husainat crossed to the right bank. The‘head shaikh of the tribe about fifty years ago was Chafchir ibn Dhiyab. After his death his son Shuraishah claimed the shaikh- ship, but he was young and a weak personality. The Husainat therefore rejected him and in his place chose ’Allaj al Suwaini. He had no sons, and after his death about thirty years ago he was succeeded by larhan al f lahir, his brother s son. Farhan al Tahir is now an old man, but has the tribe well under control. In character he is the exact contrary of Salih al Daghir, Shaikh of Al Ibrahim. He is straight forward and always ready to give assistance. In spite of his age he is very active, and travels about his tribe with great frequency.181 % 5 6 7 Armed men. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modem. Old but service able.

A1 Ibrahim were oifginally a nomadic tribe forming part of the Bani Malik. They, however, settled on the branch of the Shatt al Hai, now known as Shatt al Ibrahim, and took to agriculture. At that time they were divided into three main sections, Al Musaddaq Al Hasan and Albu Hamudi, the last of which was headed by Al Rodhan. About forty years ago, Shaush ibn Humaidi was head of the whole tribe. After his death his son Tahir took his place, but he was not a man of his father’s character and another personality came into prominence, Daghir ibn Hamad. During their life time these two men, Tahir and Daghir, divided the allegiance of the tribe between them, and the tribe remained strong because they held to a common policy. After their death Daghir was succeeded by his son Salih and Tahir by Mutashshar. Of these two Mutashshar was the better and stronger character, being consulted the more frequently by the Turkish Government with regard to the affairs of the tribe ; but on the whole he and Salih held well together. Mutashshar, however, died seven years ago near Suq on his way to Shu‘aibah to take part in the battle. He was succeeded by his son Manhar. Manhar, however, was both young and of weak character, and was immediately ousted from a great part of his property and entirely from his position in the tribe by Chaid al Tahir, the brother of Mutashshar. From that date there sprang up a feud between Salih and Chaid ; partly because Salih resented the treatment which Chaid had dealt out to Manhar, Salih’s late ally, and partly because Salih saw in Chaid, owing to his propensity not only to grasp but to grasp successfully, a formidable rival. At this period the British were making their way up the Euphrates. When they approached Nasiriyah, the question which exercised the minds of these two, Salih and Chaid, was which horse was the more profitable to back. Salih decided to come in with the English and Chaid remained with the Turks. Chaid did not make his dakhalah with the British Government until the middle of 1917. Salih al Daghir is now the shaikh who is recognized by the Gov ernment as paramount. Chaid would like to be regarded as his rival if allowed. Salih is what the Arabs call a ‘ Shaitan ’, cunning as a snake, with much of a snake’s venom and with fifty years’ experience behind him. Owing partly to the rivalry of Chaid and partly to the geographical situation of the village his position in the tribe is not strong and he has to maintain it by craft. His dealings with Government officials are marked by a perversity which leads him, through a wrong headed desire to cause irritation185 and to nullify any scheme that may be proposed, deliberately to misinterpret orders and to present every obstacle that he can con ceive. He keeps his tribe in a constant state of unrest by his machinations; and he appears to consider this to be to his own in terest. He is, however, retained as shaikh, because there is no one of his calibre to replace him. He is the cleverest man of his tribe, and on the principio of * Set a thief to catch a thief ’ he has his uses. In addition he was the first to make up his mind to come in to the British during the war.108 160 187 l°Z Families Tents or Houses. 1,000 Reed Huts. 100 Armed men. Horse. !

A1 Husaini. Bani Hutait. ’Ibadah. Bani Musharraf. The Ahl al Jazair or “ People of the Island ” form a geographical group between the Tigris and the east end of the Hammar lake comprising some Muntafiq and some non-Muntafiq[ tribes. It is said that the name was given to the inhabitants of this district by the Muntafiq tribes when they first settled in their present territory. Originally, therefore, none of Ahl al Jazair were Muntafiq, but in time a few have managed to conquer and occupy the lands border ing on the east end of the lake. It is possible that at first the in- habitants of al Husaini, ’Ibadah and Bani Musharraf were not included in the Ahl al Jazair, but the tribesmen of to-day are fol lowers of the Bani ’Asad and are therefore considered as belonging to the Ahl al Jazair group ; none of the three, like the remaining Lake tribes, being of the Bani Khaiqan confederation. The non-Muntafiq tribes of this group are not mentioned here, but are included in the tribes of Basrah district, to which they belong. BANI ASAD. The Bani Asad form a tribal group under the control of the Shaikh of Chabaish. The tribe claims descent from the Osntral Arabian tribe of the same name, which was famous in the days before the Prophet. It is said to be an offshoot of the Ahl al Shimal (Arabs of the Hijaz) and to have migrated from Arabia to the neigh bourhood of Babylon and thence to the lower Euphrates. Some furqahs, t.e., sections are still to be found round Karbala. The Bani Asad form part of the Ahl Jazair, which comprises some non- Muntafiq tribes. The tribe is chiefly occupied in the reed and mat trade. There are a few cultivators, who grow idhrah, and two sections who work the salt pans at Ghabashiyah. Their district is absolute marsh with waterways known only to the tribe. The reeds recede from the river on either side reaching to a height of 20 feet, with the result that military operations would be almost impossible in this area. The present shaikh of the Bani Asad is Salim al Khaiyun, a man of pleasant appearance and striking personality, though un doubtedly a rogue. In 1915 after the occupation of Qumah, Salim was removed to India, since he refused to surrender to us, being195 ! 0£ eographical immar lake •ibes.

During his absence his nephew, Majid al Khaiyun, was appointed shaikh. In 1920 during the rebellion Salim definitely placed himself on the side of the Government by concentrating the tribes of the lake and protecting and returning to Basrah the dredger «oet. In 1921 Salim was appointed Minister without portfolio in the pro visional Government. On the formation of the new cabinet after the coronation of King Faisal, Salim with the rest of the old cabinet resigned. So long as Salim is shaikh of the Bani Asad, the Bani Asad and Salim can be relied upon to support that govern ment, which has the power to attack Chabaish. Aeroplanes co operating with a very strong force of defence vessels are the only possible military measures in this district.

The Khafajah was once a powerful tribe feared by all its neigh- hours in the surrounding district, and with the evil repute of being the greatest scoundrels and thieves on the Gharraf. Owing to the Shatt al Shatrah becoming dry large numbers r 4 tribesmen migrated to Basrah, Suq, Hai and Hillah ; whilst two-tn.Als of the remainder may be considered to-day as semi-nomadic wandering into other territories with their sheep in search of grazing. The large area constituting the Khafajah territory presents a most barren and deserted spectacle. This lack of water in their territory and the increase of that element in the area of their neighbours and rivals, the Abudah, has completely reversed the positions of the two tribes, the latter now holding the position of the most formidable tribe on the southern end of the Gharraf. Of the sections some have been hostile to us, some neutral and others friendly, but all are bound together with t lie one vice oi thieving and robbing caravans on the Nasiriyah-Shatrah road, which runs through the middle of their territory. During the insurrection of 1920 they were prevented by Khaiyun al ’Ubaid, Shaikh of Abudah, from rising as a tribe against us; some, however, did fire on Nasiriyah.209 l its neigh- e of being ring to the n migrated remainder into other large area barren and y and the and rivals, two tribes, de tribe on leutral and me vice of trail road, iy Khaiyun gainst us; Statement,211 I Families Tents or Houses. 1,300 Tents 600 Huts 80 T., 30 H. 70 T.

Tbe Baui Khaiqan is a strong tribal confederation, which eni' braces all tribes from tbe ’Asakrah to the east shore of the Horii Haminar. They are not by origin Bani Malik, but formed a separate constituent of the Muntafiq. In Shaikh Ns sir's time this group became very powerful under the Mughashghash family, but the Turks deliberately split it into the numerous small sections which exist at present. They brought the Hammar tribes under the Qadka of Qumah, thus splitting up the Bani Khaiqan between Qumah and Suq. This was strongly resented; the British, ho? ever, during the occupation restored them, for official purposes, t« the Suq district. At the present time the Bani Khaiqan for practical purpose- divide themselves into the following groups :— (1) Hammar Lake. (2) A1 Rahamah and Al Shumais. (3) ’Asakrah. (4) Juwaibir. The constituents of these groups acknowledge no titular heai and are considered as independent; thus the tribes of the Hammac Lake and Rahamah, whilst admitting the Shaikh of the Ban; Khaiqan as the Shaikh of their tribe, deny his authority and^ consider themselves independent, whilst those of the Juwaibir and ’AsakriE have always been considered independent. It is customary at the present time, when referring to the Ban Khaiqan, to include only Al Rahamah and Al Shumais. Tfc important factor must not be overlooked, seeing that the Ban Khaiqan cannot be reckoned as a united and single-minded con federation. In the event of war the Bani Sa’id tribe of the now vanisbw Aqqrrah tribe would in all probability join the Bani Khaiqan amwith them possibly the Albu Khalifah, who are claimed by both Bani Khaiqan and A1 Mujarrah. The Bani Khaiqan are considered to be more amenable to Gov ernment orders than the Mujarrah, probably for the reason that they are more accessible. Both confederations, however, in Turkish times were constantly at war. Like the Mujarrah, the Bani Khaiqan are truculent and well armed, unwilling to submit to any form of established Government, and, like the Mujarrah, they would be hostile if any reverse overtook our arms. Their numbers are impossible to estimate with accuracy, and the figures given are not reliable. It is probable that the number of fighting men is slightly over-estimated ; if such is the case, the number of rifles quoted will give a fair estimate of the fighting strength of the tribes, since a man can rarely be found to-day, who does not possess a rifle of his own. Ammunition too is plenti ful, the very poorest man being in possession of at least two hundred rounds. The Bani Khaiqan cannot be said to have taken any active part during the disturbances of 1920.219 5 6 7 Abmed hen. Rifles. Horse. Foot. Total. Modem. Old but service able.

A1 Muhsin are not strictly speaking a tribe, but a ruling family like the Sa’dun and the titular Shaikhs of the Bani Huchaim con federation. They are Saiyids by origin, which was in Mecca. Abdullah al Kuah came early from Mecca to claim certain cus- r.omary rights from the Bani Huchaim. He married the daughter of their chief, and had a son called Ghattah. ‘Abdullah returned to Mecca and left all his rights over Bani Huchaim to Chattab, who is the ancestor of the present family, which owing to its sub- sequent size separated, had rivalries and lost power accordingly. They have now no authority over the Bani Huchaim, but with their followers are considered a tribe. Naif al ’Ajil, their Shaikh, is Mudir of Darraji.248 AL MUJARRAH. Constituents. A1 Dujain.

Al Zayyad The Mujarrah is a powerful confederation, which from time immemorial has been at war with the Bani Khaiqan and which has remained more faithful than the latter to ’Ajaimi and the Muntafiq influence. The tribes are turbulent, well-armed and form a far more dangerous confederation than the Bani Khaiqan. In the last 11 years of their administration the Turks made three unsuccessful expeditions against them. Their wealth in dates and rice is remark able, and yet the tribes living below the Hachcham had not paid revenue to the Turks for the last eight years. The merchants of Nasiriyah and Suq own much property in the Mujarrah territory below Suq, but for over 14 years they have taken complete posses sion and refuse to allow the owner to approach his property on pain of death. The Mujarrah tribes fall mainly into three large groups, Al Hachcham, Al Hasan and Al Shaddud. Though the Mujarrah form a confederation of tribes closely knit together, yet they acknowledge no paramount chief. The Mujarrah, however, at the present are politically divided into two, traceable to the hostility sh jwn to the paramount Shaikhs of the constituent tribes, so that it is possible from a diplomatic point of view to maintain a balance of power and not to allow the confedera tion to act with one mind. Bach side of t is division assists the other in private warfare and, though combining for the defence of the Mujarrah as a whole, it would be bad diplomacy if the con federation as a whole combined against Government. The division is as follows :— Al Shalawiyah Al Sarah . Mushairjah Gharyafiyah Albu Humaidi ‘idris versus Haji Husain. Hammudah versus Albu Jasim. Faisal al Yasir versus al ’Obaid. Haji Shahuo versus Shinyar. Yasir al Cholan versus Dukhaiyil al Mozan.Bani Muslim Albu Hamdan A1 Hachcham Nowashi Shuwalish Shaddud . Hasan al Wuhaiyib versus ‘Alaiyin al Hulu. vj The Saiyids versus The tribe. Qasid versus Haji Nasir. Husain al Matlub versus Huwaifadh. ‘Abdullah Wushah versus Muhammad al Wushah. Haji Faisal versus Haji Hamad. A point worthy of note concerning the Mujarrah is that they will not fight against Government except in the defence of their lands, when they are prepared to fight any enemy. As a con federation they cannot be said to have taken any part during the disturbances of 1920, though there are instances where tribes rose and took a leading part against Government. These instances are noted when dealing with each tribe separately.252 AL HAKKAM (HACHCHAM). The Hachcham claim descent from the Ghazzi and through Ahem from the old Fudhul tribes, now split up between the Sham, mar Jarba, Dhafir and ’Anizah. _ Most of the Hachcham lands belong to the Rodhan and Rashid branches of the Sa’dfm, but some are their own property. A1 Hachcham are a well-known tribe of the 41 Mujarrah Con- .federation, famous chiefly as fighters—they defeated the Turks ot three occasions—and on account of the richness of their lands. At present (1922) there is no paramount Shaikh, but five Shaikhs with more or less equal power. Previously Government appointed Qasid al Nahi paramount, but this was bitterly resented by the shaikhly family of Haji Nasir, who himself had been outlawed for the murder of Mizban al Radhi in August 1915. It was, however, discovered later that the murder was the result of an intrigue by Qasid. During the rebellion of 1920 Al Hachcham rose against us, and, at the instigation of Haji Nasir, frequently fired on the railway posts. At the present the tribe is so split up by blood feuds that there is no fear of them taking any active opposition against Govern ment. The important factor, however, must not be overlooked dhat, should Al Hachcham rise at any time, the whole of Al Mujar- irah Confederation would come to their assistance.and through en the Sham- i and Rashid rty.

The chief of the tribe, Mirza ’Tnayah, is a religious leader of great prestige, and has enormous influence with the tribes, especially Al Hasan. He is well connected with Najaf and Basrah, where his brother lives. He is a property owner in this district, and has a mosque in his gardens near the village.

The tribe wa^ originally known as the ’Alaiyat, but since it has been absorbed by the Shaddud family, descended from an ancestor, Shaddud, who was grand-father of the present shaikhs. The tribe is now always called the Shaddud. The tribe consists of a family of brothers, who all live in separate hamulahs, f.e., sections, each having his own fighting tower. Though up-to-date no killing ha« taken place between the brothers, the internal cohesion of the tribe is far from good. During the rebellion of 1920 the Shaddud were the leading figures in the Suq area, and were heavily bombed on two occasions. It is said that Sayid Hadi al Mingotan, of Shinafiyah, has great influence with them, and compelled them to rise. The Shaddud are mallakhs and fallahs, owners and cultivators of their date gardens.

A1 Hatim. A1 Jabr. A1 Salih. The Bani Rikab is an important group with no paramount chief. In Sa’dun and Turkish times six independent tribes and chiefs were always recognized. At various times one tribe or another made itseli the head of the group, this tribe generally being the ’Ayid. The last man to have any hold of the Bani Rikab was Haji Shallal of Albu ’Atallah. It is incorrect to say that Hammadi al Shati was over paramount over the confederation. He never attempt ed to assume this position, and without the support of Yusuf al Khairullah of Al Humaid would not have remained chief of the Albu Ghuwainim. None of the present chiefs are fit to be entrusted with paramount authority. The group is too large to handle as a unit, and the tribes which compose it are more easily dealt with separately. In spite of no paramount chief the internal cohesion of the group is good with the one exception that every man is against Al Hatim and in particular against ’Ubaid al Qatran and his followers. The latter, however, has the support of Khaiyun al ’Ubaid, Shaikh of Abudah. As regards their external relations none of the trills are on good terms with Al Badair or Al Mayyah, but all are on friendly terms with Al Humaid group. Like all the tribes of the Gharraf they have no desire for any form of constitutional rule, but are not actively hostile to Government. The tribes are well mounted, their horses excellent, and they are great breeders and fair horse masters.

As confederations, except &gt;in name, the Ajwad and Bani Malich are scarcely recognized and certainly never even considered or mentioned by the tribes; whilst on the contrary the Bani Sa’id are the reverse, and would appear to be rather a large tribe with its constituents as sections. The area occupied by the Bani Sa’id is vast, stretching from the Gharraf to the tails of the Tigris canals in the ’Amarah district where a large number of the tribesmen cultivate. The remaindeJ of their territory is dry and dependent on rain for cultivation with the result that the tribes resident in the Muntafiq area are for the most part semi-nomadic cultivating wherever possible. For this reason these tribes are considerably poorer than the majority of the Muntafiq and Amarah tribes. Their district is not easily accessible being awu,y from any suitable lines of approach by either land or water. Therefore accurate information regarding the smaller details of this group is cjifficult to procure. • Sa id were not represented at the battle of Shu’aibah m 191o, when nearly all other tribes fought against us.

The whole area stretches from ’Ozair (Ezra’s Tomb) inclusive PersknT , t0 th ® Pers * an Gulf finding to the east as far as the Persian frontier and to the west along a line running through Sabari- yah, JSahr Bakhtirah, Ghabishiyah, Hor Zubair, Hor ’Abdullah and thence to the sea.

Consequently they are more amenable to Government control.315 {\*&gt;6 J ABUL KHASlB QADHA. Constituents. Fao Nahiyah. Shatt al Arab Nahiyah (left bank Shatt al Arab).

The populated area along the river bank is well cultivated and thickly planted with date trees, often with vines, fruit trees, cereals and vegetables growing below them. The population con sists of a few big landowners and their fellahs and of a large number of smaller landowners. Tribal ties are weak and are becoming more fco. Although many of the fellahs claim tribal descent and own allegiance to the Shaikh of Muhammarah, yet this feeling is in reality weak in the district from Basrah to Abu Falus canal, but more pronounced from there southwards in the Fao Nahiyah. Of the landlords the majority are Sunni; the more important are Haji Mahmud Pasha, who owns several properties in the Nahiyah. Naqib’s family, Saiyid Hashim, who owns several properties in the Nahiyah. Ahmad Pasha Sana’, whose land is Luqtah in ’Amiyah. Shaikh of Muhammarah, who owns two-thirds of Kut al Zain Sanniyah. (Government lands). Chiefly in ’Amiyah and Qaus. There is a large influx of date packers, who arrive annually in September and October and return in December, totalling usually some 4,000. The packing area is chiefly confined to between Sartaji and Abul Khaslb, both inclusive. The following tribes are represented:—Dair, Sharish, Bani Mansur and Albu Muhammad. There are also many Persians, a considerable number coming from the Karun. During their stay they all live in roughly made reed huts.318 i Confederation, Tribe or Section.

Two-thirds of the population look on the Shaikh of Muhammarah as their over-lord, and many of them would go to his aid if required by him. Though his influence has gradually faded since the in troduction of an Arab Mudir, yet in 1921 the tribal elements showed a tendency to disregard the Mudir’s authority by appealing to the Shaikh of Muhammarah direct when tribal disputes occurred. The remaining one-third are so mixed as to have no claim on any tribe or Shaikh ; most of the fallah population are affiliated to the Muhaisin, but do not live together in any tribal fashion, being in fact all dispersed throughout the Nahiyah. The district is owned by large landlords, very few of whom reside on their property. The more important of these are : Sanniyah (Government lands). Duaib, Sihan, Muhaiah and Sibah. Shaikh of Kuwait, who owns the whole of Fao. Bait al Ibrahim. In Dorah. Sa’dun family, who own about three quarters of Ma’amir and all of Kut Bandar and Kut Khalifah.

The population of Harthah mostly comprises small tribal groups that have been detached from their original tribes. There are no important chiefs, though certain sections claim allegiance to Shaikh Khaz’al of Muhammarah, but they would not willingly follow him to war. Conversely the sections from Bani ’Asad and Madinah would return to aid their shaikhs, Salim and Hasich respectively if called upon to do so. The immigrants from Dair am sedentary, and have no chief beyond the Mudir. The marsh area is inhabited mainly by Ma’dan. There is an annual influx of some 500 people in September and October for the date packing period.

Of the remainder Husain al Fadl, Mudir of Sharish, has now most of the Bani Mansur under his control, who consider this pre ferable to the extortions of Shaikh Qubashi and his sons. The abolition of Dair as a nahiyah and its inclusion in Sharish is at the present being seriously considered.335 DAIR. The shaikhly house of Dair was in Turkish times the Qannas, who claimed decent from the Bani RabTah though their pretensions were counted doubtful. On the death of Shaikh Sa’ud al Qannas the shaikhship was sometimes held by his son, Hachim, and some times by another member of his family, Ahmed al Rashid. The Turks encouraged rivalry between them. For the four years before our occupation Ahmad held office uninterruptedly, and we recognized him as shaikh. There was, however, constant strife between the twa parties, and in February 1916 Ahmad’s son was killed-. In October 1916 both Ahmad and Hachim were removed and ’Ati al Sa’ad, Qubashi's brother, was appointed mudir,- who in his turn was removed early in 1920, and Salih al Hijaz, a Basrah landlord, installed. He was appointed Qaimmaqam of Suq al Shuyukh on the formation of the Arab Government, and succeeded by Ibrahim al ’Ammari^ ‘he present mudir. 23337 Abjced men. HlFIJiS. Hoise. Foot. Total. Modern.

There is no actual tribe known as Madinah, but the population in this Nahiyah are called by the tribal name of A1 Siyiimir (came from Samarrah about 400 years ago). As a Jvahiyah Madinah is under a shaikh, who is also a Mudir. The population, except for the Madalah are cultivators or occupied in the reed and mat trade. _ The Shaikhly house springs from the Halaf section of the Amarah (Bani Rabi’ah), and has been on the Euphrates for nine generations (see genealogical table). ’Abdul Hamid ibn Humud (aged 19^ 1922) succeeded to the shaikhship on his father s death in 1916, but was not a success and in 1919 was banished to darabah, 4 miles north of Madinah. Hasich ibn Mubarak, the present shaikh, was with the Turks until March 1917, when he came in to us. The chief branches of the family are :— (1) Bait ’Ali Beg, formerly the ruling house, but displaced by Bait Muhammad Beg. ' (2) Bait Muhammad Beg. (3) Bait Mir ’Uthman. (4) Bait Sarhan. The last two are distant cousins of the Bait Muhammad Beg, but were never ruling houses (see family tree). The Madinah tribes are of varying origin, although known collectively as the Siyamir. .

Personalities. ’ABD ALI, SAIYID.— Rais Baladiyah of Qumah. A thoroughly .honest and loyal servant of Government. No complaints have ever been made against him since our occupation.

Was formerly in Turkish employment. Useful. ’ABDUL RIDHA.— An ’Alim of Shatrah. Used as an agent by Mizhir Pasha in stirring up the tribes. In. January 1917, after the attack on the A. P. 0. Hammar by Dukhaiyil's men, he came down to the Ibrahim urging them to stir up trouble on their own account or to help Dukhaiyil. ’ABDUL WAHID, SALIH BEG IBN HAJI MAHMUD.— Was Rais al Baladiyah of Basrah, bad reputation, tyrannous- he wrung money out of the people. A friend of Saiyid Talib, but out of fear; his real leanings were towards the C. U. P., and his sympathies with the Turks on religious grounds. No politician. He was asked to keep the municipality moving after the occupa tion, and showed a vast incapacity. It was he who went to Muhammarah and as Rais al Baladiyah offered to hand over Basrah to us. ’ABDULLAH BEG AS SANA.— Relinquished the post of Mudir of the Abul Khasib Nahiyah when appointed Rais Baladiyah of Basrah. ’ABDULLAH AL MUTALAQQIM.— Of the ’Ajman, Sufran section. Came up with Dhaidan ibn Hithlain, q. v., from Hasa in the autumn of 1915. Followed his fortunes for a time, but when, or possibly even before, Ibn Rashid left for Hail, he joined the Aslam (Shammar), who were in opposi- ( 353 ) 24 ation to Ibn Rashid, and finally went down to Safwan, where the main body of the ’Ajman had established itself. ABDULLAH AL WUSHAH — Shaikh of the Shuwallsh (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah) who are on the Euphrates river bank above Suq and are kept loyal by their vulnerable situation. ’Abdullah has his people pretty well in hand, but he is a weakling. The Shuwallsh are always in trouble with the Ahl al Kut and other tribes of the Shamiyah” ’ADHAR, hAjl— He came out against us by order of the Wali of Basrah, was dangerously wounded at the battle of Kut al Zain, picked up by us and well treated, on the advice of the Shaikh of Muhammarah, who made representations in his favour. He considers that he owes his life to us. He is staunchly pro-British. His son is employed in the office of the Military Governor of ’Ashar. Haji ’Adhar is a Shaikh of the ’Amarah, originally part of the constituent of the B. Rabl’ah of that name. The late Shaikh of Madinah, Humud, was Haji ’Adhar’s cousin. He stayed in Damascus on his return from the Hajj and is on terms of warm friendship with Muhammad al Bassam. ' A man of 45, fine looking, pleasant open manner. Somewhat given to in trigue.

Young and energetic. Will hustle if interested. Should develop well. He is a Persian. AHMED AL RASHlD.— One of the rival headmen of Dair, south of Qumah.

He is head of the Qannas section of the ’Amarah, these last being an offshoot of the tribe of the same name, a constituent of the B. Rabl’ah. Ahmad al Rashid was set up as Shaikh by the Turks on the deposition of Hachim al Sa’ad, the head of another rival clan in Dair. The two individuals were bitter rivals, and their enmity to one another wa,:j a constant source of trouble. His son was killed in 1916 (see Dair, Appendix A). Finally, a Mudir was appointed to Dair, and the two Shaikhs were exiled to Basrah until they had made up their quarrel, when they were allowed to return to their lands at Dair.355 ALI, SAIYID.— Of Suq. Alhu KhaHf^.h (Muntafiq, Barti Malik, Bani Khai- qan). A prominent Saiyid and personally a charming and influen tial man, pleasant and cheerful. A well-known astrologer, student of horoscopes, he predicted the downfall of the Turks in 1917. His mystic talk makes a considerable impression. Pro-British, a protege of Haji Hasan Hamdani. He has influence with Badr Rumaiyidh and the tribes north of the Hammar. Poor and humble. Has done excellent work for us at Shatrah and on the Bad’ah Canal. ALI AL DABBtfS, SHAIKH.— Was formerly the leading personality in Suq-ash-Shuyukh, but has been supplanted by Haji Hasan Hamdani, q. v. He 'bears him little malice, being fully occupied with his own business as a mer chant. He is the richest merchant and garden owner in the Suq district. He is very pro-English and progressive. He has applied for a branch of the Bank of Persia for Suq and for the establish ment of a Land Bank. Highly respected; not an intriguer. Shiah.

A great friend of Khaiyun al ’Ubaid, Shaikh of the ’Abudah and inclined to follow his lead. Cunning and exceedingly cruel. Fought against us at Butniyah. A great admirer of ’Abdullah ibn Falih Pasha. Has in the past taken part in all the Muntafiq wars against the Turks, and only came in to us definitely when Baghdad was taken. His tribe was very much out of hand till quite recently, and made the Shatrah road a by-word for dangerous travelling. ’Ah al Fadhl has now turned over a new leaf, and in December, 1917, was granted an allowance of Rs. 200 per mensem, thus bringing him into line with all the Nasiriyah Shaikhs. Has two sons, Saqban and Sulaiman. They are pro-British, energetic and strong charactered. ’ARAIBI AL WANIS.— Together with Muhanna al Barghash is head of the Nujaim section of the ’Abudah. They are always quarrelling. The Nujaim is the most troublesome of the ’Abudah sections. ’ASAIMI, MUHAMMAD AL BARRAK.— One of the worst rogues in Basrah, ’Ajaimi’s agent, an enemy of Saiyid Talib. Cunning and treacherous ; he is said to have been the only man Saiyid Talib feared. He was formerly engaged in intrigue with ’Ajaimi against the Turks, and probably they had an arrangement with the Germans for the landing of arms at Babyan for ’Ajaimi. He joined the Turks at Nasiriyah in January, 1915.356 In the middle of 1915 he went to Najaf with Saiyid Hadi to con ciliate the people after the troubles there and was for a time acting Qaimmaqara of Hillah. With Muhammad Pasha Daghistani he was engaged in distributing Turkish bribes amongst the tribes. In May, 1916, he visited Ibn Rashid, near Zubair, to use his influence with him, but the mission was reported to have been unsuccessful. He began his career as a very poor man, entered the service of Makki Abu ’Abadah, a sheep merchant of Basrah, but left him and went to Muhammad al Shu’aibi—both he and A1 Shu’aibi came originally from ’Anaizah in the Qasim. He bought sheep for Al Shu’aibi in Zubair, made a little money and set up as a sheepskin dealer under Qasim al Khudairi, by whom he was also employed to bring in corn from the Muntafiq district. When he had saved a little capital he set up for himself. One of his brothers, Yusuf, he placed at ’Amarah, the other ’Abdul Rahman in Muntafiq—both like rogues with himself. In his dealings with the Muntafiq country he made the acquaintance of Sa’dun Pasha. He was at the root of the quar rel between Sa’dun and Mizyad Pa'Sha, egging on Sa’dun to seize Mizyad’s estates. He made bad blood between ’Ajaimi and ’Abdullah Falih. ’Ajaimi looted and captured Mizyad when the latter was camping in the desert, but Mizyad escaped and brought in a complaint to Basrah. It was ’Asaimi who brougfit ’Ajaimi into the C. U. P. In 1918 ’Ajaimi sent him to Hijaz and Egypt, to plead his cause. ATI AL HARBlYAH, SHAIKH.— Shaikh of the Fuhaili (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan) pro-British, was largely influenced by Captain Cowley, of Lynch Brothers, who often stayed with him. Was backward in coming in when we advanced on ’Akaikah, but has given no trouble since we established ourselves in the Euphrates. Lame in the left leg from a bullet wound ; pleasant manners. ’ATIYAH, SHAIKH.— Managed Qal’at Sikar before the appointment of an A. P. 0. A strong man. He kept the town clean and peaceful and levied taxes as he chose ; therefore unpopular. He has a quarrel about land with the Maslab, a section of the Toqiyah (Muntafiq, Ajwad, al Humaid). His son was appointed Mudir of Suwaij Shijar on probation, but turned out to be useless. ’AUDAH, SAIYID.— Lives near Suq. One of the most important men in the place. Famous for his sanctity and as a settler of disputes. All sacred oaths in Suq are taken before him and often on his person. Wa- hayyat Saiyid ’Audah.” If the taker of the oath is forsworn he will die within the year. A good man, not bigoted, he belongs to357 no tribe, is well-to-do, a charming country gentleman. About 45. lias great influence among the Mujarrah and to a lesser extent among the Bani Khaiqan. Always refuses money presents in return for his services to us in settling disputes. BADR AL RUMAIYIDH. Paramount Shaikh of the Albu Salih and nominal head of Bani Malik Confederation, submitted to British Government in Septem ber 1919. He is an old man of over 65 years in 1920 but still retains control of his own tribe, the Rumaiyidh. Hassan, the eldest of his 20 sons (he has countless daughters) was formerly recognised as head of the tribe after Badr’s submission, but Arab custom does not allow a son to ignore his father and for all practical pur poses Badr still rules as he has done for the past 40 years. His sons, when able to carry on, are allotted a portion of the tribal land and they set up their own house, thus they act as body guards to their father and lieutenants to his fighting force. His “ mudhif ” is famed for its lavish hospitality. No soul in his terri tory ever lacks a meal. For the last 40 years his tribesmen have known no other rule but his and are completely loyal and faithful to him. He has visited Hai and Nasiriyah only 2 or 3 times in his life. qHAID AL TAHIR.— Rival to Salih al Daghir for paramount shaikship of A1 Ibrahim. Obtained his property chiefly by robbing—his brother’s son. DHABBAH, HAJL— Head of the Ghinanimah Section of the ’Asachrah (Muntafiq, Bani Malik). No influence beyond hi» humulah. Consistently anti-British, took part against us in the action of September, 1916. Thorough scoundrel. DHAlDAN IBN HITHLAIN.— Shaikh of the ’Ajman ; he has afi independent character, speaks his mind and comes straight to the point. He led the opposition to Ibn Sa’ud in 1915 and after the defeat of the ’Ajman fled north wards with Khumaiyidh ibn Munaikhir, and others, and in Novem ber asked Salim ibn Mubarak to grant them peace. Salim referred them to his father and Dhaidan came to Kuwait and made sub mission. At Ibn Sa'ud’s request the ’Ajman were expelled from Kuwait territory in February, 1916. About 1,200 of the 2,000 fighting men went to ’Ajaimi, and, with the exception of Khumai yidh, subsequently joined Ibn Rashid. Dhaidan wrote to the “ Commander of the Turkish Army ” saying that they were at his disposal. In May Sultan ibn Hithlain, obtained permission from the Shaikh of Zubair to settle at Safwan and took most of the ’Ajman(&amp;) 359 Dhari was made responsible for the security of a part of the railway between Zubair and Khamisiyah and controlled the access of cara vans to the latter town. He is a man of independent spirit, with a frank open manner but in reality is insincere. DUKHAIYIL AL BUSHlRAH.— Shaikh of the ’Abdul Rahman section of the Rahamah (Mun- tafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan), which is under the influence of Farhud al Mughashghash. He showed at first strong anti- British tendencies, and refused to surrender even after the capture of Nasiriyah his main reason being personal antagonism to Farhud. His fear of the latter ultimately brought him in. Would seize the first opportunity of opposing Farhud. In January, 1916, was res ponsible for an attack on the A. P. 0., Hammar, and was harbour ing outlaws. His towers were destroyed. Adopted attitude of passive hostility during 1920 insurrection. DftKHI AL MAS’AD.— Paramount Shaikh of the ’Asakrah (’Asachrah), one of the leading tribes of the Bani Khaiqan group (Muntafiq, Bani Malik). He gave us considerable trouble, in consequence of which his fort was shelled and destroyed in March, 1916. Consistently anti- British. Took part against us in the action of September, 1916. Has little authority beyond his own humulah. Friendly during the 1920 insurrection. FAISAL AL SHADDIJD.— Senior Shaikh of one of the three groups of tribes which com prise the Mujarrah confederation of the Suq ash Shuyukh district, the Shaddud, Mutairat, Himahamah, Harbiyah, Shuwallsh, and Nuwashi. Head of the Shaddud, Haji Khalaf section, cousin of, Haji Hasan al ’Alwan of the Haji ’Alwan section. The Shaddud tribe has given no trouble except in the matter of collecting revenue, a difficulty common to all the Suq tribes. Haji Faisal is a pleasant- mannered man of 45 or so and has been of help to the A. P. 0., of Suq in the decision of tribal cases. Friendly during 1920 Insur rection. FAISAL AL YASIR.— Shaikh of the Mushairijah section of the al Hasan (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). He was Mudlr of Suq Shabanahs. A strong personality, cordially hated by the Al Hasan, chiefly because he is a rising man. Uxorious, and has in consequence a fine bevy of sons.

The Fandi family claim descent from the Ghazzi and through them T«r? a ’ h ™ 0 f- Fad S U , tribe ,: now s P lifc U P between the Shammar Jarba, Dhafir and Anizah. Farhud is a clean-bred man of about 30, well mannered and of very pleasing address. The best of the Hachcham Shaikhs after Qaaid al Nahi. A personal friend of ’Ajaimi, as are all the Hach cham Shaikhs. FARHGD AL MUGHASHGHASH.— Paramount Shaikh of the Bani Khaiqan, a tribal group within the Bam Malik section of the Muntafiq. In March, 1915, he was arrested at Suq ash Shuyukh by the Turks and imprisoned on the charge of giving us information. Intimate friend of the Hamdani family. On our advance up the Euphrates he and his lands were at our mercy as soon as we reached ’Akaikah, and he was shrewd enough to see that his interests lay with us. He threw in his lot with us entirely and was of great service to us during the Qarmat Safhah operations and advance on Nasiriyah. In consequence of his services he received compensation for damage to his lands by the removal of the 'Akaikah dam. He is now Mudlr of the Baiii Khaiqan. A man of strong character and much personal authority, bme appearance. He has done remarkably well as Mudir. He has taken a house at Suq so as to have his two sons at the Govern ment school.

At one time instituted a reign of terror against Majid al Khaiyun, but fled before us to Nasii»yah. He came in after our advance to Baghdad. HAMAD IBN KHAMIS. Shaikh of Khamislyah, which was founded by his father ’Abdullah ibn Khamis, as a market town for Bedouin caravans, Suq ash Shuy.'ikh being unapproachable in spring owing to floods. Khamisiyah occupies much the same position with regard to Suq that Zubair occupies relatively to Basrah. Shaikh Hamad is our strong ally, a Sunni and a Najdi; his father came from Buraidan. No caravans are supplied from Khamisiyah without our permis sion. Hamad is small in stature and of unprepossessing appearance. Suffers from something like asthma and has a stiff neck. He is all on the side of peace and quiet government. In former days he is said to have been much bullied by ’Ajaimi and to have been pool. This may account for his miserable house and for the dirtiness and unkemptness of his town. Ho has no power in men and arms but considerable influence as a landowner and as a man of reflection. He is keenly alive to his own profit in money matters. His circum* stances have improved greatly through us. Ho is accused by many of making an excellent thing out of the blockade, but his brother and eldest son are probably more truly open to the charge than he. He did very good work in connection with the transport of supplies by ballam from Basrah to Khamisiyah and no doubt gained over it. His opinion as regards the creek tribes between Suq and Khami siyah is of great value. He is very impartial in his judgment of Shaikhs and does not air his private feuds and jealousies, in spite of continual suspicion to the contrary. He has been to Mecca, but this does not seem to have affected his morals, a.g-, with regard to slave dealing in former times and other more dreadful vices. His present ambition is to become in Khamisiyah what Ibn Sabbah is in Kuwait and Ibn ’Abdullah in Zubair. He purchased in Basrah an outfit for the table and gave dinner parties in the middle of the day to British officers. . He is very agreeable companion on trips in the desert or in bal- lams over the flood water. A man of shrewd and sound judgment; reads and writes his own tongue and despises, as a Najdi, the dogs of the riverside.” Khamis. Saih. ’Abdullah. Hamad.362 HAMDANI, ’ABDUL KARlM. A younger brother of Haji Hasan, aged about 25, is now Arab Assistant to the A. P. 0. at Shatrah where he helped ’Ali al Mansuz al oa dun to run the Arab scouts. Like all the Hamdani family his tribal connection differentiates him from other townsmen. He is very well reported on, and knows the Ajwad tribes well. HAMDANI, liAJI HASAN.— Rais Baladiyah at Suq ash Shuyukh, landowner and big mer chant, partner of Agha Ja’far of Basrah. The family have a pecu- VL ar .. tr „ al P osltl on in Suq owing to alliances with tribal Shaikhs. Haji Hasan, because of his tribal connection is a much more im portant person than any other of the Suq merchants. He is not loved by the majority of the Shaikhs near Suq, though this is per- ,c! 8 ,j 0t ^ scre&lt; iit. The chief complainers are Thamir Beg al Sa dun, Husain al Qubaiyah and Qasid of the Hachcham, the first being the brother, the second, and possibly the third also, friends of Ajaimi. He is at enmity with Ajaimi, and indeed none of the §ons of Sa dun have any love for him, though Thamir always stays m his house when he comes to Suq—so did the Ottoman officials in Turkish times. Abdullah Falih is on good terms with him. He was one of the Mujahidin at Shu’aibah, but it w'as mainly owing to his influence that Suq showed itself pro-British ; he is fully aware that he can hope for no mercy from the Turks. The family have business relations all up the Gharraf. He was exceedingly useful in proem mg provisions for the troops at Nasiriyah. A man of about 50, impressive, outspoken, capable, accustomed to exercise authority, a valuable ally if checked in a natural ten dency to become a dictator. He desires settled government that he may collect and enjoy his rents. He is a merchant politician. In September 1920, on the withdrawal of A. P. O., Suq ash Shu yukh, he was appointed government representative. The Meso- potamian branch of the family is now much split up ; a group of the Albu Hamdan are on the Zab ; there are some in Baghdad where they own property in Kadhimain ; Shaikh Hammadi ibn ’Ali Pasha near Musayib is another member of the tribe, and there is a small furqah_ under Shaikh Hassun ibn ’Ali Salih between Fallujah and Mahmudiyah. 4 Hammadi. Hasan. I saiih . 1 Kadhim. ’Abdul. Karim. HAMDANI, KADHIM.— A younger brother of Haji Hasan. Assistant to A. P. 0 ., Suq ash Shuyukh. Cheerful, dogged, unflagging and faithful.363 HAMDANI, SALIH.— A younger brother of Haji Hasan, lives at Suq and acts as general utility man to. Haji Hasan and Kadhim. HAMID AL SOZ.— Mudir of Karradi. Of Persian extraction. His parents lived in Baghdad where there is still a branch of the family. Haji HAraad, Hamid’s father, was a protege of Thamir al Dahad al ■Sa’dun. He fell into disfavour with the Turks and moved to Suq where he became an important merchant. Hamid and his brother traded in grain on the Gharraf mostly with money supplied by a rich merchant and landowner of Suq, Haji ’Abbas al Karradi. On the instructions of the latter, Hamid purchased an estate on the Gharraf, known as Al ’Abid (now Al Bad’ah). He settled in this muqata’ah, built a house there and stored the grain of ’Abbas al Karradi round it. This became a convenient centre for traders and tribesmen, and so Karradi grew until to-day it boasts of a Baladiyah. Hamid is a Shiah and one of the leading personalities of the Gharraf. He has great influence with the surrounding Shuwailat tribesmen, but his official jurisdiction is confined to the town of Karradi. Famed for his hospitality; too easy-going and genial a nimre to be of much strength as a Mudir. Consistently pro- British and from 1915-17, supplied us with valuable information. HASAN AL HUMAIDI.— Shaikh of the Albu Suf section of the Husainat, Muntafiq, Ajwad • afforded our troops valuable assistance during their advance on Nasirfyah in 1915. A strong well-wisher of ours. Was recoro- mended for a salary in 1918 for services rendered to the British administration. HASAN THAMIR.— Of the Thamiriyah tribe (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah), lives on the Mujahshiyah canal about two miles from the Euphrates (Left Bank), 41 miles above Suq. After our occupation of Nasi- rlvah he remained in close correspondence with the Turks, and harboured Turkish officers. The A. P. 0. of Suq caught him to wards the end of 1915 and sent him down to Basrah, where he was imprisoned. He managed to escape and returned to his tribe, where he was a source of difficulty to us. He was a most valuable snv for the Turks on the Euphrates. Surrendered in February, 1918 and was ordered to reside in his tribe quietly ; his tribe is now managed by another Shaikh, appointed in 1916, Khnlaif al Bandar.' 364 HASHIM AL HASS0N. Shaikh of the Nuwashi al Hadhr, f.e., those on the left bank of the Euphrates near Suq. The Shaikh on the right bank is Husain ibn 'Ali. Hashim is amiable, weak, no authority with his tribe he is always asking us for help. In August, 1916, ho fled to Suqi took protection with us and had to be reinstated by force. HASICH IBN MUBARAK.— Shaikh of Madinah and cousin of Humud the former Shaikh When we took Qumah he fled to ’Amarah. We took sureties for him. He stayed for some time with the Azairij on the Tigris then joined Badr Rumaiyidh and Ghadhban ibn Hasan al Khaiyun against us. He did not surrender to us till March, 1917, and was then allowed to live at Madinah. An arrangement was made between him and Hamid, Humud’s son and successor, by the Shaikh of Muhammarah, but Hamid was very jealous of Hasich. In January 1919 Hamid was turned out of the Shaikbship by us and Hasich installed in his place. Hasich has proved reliable and has far greater influence than Hamid. He has a fairly firm hold over his unruly “ tribe.” HATIM AL MOZAN.— Shaikh of the Juwaibir (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan) together with ’Ajil alMuhsin, has also much influence with the tribe! Hatim is a simple straightforward countryman, very honest, always anxious to help ; influence considerable. One of the staunchest supporters of Government. HUMUD IBN SUWAIT.— Shaikh of the Dhafir. A man of about 45, good Badu tvne. intelligent, and reckoned among the tribes a fairly good politician. A quiet man and humble and unimpressive appearance, always obedient and popular with the British officials. He was personally on terms of friendship with Ibn Rashid and at enmity with ’Ajainu ibn Sa'dun. With Sharshab ibn Shaham of the BudGi and Man- shad ibn Hubaiyib of the Ghazzi he formed a combine against ’Ajaimi in our interest in the early part of 1915. But his authority over his own tribe is not complete. Ajaimi with a small following of ‘Ajman and Shammar (Ibn ‘Ajil and some 20 horses), raided the combined encampment of Humud and Sharshab near Shasrag in March, 1916. The two Shaikhs sent envoys to Basrah asking for our assistance and vare given a couple of hundred rifles, together with some ammunition and provisions and money. They promised in return to protect our supply depot at Khamisiyah and to keep ’Ajaimi out of the occupied territory. With this assistance they were able to repulse him.In April 191G, Humud was given authority to grant or refuse passage to all caravans coming in to Khamisij’ah from the desert. There is a great deal of jealousy between him and Ibrahim al ’Abdullah, Shaikh of Zubair. Towards the end of April, 1916, Humud raided a body of Dhaflr who had attached themselves to Zubair and were numbered by Shaikh Ibrahim among his own people. Visited Ibn Rashid in June, 1916, when the latter was at Chabdah,^ but returned to his camp near Khamisiyah and joined Ibn Tawalah in an attack on the Amir. Humud is grasping and avaricious, unpopular with his own tribe. He receives Rs.'l,000 per mensem, in return for protecting the Railway from attack. ’ HUSAIN FADHL.— Shaikh of Sharish. The best Shaikh in the Qumah district. Not of a very strong character but his area is the least lawless and the best cultivated. He has been consistently pro-British since the occupation and can be thoroughly relied upon. HUSAIN AL QUBAIH.—* Shaikh of the Juwarln. A massive piece of flesh about 14 stone in weight. Fine-looking ruffian, very independent in speech. Reputed half mad ; a man of simple, outspoken guile and bluff. He is a notorious friend of ’Ajaimi. Does not read or write his own tongue and has no one with him who can. Rough in speech and difficult to understand. He regards all the land from Mujarib to Khamisiyah as his district. He is constantly quarrelling over land questions with Thamir Beg, ’Ajaimi’s brother, and has standing disputes with the Shuwalish and with Chuw’aiyid of the Ahl al Kut! IBRAHIM, SAIYID.— . 4.. note ? MuHa of Shatrah. Toured perpetually among the Azainj and Rhafajah preaching the Jihad. IBRAHIM, SAIYID.— (An Arab) was made D. A. P. 0. of Bani Sa’id, which comprises one-third of the Muntafiq. Not popular among Shaikhs as thev do think they will get justice. Pulled up twice for abusing his officia 1 position. Reported on as being “ the best Arab official in the Muntanq. But the tribes much prefer their affairs managed 1&lt;)20 BTlt,Sh Transferred as E- A. P. 0., Daltawah, April, IBRAHIM IBN ’ABDULLAH AL RASHID.— Shaikh of Zubair. Aged 51 in 1920. The Al Rashid are of Amzah stock and came originallv from Hurainjlah in the ’Aridb but they have been settled in Zubair for 200 rears. Ibrahim wa- a connection of Kbnlid al ’Ami of Al Hirfi. Shaikh of Zubar was366 was murdered in 1907 by Ibrahim’s brother Ahmad and his negroes. Muhammad Beg al Mushri was appointed Shaikh by the Turks, but with a very limited authority. Zubair continued,' for all prac tical purposes independent. A Mudir represented the interest of the Ottoman Government, but the town was exempt from conscrip- tion. Muhammad al Mushri was in intimate relations with ’Ajaimi al Sa’dun and was turned out by us just before the battle of Shu’- aibah. Ibrahim was installed in his place as a relation of the old ruling family. (The Hirfi and the Rashid had long been at enmity, and a famous battle was fought between them some 40 years ago.) In recognition of his loyal services Ibrahim has been given the farming rights over the valuable estate formerly belonging to Ghallb al ’Umar on the left bank of the Shatt al Arab and is pro- British. He is intelligent and pleasant-mannered. Is an exceed ingly businesslike and shrewd person to deal with and has filled his part as Shaikh of Zubair in difficult situations with astuteness. Small in stature, he is not a commanding personality but enjoys respect, if not popularity. There is a good deal of jealousy between him and Ibn Suwait. He has his town -in excellent control. As a Najdi he has a hearty contempt for the Muntafiq and as a towns man professes to despise the wildness of the Bedouin. His opinion on Arabs in general is of great value. He executes admirablv any commission entrusted to him, so long as he is given clear and precise instructions, and where price is no object. Reads and writes his own tongue. He would much like to preserve his independent position as the Shaikh of the desert oasis, and does his best to do so. He is strongly against any modem improvements in Zubair such as sanitation or the provision of a drinkable water supply. His town is therefore in a filthy and uncivilised condition. IBRAHIM AL ’AMARI, HAJL— An honorary magistrate of Suq, a Sunni Najdi, has been con sistently pro-British since the occupation, when his influence was of great service in keeping the town quiet. Has a name for honesty. A friend of Shaikh Ibrahim of Zubair, Dhari ibn Tawalah and the Bedu generally. On bad terms with Shaikh Hamad of Khami- slyah. He is the leading Sunni in Suq. ’INAYAH, SAIYID MIRZA.— Suq district. A Persian from Najaf to whom the Turks granted a large estate.

He is rich and keeps open house ; every Friday night he has some 500 men in his mosque where ho leads the prayers. He feeds and clothes them and thereby extends his influence. A man of about 50. His elder brother Muhammad25 Taqi lives in Basrah, but we could do nothing with him. He belongs to the Akhbariyah sect of Shi’ahs who do not send their dead to Xajaf for burial, as opposed to the ’Usuliyah who follow the con trary practice. He came to see the A. P. 0., in April, 1918, and announced that he had always been a servant of the British Govern ment. ISMA IL KHASHAN, HAJL— Shaikh of the Ismail (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan)* A pleasant old man, looks very mild but is a strong character and considered one of the best men in the Hammar Lake.

JABIR ibn saiyid ’Ali battAt saiyid.— The most popular Saiyid in the marshes north-west of Qarmat 'Ali, lives at Ghalidah near Abu Khanzir, which was given to him by Ahmad Pasha al Zahar. His father came from Madinah (Qumah) and settled down in the marshes with the Ma’dan. He made a great reputation as a Saiyid, and turned it to profit by claiming a few sheep from every flock and a buffalo from every herd in his capacity as holy man. His son Jabir succeeded him, and his reputation and influence are very great. The Mad’an take their oaths on his head, turning in the direction of Ghalidah, and the man who is false to this oath is believed to die within three days. Saiyid Jabir is said to own 1,000 buffaloes and 10,000 sheep. He hates the Turks and is friendly to us, and helps the Mudir to keep his part of the marshes in order, arresting deserters and male factors. He has three mudhifs (reception houses) one at Madinah, where his family lives, one at Nahar ’Antar and one at Ghalidah, where he usually resides himself. JA’FAR IBN SAIYID BAQIR, SAIYID.— A powerful Shi’ah of Suq town ; he stepped into the shoes of his father, Shaikh Baqir of Najaf. The latter was one of the best known men south of Najaf ; he died in 1915 almost immediately after the battle of Shuaibah. The gossip in Suq is that the Turks forced him to accompany them there. Saiyid Ja’far is a mere figurehead with little ability, except that he is clever in Shar’ah Law. He settles personal, not tribal disputes. A shy man of about 30, but a very charming personality. H(- has two brothers, one of 25, the other of 18.368 JASIM AL JA FAR.— Shaikh of the Hasawiyah, settlers from the Hasa, now a consti tuent of the Muntafiq (Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan).

He usually lives either at Sudaifah, east of Shatrah, or at Hawi, on the edge of the town. Aged about 33 in 1920. He has bad manners, is cruel ami has a large store of low cunning. He is brutal, faithless, conceited rude and rich, fearless and a bom fighter. Owing to his faithless ness and stupid brutality most of the neighbouring tribes, more especially the Khafajah, were at feud with the ’Abudah. He was a constant thorn in the side of the Turks. In July, 1914, the Otto man Government sent ? small force against him, which he defeated. At the outbreak of war he was heavily bribed by the Turks, and he joined ’Abdullah Falih al Sa'dun against us in January, 1915, With 500 to 000 men. Though he abandoned the Turks in March, his men are said to have taken part in the battle of Shu’aibah. He was made Ottoman Qaimmaqam of Shatrah in June, 1915. Khai- yun came to us in December, 1917, and paid us Rs. 10,000 as a fine. He went up to Baghdad, where he paid his respects to the Civil Commissioner, Sir P. Cox. He was allowed to manage Shatrah affairs on a Haifay of Rs. 500, pending the appointment of a Political Officer. When this took place in April, 1918, he declared himself freed of furi-Mm lesponsioility and retired to his tribe. He is the strongest nmn on the Gharraf. He owns 100 camels and 1,500 acres of aroou nee land. He manages his tribe well and rules with a rod of imn. Since Febmarv miq to date (May 1920), he has done everything to please. On the withdrawal of A. P. O., Shatrah, in August 1920, he was left in charge and maintained a consistently pro-British attitude throughout the 1920 insurrection. KHULAIF AL BANDAR.— .

In November, 1916, they approached Shaikh Salim. Mubarak s second son, with peace proposals. He replied that they must apply to Shaikh Mubarak, whereupon Dhaidan came to Kuwait and made submission. Ibn Sa’ud however, insisted on their ejection from Kuwait territoiy and this took place in February, 1916. Khumaiyis with about 50 followers, joined ’Ajairni and remained with hirm In^August, 1916, he went down to Safwtm and with some of the Ajman raided some Mutair in Ibn Sabbah's territory and took booty. He returned to ’Ajaimi. He is a battered old warrior of 50 years of age (1920) lame through wounds. Said to be the best fighting leader in the whole desert. • KUBASHI AS SA’AD.— Shaikh of Qumah and paramount Shaikh of the Nahairat, who are the ruling section of the Bani Mansur (Ahl Jazair). Friendlv from the time of the occupation. His father, Shaikh Sa’ad, who is said to have been beaten to death by the Turks, exercised, accord- mg to Kubashi, a wide jurisdiction over the tribes, his authority stretching up to ’Azair (Ezra’s tomb). A man of about 68 in 1920, medium height and still a strong man, loquacious. On the whole has done very well by us. He is the most important Shaikh in the district. His nickname amongst the Arabs is “ The Father of Two- Faces ”, and although since the occupation he has somewhat modi- fied his right to this title yet his undoubted loyalty to the British springs principally from a firm conviction as to which side his bread has buttered. All his 9 sons are worthless. KUTI AL NASIR.— Shaikh of the A1 Hasan section of the ’Abudah. Age 25 in 1920. Meak character. Deep in debt. Used to be friendly with Khai- yiin but they have now fallen out.

Humaid Confederation (Ajwad -luntafiq) , succeeded to the position in February 1918 on assassination of his father. Yusuf al KhairuUah was the outetand ing figure on the Gharraf in recent years.

A land grabber and an intriguer against Sulai- man al Sharif, paramount chief of the Bani Zaid. father was Secretary to Nasir Pasha al Sa’dun and Muhammad himself was Secretary to ’Ajaimi for 3 years and did not get on with him, for which reason he has a grudge against the Sa’dun. He went to Revd. Mr. van Ess for education and embraced Christianity, at any rate for a time. At Nasiriyah he is known as a Mohammadan. He is unpopular with the tribesmen ; no manners ; jealous of the Chuwaiyid, rules a third of the tribe, but submits to Chuwaiyid’s authority in important matters. Friendly from the first, keeps his tribe in capital order ; with Chuwaiyid did very excellent work on tli# Suq-Nasiriyah road. MUHAMMAD IBN HAJI KADHIM.— Secretary to Thamir Beg ibn Sa’dun, Siiq-ash-Shuyukh district.

NAJI AL ’AUDAH.— Shaikh of Mutairat (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). A prosperous, well-to-do chief. Owns much land in his own right, having taken out Tapu sanads, hence keeps quiet as he is vulner able ; cunning, professes to be very pro-British and has never given any trouble. Pays his revenue regularly. He has a good deal of property in the Shamiyah, west of Suq, where he grows rice and wheat. In November, 1916, was given £100 loan to help him to buy wheat for sowing, this being the first experiment of this kind in Suq. In Turkish times he used to persecute the large Sabean com- munitj 7 which lives in his lands, but has desisted since our occupa tion. He is of Bani Khaiqan stock, but is now allidd to the Mujar rah confederation. Supplied us with many labourers during the autump of 1916 for the deepening ol the ’Itaibiyah canal. NAQlB ZADAH OF BASRAH, SAIYID HASHIM.— Nephew of the Naqlb, the richest of that house and probably the best of them. He disliked Taiib who systematically squeezed him. He is a good Muhammadan and has a reputation for genero sity. Speaks some English, was member of the Majlis Idaharah. Not a prominent man.

Pro-English from of old, and strongly anti-Turk. He was not on very good terms with his son Saiyid Taiib, and dis liked the latter’s extravagant expenditure, but feared him.

Sister =Saivid Talib (from Mandftll, succeeded his brother-in-law Abdul Rahman). Saiyid Muhammad Sa’id. (Resigned, 1890, died 1896.) Hashim. Xalib. Yusuf. Hamad. NAQlB ZADAH OF BASRAH, SAIVIH TALIB.— Saiyid Talib is the eldest son of the present Naqib of Basrah, Saivid Rajab. The family are descendants of the great Muham madan saint, Saiyid Ahmad al Rafai, whose tomb stands east of Hai town, and control extensive Waqf property. In 1899 Saiyid Talib was sent by his father on a mission to Constantinople to complain of the policy of the Wali, Hamdi Pasha, who was disliked both by the Naqib and by Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait. Saiyid Talib succeeded in effecting his removal and returned to Basrah, in a cloud of glory. He secured the friendship of Shaikh Khaz al of Muhammarah by the timely murder in 1890 of Abdudah Rawanduzi, an individual distasteful to the Shaikh, and from that time forward received a large yearly subsidy both from Kuwait and from Muhamm-nrah. He surrounded himself with a body guard of cut-throats and scoundrels and with their aid dominated Basrah levying blackmail on the rich and plundering all who refused to serve him. In 1905 Fakhri Pasha, a Wali of unusual determination had him removed to Constantinople where he imbibed new political ideas. When the C. U. P. came to power he came back to Basrah and posed as the leader of the new party, but his fellow townsmen found means of getting rid of him by returning him as a Deputy to Constantinople. Finding that he could make no profit out of the C. U. P., he joined the more moderate reformers, and with them evolved the idea of the Hurr al Mu'tadil or moderate Liberal movement, which was the parent of the young Arab part\. He came back to Basrah, but this time in opposition to the C. U. P., and found his chief opponent in Sa’dun Pasha, paramount chief ■of the Muntafiq confederation. Him he decoyed into the hands of the Turks in 1911, and thereby earned the lasting enmity of Sa’dun s son ’ \jaimi. In 1912, on the advice of Kiamil Pasha, the figure, head of the Liberal party, at that time Grand Vizier, he resolved to Saiyid Rajab, (appointed Naqib in 1890). Saiyid Ahma (died 1904). Salyii374 ® ee !\i« e s “PP ort of the English, and to that end he went to Eevnt m 1912, w-here he saw the Khedive and Lord Kitchener, and on'his return visaed Lord Hardinge at Simla. It was probably at this time that he conceived the idea of making himself the semi-inde pendent ruler of Basrah Wilayat and establishing a Confederation ol Arab Shaikhs and Amirs, each one autocratic within his own boundaries, and all banded together to carry out pan-Arah ideas though they might remain under the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan At the end of 1913 this policy had fired the imagination ot the Young Arabs of Syria who looked on Saiyid Talib as the exponent of Arab nationalism. With the definite aim of becoming paramount in Basrah Wilayat, Saiyid Talib cultivated the friend °a ,M Iuh , ar ? maC - Shaikhs and established relations wuh Abdullah hahh al Sa dun, Ajaimi s cousin and rival. In April, 1913, he opened active proceedings against the Ottoman government by a clamorous protest against the new Wilayat Law but he was countered by the appearance of ’Ajaimi with an armed force outside Basrah to support the Wali and the C. U. P. He met this threat with his usual vigour and by his customary methods In June his adherents assassinated the Turkish Commandant in-the k® art of the t0 ^ n - The Turkish authorities were effectually cowed the Wall was dismissed and in August a programme of reforms was T-rn 1 ' T? Ut f he f e n epS - dld not satisf y the ambitions of Saiyid . , x V 16 , b Committee, which was wholly in his hands circulated an address among the soldiers and the' tribes calling on all Arabs to throw off Turkish tyranny and declare the independence T-ikK t^u Ve wr B v y ’ ' vho W f s then in P ower - ordered the arrest of lahb, but the Wah reported that he was powerless to carry out these instructions, and in December Talib sent a second threatenina address to Constantinople. Enver submitted to the force of cir 0 cumstances The Wahs of Basrah and Baghdad were bidden U consult Talib in all matters, and a high order was conferred on him Thereat he issued a manifesto saying that he would henceforth support Ottoman authority. In the spring of 1914 he was used bv the Turkish authorities to carry on negotiations with Ibn Sa’ud touching the latter s position in the Hasa, a province from which Ibn Sa ud had expelled the Turks in the previous year, and in if at + mf u° nned the BrHish Ambassador in Constantinople that I ahb was to be^appointed Wali of Basrah. Secret instructions tor his arrest had, however, been issued to the Wali of Baghdad who, to this end set out in October, 1914, with a considerable force J f St aft f r ^be outbreak of war with Great Britain. San id 1 ahb had got wind of his intentions and retired to Kuwait, ostens^ly with the purpose of completing the negotiations with Ibn baud. Just before the war he was negotiating through the inter mediation of the Shaikh of Muhammarah with the British autho rities with a view to co-operating with us in the event of war bet ween Great Britain and Turkey, but he put forward extravagant375 pretensions, and had not come down to any reasonable terms when war broke out. He had precipitately to expedite his departure for Najd, whence he went into voluntary exile in India. Saiyid Talib' is a man between 45 and 50, a heavy drinker and addicted to ah the vices of the East. His constitution has suffered from life-long indulgence in every form of excess, and his restless energy has probably to some extent diminished. In spite of innumerable crimes, he still retains among Muhammadan Arabs—especially among those who have not been brought into immediate contact with him—a high religious position as the descendant of a sacred house, but it is doubtful whether he would carry any weight as a political reformer except in exceedingly primitive communities. He has still the support of many of his former adherents in Basrah, but his reputation among the educated Liberals of Syria could scarcely bear the test of personal acquaintance. He was permitted to go to Egypt in 1918, but returned to Basrah with his family in 1920. In the autumn of 1920 was appointed Minister of the In terior in the provisional ’Iraq Cabinet, but owing to intrigue and disloyalty to the Civil Administration he was removed from Office and deported to Ceylon in May 1921. NASIR AL YASIR.— Ex-Shaikh of the Hachcham (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). Though outlawed, he is still with his section the ’Ujail. The ’Ujail are the chief ruling house of the Hachcham, Nasir is therefore better bom than Qasid al Nahi, who is at present (May 1920) the most prominent man of the tribe. qAsid al nAhl— Paramount Shaikh of the Hachcham (Hakkam), a Muntafiq tribe of the Bani Malik Division, Mujarrah group. He was greatly attached to Ajaimi in the past. This has handicapped him in his dealings with us. He has been staunch to us ever since we have been at Suq, in spite of much intrigue which has gone on around him. He is a famous fighting man, and led the three revolts against the Turks which took place in the Suq district. He is married to the daughter of Muzai’il, Shaikh of the al Hasan, and has great in fluence over that tribe.' Practically he controls the whole Mujarrah group of the Bani Malik, and has great influence with the Al Hasan. A rogue, but a fairly independent and a pleasant one. During the period leading up to the fall of Kut he was one of the chief means of preventing open rebellion among the tribes of Suq. Grasp ing, cunning and shrewd. Friendly during 1920 insurrection. QATI AL BUTL— Paramount Shaikh of the ’Azairij tribe (Muntafiq, Ajwad). Lives within four miles of Nasiriyah. Leader of the Albu Nasir376 section. Small in stature, cunning. During the Kut operations and Mizhir Pasha's occupation of Shatrah in 1915-16 he undoubtedly kept a leg in either camp. Has had little influence over the ’Azairij as a whole. This has occupied the attention of the Political Officer, Nasiriyah, who in 1917 managed considerably to strengthen Qati al Buti’s hands in this matter. Up till October, 1917, half Shaikh Qati’s tribe were still hostile to us, namely, the Wutaiwat, Albu Humairah and Albu Hawalah’ sections. These have now been got in and put under Shaikh Qati’s influence. Qati, for all his faults, may be said to have served us consistently since Nasiriyah was captured in July, 19L5. He is recognised as paramount Shaikh of the ’Azairij, and receives a subsidy of Rs. 200 per mensem. He is the only Shaikh in the Nasiriyah district with any education. He can read and write Arabic and speaks Turkish. QURAISH EFFENDI.— Resident of Nasiriyah. Rich, reported pro-Turk. Owns about 25 houses. Anti-British; formerly Mejnber of Parliament, Con stantinople. Disliked locally for having extorted money from the poor in Turkish times under the plea of revenue collection. RASHID, SA’UD IBN.— The present Amir of Jabal Shammar, son of Abdul ’Aziz by Mudhi bin Subhan. Ho is an ignorant, self-willed youth of 18 (1916), and is generally reckoned by the Arabs to be the unworthy son of a worthy father, but in his dealings with us in the summer of 1916, though no doubt fooled by the Turks, he certainly knew his own mind. He was summoned to the confines of the ’Iraq and bidden to await Ottoman help. He relied implicitly upon the promises which had been given him, refused to listen to the sound advice offered to him by the Shaikh of Zubair, and rejected with insolence the advances made to him by the latter. He sent no reply to the letters addressed to him by the C. P. O., and openly declared himself to be in the Shamiyah under Turkish instructions, and prepared to join in fighting us if Turkish troops were sent him. He did not, however, co-operate with ’Ajaimi, with whom he does not appear to be on good terms. In July he was attacked and repulsed by our Allies, the Dhafir and the Aslam section of the Shammar (see Dhari ibn Tawalah). Being unable to obtain provi sions from Zubair, Khiimislyah or Kuwait, and so losing his own following while receiving no help from the Turks, he was obliged to return to Hail. He exists doubtless chiefly on the strength of a name. Dhari ibn Tawalah found considerable difficulty in rallying the Aslam against him. One of the main factors in Shamiyah politics is the hatred and distrust with which the riverain tribes regard the Shammar, and vice verso. Ibn Rashid was the pivot of this sentiment in the minds of the desert people, but he could377 not stand up against the failure of the Turks to keep their engage ments and our success in closing the ’Iraq markets. In 1917 he joined the Turks on the Hajj Railway, but was treated with scant courtesy. Thence he returned to Hail early in 1918. In the summer he was attacked by Ibn Sa’ud, and was within an ace of losing Hail, but the attack was not pressed. He came to terms with Ibn Sa’ud and sent emissaries to the Sharif. He has made various indirect overtures to the British Government since the Annistice. Murdered 1920. SA'DCN. ’ABDULLAH BEG IBN FALTH PASHA.— Leader of the house of Nasir as opposed to that of Mansur which is represented by ’Ajaimi Beg al Mansur. ’Abdullah styles him self Amir al Muntafiq, and the majority of the Muntafiq look to him as the hereditary and rightful Shaikh of the Muntafiq on account of his being the grandson of Nasir Pasha, the last great Shaikh of all the Muntafiq Arabs. The minority look to ’Ajaimi Beg as their present leader, but the latter cannot put forward anything like the claims of ’Abdullah. Speaking generally ’Ajaimi considers himself the head of the Muntafiq who reside on the right bank of the Euphrates, and ’Abdullah leader of those between the Tigris and Euphrates. ’Abdullah is a tall man of fine appearance. About 30 years old, good looking, simple-minded and cheerful. A good example of the best type of Arab. Very proud of his sharaf, declined a subsidy from the British Government when he made his submission (February 1918). Remarkable for his personal genero sity, and though his financial position was good before the war, he now possesses nothing to speak of. One of the few Sa dun who retain their hold over the affections of the tribesmen. A bitier enemy of ’Ajaimi, not on good terms with Dhari Beg and Ibrahim Beg, who fear ’Abdullah’s rise to power. ' ’Abdullah surrendered at Nasiriyah on its first capture in July. 1915, but smarting under a fancied grievance, he never came in to us again, and throughout the summer of 1916 was in correspondence both' with us and with the Turks. He lived alone on the Gharraf river, and studiously avoided seeing both Turk and British. His property at Ma’amir was sequestrated by us. SA’DUN, AJAIMI IBN SA’DtJN.— The most virile member of the Sa’dun family is undoubtedly ’Ajaimi ibn Sa’dun who seems to be endowed more than his fellows with the primitive and restless instinct of the desert Arab. He is renowned for his cruelty and faithlessness, but no less famous for his personal bravery and resolution. He can be generous and genial but he is very fickle. The present unpopularity of the Sa’dun with the tribes is due largely to the lawless methods and brutality of ’Ajaimi and his father.378 Having squandered most of his patrimony and having no pro prietary stake in the country, he has for years been a stormy petrel in the Euphrates districts. In pre-war days his proclivities brought him periodically into conflict with the provincial Turkish authorities, and on these o ca- sions he more than once made appeals both to the Basrah Consulate and the Bushire Residency for British protection or intervention. To such overtures no response could be given, and he retired dejected. He was thrown permanently on to the side of the C. U. P. by his hatred of Saiyid Talib (see Naqib Zadah of Basrah, Saiyid Talib), whom he never forgave for having decoyed his father Sa'dun into Turkish hands in 1911. In October, 1912, he attacked and robbed his cousin Mizyad (probably with the connivance of the Mutasarrif Farid Bey) of a very large sum and came into conflict with Mizyad’s brother,’Abdullah. The C. U. P. falling out of power in November, ’ Ajaimi was proclaimed an outlaw. In November he threatened to attack Basrah, but in 1914, the C. U. P. being again supreme, he appeared outside Basrah to support them against Talib. When the war broke out he took service with the Turks as a soldier of fortune, and was present with his following of about 250 sowars with the Turkish forces opposing our entry into ’Iraq. He managed however, to keep out of active fighting, and retired by the desert route to Nasiriyah. He then began to make specious overtures through friends for entering into relations with us : but he placed such an exalted estimate on his services that it is doubtful if his advances were serious. In any case, in spite of every opening afforded him both by message and writing, he repeatedly failed to come to the scratch, and finally committed himself completely to the services of the Turks, receiving considerable sums from them for raising an Arab contingent for co-operation with their forces opposing us at Shu aibah. But he proved a broken reed to his patron, both at Shu’aibah and in the operations leading to the capture of Nasiriyah. He remained in the desert and in close touch with the Turks until we raided ’Anah in the spring of 1918, writing frequently to the Shamiyah Shaikhs, and providing a focus for Turkish intrigue. He was doubtless instrumental in fostering the troubles at Najaf, which ended in the murder of Captain Marshall in March, 1918. He is still an outlaw. SA DtJN, ’ALI IBN ’ABDULLAH IBN MANStR IBN THAM— \\ as head of the Arab Scouts at Nasiriyah, has shown himself a faithful servant of the British. A good horseman, used to a soldier s life. Owns considerable property up the Hai which Muhammad al Yasln (Shaikh of the Maiyah) has got hold of and pays him no rent. He used to live at Hassanah with ’Abdullah I alih, but when the latter’s attitude towards us became doubtful he removed with all his family into the Al Ibrahim country, north-379 •east of Nasiriyah. A pleasant-mannered well bred man of about 45 (in 1920), not particularly intelligent, but a trustworthy type. He was wounded in our service, and was awarded the I. D. S. M. SA'DtJN, DHARI BEG I BN THAMIR AL SA’DtN.— A man of about 43 in 1920. Has property on the Gharriif, east of Shatrah. and near Nasiriyah. Lived at Hassanah with ‘Abdullah Falih. Dhari was Abdullah Falih’s right hand, a very well known man, much respected. A bit of a philosopher, a lover of peace, pro-English. He left ’Abdullah Falih and settled in our territory with a group of Sa’dun whom he won over from ’Abdullah. SA DCN, IBRAHIM IBN MIZ’AL.— A grandson of Nasir and cousin of ’Abdullah Falih. He is the most pro-British of the Sa’d in; refused to go Shu aibah and came in to us after the occupation of Nasiriyah. Has held consistently with us. His own country, round Hasslinah, north of the Ham mar Lake being so much disturbed, he came down to Basrah whither he brought all his family. His mother is a negro slave girl. The only member of the Sa’dun who had the determination to throw in his lot with us unreservedly from the beginning. SA’DtN, MUHAMMAD BEG AL FAHAD.— Hai district. A Sa’dun Mallak holding most of the land in the district on the right bank of Gharraf. He follows the usual Sa'dun tent life, taking only a light rent from the tribes. He is the best educated and most widely travelled man in the district, having been to Constantinople and Egypt. As a result he has a broader outlook, and being already fairly wealthy, gets bn well with his tenants. Would probably like to take part in public life in ’Iraq if occasion arose ; probably, however, his view s as to the land ques tion would differ from those of Government. SA’DUN, MUTLAQ AL HUMUD.— A Shaikh of the old style, now much advanced in years. He lives in the eastern part of the Hammar region, north of the lake, not far from Badr Rumaiyidh, and owns considerable properties on which the Albu Shamah, Bani Hutait, Husaini and Musharraf (Muntafiq Bani Malik) live. He is a son of Faisal and grandson of the famous Humud al Sa’dun who ruled the clan for 40 years, during half of which time he was blind. After our occupation of Basrah he came into Basrah and remained there for some weeks, but he is a harmless old dotard, and get into the unscrupulous hands of one Mathew Marios (since deported) who led him astray Suddenly without any apparent reason, except perhaps that he thought the Turks were going to retake Basrah, he went over to the enem or to ’Aiaimi at Shulaibah. After the fall of Nasiriyah380 he made his submission again and the Political Officer, in ignorance of what had happened previously, welcomed him and whitewashed him. Is now living on his property on the Hammar. For many years the tribes have paid him no rents. SA’DtJN, THAMIR BEG AL.— Eldest brother of ’Ajaimi. Lives at Umm al Battush near Siq and keeps a kind of semi-regal state, surrounding himself with Sa’dun notables who look to him as the head of the family. He is not, however, well off. His leading trait is his hatred of his” brother ’Ajaimi who, being a man of much stronger character and with a greater capacity as a leader, has eclipsed and supplanted Thamii. Chiefly owing to this sentiment Thamir stood lo.ally by us; he receives a subsidy and in December, 1916, he was given an allow ance for 30 horsemen whom he is bound to maintain for Govern ment service in the Suq-Khamisiyah district. He is weak and obstinate, has a bad temper which at times gets control of him, is touchy, and possesses all the inordinate conceit of the Sa’dun. Very pleasant in personal intercourse. He was a strong supporter of Government, and carried on faithfully his work of keeping order in the Shamiyah. He returned from Syria at the end of 1919, both he and Yusuf Beg al Sa’dun are full of ideas of the Arab move ment towards independent Government. He brought back a letter from the King of the Hedjaz to the Civil Commissioner. He has been to Mecca. As the eldest son of Sa’dun Pasha he is casting longing eyes at the Shaikhship of the Muntafiq. He is ambitious.' SA’Dt)N, THUWAINI IBN ’ABDULLAH IBN MANSUR AL RASHID, HAJIj— Brother of Sumair ; the two bear a marked resemblance to one another. Lives with Thamir Beg at Umm al Battush. He owns- the whole of the ’ Ibadah country in the Hammar, and on the Gharraf the ’Aradhi ’Aqail on the Shatt al A’ma. SA’DUN YUSUF BEG AL MANSUR.— Cousin of ’Ajaimi. Was with the Turks at Shu’aibah, came to us subsequently in 1915 and was told to remain in Basrah. After two months he left without permission in the late autumn of 1915 and rejoined ’Ajaimi. He had been in communication with the Turks and is believed to have visited Khalil Pasha after the fall of Kut. He is said to have received 100 Liras a month from the Turks. Visited ’Ajaimi and complained that his property at Mutawwa’ah near Basrah had been confiscated by us. Then went to Shatrah to Mizhir Pasha. He has since been permitted to return to ’Iraq and is now (May 1920) with Thamir Beg al Sa’dun, ’Ajaimi’s brother, at Umm al Battush, near Suq. He is ambitious and now hopes for employment under Government.381 {°iy SALIH AL DAGHIR.— Head of Khashab section of the Ibrahim (Muntafiq, Bani Malik)' the only Shaikh of the tribe who has stood by us consistently and rejected all Turkish overtures, looked upon as leading Shaikh of the Ibrahim by us in consequence. Gets Rs. 200 subsidy per month. He rendered good service in endeavouring to bring in wavering Shaikhs of his own and other tribes (October 1916). His attitude was no doubt due in a great measure to the fact that his domicile is within range of our guns at Nasirlyah. Has not much influence in the tribe. Shifty, cunning, under the protection of Dhari Beg as Sa’dun. His tribe badly hit by the famine of 1917-18. SALIH AL HADJAZ.— Mudir of Dair. A Basrah landlord. An exceedingly strong and capable man who has already worked wonders in a Nahiyah which has for long been a most unruly one. He was formerly Mudir of Chabaish before the return of Salim al Khaiyfin. SALIH AL DAGHIR.— Paramount Shaikh of Al Ibrahim. Clever and cunning. Has experience of 50 years intrigue behind him. Position in tribe not strong, and not much in personal touch. SALIM al khaiyCn.— Shaikh of Chabaish and Mudir of Chabaish and Hammar Sharqa. Of pleasant appearance and striking personality. Before the war was Captain of River Police in pay of Turks and in great demand by the Wali of Basrah against the advances of Saiyid Talib. Was known to be a strong pro-Turk and did not take the oppor tunity of surrendering to the British after the occupation of Q urn ah. He was consequently, owing to his strong pro-Turkish sympathies, removed to Bombay where he was kept on parole as a political pri soner throughout the war. His nephew Majid al Khaiyan was put in as Shaikh. Salim was allowed to return in June 1919 and re installed as Shaikh of Chabaish also made a Mudir. Salim hae adopted many western customs and ideas due to his coming into contact with Britishers in Bombay where he became an enthusiastic race goer. Although he is undoubtedly a clever rogue his conduct to date towards Government has been satis factory. His attitude is to cultivate the friendship of all Britishers with whom he comes into contact doubtless with ulterior motives. He has a wide influence over the Ahl Jizair tribes and also to some extent in Madlnah, and among some of the Bani Khaiqan. A man who could greatly help or greatly hinder us according to his incli nations at the time. Rendered valuable assistance during the 1920 insurrection in protecting river craft near the mouth of the Mazliq canal in the Hammar Lake.382 SANI, AHMAD PASHA.— One of the leading citizens of Basrah, has house property in the town and on one of the creeks ; owns extensive date gardens and takes part in the yearly Conference with foreign exporters for the fixing of the price of dates. Said to be a good deal indebted. He was a member of the Majlis Idarah, and was treated with great consideration by the Turks who were accustomed to seek his advice. He was charged with the reading of the address of welcome to the incoming Wali. He was intimate with Saiyid Talib, through whom he became rich. He acted as his intermediary with the British Consulate. Not on good terms with ’Ajaimi, though he preserved relations with him. He welcomed our arrival and telegraphed congratulations to King George after the occupation of Basrah. Has given £200 to the Red Cross. He has shown great loyalty and has definitely thrown in his lot with us and burnt his boats. Always ready to help whenever asked by us. A man of 45, heavy in build, coarse featured, ignorant, not specially intelligent. With Yusuf Beg, brother of Saiyid Talib, he used to squeeze money out of the people. He is the agent of Sa’dun, who resorts much to his house. His family is of old Najd origin, his father having come to Basrah from Majma’ in Sudai. Sunni. SHAHAD AL ISA, HAJI.— Shaikh of the Gharyafiyah, a strong humulah of the al Hasan (Mun^afiq, Bani Malik, Mujarrah). A strong fanatical man, reputed honest. Too proud to ask for presents. Great difficulty in bringing him in ; he had to be bombarded for harbouring Turkish agents. Perfectly straight; dislikes us and does not conceal it. His cousin, Haji Shinyar, supports him and shares his characteristics. SHARSHAB IBN SHAHAM— Shaikh of the Budur (Muntafiq, Ajwad), a nomadic tribe claim ing to be of 'Anizah stock. With Humud ibn Suwait of the Dhafir, with whom he is on terms of personal friendship, and Manshad al Hubaiyib of the Ghazzi, he formed a combine against ’Ajaimi in 1915. In March, 1916, his brother, Sarhan, came with Hum' d’s son to Basrah to ask for help against ’Ajaimi, which was given. (See Suwait, Humud ibn.) Small in stature, reserved, rarely comes into Nasiriyah. Is in receipt of Rs. 200 per month subsidy. Has an unruly tribe under him, which he manages well.

He is unfortunate in having .three sectional chiefs against him, Mansur al ’Uwaiysh (Jabbarah) Sirhan al Sharrad (’Udhaimiyin), and Shamkhi al Huwaichim •{Bani Zaid Dachchat). This enmity is engineered by Khaiycn al ’Ubaid. Very pro-British, clever, rich and a miser. SUWAILIM IBN HAW WASH.— Shaikh of the al Jahl, an important sub-tribe of the ’Abudah, Suwailim is an intelligent, straightforward man, qualities which are rare among ’Abudah Shaikhs. An inveterate enemy of Khaiyun al ’Ubaid, whom he is running very close for the paramount Shaikh- ship of the ’Abudah. He fought against us under the Khafajah Hag. Age about 50 in 1920. He is more cunning than Khaiyun, but the latter has more influence on account of his having been twice Qaimmaqam under the Turks.

TAHA AL SALMAN, HAJL— One of the richest citizens of Basrah, merchant and land-owner, AJo thought .but for his business. Kind and pleasant, timid ; goes with the stream, but at heart anti-British. His son, ’Abdul Razz-aq; was openly robbed by Saiyid Talib. TAHA AL ZIYARAH.— A prominent personage of the Khafajah tribe near Nasiriyah, Quarrelled with the Shaikh of the tribe in Turkish times, and took the opportunity of joining us when Nasiriyah was captured, in July, 1915. Was employed from 1915 to 1918 as a secret agent with varying success. He was particularly good at producing news of Shatrah and its affairs. In January, 1918, he was ordered to reside at Suwaij, near Shatrah, where he was pensioned off with a small salary of Rs. 80 per month. He is medium sized, with a black beard and cheerful countenance, a strong well-wisher of the British ; a most useful man to have among the tribes, but his reports are often not to be relied on. He has a tendency to so cook his news that, if believed, some of his private enemies would certainly come off badly at our hands. TAHIR AL HUSAIN.— Shaikh of the Bani Sa’id (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan) He is the bright spot in the Bani Khaiqan tribes. Very pro-British has kept his tribe in order. Adopted attitude of passive hostility during the 1920 insurrection. 26384 YASIN al daftar.— A1 Fuhaili (Muntafiq, Bani Malik, Bani Khaiqan). Aii impor* taut personage on the left bank of the Euphrates. Has been very friendly since our advance on ’Akaikah. Has always hoped to take Shaikh Ati’s place, claiming that he came in first. He has given valuable information concerning Turkish mines in the river, etc. In 1916 his date revenue was remitted for his good services. YASIR AL CHOLAN.— Shaikh of the Albu Humaidi, a nasty reacherous crowd, section of the al Hasan (Muntafiq, Bani malik, Mujarrah). Yasir was for long openly hostile ; has a reputation for extreme dishonesty, and will betray his own people. Influential, a dangerous man, was in constant touch with ’Ajaimi. ZAMIL AL MANNA’.— Nasiriyah district. Head of a family of Hijaz origin, dependent on the Sa dim. They were put in some 50 years ago as head men of the Ajwad Division of the Muntafiq, but the position is purely titular with no executive tribal authority. In war time one of the Manna’, if there happened to be a capable man available, would be the natural leader of the Ajwad. In an assembly of the Ajwad, Zamil would have the highest seat. The family have property on the Cfharraf, and at Nasiriyah. Since the occupafion of the Gharraf, Zamil has been very friendly and obliging.CHAPTER VIII. COMMUNICATIO NS. I. General. The physical features of this area are such as to be more of a hindrance than a help to its natural communications, the rivers being the only asset. By means of them permanent lines of comm”- nications are afforded each in its own direction by the Shatt-al- Arab and the Euphrates, while a temporary one is available by means of the Gharraf, which is never navigable between the months of August and December (both inclusive) and may remain not so for even a longer period, depending on the amount of water in the Tigris. The remaining outstanding physical features, such as the vast marsh areas which restrict alignments, the arid desert expanses, and the soil, which becomes almost untraversable after heavy rain all militate against the formation of any sound system of commu nications. II. Water Communications. (a) The Shatt-al-Aeab. The Shatt-al-Arab is the broad navigable river which is formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates (old channel) at Qurnah and which, after being joined by the Karun flows into the Persian Gulf at Fao. Its mean breadth from Basrah to the mouth of the Karun is 600 yards, below which point it immediately broadens to half a mile, gradually reaching the width of one mile at Fao. The new channel of the Euphrates enters the Shatt-al-Arab at Qarmat ’Ali, and is the main outlet to the water in the extensive marsh area west of the Shatt-al-Arab between Qumah and Basrah. The controlling factor for the size of shipping using the Shatt-al- Arab as a waterway is the Fao bar. The depth of water at the shallowest part of the bar is 10 feet at low tide and 20 feet at high tide at all seasons. The state of the Shatt-al-Arab whether in flood or otherwise makes no difference to the depth of water at the bar. Effect of wind .—A strong southerly wind (strong breeze, force 5) gives an additional foot of water at the bar. Conversely a strong northerly breeze reduces the depth by a corresponding amount. 385 26 aDredijtvg. —There is no dredging, nor any dredged channel at present but a dredging scheme to admit a draught of 25 feet is likely to materialise shortly. A ship can plough through 14' or 15' of mud at the bar, the distance that has to be ploughed through (i.e., the breadth of the shallowest portion) is 2 miles. The average soundings between Fao and Ma’qil in the Shatt-al- Arab are 7—8 fathoms. The minimum in the deepest channel is 4 fathoms at dead low tide and in the low river season. In 1918 the total inward tonnage crossing the Fao bar was 2,640,437 tons. The total outward tonnage was 2,672,331 tons. (For note on the port of Basrah see Appendix “ I).”) , Nahr Umr. —Two wharves for ocean going steamers have been built. The bank here being naturally “ steep to ”, steamers can be moored to it. As many as eight ocean going ships have been berthed at one time, but as the river is only 500 feet broad between the 18-foot contours the turning of large ships is a delicate and difficult operation necessitating an efficient tug. Maq'il-Qurnah .—There is a bar 2 miles downstream of Qumah (due to the junction of the Euphrates) which controls the draught of shipping to about 10 feet at low water. The maximum being 15 feet in flood river and high tide. The average maximum at high tide is 12 feet over this bar. (6) The Euphrates. The Euphrates traverses the area from Darraji on the west to Qurnah on the east, where by means of its old channel it links up with the Tigris ; the water of the two rivers forming the Shatt-al- Arab. The Euphrates new channel enters the Shatt-al-Arab at Qarmat 'Ali, and takes off from the large expanse of open water south west and south of Qurnah which is all connected with the Hammar Lake. The old channel enters the Hammar Lake at Mazliq and passes out of it at Bani Hutait, 15 miles to the west. From Bani Hutait to Qumah it has only one main navigable channel, and both banks are closely intersected by a network of-canals, running north and south into the extensive permanent marsh areas which embrace the whole of that district. The maze of waterways amongst these marshes is so complicated that they are known only to the local inhabitants. They are navigable only for mashufs ; motor launches might be used in isolated localities within these marshes where the channels are clear, but their sphere of action would be extremely restricted owing to the masses of reeds which would continually foul the propeller.The main channel as far as Chabaish is navigable at all seasons of the year for river steamers with barges. West of Chabaish lies the Hammar Lake which requires constant dredging to keep open a channel deep and wide enough for river steamers. These dredging operations have been suspended and the once suitable channel is silting up rapidly and a natural bar with a depth of only 2 feet 6 inches of water has again formed near Mazliq. (See Appendix “ B ”.) Thus through navigation between Basrah and Nasiriyah for any craft of greater draught than 2' 6' is at present only possible in the months of April, May and June when the lake level is high. The Euphrates from Mazliq to Darraji is navigable throughout for river steamers at all seasons of the year. (c) The Gharraf. The Gharraf flows from north to south and is a distributary of the Tigris. Its use as a waterway is dependent on the amount of water in the Tigris, for when that river is low the Gharraf is either dry or nearly so. When flowing, its course is, roughly speaking, south as far as the junction of the Shatt-al-Shatrah and the Bad’ah (3 miles north of Shatrah). When the Bad’ah channel is not closed by means of a bund at its mouth the majority of the Gharraf water flows down it in a south-east direction feeding a series of permanent- lakes before finally emptying itself in the Hammar Lake. The old course of the Gharraf, now completely silted up at its southern end, was that of the present Shatt-al-Shatrah, continuing to join the Euphrates at Nasiriyah. The Gharraf runs dry in September and remains so until about the end of December. The navigable season is usually from the end of January to the end of June, when “ Fly ” boats and stem wheelers can steam with ease as far as the Bad’ah channel take off. When the Tigris is in high flood this point can also be reached by river steamers of 6-foot draught. There is a sufficient depth of water in the Bad'ah channel for “ Fly ” boats and stem wheelers, but turning for them is a matter of great difficulty owing to the narrow channel. Turning of such craft in the Shatt-al-Shatrah is impossible ; where the only means of exit, if once in, is to go astern till the junction is reached. It is therefore inadvisable, under normal conditions, for any craft of greater size than motor launches to pass further downstream than the Shatt-al-Shatrah-Bad'ah channel junction. At the point where any of the branches of the Bad'ah flow into the first of the series of lakes which lie to the north of the Hammar Lake there' is a “ bar ” which, even at high water, limits draught to not more than 2' 6*. From the end of January to the end of June craft of 2' 6* draught or less should be able to pass between the Gharraf and the Euphrates388 vid the Bad’ah channel and the Hanunar Lake. It is by this route that all the surplus grain from the fields of the Gharraf tribes is exported to Basrah. (d) Canal. From Suq to Khamislyah. There are two routes, both open from mid-April to early July, dependent on high flood. They are suitable for launches and ballums of 3-foot draught. (i) The Atabiyah Canal (9 miles). (ii) The Kirminshiyah Canal (12 miles). Note.—T here is a flying ferry at Suq capable of carrying 50 men’ or 12 horses, or 1 lorry. ///. Railway Communications. The metre gauge line from Basrah to ’Amarah via Qumah has been taken up. The existing railway is a metre gauge which runs from Basrah to Baghdad via Ur Junction, Darraji and Hillah. It has two short branch lines one from Zubair to the Jabal Sanam (of 23 miles), for the transport of quarried stone, and one toNaskiyah from Ur Junc tion (8 miles). Its alignment, where it traverses this area, is imme diately to the south of the Hammar Lake flood and marsh area, turn ing north-west towards Ur Junction and thence to Darraji keeping to the right bank of the Euphrates. Immediate^ on its south side lies the Shamiyah or Arabian desert, the home of the Bedawin. From its location it is therefore vulnerable to tribes who are some what inaccessible for punishment. The tribe which is most closely connected with the railway in the area between Darraji and Basrah is the Dhafir. Shaikh Humud and Shaikh Lazzam (each head of one of the two leading sections of the Dhafir) receive Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 500 per mensem respectively as a subsidy for the protection of the line. IV. Land Communications. Except for the short stretch of road 10 miles between Ur Junc tion and Nasiriyah and for the road from Nasiriyah to Shat rah, 32 miles, and roads in the immediate vicinity of Basrah and Maq’il there is no road maintained throughout the whole area. Land communications exist, as shown below, but, apart from the few exceptions mentioned above, these communications resolve them selves in almost every case into any route, picked across country, at the discretion of the traveller himself, the normal means of transit being either by water or the railway.389 (a) Land Communications from Basrah. (t) Basrah to Fao (68 miles).— This route is practically never used as all communication is normally by river. It is impassabl for heavy M. T. but is fit for Fords and light lorries except during, or for 3 days after heavy rain. The track ^ always liable to be intersected by irrigation cuts which the inhabit an ^ cut into and across it; these are sufficiently broad and deep to stop any type of wheeled transport until filled in. T ic pom ., such channels are most frequently met is at Naghamish, lo miles north of Fao. (w) Basrah to Zubair (12 mM.—Direct route, passable for Fords and light lorries as in (i) above. (Hi) Basrah to Umm Qasr (il miles).— The route passes Safwan and is fit for Fords and light lorries at all seasons except during and for 2 days after the cessation of heavy rain. (iv) Basrah to Qurnah.-The road from Basrah to Qumah still exists and is in good condition, suitable for motor traffic At the present time however there are no bridges at G^rmat Ah Shafi and Asafiyah, though the old piles still remain. The Cml Adminis tration intend to restore this road shortly building bridges at bhah and Asafiyah and keeping a flying ferry at Gurmat Ah. This roan, which already runs to Ezra’s Tomb, will meet the Amarah-Qalat Salih road. From Basrah to Nahr Umr (17 miles). -Motor lorry convoys could proceed at all seasons except during and for 3 days after the cessation of heavy rain. From Nahr Umr to Oumaij (20 ^iles).-The route leads along the railway embankment ah the way, the Shaft canal being crossed by means of an iron bridge 45 yards long. From Oumaij to Qurnah (7 miles). -The road leads through the palm trees on the right bank of the Shatt-al-Arab and is passable at all seasons (except for two days after heavy ram) for | ord ans aa long as the marginal bund of the river is maintained. Should this not be so there is the alternative but bad route available at all seasons by continuing along the railway embankment to Qurnab. There is a flying ferry over the Euphrates at Qurnah capable of carrying two Ford Vans, or one lorry, or 45 men at one time. This' route could be very easily so improved as to admit of the passage of motor lorry convoys. (v) Basrah to Nasirlyah (110 mi7es).-There is no definite track The route as far as Ur is fit for field guns and any type of transport up to light lorries at all seasons except for 3 days after the cessation of heavy rains. The general alignment of the route from Basrah ?s approximately that of the railway as far as 2 miles south-east of Tehal-Lahm from which point a line for 3 miles on a north J390 bearing wiil strike the Khamisiyali-^sasiiiyah road (see C (ii) (o) below) at a point 5 miles west of Khamlsiyah. Generally speak'n' the ground undulates to the north of the railway and is more suitable than that to the south of it. Stretches of flat level ground affording perfect going are found for miles on end but patches of heavy sand are encountered which must be avoided by means of detours. Apart from the water for which storage is normally available at railway statioi s (see Appendix “ C ”) the water alon« the southern edge of the Hammar Lake near the railway line (except in April, May and June) becomes too brackish either for engines or for drinking. At all .seasons there are howe\er certain patches at Ghabashiyah and Luqa’it fit for drinking and for engines. Apart from what is available at railway stations there is no^ood water between Ghabashiyah and Luqa’it and no water between Luqa'it and Hamadiyah except at A1 Jalibah. From Jallbah to Tel-al -Lahm there is no water. At Tel-al-Lahm there is a brackish but drinkable well. From Tel-al-Lahm there is no drinkable water till Ur is reached. (f&gt;) Land Communications from Qdknah. Qurnah is connected by land routes to ’Am&amp;rah (92 miles), and to Basrah (44 miles, see para, (a) above). Qurnah to 'Amarah.— Fit for infantry, cavalry and pack trans port only, as the old bridges are either broken or unsafe. Between Qurnah and Ezra’s tomb the track cannot be relied upon for anv arm on account of floods which may occur between March and June (inclusive). The old railway embankment still exists, but of all the biid^es only the piles on which they w'ere built remain. If the railway bridges were renewed a good permanent road could be made with but little additional labour. This is under consideration. (c) Land Communications from KhamisIyah.

(ii) Direct route {28 miles ).—The surface is uneven and difficult though passable for Ford Vans. No water along route except the KhamisIyah Canal which lies to the north of the route for the first ten miles. Route (i) above is normally taken bv M. T., as being the more suitable.

The route is passable for pack transport throughout at all seasons, but the surface of the bund is treacherous. This could easily be improved. A reinforced bund, 5 feet wide at the top and 4 feet G inches high, and 11,000 yards in length runs from Suq to within 4| miles of Tel-al-Lahm station. Its course is winding, and its object is to protect the Shamiyah crops to the north-west of it from water banking up from the Hammar Lake. It is a possible alignment for a decauville railway to connect Suq with Tel-al-Lahm. The Lake water on the east side of this bund is waist high in May. The Khamisiyah Canal cuts through this bund and is bridged, 100 yards north-west of the bund (and south-west by south of Suq) by means of palm logs fit for men or single horses or donkeys. The Khami- slyah Canal which takes off from the Euphrates about mid-way between Nasiriyah and Suq flows south-west for approximately its first 4 miles and then turns south-east to Khamisiyah. It is 12 feet wide from bank to bank and contains water at all seasons. Its depth fluctuates between 3 and 5 feet. (б) Direct distance 9 miles. This route is fit for donkeys and mules only and is unsuitable for camels. From Suq to the Khamisiyah Canal (4 miles), men and animals must move in single file owing to marshy land and irri gation channels. After crossing the Khamisiyah Canal (see (or.) above) the remainder of the route to Tel-al-Lahm (5 miles) is fit for lorries at all seasons except after rain. (ii) Suq to Khamisiyah (distance ft miles). —Passable for donkeys and horses only. From mid-April to early July traffic is normally by water (see para, (ii) (d).) The Khamisiyah Canal is crossed by means of the palm log bridge (see para, (d) (i) (a) above) at mile 4. The track thence leads south-east for 5 miles into Khamisiyah. Note. —It is always possible even in the high flood season to reach Khamisiyah from Suq by land by using the bund until the high ground to the west of Khamisiyah is reached, and thence, by keeping to the south of the flood reaching Khamisiyah. Owing to the passage of the Khamisiyah Canal this route is only fit for pack transport. (iii) Suq to Ndsiriyah. —There are two routes. (a) Vid the right bank Euphrates bund (25 miles). —Suitable for pack and infantry in single file. Supplies. —Of dates, grain, fish, vegetables, fuel and fodder sufficient for one Company and its transport.There are very few irrigation cuts crossing the track, they are not bridged but none forms a serious obstacle to the passage of M. T. Except from the Euphrates, which is an average distance of miles to the north of the track, there is no water to be found between Ur and Darraji unless some happens to be found in any of the shallow irrigation cuts passed over ; or at railway stations (see Appendix “ C ”); in this section such water is usually brackish and scarcely fit to drink. At Darraji railway station there is a well cut channel, 2,000 yards in length, 4 feet wide and 2 feet deep which takes off from the Euphrates and contains a permanent supply of good, clear water. Sheep are plentiful from late December till May inclusive, otherwise no supplies are available. (iv) Nasirlyah to Shatrah {32 miles ).—General direction north. The route is across the desert as far as Suwaij from where to Shatrah a bridged track follows the dry bed of the Shatt-al-Shat- rah. An alternative route exists along the river bed. The road is unmetalled and in general is as far as Butniyah passable for all arms, and for heavy lorries except in wet weather. Where through water-cuts it is not so, these can be bridged or cut away for traffic. From Butniyah to Suwaij there are no obstacles until 3 miles south of Suwaij when several water-cuts are met. These are bridged but are generally rather narrow for wheeled transport. Irom Suwaij to Shatrah the high level road crosses many water-cuts. The bridges over these allow a Ford Van to pass over but are not suited to wheeled transport. The alternative route via the bed of the Shatt-al-Shatrah has no obstacles and is suitable for all arms and heavy lorries. Wells in the river bed at Sadun make passage difficult and the route leaves the bed of the Shatt-al-Shatrah, two miles south of Shatrah and joins the high level route. Throughout, the route is thickly overgrown by low bushes up to five feet in height, affording excellent cover from view. This together with the maze of canal cuts renders the country almost impossible for cavalry and armoured car work. It must also be borne in mind that the passage of the country during hostilities would probably necessitate the rebuilding of the bridges over water-cuts. Water. —At Butniyah is a large lake in which there is a permanent supply of water found at 4 to 5 feet below ground level at the sides of the lake. A few wells exist but it is advisable to sink new ones, which can be done quickly, thus avoiding contaminated water. In January, 1921, the supply from 10 wells of 8 feet diameter was about 24,000 gallons per diem. A water-cut near the north end of the lake is capable of watering 3,000 animals in addition. Quality of water fair, but requires chlorination. At Suwaij very good water can be obtained at a depth of 18 feet from the dry bed of the Shatt-al-Gharraf, by sinking wells. In394 January, 1921, a daily supply of 12,000 gallons was obtained from 12 wells. As these are liable to fall in, the sides require shoring. Supplies, etc. —Most villages have from 1—tons of barley and bhoosa stored, whilst about 400 tons of each could be collected at a month's notice. Camels and donkeys for transport are not numerous. Camel thorn for firewood is plentiful. Grazing is poor and not suitable for military horses. (v) Ndsiriyah to Khamisiyah. —Two routes, 36 miles and 28 miles. [See C. (ii).] (vi) Ndsiriyah to Suq-ash-Shuyftkh. —Two routes, 25 miles and 254 miles. [See D. (iii).] (/) Land Communications fkom Shateah. (i) Shatrah to Ndsiriyah (32 miles). —[See e. (iv) above).] (ii) Shatrah to Hai Town. —64 miles (approximate by river side route). General direction north. The route lies across the desert keeping close to the Shatt-al- Gharraf (left bank). The road is unmetalled, and passable except in the flood season for all arms and heavy lorries except after wet weather. Obstacles in the nature of water-cuts are frequently met with, but these can be easily bridged. In August, 1920, all the existing bridges were destroyed by the insurgents but were repaired by them in January, 1921, to allow the passage of a strong column. The road continues through from Hai Town to Kut. Alternative tracks are available, but these are passable for pack transport only, and impassable in the flood season. Drinking water is plentiful from the Gharraf or from wells, whilst there is an abundance of grain, fodder, and sheep. Grazing is poor. F. Telegraph Communications.

(c) is connected to Shu’aibah by one wire. \d) one trunk line to Muhammarah. Ndsiriyah —Is connected by telephone with Suq-ash-Shuyukh and Shatrah ; the connection is over the telegraph wire. VII. Postal Communication. There is a regular daily postal service to and from Basrah by railway to Nasiriyah and beyond. The daily postal service to and from Qurnah is carried by means of river steamers. From Nasiriyah letters to Shatrah, Qal'at Sikar and Suq-ash- Shuyukh are sent out under, arrangements made by the Civil Administration three times a week by Arab levy sowar. The tribal Shaikhs have extremely little postal correspondence ; such as there is, is normally carried out through the medium of a merchant or clerk in the nearest town with a post office. VIII. Aerodromes. Basrah and Shaibah.—There is an emergency landing ground at Tanumah on the left bank of the Shatt-al-Arab. A new aero drome has been taken into use on the plateau at Shu aibah which is 1,000 yards square and fit for landing at any season, and for all ypes of machines.396 Chaibaish. —No possible landing ground at any season owing to floods. Khamisiyah. —There is no made aerodrome but there is good landing and unlimited space on the desert anywhere to the south and west of the town. Surface after rain would be very soft. Nasiriyah .—There is a good aerodrome for all types of machines. Surface is rather soft but very level. No vegetation on aerodrome. It is situated one mile south of town on right bank of Euphrates. Size 600 yards by 500 yards. QaVat Sikar. —The landing ground is not being maintained (July 1921) but the position would be useful in the event of a forced landing in the district. The nature of the surface was good (June 1920) and approximately 400 yards by 400 yards. The position of the landing ground is 1 mile south-east of the town and on the left bank of the Hai river. Qurnah .—A landing ground is situated approximately 1 mile south of the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and is approximately 500 yards by 400 yards. The surface is good. Shatrah. —An emergency landing ground is situated approxi mately i mile south-east of the town on the left bank of the Shatt- al-Gharraf. The surface is of hard sand and the maximum dimen sions for landing—500 X 350 yards. Suq .—An emergency landing ground 400 yards square not in regular use. Surface fair. IX. Effect of certain Floods on Communications. Apart from the normal increase of the flooded areas which is naturally to be expected owing to the additional volume of water due to the melting snows brought down by the Euphrates between January and June, there are two localities which are liable to flood which are somewhat unexpected. (i) Owing to the annual increase of the Hammar Lake north east and south its waters “ bank up ” over the low-lying country to the west and south-west. These waters, reaching the walls of Khamisiyah on the east, pass to the north of that town until they are held up by the Suq-Tel al Lahm bund (see para. D (i).) There are no floods ever to the south or west of Khamisiyah. (ii) Floods from the Khor Zubair .—When a strong wind blows for days on end during the period of exceptionally high tides sea water is blown up from the Khor Zubair flooding the intervening country as xar as the walls of Zubair and Basrah. Under such con ditions two feet or more of water is not uncommon at the bund outside Basrah (e.g., March 1916) the water reaching to and flooding the branch railway line from Zubair to the Jabal Sanam.ving to s good &gt; south ichines. •drome. ihrates. (iii) For a somewhat similar reason a camp pitched, for instance, on a calm day on the south shore of the Hammar Lake, where the slope of the land is very gradual may find itself flooded in a few hours for a distance of 1,000 yards or more inland. This is due to a strong north wind having arisen and blown the lake water south wards. (In this connection see para.

The methods of calculating weights and measures in Iraq not only vary according to locality, but two or more systems are fre quently in use in the same place, thus leading to much complica tion. The whole problem—one entailing numerous difficulties—of standardizing all weights and measures in the occupied territory is under consideration, but as yet (May 1920) no solution has been reached. The following weights and measures are in use in Area 6 :—404 APPENDIX B. Note on the Hammar Lake. The main obstrnctiou to through navigation for river steamers with barges between Basrah, Nasiriyah and beyond is the Hammar Lake, which has to be traversed. During the War, the original military intention was to make and maintain a channel to admit of river boats and barges of 6-foot draught being able to get through at all seasons of the year between Basrah and Nasiriyah. This was done by the dredgine of a, channel 180 feet wide and 10 feet deep across the Hammar Lake the soil being thrown up on the south side of the dredged channel and forming an incomplete bund from Mazliq to Bani Hutait. Matters were further improved by cutting a 5-mile channel of the same dimensions direct from Bani Sa id to Mazliq which was completed in January 1919, and which carried the whole volume of water of which previously two-thirds flowed into the Hammar Lake via the Nakhla Channel and one-third via the Mazliq Channel. Unfortunately shoals began to form almost immediately with the result that by October 1919 downstream of the Mazliq in the Hammar Lake itself, and at Chabaish, silting up was of such extent that whe:$ 10 feet of water was hoped for there was actuallv only a depth of 2 feet 6 inches. Dredging operations had therefore to be resumed, and these were continued intermittently until the insurrection of 1920, since when nothing has been done, and the cutting of the bunds in several places by the insurgents together with wear from wave artion during storms has practically nullified the whole of the work and of the immense sums of money previously expended on the project. Unfortunately it would appear that funds were not forthcoming for the upkeep of the channel, though a moderate sum expended on revetting the bund would have pre served it from wave action, and resulted in the reclamation of large areas of land from which revenue would have been obtainable, and which further, in the event of hostilities, would have made possible the pursuit of marauding tribes—an important military factor. Except for this, and the co-operation of gunboats in opera tions against the ever refractory tribes of the Lower Euphrates, the necessity of the navigability of the Euphrates has greatly decreased owing to the completion of the railway from Basrah to Baghdad via Nasiriyah and Hillah. It is very doubtful therefore, in view of the cost, whether the project of remaking and maintain- ng a navigable channel through the Hammar Lake will be re-opened for some years to come.

Previous to the War no facilities existed for the berthing of deep- sea steamers and for the discharge of import cargo. During the War it was found necessary to build wharves for effecting the rapid discharge of troops and War material. A suit able site was chosen at Ma'qil and wharves complete with cranes and cargo landing devices were erected. It was only when Govern ment Transports began to be handed back to owners that com mercial cargo commenced to be landed at the Ma’qil wharves. The necessity for shedding accommodation for merchants’ cargo in close proximity to wharves then arose and nine sheds have been built. The Port of Basrah Proclamation (Provisional) 1919 placed the port on its present footing, defining its areas, organization' duties and powers. In connection with the Port there exists an efficient survey department responsible for recording all changes in depth of water from Basrah to the Outer Bar. The buoyage of the Bar and river is also maintained by the port. The prospective dredging of the Outer Bar should affect shipping entering Basrah very considerably, as 25 feet will be available as against 18 feet to 20 feet at present. Nos. £ loading, b Farth&lt; Ambulant Downs used by r Wharves. There are 3,000 feet of continuous wharf at Upper Ma’qil which » is divided into 6 berths of 500 feet each, with an average depth alongside of 24 feet at low tide. This wharf is fitted with electric cranes, railway lines, sheds, etc. The berths are numbered 1—6. Downstream of No. 6 berth, divided from the Upper Ma’qil Wharves by Lynch’s Dockyard, is No. 7 Wharf ; used principally as a coal wharf, being fitted with steam cranes, railways, etc., to facilitate discharge. The next wharf suitable for ocean going vessels is No. 11 which is not fitted with cranes, but is used mostly for embarking or dis embarking. No. 8 is built of pontoons with small jetties from the shore and seldom used by ocean going steamers.Nos. 9 and 10 are wooden wharves, used principally for up river loading, but can be used for deep-sea ships. Farther down river there is a jetty at No. 3 B. G. H. used by Ambulance Transports. Downstream of this is “ Bhoosa Pier,” a wooden landing stage- used by river steamers only.APPENDIX E. Note on dates. All the best and most fruitful date producing localities of Iraq iall into the area included in this report. I. — Locations. Date gardens border both sides of the Euphrates from a few miles upstream of Nasiriyah to the Mazliq Channel; they average a depth inland of 4—500 yards, and are mostly privately owned. Merchants and townsmen invest much of their capital in these gardens. There are large plantations on the north shores of the Hammar Lake from the Fuhud to Bani Hutait. There are considerable gardens at Chabaish and south of the Hammar Lake between the Mazliq and ’Ibadah territory. Passing down the Euphrates there are many trees at Madinah whence gardens exist almost continuously along the right bank to Qumah where there are gardens to the north of the Euphrates and on the left bank of the Tigris but more especially for 5 miles down the right bank of the Shatt al-Arab. From Nahr Umr, down the Shatt-al-Arab, to Fao is the greatest •date producing area. There are date gardens on both banks which vary in width from a few hundred yards to five miles. II. — Trade. Dates from Nasiriyah, Suq and the Hammar areas are not exported to Basrah to any great exten f as the Basrah dates, gene rally speaking, are of better quality and have the great advantage of being more handy for shipping. (The best variety of Iraq dates, however, is grown in the Suq district.) In these areas trade in dates is therefore limited to an interchange between one district and another of agricultural commodities produced in excess or deficit as the case may be. III. — Types. There are hundreds of different varieties of dates but for com mercial purposes all dates are classed as Halawi, Khadrawi, and Sair (the rest). The first is popular in America, the second and third sell well in Europe, while India and Persia are content with the third,IV. — Shipping. Dates are shipped in boxes for America and Europe and in. baskets to India and for Per ia. V. — Characteristics. Date trees live to 100 years but lose their vigour at 80. They die if they are deprived of water, and drown if flooded too much. The fertilisation which is done by human agency, is called Ligah and is carried out in April and May. Dates ripen in August but are not fit for preservation till September. One male tree is suffi cient for 50 female trees. An acre bears rather over 100 trees. Date trees are grown from offshoots or suckers, which bear fruit within five years. In Mesopotamia a date tree grown from a stone will not bear fruit, but in America a tree grown from » similar stone will do so. The exact reason of this has not as yet been definitely ascertained. VI.—Uses of the trees ana fruit. (а) The ripe fruit is one of the principal articles of food in the country. (б) “ Windfalls ” are collected and used for human or animal fodder. (c) Arak is distilled from the Zehdi dates. (d) The branches are used for fuel and as material for furniture making, building and fencing. (e) The trunks are used for bridging irrigation cuts and for house building. (/) The fruit stalks are made into brooms. (gr) The fibre is made into rope. (h) Matting is made from the leaves. VII.—Methods of Irrigation. Normally by “ lift ” or by “ flow ” but in the Basrah area the method of irrigating date trees is out of the ordinary on account of tidal action. As the tide rises the river level also rises on account of the river water being banked up several feet. The date growers take advantage of this to establish subsoil irrigation.412 . Deep “ cuts ” are dug in the land between the trees, these are connected up to the main channels which in turn are connected with the creeks, which carry the waters inland from the river. So long as these “ cuts are kept clear of silt they fill up and empty as the tide rises and falls; thus the river water permeates the subsoil CO with every change in the tide. The trees will flourish if the “ vUts are so maintained that they are empty at low tide, in order that the gardens may not remain flooded Witt this reservation the more water the trees get the better they thrive, but a tree left to grow in permanent water will die.
