JAFMRIAH SCHOOL. ihis school has been in the course of construction for over two years. It is now complete. It was built by the Government, not by contract. With the exception of iron girders, cement and imported wood all the material^ is local. It can be justly claimed that the building is one of the most handsome in Bahrain. The design was ma.de and the work was supervised by Mr. Mohammed Khalil, the Suprintendant of the Land Department, who also carries oft the duties of a Public - . v. l V Works Officer, . There are 9 class rooms which can accomodate about 250 boys, and a large central hall which^built between two wings, which if necessary would be used to hold another hundred boys. One of the offices on the north of the school is used by the Shia Wakaf Department. The school has sufficient accomodation for the present masters to live in the building. The school is built of local Murrabba Stone, plastered with Juss and whitewashed. The masons employed on it, and most of the labourers, were Persians as the few local Arab masons who exist are more expensive and do not work so well. The school is situated on the southern edge of H/ fnn« m «h town slightly east of the Fort. The Bahrani Quarter of the town is immediately north of it.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100026020540.0x000007_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/306, f 45</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100026020540.0x000007</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/306, f 45</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Photograph of Jaffariah School, Bahrain</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1931</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2015-08-05T21:15:00</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 photograph</extent></physicalDescription><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100026020540.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
