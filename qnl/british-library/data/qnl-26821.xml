This report sets out clearly and succinctly the special nature of the problem of the rehabilitation in commerce and industry of British ex-Cervictmen who will be demobilised in Lgypt. It cannot be too strongly emphasised that their lot will be very different from that of their compatriots who are demobilised in the United Kingdom where they will enjoy the fullest support of public opinion, and consequently of Parliament and the Administration, in their efforts to find suitable employment and adequate livelihood. In -gypt, on the other hand, they will find a Government of pronounced nationalistic tendency pressing the rival claims of Egyptians to the best Jobs, and they will also have to meet the competition of other foreigners in relation to whom they will be handicapped in the ways indicated in the memorandum. I hope very much that means will be found through the rehabilitation boards which you have authorised me to set up, to meet this situation in a manner which will reconcile the British community, particularly the Maltese and Cypriot elements, to the sacrifices they have been called upon to make during the war find convince them that His Majesty’s Government are concerned with their future prosperity. I must however stress the fact that such a policy may well involve considerable expenditure of public money which I hope will be forthcoming.

In civilian life they are either email employees in commerce or industry or the proprietors of small businesses mainly in the grocery trade. They are all ex-hypothesi foreigners and can therefore expect no help from the Egyptian Government by special legislation or otherwise such as can be relied upon by their compatriots who live in the United Kingdom. On leaving the Army they will be faced with the difficult problem of obtaining employment or restarting their little businesses, as the case may be, with no support financial or otherwise from the Government of this country. They will be faced with competition not only of Egyptian subjects, who will enjoy the full support of their Government which often goes to the extent of pressure on the employer, but also cf other foreigners, e. g. Greeks who will probably be demobilised at an earlier date. There is also the menace of Italian labour now mostly released from internment whose early availability coupled with their education and technical skill, which is unfortunately usually of a higher standard than that of our own non-Anglo-Saxon community, will give them a pull in the market for the posts available. 3. With the axjproval of the Foreign Office the Ambassador has decided to create an organisation consisting of Rehabilitation Boards in the main centres of European population, whose function will be to deal with individual cases and to do what they can by collation of information and personal intervention with employers to reinstate these British subjects on demobilieation in civilian occupations. For this purpose certain funds sub scribed by local bodies and individuals, including a proportion of the balance of the British War Fund, will be available, and it is hoped that the difficulties experienced by the local ex- Berviceman will he to some extent mitigated by their efforts. The task however will be a difficult one and the Ambassador considers that every tiling possible should be done officially to help. The Maltese and Cypriot communities are with good and legitimate reason very apprehensive concerning the future of their people, and it is politically most desirable that they should not be able to claim that the men who were called up on rigid principles in the national emergency were let down when they had served this purpose. 4. It has been decided that demobilisation in Egypt is to be carried out on the same principles as are to be applied in the United Kingdom after the German armistice. This will be a great disappointment to local Servicemen who had hoped that owing to their special circumstances they might be given a special priority, in the same way that in other parts of the Empire local units will be disbanded early. To meet this disappointment the Ambassador has suggested to His Majesty’s Government through the Foreign Office that the United Kingdom rules governing individual priorities should be applied here on a very generous basis and interpreted in the sense that the importance of immediate return to civilian life before the /availableavailable jobe are snapped up should be regsrded as oX £ aU&lt; ^‘V? P ° rt ? nCe arid a eround for iamedii te d ofa'dlStUsatl on. Ho official reply has yet been received to thTB^uggestion, but copies of Inter-departmental correspondence which have already been forwarded to the Ambassador from London indicate that it is unlikely to be approved. The problem of re establishment will therefore have to be faced in its most acute form* 5. A further suggestion which the Ambassador has made to London is that technical training should be given to local men prior to their demobilisation in order to give them cualifi- cation* which would enable them to compete successfully in the G £ ain£ ’t unskilled rivals. The Commander in Chief, kiddle u»&amp;st lorces, to whom this proposal has been communicated has expressed himself willing to assist as far as possible, but has pointed out that training for civilian life is not really the concern of the Army but of the Ministry of Labour. This view em P ha8is ^ B very clearly the peculiar difficulty which the Ambassador has to face, because it is precisely the absence oi any (British, Ministry of Labour machinery in hgypt that constitutes his problem. The General has promised to^ a S r ^ e w ^ 6 * * * i0 desire it a technical tnining course of four to six weeks in the subject of their choice as far as possible, and this is a valuable concession. In the case of men who have been employed during their service career in a technical capacity, such a course may well give just that extra polish and efiiciency which will give them the reouired pull over other competitors in the skilled labour market. Although 1L unable to undertake to defer demobilisation of individuals entitled to release for the purpose of this training, ?\ ovlbt . in P**a ct fce that arrangements could be made in all for them co take this short course# 6 . The object of this memorandum is not to indicate any particular solution but to set out the problem so that the CMimittee may be able to help.

BRITISH E14BASSY, ~ T Pftj' -j 3rd Marsh, 1944. Sir, I have the honour to report that in August last I decided to set up a small committee to examine and advise on the general question of the future of the British community in Egypt after the war and the various problems of post-war reconstruction. Not least amongst these problems is the re-establishment in civil life of those British subjects in Egypt who have volunteered for military service or who have been called up under the National Service (Sgypt) Order, 1942. 2 . Mr. Besly, uegal Counsellor to the Embassy, was so good as to undertake the chairmanship of the committee, of which the members were ^r. were, His Majesty’s Consul-General at Alexandria, Colonel Sir S.T. Peel, Mr. Hugh-Jones, who as director of the posting section set up under the National Service Order has a wide knowledge of the circumstances of those members of the community who have been called up for military service, and Mr. Charvet of the Shell Company of Egypt, Limited. The committee met on eight occasions and heard the views of a large number of leading members of the community. Mr. Besly recently submitted to me the committee’s final Report, the views and recommenda tions in which were unanimously agreed by all the members; and in so doing he has recorded their warm appreciation of the work of Miss Broza who acted as Secretary to the committee. The Report, on which I feel sure you will agree that all concerned in its compilation deserve the warmest congratulations and thanks, has been fully considered by my staff and myself; and I now have the honour to trans mit to you a copy with the following observations, for the consideration of His Majesty’s Government, 4 , to deal first with Section A of the Report, concerning the re-c shment in civil life of local men and women who have joined His Majesty’s Forces, assume it tG be beyond dispute that there is an obliga tion to assist the local servicemen and servicewomen, 'both volunteers and those conscripted under the National Service The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.p. etc. , etc. , etc. , FOREIGN OFFICE. P-L tiPT. 1 5 JUN 10^^ **£)IA OFFICE t■&amp; CJf k Service Order,, and that the responsibility in this respect must fall largely on His Majesty’s Government. And I submit that there is no reason for treating local British subjects less favourably in this connexion than those who have been called up in the United Kingdom, in so far as it ie possible to avoid discrimination in the ’different conditions prevailing in Egypt. The problem surely transcends that of extending at the cost of the British taxpayer peacetime benefits to British subjects abroad who for the moso part are not taxpayers in the United Kingdomo His Majesty’s Government found it necessary in the war interest to conscript British subjects in Egypt for military service regardless of the measure of personal sacrifice involved; and I trust that it will be accepted that they should participate, yn so far as may be possible, in such measures of social security as will be provided for their compatriots at home. Apart from the moral claim of those who have been called up in Egypt, the material contribution of the British Community in Egypt has not been inccnsidt f ab le; they have given generously not only of their personal services but also of their wealth, in taxation and savings. In addition to the monies accruing to His Majesty’s uovemment in the shape of Probate Fees, referred to in the report, I am advised that British firms have paid several millions to the United Kingdom Exchequer in income tax and exceefi profits duty. * 5. I consider that the proposal in Section A of the Report to establish ’’rehabilitation boards' is eminently sound and I feel that these boards should be given wide discretion to advise upon the measures necessary to meet the local problem. It is also clearly desirable that demobilisation should be carefully controlled and be 0 radually carried out on the lines indicated in the Report; and I suggest that this should be impressed upon the British military authorities. I fully appreciate the practical difficulty of granting financial help by way of unemployment benefits as dis tinct from rehabilitation as local employers and employees are not contributors to the United Kingdom fund. But rehabilitation and relief are closely related, and the devising of ways and means of bringing local grants into line with those at home should not be beyond the realms of actuarial possibility I think it will be valuable to have ***&lt; ' advisers ^ iehabilitation Embassy, m the same way as was Mr. purpose of establishing the National When the one or more attached to Collett, Service tion in Egypt* I do not propose to comment detailed proposals contained in Section A of say that they time comes expert this for the organisa- now on the the Report; I wish merely to say that they are the outcome of much thought on the part of men who are well qualified to judge of loca] conditions and the measures necessary to£ 4 /£-, *1 ^V^&lt; negative measures* The Coiumercial Counsellor is actively discussing with the British Chamber of ommerce of -^gypt and also with the department of Overseas Trade, tactics for the post-war British -i ^ ?u ive whlcl1 is ri advocated in paragraph 16 of the Report; . and I agree that the vital question of f Rri^oh ng rlghts of Residence for the British elements ^ ^fi tlSh 1 com lJ l ® rcl 2 l f irms in %ypt, which is discussed in paragraphs 17 and 21 of the Report, must be tackled at an early date* I should welcome your views on the compromise interpretation' of the clause in the Montreux Declaration guaranteeing rights of residence to British subjects who have resided in Egypt for at nf a +id f k Ve y ? ars ’ whi ? h i3 Su crcested in paragraph 17 r ?fd h Ke P° r p In addition to the settlement of the anrt thf\° e 0 f. 0 P lnion between His itejesty’s Government ana tne Egyptian Government as to the meaning of this ^clause, it is clearly of great importance that British b firms in cgypt should be enabled not only to maintain nnoa'ii-. i T ' &lt;3 ' ' ' 5; -“b- staffs and to make the fullest avff^df u ? e suitable British subjects who may be are essen 1 -’ 31 % y th D ' ;lt alS a t0 bring in such others as to h^ h 1 * H? elr neede - In this connexion it is men b in average age of British business men in Egypt is high; many are on the verge of retire- ent.«%d% I f &gt; as is to be hoped, British commercial enterprise is to be maintained and intensified after the war, it can only be by the infusion of new blood. Another point which is of importance is that British at n the C nre 3 e%% 0Ul % be ade ^ uatel y represented here; at the present time tnere are all too few British agency firms, with the result that most British and U f%%%% rS -, ar,e re Presented by non-British firms a ^ d ■&gt;individuals wr.ose past records are not always fn^etic Br?M SUrely b6 t0 induce and nergetic British subjeccs to come to Egypt for this purpose; but this will not be possible ^slbg as the present uncertain conditions as regards residence andffnf^TT- P he B Wstions in paragraphs 20 f th f i 1 ieport &gt; regard to the conclusion a Commercial or Establishment Treaty with Egypt, seem to me worthy of particular attention.

I should myself aoubt whether the transference ofof any large portion of these comniunlties to some part Of the British Empire in a practicable proposal; and failing that I agree that everything possible should be done to assist the members, of these communities, not only in finding suitable employment here but also in raising their standard of living and their general social and educational level. Not only have Cypriots and Maltese, like other British subjects, been called up in Bgypt for national service, but leading members of both communities have played their part on the Boards and Committees set up under the National Service Order. If these communities are to remain in Egypt, it is surely incumbent upon us to do all we can to make them worthy members of the British Commonwealth. Th e remov al of the talians from Egypt would no doubt help towards finding &gt;&lt;• C'q ..... C ^ ' ^employment for Maltese and Cypriots, who are likely to experience the greatest difficulties in this respect owing S n the part of S syptia^s and the large foreign ommunities m Egypt; but the arguments against encouraging the Egyptian Government to institute measures against any foreign community are very strong. It is a catching habit, ^ ^ u The paragraphs of the Report which deal with ‘^ 1 1 ^ sh oultura l activities (29 and 30) speak for them- ^ selves; and we are not likely to have a better opportunity for developing these activities which can play so ptal a part in maintaining our position in Egypt and which were so sadly neglected before the war. nr t tl?f t D that i the , ? Uggestions P ut ^orward in this portion Report will receive earnest and s/mpathetic consideration.

The proposal to establish a 'British House' in Cairo (paragraph 33 of the ^eport) has obvious attractions, the.more so as it was recently reported that the Americans are also contemplating something of the kind. Considerable capital would be reouired, and it seems improbable that the scheme could be realised without assistance from His Majesty’s Government* TheThe matter is under active examination here and will l b fhi^ ?+ bJe a'' ° f a ®? 60131 report in due course. ^ un f? sl rable that the headquarters of the British Council should be situated in the 'British House' i 5 ' v share the views expressrd in paragraph 34 of the Report regarding the importance ing n representat:lve c o r ™unity Councils This lU 8 lon 13 a ls o being actively examined here. iwl n o .

C*+&gt; WT /&gt; rtU c\ J The Droblem of foreseeing the difficulties which will face the British Community in 3gypt after the war, and of suggesting as far as may be the best available means of meeting and overcoming them, presents itself in two aspects. First there is the problem of the I ’ ee ? tablishnr ' e !?^ t ^; n u nteel . s life of the local servicemen and servicewomen, both volunteers and those conscripted under the National Service Srder m Council This will be an immediate necessity in itseli, ana also an'essential preliminary to any satisfactory solution of the°second and more general problem of the f^re welfare of the Community as a whole, which it is the mam 03 ^ bl Report to consider. It is however quite a separate proble , and the Reportis therefore divided into two sections dealing respectively with these two aspects. Section A . Reestablishment of local servicemen ja ndservicewomen• 1 . This problem has already formed the subject of severe’ negotiations with the Egyptian Government and others as the result of which certain safeguards and guarantees have been obtained. The promise that members of the British Forces will not be demobilised in Egypt has been clearly defined as not applying to persons mobilised here, so that it is open to the British military Authorities to demobilise here all the local servicemen and servicewomen, thus restoring them to the^status which they held at the time they joined the services. The Prime Minister has undertaken that the Egyptian Government will take no measures calculated to prevent British mobilised personnel from resuming their civil employment on demobilisation; and the Egyptian Government has gone so far as to give a lead to private employers by issuing a circular by which all foreigners in the service of the Government have their posts reserved tor them if taken up again within two months of their discharge rom military service. /* 2, It has also been possible to obtain through the British Chambers of Commerce prorr.jses from a number of British that they will re-engage their British personnel on demobilisation. The Egyptian Government has further promised that in cases where British tradesmen, such as grocers and Bar or Restaurant keepers, have had to give up their rokhas (permits) on being called up, ^^ they will make no objection to the re-issue of such rokhO^ on ^(S demobilisation. The recommendations in this section of the Report are made to supplement what has already been done. 3, The first recommendation is that rehabilitation Boards should be set up to deal with individual cases, and act as the ''wnajigi m »r wmm.IS ~ r.i!pr r »o.r« JOJ SSSUy voluntary basis. It is now.ever regaiuc o h ould be rnade for a p^sent wi.h the f-Power Boards, P-vision^ahoul ^ the three P aid .® t ^ f A a !;f* Alexandria and the Canal Area. .Moreover in oruer- ?o a avoid n aS hiatus between the beginning of demobilisation and /L&lt;J^C. the first functioning of the Boards it is the —■ iss;s;.?^r£p;r National Service Secretariat which will collate aii f s ,“;r^s«r=nrs;n»“«rf t \: 1 K»s r S£»«*s* they T. r. a »ir.a, «h,.e e.rde • UM.e^.e^ t r.S'r^-h.thiTeSs.f in Sgypt, and of all volunteers resident in -Lgypt vvho British nationality. *2 &lt;^ 0 -^ (f(r&amp;o 4. It is considered most important that de ' 0 ' 3 ?'J;?;®?i}°g T * e should be carefully controlled by the ilitated if ft is'carried'out'gradually oft he principle that persons with jobs to go to are demobilised first, and the ^hers as employment^ ^ becomes available. This precaution is P? rt ^ularly ^ Egypt, where there is certain to be highly 'S emplov- market owing to the slump in s gyP tla ? ® nd °!' h ®£ f?H e f Troops'' and ment which will follow the sudden w ithdrawal of Administrative Establishments, as a cor3d ^ y 0 ^g ? 0 L to and recommended that persons who have no immediate jo s ® . who^cannot be placed by the Rehabilitation Boards or otherwise should be retained in the services for a perio mllitarv training in such depSts, workshops or other ec wi ght usefully establishments as may be maintained. The train K | of include in the case of Maltese and Cypriots the lear g English* 5. The Committee feel most strongly that, as far as is possible in the different conditions prevailing in •'should be urged to grant to locally recruited the same benefits, and to assume towards them the same responsibilities demobilisation as they do in the case of personnel recruited in the United Kingdom. In this respect po difference should be made between volunteers and conscripted persons and no distinctions introduced on the grounds of nationality. Service in the British Forces should be the sole criterion. 6. It is recognised however that it will be impossible for HMG to do for servicemen and servicewomen in ^gypt all that can be done at home. It can hardly be expected that any Social security scheme introduced in the United Kingdom ^ could be extended to Egypt, and the existing Unemployment Benefits being on a contributary basis will obviously not oe available here, moreover no large schemes of Public ^orks can be inaugurated by HMG in Egypt for the purpose of crea ing work for British subjects. It is therefore recommended that the Rehabilitation Boards should be authorised to consider and/ A ^&lt;52. 't' fcc&lt; yp ,'^L-r^ -a IS K( ^ and prepare schemes for rehabilitation of demobilised personnel in civil life within the limitations implicit in the position of the British Community in a foreign independent country. For this purpose it would be essential that the Boards should be able to call on HMG for the necessary financial backing for any scheme which is approved, and the Committee recommend that the acceptance in principle of this liability ^ should be obtained in advance. The question of the procedure and the channel through which any such scheme is to receive the approval of HMG must also be considered in advance,, 7, It is considered that any such rehabilitation schemes which the Boards may be authorised to apply should be confined to (l) persons conscripted in Sgypt under the National Service Order in Council, whether they are able to establish a claim to British nationality or not, (2) persons who volunteered in Egypt and who are in law British subjects, and (3) British subjects who though not normally resident in Egypt might, through marriage to local girls or otherwise, be demobilised here in exceptional circumstances, Vhereas benefits such as those referred to in paragraph 5 above should accrue alike to all persons who have served in the British Forces ipso facto, it seems right that the Boards should not be called upon to concern themselves with the re.stablishment of foreigners who have volunteered for service. It is further recommended that while such schemes should envisage mainly persons who before demobilisation did not hold commissioned rank, powers should be given to the Boards to include therein ex-officers who are genuinely in need of assistance. 8 , As one concrete suggestion it is recommended that consideration should be given to the possibility of continuing to pay the family and family ration allowances of other ranks for a period of 3 or even 6 months after demobilisation in the event of actual unemployment established to the satisfaction of the Boards. 9, While recognising, as stated above, that it is not possible to apply generally in Egypt the Statutory provisions ^ r / r ^ existing in the United Kingdom for Unemployment Relief, the /V r . Committee suggest for consideration whether it would not be j'r ls-r possible in the case of demobilised personnel to institute for a limited period a modified systdm of unemployment benefits to tide them over the period of re-settlement. It is understood that H.M, Treasury have in the past on more than one occasion refused.£n principle to sanction the application of the proceeds of local taxation in the shape of Probate Fees to the relief of distress among British subjects in Egypt, but in justification of such an ex^ 0 ^imeasure as is proposed in this paragraph it can be urged that the British Community does in fact pay taxes in this way which are always substantial and have amounted in two recent years to as much as £80,000 and £ 100 , 000 . 10, The Committee consider that, in the light of experience of what happened after the last war, there are certain to be cases of recrudescence of injuries and ill ness directly resulting from war service after the person in question has been discharged to civil life apparently fit. In some cases the injury or illness may not even be come apparent until such time. They feel that such persons should/17 should be assurer of free hospital treatment on the principles postulated in paragraph 5 of this Report, subject course to satisfactory proof of the origin of their dis ability. This treatment will probably have to be given in British civilian hospitals, so that it would be necessary to make some arrangement whereby the cost would be claimed by them from HmG 0 (fypYrS fr) / 11. There is one particular class of British subjects in Egypt who have been called up for service with the Forces for whom the Committee are strongly of opinion that special provision should be made, namely the small tradesman, mainly grocers. These men are mainly Cypriots, and the Community of British Cypriots have consistently opposed their calling up on the grounds of hardship. There was in many cases a considerable amount of justification for this plea, because it was not found possible to find other members of the family capable or reliable enough to carry on the business for the conscripted man, and he found himself in consequence under the necessity of liquidating his stock at an undervalue, and risking the loss of the goodwill of his business which had often taken him a number of years to build, up. In cases in which postponement ^ on the grounds of exceptional, hardship was refused, the National Service Committees acted on the principle that mere financial loss, being reparable, was not a sufficiently cogent consideration. The Committee however feel that it is a necessary corollary of this policy that the financial loss which they have in curred should be made good. It has already been agreed with the Egyptian Government, as mentioned above, that they shall receive their rokhsas again on demobilisation, but what they will require is a lump sum of money to enable them to re-stock and re-start their shops. It is therefDre recommended that they should be granted through the Boards the necessary capital sums in the form of a recoverable advance bearing a low rate of interest. It is further suggested that in the event of the existence in Egypt at the end of the war of surplus stocks of suitable commodities in the hands of the U.K.C.C. or the Military Authorities, priority should be given to this category of demobilised small tradesman in disposing of them to the retail trade. 12. It is recommended that HMG should be asked to provide the necessary t’-'v^dci fcr the schemes outlined above and for any other schemes that may be proposed by the Rehabilitation Boards, if approved. It is not considered that the local Welfare Funds should be used for this purpose. It has already been decided that a large proportion of the balance of the British War Fund (which is by far the ^ost important of such Funds) is to be paid over to the Trustee Corporation for British Charities in Egypt to be administered by a strong body of Managing Trustees for the general purposes of post«-war welfare of the British Community, and particularly ex-service men and women and their dependents. But it is emphasised that this fund is intended to be supplementary and to be kept for meeting the hard cases which are certain to arise in spite of all the efforts of the Rehabilitation Boards, The scope of the additional help that can be given in this way must of course depend on the funds available, which it is not now possible to estimate, but it is considered that in addition to the eventual balance of the British war Fund it is desirable that any balances remaining/fj CL remaining in the hands of the Controllers of other independ ent Welfare organisations should be paid eventually to the Trustee Corporation to be administered by the Managing Trustees in the same manner,, Sec tion B, Ge nera 1 position o f the Brit ish Comm unity after the var. 13. In spite of the assurances that have recently been given in public announcements by the Prime Minister and other members of the Government that the presence of foreigners in Sgypt is welcomed and that there is no intention of taking any action against them, it appears certain that the present tendency towards extreme nationalism and xenophobia will be maintained and aggravated after the special war conditions have disappeared. The primary cause of this will be the unemployment problem which is bound to be acute among the Egyptian town population after the closing down of the British and American military establishments which have provided employment on such a large and lavish scale, /hereas many of these Egyptian civilian employees are of the labouring class and may eventually be re absorbed into agriculture, there v/ill remain a great number of technical and semi-skilled employees who will remain in the towns and crowd the labour market there. They will be thrown into direct competition with the lower (and far the larger) class of foreigners, including Maltese and British Cypriots, and it seems inevitable that any Egyptian Government will be tempted on political grounds to support them against foreign candidates for whatever work may be available. There are signs too that Egypt is seriously contemplating the encouragement of industrial undertakings of a purely Egyptian character, such as is already evident in the Banque i\ isr satellite companies. The development of such a policy must react against the security of existing foreign undertakings and even more against the establishment of new foreign, including British, enterprises in Egypt. In these circumstances it is considered that it is essential to take stock of the position of the British Community as it now stands, and to suggest ways and means by which it can best be safeguarded and improved in the future. This position, apart from any special goodwill that may be held to exist by reason of the Treaty of Alliance or the continued presence - and past achievement of British officials in the service oi Government, will be the same generally as that of other foreigners who previously enjoyed Capitulatory privileges, but this Report will confine itself to the case of British subjects. 14. The post-war prospect must be considered in respect of two periodsc. During the earlier of them, up to October 1949, the position of British subjects will still be safe guarded by the provisions of the iv.ontreux Convention. Thus they will still be justiciable' by the Mixed Courts: they will still enjoy the guarantees against expulsion and refusal of permission to re-enter, if they have the requisite residential qualifications: they will still be able to refer in matters of personal status to the Consular Court, unless it is decided by HMG at an earlier date to surrender this juris diction: they will still enjoy, as a legal right under -article 2 /2 of the Convention, protection against discriminatory legislation, and the numerous scheduled Institutions of an ^Educational, Medical or Charitable character will remain free to carry out their activities and maintain their staffs under the terms of the letters exchanged on 8th May, 1937, After 1949, however, these advantages which were strictly limited to the transition period will disappear. The only shreds of the concessions given at toontreux that will remain are the declaration that the limitation to this period of the under- taking not to discriminate against foreigners does not connote any intention of doing so when the period ends: the rather in tangible assert! n that in applying lav/s to foreigners the Egyptian Government's policy will not be incompatible with the generally adopted principles of modern legislation: and the suggestion in the exchange of letters above referred to that the privileges accorded for the transition period to scheduled Institutions might be extended by the conclusion of a subsequent agreement with, in the ease of British Institutions, HMG, 15, The recommendations in this Section of the Report are all made with a view to early action, during the former of the above periodSo It ’would be un-vise to wait until the later period when the urgency would be even greater but the possibility of carrying them out would probably be much lessened. In fact in many casec the suggested action, if it is to be effective, should be taken now with the Egyptian Government, in order that it may not be found when the war comes to an end that British interests have already been allowed to slip. The Committee have considered the possibility of eventual recourse to commercial retaliatory measures in the event of the Egyptian Government adopting an attitude frankly hostile to the maintenance and development of British trade. They recognise that this is a weapon that should not be lightly used as it might well be found, if wrongly em ployed, to aggravate rather than relieve the position, particular, during the war it would be impossible to apply many otherwise available measures of commercial pressure without injuring the economy of Egypt to the detriment of the war effort. Neverthele 1 it is suggested that all possible methods of applying such pressure should be studied now with a view to their application at some future date if it should become necessary and desirable to do so. It is hoped that even then the threat of application might be sufficient. 16, The most obvious method by which the British yt,,«vCommunity (which will then be predominantly commercial and &gt; not, as in previous times, conspicuously official) can be helped is by the encouragement of British trade in Egypt, For a grade drive should be organised and supported Uni tpa h «-i° b ^ e0t ™ kln S Egyptians buy their goods from the United Aingdom and the Dominions, thus increasing the a£ents U of Brfti'T J 0cally established British tradesmen and ', n? n tS f Brltlsh f irms. It is known that the British Chambers tL'npnn r ? e a f® ? tr ; on Sly urging such a post-war drive through !T nt ° f ? verseas Trade, and that this proposal is the Briti^h e r i£ 0nSiderat i° n by the Commercial Secretariats of in%eneral h tenmr S1 n S t and Tf gations in Nea r Eastern Countries, in general terms. But m the case of Egypt it is considered that a special opportunity is offered by the Treaty The / Alliance/O' alliance at present is on an essenticSV polit ical basis, and as such it is at. time s cr it icised by Sgyptians as burdensome and even inconsistent with their independence and Sovereignty, It is however recognised as a reality and it certainly has the effect putting the British Empire on a footing quite above that of an;y other foreign nation,, If after the war this Alliance could be not so much superseded by, as developed into a close commercial bond, the danger of foreign competition would be to a great extent eliminated, and a flourishing Anglo-Egyptian trade could created to the mutual benefit of both countries# be V ihe firsc essential condition for any such trade drive is that British^ subjects should be secure in their rights to reside in -»gypt, Their position is at present regulated by the terms of the jviontreux Declaration which guarantees the right to remain in -'F’ypt to all British subjects who have resided there for at least five years 0 Unfortunately the meaning of this con- cession is uncertain. The view of the Egyptian Government is that the guarantee is restricted to those who on the date of tne signing of the iviontreux Convention, i,e, in 1937, were residing in agypt and had continuously resided there for the last five years# This view was communicated to the interested Powers by the Egyptian Government at the end of 1939, HMG do not accept this interpretation, and as long ago as early in 1940 protested against the restricted meaning on which the Egyptian Government proposed to act, claiming that five years residence in Egypt prior to the date at which the question of the right to remain in or to re-enter Egypt arose, was the necessary qualification, This difference of interpretation has never been solved, and in consequence many British subjects are nuite uncertain where they stand, and fear that after the war may be impossible to prevent the Egyptian Administration from acting on the narrower meaning and turning them out. It is re commended therefore that this point should be cleared up now, &gt;tt the same time it is pointed out that it would now be inadvisable m°n PreSS f ° r an in ' ter P re tation as wide as that put forward by 1 * were to be established that the five years is to be calculated from the date when the question arises in any case ? Egyptian Government would probably, and even justifiably, be unwilling to renew a -residential visa for a fo^flaibnf'hU after has resided four years in the country, allowed to remain*in Kpt'forYfmryea^ “tTiTs*' 11 18 name ly°t hat 'in U nter ^®tiorshouL be Af!me^ they should be regarded as havinfouaU??^*?* ln Sgypt ln 1937 they had then eomifletpri ng qua;L;Lfled the concession if breaks for leave or busines^ o^wr 81 ^^ 6 to normal vear&lt;?

It is further important to remember that there are in Egypt many firms which though not technically, or some times even entirely, British in character, yet are practically British both in their compositiDn and in their furtherance of trade in British goods. Firms of this class too will only be able to continue their important work subject to the same con ditions of maintaining the replacing their British staff. The attitude of successive Egyptian Governments of recent years has, however, shown a strong tendency to place all possible obstacles in the way of such replacements, and to compel firms to eliminate even their existing British staff in order to make room for Egyptians. This is a problem that must be faced and overcome if the anticipated trade drive is to be successful* 19. The Committee recognise that the Egyptian Government is entitled, and indeed bound, to take all legitimate and useful measures to solve its own unemployment problems, particularly among the category of its subjects that can be classified as 'labour'. They do not feel however that such a policy is furthered by legislation the object of which is to discourage or interfere with commercial enterprises which by their presence in Egypt actually create the very employment which is required, a recent example of the mutual benefit derived from the establishment in Egypt of a British industrial plant is provided by the Beda Dyers factory, which gives employment to many thousands of Egyptians. Further examples of longer standing are luarboni’s and the Anglo-Egyptian Oilfields. It is therefore suggested that efforts should be made to persuade the Egyptian Government, in their own interests as well as in those of the British Community and British Trade, to adopt a policy under which British firms should be given the necessary safeguards with regard to their British personnel. In order to avoid any proposition that from its vagueness might appear to the Egyptian Government to be a return to the old system of Capitulations, it is suggested that these safeguards should be limited and defined, and that in the case alike of British firms or companies, and of Societes Anonymes Egyptiennes which are largely or to a substantial degree British in capital or in character, the objective should be to have them authorised to retain in Egypt, or in the case of new enterprises to intro duce and retain in Egypt their essential British administrative and technical staffs, and to maintain them by adequate replace- ments from the United Kingdom or the Dominions, In deciding what elements in each staff are covered by this definition the criterion should be whether or not the persons concerned could be classified as 'labour'. ) ,■ 20 ‘ The Committee gave much thought to the question how best assurances might be obtained frcm the Egyptian Government, and in na t»+. i r»rH or» o-i ^ . * . . ~ ° me xtin government, ant in particular considered whether some such provision could be introduced into a Commercial or Establishment Treaty, They ? p ^ eci ? ted that the signing of such a Treaty was a question of nigh policy on which they were not competent to advise, but having regard to the clear indication in the Montreux Exchange 2 f + v^ terS t 5 at the Possibility of such a Treaty was contemplated - both by the Egyptian Government and by HMG, they felt -Oy.y A ^justified in examining the possibility of the inclusion therein of some such clause. Prima facie it seems clear • that/ */•■that this would be the ideal solution from two points of view. First because as part of a general trading agreement it would be ^ore easy to get the assent of the iSgyptian Government than if it were presented as a demand for a special eoncession. Secondly because as a clause of a Treaty it would have permanent and indisputable validity. Dn the other hand it is realised that the application of the M.F.N, principle would have the effect of giving to all other nations making Treaties with Egypt a similar advantage. Apart from the fact that no special advantage would therefore accrue to British Trade from such a clause in a Commercial or Establishment Treaty, it seems clear that the Egyptian Government would be / }v/'..wthe less ready to give such a concession to HMG if they knew that it would enure to the advantage of many other nations too. 21. To overcome the difficulty above referred to it is suggested that the concession might be asked for, either in a Treaty or by some other binding agreement between HMG and the Egyptian Government on the basis of reciprocity. It is under stood that under the regulations in force before the war in 0 the United Kingdom, whereas the general rule was that all aliens entering the United Kingdom foi* the purpose of taking up employ- ument must hold a permit from the Ministry of Labour, there were a considerable number of exceptions, particularly in the follow ing cases: (i) Aliens intending to enter into partnerships; (ii) Qualified agents of firms established outside the United Kingdom; (iii) Direct representatives of a foreign firm who would continue to be paid and controlled from abroad by that firm; and (iv) Aliens coming to be employed for liaison work in a branch or selling establishment in the United Kingdom by a foreign firm, and paid and controlled by the parent house and not by the branch or selling agency in the United Kingdom, Reciprocal concessions on these lines would go some way to meet the requirements of British establishments in Egypt, as far as the administrative staffs are concerned. It is not known how far, if at all, it will be possible to extend such general exceptions in the United Kingdom to cover technicians who cannot be engaged locally, whereas in the case of the United Kingdom and Egypt the result of such a reciprocal agreement would act almost entirely in favour of the British technician desiring to enter Egypt, it is appreciated that in the case of other countries this would not be the case. If it is not found possible to cover such persons and the other administrative staff not already covered in classes (i) - (iv) above by an extension of the general exceptions, perhaps a special agreement could be come to v/ith the Egyptian Government also on a reciprocal basis whereby the respective Ministers of Labour undertake to grant the necessary permits, 22. As an alternative or subsidiary method of obtaining the right/right for a liriiea number of British subjects to be allowed to enter Egypt y the Committee also considered the possibility of establishing a system of quotas, based on the number of British subjects resident in Egypt. In this connection the American legislation was studied, but it was found hardly to be applicable to the problem in Egypt, where there is in reality no question of immigration of British subjects for the purpose of permanent residence and establishment at all. In consequence the rules applied by the United States to fix the quotas and allot the permits do not appear to be appropriate here. On the other hand it might well be useful to refer the Egyptian Government to the realisitc and generous attitude adopted by the United States Government towards the legitimate desire of foreigners to enter the United States and in particular to the fact that it is only immigrants properly so called that are subjected to quota limitation, which is expressly stated not to be applic able to aliens entitled to enter the United States solely to carry on trade between the United States and the foreign States of which they are nationals under and in pursuance of the pro visions of a Treaty of Ccmmerce, together with their wives and infant children c Similarly it could be pointed out that the quota does not apply to the entry into the United States of Ministers of Religion and professors of schools or colleges. 23. The question of maintaining the efficiency of British business undertakings in Egypt and the introduction of new enterprises is, however, only one element in the paramount obligation which will arise after the war of securing for the British Community in Egypt full employment and thereby the means of obtaining an adequate livelihood, This obligation is particularly imperative in the case of that class which can be regarded as 'labour'’, but it is just in the case of this class that the main difficulties are certain to be encountered, owing to the competition of Egyptian and, to a lesser degree, other foreign labour. By far the largest percentage of British labour in Egypt is composed of persons of Maltese and Cypriot origin, and it is their future which presents at once the most insistent and the most difficult problem. 24, It is considered that both as one practical method of meeting the situation, and as an example to other employers, the greatest consideration should be given by all British and British controlled firms to the claims of Maltese and Cypriots to be employed by them in preference to other non-Egyptians, In particular everything possible should be done by them to find jobs for such of these communities as during the war have been employed by the Forces in a civilian capacity and have thereby fallen out of ordinary civil employment. It is considered that all firms trading with the United Kingdom should be called upon to cooperate in this, and especially all members of the British Chambers of Commerce. In order to facilitate their collaboration it is proposed to supply British Chambers of Commerce with the information now being collated by the National Service Organisation for the use of the Rehabilitation Boards as reported in paragraph 3 of this Report, 25, In spite of the difficulties of a political nature that are Known ^ l r i e 4 ' , the Coruiiiit *: ee feci bcnnd to recommend in/in the interests of the British Community that, having regard to the inevitable congestion of the labour market after the war and •^the consequent difficulties that will be experienced by British subjects, particularly Maltese and Cypriots, in obtaining employ ment in competition with Sgyptians, the possibility should be considered very seriously of eliminating as large a number of Italians as possible. The Italian labourers and technicians in ' ? 'C Egyp* are serious and often successful competitors for employment, not only with the Maltese and Cypriots of the same class, but also with the Greeks, and there is a strong feeling that, in the very restricted field of demand for non-Egyptian skilled or semi skilled workers which will persist, no consideration should be &lt;v given by the Egyptian Government to the claims of persons who have so abused the hospitality offered to them by Egypt as to have organised and planned for her conquest. It is appreciated that in the present circumstances, when the pontreux undertaking cannot be disregarded even in the case of Italians, compulsory repatriation could not be encouraged or even countenanced without endangering the validity of the Montreux Convention as a whole. But in the Settlement that will follow the termin ation of hostilities it might perhaps be found possible to meet this urgent demand of the British and other Allied Communities in this respect. 'A 2 £ 26. It is realised however that in spite of all that can be done in the way of stimulating the employment of British subjects, there will still remain a large number of them who are unable or unfit to find work, or to maintain themselves and their families in a way that will do credit to their race. There were before the war and, in spite of the ephemeral war time prosperity, still are a number of these British subjects whose standard of living and general social and educational level is so low that they have almost, if not quite, become indistinguishable from the Egyptian proletariat, post-war conditions are bound to tend to aggravate this situation, and although it is recommended in the Report that various measures //i /should be taken to assist and encourage the development of this submerged element of the community, it is regarded as important ^that serious consideration should be given to the possibility of transferring a substantial part of the Maltese and Cypriot work ing class to some part of the British Empire where their standard of living could be raised, and their numbers would accrue to the benefit of the Empire instead of being absorbed, as they so Rapidly are, into the local population. It is the considered opinion of the Committee that our long tail does not strengthen our position in Egypt either politically or commercially. On the other hand it is regarded as most important that there should be no legitimate grounds for any suggestion that they are being turned out of Egypt against their will at the instance of HMG, It is therefore emphasised that in formulating any such scheme the greatest care should be taken not to injure the feelings of these loyal communities, and that their leaders should be fully informed of anything that is proposed. The recommendation of the Committee can perhaps best be expressed as a plea that if any scheme is organised by HMG for the voluntary and subsidieed transfer of British subjects to parts of the Empire offering better opportunities of a useful and prosperous life, the case of the British subject in Egypt should not be overlooked. If this recommendation is accepted it would be useful to extend the records now being compiled for ex-service men and women to cover all other persons registered under the National Service Order in Council, so as to form a basis/basis for selecting potential emigrants in the light of the classified requirements of territories willing to accept them, 27. The Committee regard it as important that the British Community should be brought to a proper understanding of the changed conditions under which they are now living in Egypt in consequence of the political changes introduced by the Treaty and the abolition of the Capitulations, and should realise that if they are to have a stable and guaranteed position, still more as it is hoped a special and (de facto) privileged position, in Egypt in the future, they must offer something in return. There are several ways in which this should be possible, both commercially and culturally. v Cw /Lc r r SI t _ 28. Commercially the policy behind the immediate-post-war trade drive should be to concentrate on the priority and on the quality of supply - to get goods here first and to get first-class goods. It is considered that the control of shipping could be used effectively as long as it is maintained to further this policy, and that preparations should be made before the war ends so that at least token shipments of goods suitable to the needs of the Egyptian market may be made at the earliest possible moment when shipping space becomes available. It is of great importance that well-known brands of British and Dominion goods should re-appear in the local shops in order to counter act the effect of their disappearance during the last few years and the habit which has thereby been fostered in the consuming public of using similar goods of other, especially American, origin. It ^ight well be that the course of the war will be such that lust as in the past the United States manufacturer has been able to maintain supplies of goods for the civil market longer than the United Kingdom manufacturer, so the United Kingdom manufacturer may be able to return to the production of these goods earlier than his competitor in the United States. It is considered that any opportunity so presented to restore the pre-war balance in the Egyptian trade of the United Kingdom and the United States should not be neglected, and that there are good ethical grounds for seizing it. The strength of our hand will, it is emphasised, lie in our control of shipping, which is bound to result in the dependence of the Egyptian consumer on ou:. goodwill for the supply of the goods which he requires, and for which the abundance of money which we have poured into the country has created an enormous demand. The control of nitrate shipments has already proved this to the Egyptian Government and to Egyptian business men, and has also indicated to us the bargaining value of such an asset. 29. At the same time every effort should be made to spread British culture in Egypt, and to encourage and extend the efforts which are so successfully being ^ade by the British Council to th. end both directly and through their interest in the British element in the Egyptian Ministry of Public Instruction, The presence of Mr. Reed at the head of the Egyptian Branch of the Council is a guarantee that its work will have the sympathy of an important and influential element among Egyptians, and an opportunity is thereby presented of strengthening the social and cultural ties between the two countries which have already been considerably increased by the amenities of the Anglo- Sgyptian Union, In particular attention should be given to all activities likely to spread the use of the English language, which is regarded as of paramount importance in the furtherance of British trade. It might even be possible to persuade the Egyptian/Egyptian G-OTernment to provide further teaching of English not only, as at present, in Secondary Schools and Universities, ouc also to some'extent in Primary Schools, At any rate efforts should he made to ensure that in future all British suooec'os kshbuld receive instruction in English, both as an example go^ Egyptians and also to put an end to the anomaly,, no\. r apparent in cases coming before the Consular Courc, tnat a negligible percentage of Maltese and Cypriots have any knowledge yhatsoever of what should bo at loast their second tongue. For this purpose the existing British schools should continue to receive all possible support and help from the British Council, particularly in respect of the recruitment of their staffs and, ^'.men necessary, by means of subsidies. In addition io migmt be possible to create new Schools to cope with che demand i^ struction in the English language among the children of tne poorer elements of the Maltese and Cypriot communities. The Committee understand that a project is on foot for tne xormacion of a Foreign Teaching Service which would include all Bricisn subjects who take teaching appointments abroad and which would provide uniform conditions of pay# promotion^anu pensions xor its members. It is further understood that it is in'cendecy co^ transfer into this Service, when created, the present British officials of the Ministry of Public Instruction and any o'eners who may be appointed to replace them without incerxering^ jICl their contracts with the Egyptian Government, although cney would have the right to any additional benefits under tne new British scheme. The Committee consider that this spheme is of the greatest importance in ameliorating the condicions of service of the future members of this class of Bricisn ^ officials in Egypt and express the hope that it may be rapidly .ntroduced. 30. As a means of giving more direct and immediate help to British trade it is recommended that the British Council migho with advantage direct their attentions now^ano. immeciio-bely after the war towards the technical education of Egypcian students on British lines. It is regarded as axiomaticythat it Egyptian engineering students are given opportunities ox lept* - in^ their trades from British instructors using British machines, they will thereafter tend to use in their businesses ohe Brioioh machines with which they have become familiar to the exclusion of foreign machines. In the past many of tnem have received their technical and engineering training and experience on^oha Continent, and have naturally gravitated to these marxets ior their mechanical requirements. As a practical proposition ic i suggested that the possibility should be seriously examined of establishing a British Technical Commercial College m Egypt xor the training of young Egyptians. The buildings of the Italian School at Alexandria might he adapted very well oo mis purpose, .md it might well he possible to purchase this property xrom oh*. Egyptian Government when the Military Authorities relinquisn 1 at the end of the war. It is at present leased to them ^ ^ Sequestrator, and if, under the Treaty of Peace, confiscated to the Egyptian Government, by way of compensation ior Egypt property rights and interests which have suffered damage at Italian hands, it should be possible to secure it xor ^IG. it is understood that the British Council have already initiated a scheme in Turkey under which facilities, and in deserving cases even subsidies, are given to Turkish enginesrin students to enable them to go to the United Kingdom and complete. /complete their technical education hy going chrough shops of leading Engineering firms there. It is urged that a similar scheme should he set on foot in Egypt under the auspices of the British Council, and tnat subsidies should he given to help the poorer students of the proposed British Technical Commercial College to avail unemselves ox this opportunity. It is suggested that such subsidies should he given on a selective competitive basis, in order^ co secure the best students, who are likely to turn their training to the best advantage both from their own point of view and that of British trade. 31. No review of the immediate post-war situation of British trade would be complete without considering the influence thereon of the two important Institutions that have come into existence during the war, and which now exercise such an important control over local commerce, viz: the Middle East Supply Centre and the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation. It is not known what is the policy of HMG with regard to cnese Institutions after the war period, but it is considered that if '•/ they are maintained in existence they could be of considerable help to British trade in Egypt. It is certain that after the conclusion of hostilities there will be very large stocks of surplus goods in the hands of the U.K.C.C. and the Military Authorities both in Egypt and elsewhere. The U.K.C.C. could r?ive o-reat help to British traders by controlling the disposal of the former,‘and the M.E.S.C. by allocating and arranging ^or the shipping to Egypt of such of the latter as the Egypoian c ‘ ■ xarket could acceptor disposal here, also under the control of the U.K.C.C. The object of the control of the U*K.C. C. would p- \ be to release these goods in such a manner as go avoid^ flood ing the market, or damaging other British trade, and oais could best be achieved by staggering their release over ohe period which must elapse before British manufacturers can supply new goods for the market. The retail sales of all such goods should be through British firms or Agents, either as agents of^ the U.K.C.C. or buying from the U.K.C.C. for resale onJ:heir own account. In particular, as suggested in paragraph 11 ox this Reeort, local small tradesmen, e.g. grocers, who have had co liquidate their stocks on mobilisation, should be re-scocked ^ where possible by the U.K.C.C. at the earliest possible momeno. 32. In order that the U.K.C.C. may have before them, in carrying out the programme suggested above, the fullest available knowledge of local markets and requirements, they should acb in the closest collaboration with the British Chambers ox Commerce, and even perhaps coopt certain representatives of oaese Ghamoers to advise them. As soon as the moment has arrived when Bricis manufacturers have returned to peace-time conditions, and are able to supply the market with new goods on a sufficient sc ^lQ, eioner generally or in any particular line, the U.K.C.C. should^drop o and allow the British and Dominion firms to deal direct throu^n their agents in Egypt. Even thereafter it might be possible for the M.E.S.C. to help British trade by so organising international exchanges of commodities as to create reciprocal conditions favourable to the sale of British goods in Egypt. 33. As a further practical measure for the encouragement of Anglo-Egyptian commercial exchanges it is recommended that a permanent British Trade Exhibition should be established in ^ suitable building in Cairo, for the primary purpose ox advertising British and Dominion goods suitable for the Egyptian marxet. l ♦ is suggested that an appropriate name for such an Institution would/ ■■Mlwould bo 'Britannia House', It would be essential that the building should be dignified if not impressive in appearance and situated in a reputable and accessible quarter. In addition to its main function as the repository of the Exhibition it should also houso the offices of the Chamber of Commercei and perhaps other bodies such as the Community Councils, the Charitable Fund and the British Legion, The possibility of moving the Hoad Office of the British Council there should also bo considered. In this way it could bo made into the centre of British Commercial and Community activities. It is understood that a similar idea has boon mooted at the recent Mooting of Commercial Diplomatic Officers hold in Cairo early in November, and there can bo little doubt that the creation of such an Institution on proper and adequate linos w.ould act as a strong and perfectly legitimate stimulus to British trade and prestige in the country. If this Institution proved to be a success it is con sidered that it might eventually bo possible to have a second similar building at Alexandria, where so much of the Trade of Egyptis concentrated, 34, The question of the establishment and organisation of Community Councils after the war is regarded as^of the greatest importance. It is understood that HMG- arc most interested in the creation of such bodies in all foreign countries^whore colonies of British subjects arc found, but that it is loft to the British Diplomatic Representative in the country concerned to ascertain and decide what form of Council or Councils is ,nost appropriate to that country. In Egypt the relatively large numbers and the political importance of thc^British Colony on the one hand, and the diversity of its composition on the other hand make this decision at once more important and more difficult than in many other countries. Two major problems present themselves in thfs connexion viz: (a). Should there bo one single Council for the whole of Egypt, or should there bo Councils in the four Consular Districts (excluding the special district of Ismailia which is of war-time but not commercial or social significance) and a Central Council? (t&gt;). Should the Maltose and Cypriots bo represented on the same Council or Councils as the Anglo- Saxons or should they have separate Councils of their own Communities (as they have at present), or should they retain the latter and bo represented in the former? These questions, among others, are being examined by certain representative members of the British Community with a view to obtaining an expression of the general viow of British subjects in Egypt for the guidance of the Ambassador, It is not therefore proposed to make any recommendation on this aspect of the problem in this Report, It is however desired to emphasise the importance of the rt&gt;lo which such Councils (however constituted) should in furthering the interests of the British Community in the post war period. Representative as they will bo of all classes of British subjects in Egypt the Councils will be the natural channel through which the Rehabilitation Boards will apply any schemes that may bo adopted, and they will naturally bo consulted as to their application. In addition to this the Councils will bo expected to keep the Consuls and/or the Ambassador advised as to tho/tho difficulties and requirements of the Community, and to suggest solutions of such problems of general intorost as may al *i B(:5 » tho same time it is recommended that it should bo understood that their function is also to act as a filter for individual complaints and grievances, by dealing thomsolves as far as possible vrith cases such as so frequently arise through misinterpretation and maladministration of tho lav/ by junior Government officials or xenophobic or anti**Christian tendencies# Such complaints are usually of a commercial character, and could in many instances bo taken up by tho Councils through tho Chambers of Commerce, leaving only tho more difficult and important cases to bo referred to tho Consulates and/or tho Embassy, or casos involving matters of principle* 35, As a subsidiary measure to those recommended above for improving tho status and securing tho romunorativo employment of Maltose and Cypriots, it is further recommended that those communities should bo encouraged and assisted to form and maintain sports and other social clubs and communal mooting-places, with tho object of fostering a spirit of solidarity amongst themsolVos, and of perpetuating tho Imperial connexion which has unfortunately boon allowed to become obscured in tho minds of many of those persons owing to tho apparent indifference to them of the Anglo- Saxon colony. At tho risk of repetition it cannot be too strongly emphasised that unless a serious effort is made on those or similar lines to show those Maltose and Cypriot British subjects more consideration than they have received in the past, thcro is a real danger that they will become not only unconscious of their British nationality and allegiance, but actually resentful of it when it is brought to their notice, Tho need for such consider ation has become far more imperative now since the application to them, without discrimination, of tho obligations of tho National Service Ordor-in-Council and tho Defence Regulations concerning service in tho Auxiliary Defence Service (British). Loyally as tho loaders of those communities have collaborated in tho carrying out of those measures, they have not boon able to refrain from tho suggestion that equality of sacrifice should connote equality of treatment, and it is particularly unfortunate that it should n have boon found possible to grant to their dependents in Egypt the same family allowance as is granted to tho dependents in Egypt of other British subjects called up in Egypt under .. same Order. It is regarded as essential to tho internal solidarity and to tho loyal collaboration of tho British Community in Egyp as a whole that after tho war no discrimination should bo made between its various elements. / It 36. Tho tendency of all Egyptian Governments tocourt popularity by oxtromo nat ionalis tic •policy c ^ . legislation nas already boon referred to in this {erw t -^ 4 ,&lt;'is considered necessary however to invito particular attention to the danger which would result to British trade if this tendency or this policy were to lead the Egyptian Government at any time to introduce financial measures radically modifying their monetary system. Above all the financial policy of the Egyptian Government should be carefully watched for any symptons *indicating an intention to cut adrift from sterling, the link with which is regarded as of tho greatest value to Anglo- Egyptian commercial relations. Such symptoms might well take tho form of proposals such as the following, which would weaken this link and aggravate monetary conditions between London and Cairo ' (a) To3o j (a) To prohibit tho export from Egypt of foreign (particularly British) capital which is surplus to Egypt's roal requirements; (b) To adopt positive inflationary measures in Egypt, o.g* by gixing excessive prices for local products, or (c) To impose excessive taxation on exports; (d) To invest the cover of her currency note issue in local or other foreign securities, instead of as at present in British Treasury Bonds, If anything of this sort wore to be proposed not it could bo objected to on tho grounds that it would impede tho war effort and so be contrary to the provisions of the Treaty* After tho war it could only bo opposed, if insisted on contrary to Egyt ; ] s true interests, by tho throat or even tho application of retaliatory financial or commercial measures by H,M. G-* Retaliation at present could not, however, be applied since it would necessarily result in a still further interference with tho war effort* It is true that a dofiniue assurance has recently been obtained, in a public pronounce ment by the Minister of Finance that it is not his intention ,o prevent the transfer of capital from Egypt at tho present time, but it is recommended that the situation in this respect should be most carefully watched in tho future, 57, It is considered that tho whole question of the movement of capital into and out of Egypt, both now and after tho war, is of groat importance to British traders* and that having regard to tho enormous credit balances of Egypt in international exchange caused by war spending, tho further importation of foreign capital should in general t* 0 discouraged* It should if possible only bo allowed when it is required for tho purpose of economic development inside Egypt, which would incroaso the consumption of imported commodities and thereby act directly against inflation* Even so it should only bo introduced in cases where no sufficient local capital is available* Further it is considered that thebe should be no restriction on tho export from Egypt of funds representing the viold and tho orderly repatriation of British capital invested ^.n Egypt* Apart from other considerations, such a movement ox funds would also tend to decrease tho risk of inflation. But on tho other hand it is recognised that such movements could properly bo checked if they wore made for political reasons, or in order to avoid legitimate taxation, or if they wqro on such a largo scale as to endanger tho interior economy of Egypt, The British commercial community in-Egypt would inevitably suffer if tho delicate fabric of, Egypt s finances wore to bo destroyed* 37* It is considered as particularly important if Egypt is to place her post-war finances on a stable basis, and so jrovido a safe field for British trade and enterprise, that she should join tho International Clearing.,Unio^ which it is understood is now being formed* Unless sho does' so li ' hardly/t /*N hardly possjlDlo for hor 'to romain in tho sterling cmj^pq l\oy bloc/ and tho importanco of hor doing so has already boon omphasisod. It should bo possible to convince tho Egyptian Govornmont that Egypt is not strong enough yet* in spito of hor tomporary prosperity* to stand alono financially, and that no othor link would bo so valuable to her since Lo^^o^ still and will continue to bo tho world 1 s first money market# Stress could bo laid on tho very great advantages she has gained from this link* narticularlv in tho last four years, and on tho importance from her own point of view of maintaining it. It is recommended that those points should be put squarely to tho Egyptian Govornmont through tho diplomatic channel at tho appropriate moment. It is suggested that this moment might be at tho first sign of tho beginning of tho period of deflation, which will obviously begin when tho military purchases in Egypt diminish to any sorioUs dogroo on tho removal of British and American troops from tho country. Statistics show that such purchases havo rioon from a normal total of approximately £5 millions in 1939 to tho largo sum of £V4-^ millions in 1942, so that tho sharp reaction which will occur in tho event contemplated will havo an effect on the economy of tho country which will call for firm handling and tho best possible advica* 38. Tho Egyptian Govornmont should be encouraged and if necessary urged to remove all tho exceptional restrictions imposed under Martial Law (Etat do Siege) as soon as possible after tho war. It is rocognisod that those restrictions havo boon, in principle, promulgated and applied at tho request of HMG in accordance with tho provisions of tho Treaty. On the other hand thero is no doubt that, behind this screen of loyal fulfilment of its obligations, tho Egyptian Government has found it possible to give wide play to political and anti-foreign feelings both in tho regulations imposed and in their application. This phenomenon has led tho British Community to fear that the Egyptian Government may be reluctant to divest itself of these exceptional powers as soon as their utility for tho purposes of tho war has come to an end. In particular it is considered that tho embargo on tho use of business codes and the censorship of tho Press should bo lifted as soon as considerations of security will allow. 39. Thero is considerable apprehension among the commercial element in tho Community that tho Egyptian Govornmont, in tho unrestricted enjoyment of its legislative autonomy, may bo led by the nationalistic extremists to promulgate vexatious laws intended to handicap the activities of foreign firms and to drive them out of business, Tho particular measure which has accentuated those fears is tho recent law concerning tho use of the Arabic language, which if it had been enforced in its original form would havo resulted in a situation in which maiy British firms would havo found it impossible to carry on. Intervention by tho Embassy has had satisfactory results in this instance ? and it is anticipated that tho more unreasonable provisions will shortly bo modified by administrative regulations and interpretations. It is felt however that similar attempts are sure to bo made to find some means of introducing further specious legislation which will in effect assist Egyptian firms by clogging the efforts of their British and othor foreign competitors, while keeping within tho lottGi* of the Montroux non-discrimination undertaking. It is especially/especially feared that the habit may he revived after the war of making the grant of residence or entry visas to British subjects employed by a firm conditional on the employment of a specified number of Egyptians, or moro particularly of the Moslem Egyptians, regardless of thoir efficiency or of the requirements and financial capacity of the firm# It is recommended that the Legislative and Administrative Authorities of the Egyptian Government should be closely watched for any such move, and that all possible stops should bo taken to combat it as has boon done in the past. It is emphasised that the successful exploitation of such a policy by the Egyptian Government would frustrate all the other efforts which it is hoped may bo made after the war to further British trade in Egypt. 40. There is a strong feeling in the Community that British trade in Egypt is closely bound up with the future of the Suez Canal. It is recognised that this is likely to form one of the major problems that will have to be faced in the general post-war settlement at the Peace Conference, and that it will have two aspects viz:(l) the International control and the defence of the water*-way and (2) tho rights of the Suez Canal Company and its administration, together with tho commercial exploitation of tho Canal after tho present concession has run out,The former aspect it is not within the scope of this Report to discuss. As regards tho latter aspect however it is regarded as very important that a firm lino of policy should be adopted, with a view to ensuring that British shipping should be enabled to got through the Canal expeditiously and at a reasonable cost - more quickly and more cheaply, if possible, than before, Tho British commercial community v/ould fool moro secure in this respect if it wore possible to obtain a renewal of tho concession to a British Corporation or to an Anglo- Egyptian body with effective British control - though it is not suggested that this objective would be easy to achieve. In tho meantime they would also like to see tho introduction of a substantial British element into tho present Administration of tho Suez Canal Company, which would bo commensurate with tho paramount interests of HMG both as majority shareholders and as chief customers. While recognising that tho Company, under tho direction of tho Agent Suporiour in Egypt, has loft nothing to be desired in its loyal service to the war effort, it is tho opinion of British Shipping Circles in Egypt that considerable improvement could in this way bo made both as regards tho efficiency of the running of tho Service and in tho matter of transit charges. 41, In preparing this Report and formulating theso various recommendations and suggestions tho Committee havo ondoavourod to confine themselves to propositions that appear to them to be possible, having regard to tho limitations .. of practical politics as appreciated by thorn. In casos whore a remedy or a safeguard has appeared to them to bo available to meet a difficulty or a danger which thoy foroaoo, thoy havo boon ablo to mako concroto x^ 0 ? 030 -! 3 * Thoy havo not hov/ovor boon deterred from calling attention to problems of which/1 ^Sff.,,ich thoy could not see tho ii^modiato solution^ or .rom making roc ommondations which they could not indicato the precise manner of carrying out f provided always that no intrinsic impossibility appeared to he involved. In this way thoy hope to have produced I a Report which will reflect tho reasonable dosiros and I aspirations of tho British Community in Egypt, and at tho same time indicato tho main features of a comprehensive and constructive policy for its post-war ■rehabilitation and development.
