No.461-6/46, highv/ay outside the Pier gates, crossed I quite agree that the condition of this track is bad, also certain other parts of the track on the Pier; this is u/used by the sharp hooves of donkeys, also by heavy lorries and tractors. I have been for some time concerned with the reparation of these defects, and discussing the best method with the State Engineer; but actually I had intended to include its cost in my estimate for Customs repairs in the coming year. I will, however, endeavour to get the work pressed on earlier, as the highway seems to be increasingly used for motor traffic. Believe me, Yours sincerely, cCtQ^&lt;&gt; uC A-- To; - Lieut-Colonel Gordon Loch, I.A., H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHRAIN:D«0« Ko. Dated the 6th July 1^40 IX c. In the last few months I have heard - and so no doubt yoyrfihve)- increasing complaints about the state of the roads A new feature of these complaints is the allegation that the Bahrain Government is not giving an adequate return for the money paid in motor vehicles taxation ana drivers* licences. 2. People are of course liable to forget that half the motor vehicles’ taxes goes to the municipalities, but the current Budget figures do actually provide some justification for puulic complaint. Receipts under motor vehicles* taxes are estimated at a 2b,Q00/-, of Which h 10,000/- go to the minicipaii ties, ss 11,000/- to the general repairs and upkeep of roads, anu presuaiably a few huaareds tow^rus incidental costs, fnis still leaves about h c500/- unaccounted for. Of course actuals are liable to exceed estimates and one may expect an excess nere on both slues of tne Budget. 3. There c^n be little doubt hiut the; standard of road communications provided by the Bcdirdn Govern ent falls far short of the standard of other public services. In Manama town the one small length of metal road laid cost in time ana money infinitely more than it should have done ana the failure of the Municipal Committee to dose roads to traffic while they are being scraped and oiled results in most of the money so spent being Ousted, it is a question whether it is justifiable to pernut even a partially elected body like the Municipality to dissipate public funds in tnis way. At/- Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq#, C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, BahrainAt tne least they should be required to consult and follow the advice of the Government Public Works Department. 4* as for roads outside tne municipal areas, the stretch which carries by far the greatest proportion of traffic and which gjves most cause for complaint is that through the palm groves between the asylum cuid 'Wiggley Bridge'. Though it is constantly being patched a journey over it remains a shattering experience for vehicles and passengers axike. I have on vari ous occasions suggested that this stretch will always be appall ing until it is heavily soled but so far no action has been taken. It occurs to me that the reason may be that the Bahrain Government are doubtful whether even heavy soling will making it a good road in vie?/ of sub-surface conditions, and if that is so I would urgently recommend that the possibility of finding an alternative alignment be examined. It might well be possible, without increasing mileage unduly, to use the first three or four miles of the Budaiyah Hoad, striking south on tne best line available to join the Awali Road soon after it emerges from the palm groves. The Budaiyah Hoad is com paratively straight and reasonably well drained, and with small realignments, proper soling ana adequate surfacing could be made first class. I nave no douot that initial expen diture would be heavy but upkeep thereafter should be cheap ana simple. 5. Would it not be well now to create a Road Fund ? In- at evitably the Government would have to make loans to it/first, but as solid lengths are completed along the more heavily used roads and upkeep costs thereon decline these loans could be paid off, and ultimately a balance could be accumulated to jus tify extension of 'first class' roads in other parts of the Island. 6. Yuould you be good enough to let me know your views on this whole question ? Yours sincerely.r I I IA I % V / f A &gt; lJL * »■ D.O. Ko. 888/8. y L £• Vo Cc^ L,\/w\A* Bahrain, 10th July 1940, '/i My dear Weightman, With reference to your D.O. No. 1286 dated 6th July 1940 about roads, though I agree that the roads here need improvement I do not share your opinion of their degree of badness. I know myself and have constantly been told by people from Iraq that the roads in the neighbourhood of Manamah are better than those on the outskirts of Baghdad and Basrah, they cannot of course be compared with roads in India. 2. Half of the actual receipts from vehicle taxes, not including driving licenses, is paid to the two Municipalities but when they undertake any big road job they are usually given a special subsidy by the Government, as,for an example, in the case of the Muharraq sea road extension and metalling the road near the Bank. Roads in Bahrain fall into two categories, those within the municipal boundaries of Manamah and Muharraq, which includes Hedd, which are dealt with by the municipalities and roads in other parts of the island which are made and kept up by the Government. ^n arrangement exists between the Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company by which the company keeps in repair the road from Radm al Kawari (the bridge at the end of the date gardens) to ^wali as well as all the roads in the oil field and iiwali and refinery areas. 3. I quite agree that the Manamah town roads are often in a very bad state although they are cons-- 2 - /A *&gt; ^ ^ • •XT / (^ ' ^ A y^ '' tr^ &amp;***' dk/* 0 (*-* A, constantly being repaired and the municipality spends a great deal more on mending roads than it receives from the government. Last year approximately Rs 30,000/- was spent on town roads of which Rs 20,000/- was spent on widening roads inside the bazaar and Rs 10,000/- the cost of upkeep and construction of roads in the municipal area. The municipality has made use of the Bahrain Petroleum Company’s machines more than once and had been advised by the company’s experts but this method is expensive. This year it cost the municipality about Rs 3,000/- to grade and oil 5 miles of town roads and the result was not lasting. The metalled road from the Bank to the Customs cost approximately 4 annas per square foot. 4. The road from Manamah to Radm al Kawari is a bad one. It is narrow, twisting and has dangerous corners and innumerable old mosque sites projecting into the road which cannot be touched. I have tried for years, without success, to persuade the Shara to allow the removal of these mounds. This road needs constant repairs but if it is kept in order a good surface can be maintained for cars going at thirty miles an hour. Our one experiment in heavy soling has not been a success. / It was done on the road from ’Hota iibool’ west of the police dispensary frem some length along the main road towards the asylum, JL, &gt; this section is now one that seems to require more fa tAS^' 5. ^n alternative road from Manamah to Radm al &gt; at attention than most of the other parts of the road. ^ — / Kawari has frequently been considered. Fifteen years ago, I believe, work was actually begun on a roadroad which was intended to go from Suq al Khamis through Bilad al Q,adim across the ford to Tubli and from there to the Rafaa road. The project was abandoned owing to lack of funds. This is a short cut but I think the construction of a causeway across the muddy creek would cost a great deal of money. I have examined this route several times lately. If this was contemplated the Budeya road to Senabus and thence across to Suk al Khamis could be used. There is another possible route, but considerably longer, which I have been across during the last few weeks, from Aali to Baar and onto the Budeya road near Makaba, but though this road would be of great use to the people of Budeya and other villages in that district it would increase the mileage between iiwali and Manamah. A third route, which already exists, is the new road branching off south of Radm al Kawari to the new bridge higher up the stream and then through date gardens to the road passing Behlah, which links the Manamah-Awali road with the Budeya road. This was built two or three years ago as a detour for donkey traffic but it could be improved and widened though the road crosses innumerable water channels and existing bridges would require rebuilding for heavy traffic. I think the sub-surface of part of this road, through the gardens, would be similar to that of the present Manamah - Radm al Kawari road as it is bordered by water channels but of these three alternatives the last is the most promising. 6. It would be possible to create a road fund by setting money apart for it in future budgets. I think in the immediate future, the revenue from vehicle-4- vehicle taxes is likely to decrease because of the increased price of cars and the reduction in the number of motor vehicles used by the Bahrain Petroleum Company and this revenue will not then be sufficient for upkeep of roads. 7. Regarding criticism of the government’s work on roads, I feel that many of the people who complain have rarely been off the Manamah - xiwali road and Know nothing about the new roads which have been made by the Government curing the last two or three years. A number of roads, good enough to enable buses to ply between villages which were previously quite inaccessible to motors, have been built and have proved a great bene fit to the people living in the country and although some of tdem are not much more than tracks with bridges over water channels they have cost money to construct. The Budeya road from Jedhafs, the Sehlah road and the road via Segeyya to Om mash’oon have all been built recently and are much used.
