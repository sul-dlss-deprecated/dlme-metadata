His Majesty's Consul, Kerman. His Majesty f s Consul, Khorrarnshahr. Memorandum. # The Ilon'ble the Political Resident directs that, for the duration of the war, any member of the ministerial esta blishment going to India on leave, shall be given a letter in duplicate addressed to the Navy Sea Transnort Officer at Bombay or Karachi, as may be most appropriate, requesting him to allot the bearer a priority second class passage to Bushire' (unless other orders have been passed regarding his posting on return from leave), in the ship most appropriate to the*date of the expiry of his leave; and to telegraph him the date when he should reach the port of embarkation. 2. All clerks going on leave should be instructed to show this paper to the Navy Sea Transport Officer immediately on their arrival in India, and to inform him of their address on leave. 3. On receipt of a telegram from the Naval Sea Transport Officer instructing the recipient to be at a port by a given date, all unexpired leave will automatically cancelled, and « • failure to report by the required date will be treated as over- stayal of leave without permission. Sd. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gul;f■V . Copy of express letter No# 1708-67/19 dated 25th July, 1944 from Britconsul, Bushire to Foreign New Delhi. I Reference your memorandum No. 2465-E/42 dated the 22nd September 1942 conveying the decision of the Governor General in Council that the period spent by Government servants waiting for a steamer while returning from leave in India should be debited to their leave account. 2. The effect of this decision has been that clerks returning from leave who are detained in Karachi for a period in excess of the joining time admissible to them, have had to be placed on leave on half average pay for the remaining period overstayed by them, since they invariably take the maximum leave admissible on full average pay in India. The half average pay of the majority of our clerks is under Rs. 175/- per mensem. This question has been brought to a head recently by a clerk, accompanied by his wife and two children, having had his leave account debited by 45 days for the period spent by him in waiting for a steamer. Government of India will appreciate the hardship caused by such enforced halts of such long duration in stations where the cost of living is prohibitive and where .they are strangers. 3 # In the circumstances, I request that the Governor General in Council will be pleased to reconsider his decision and permit clerks returning from leave to the Persian Gulf to treat the Period of enforced detention at the fixed point as joining time. AGL.From - The Under Secy, to the ^ovt. of India in the External Affairs Department, To - The Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Memorandum No, F.27(10)-E/44. Dated Simla, the 23rd November 1944. Subject:- Joining time to Government servants Proceeding on leave. Reference your express letter No, 1708-67/19 dated the 25th July, 1944. 2. The Government of India regret their inability to sanction the proposal to treat the period of enforced detention at the fix point as joining time. However the Defence Department have kindly agreed to assist, as far as possible, in securing early passages to the personnel on leave in India from Persian Gulf, by bringing them under category (5) mentioned in paragraph 2 of that Department letter No. 40/M.P., dated the 1st r February 1944 ( copy enclosed for ready reference). 3. It would be necessary for you to furnish to the clerk concerned a certificate indicating the name with full particulars regarding leave, leave address etc. The clerk should give it to the local * shipping authorities on arrival in India.
