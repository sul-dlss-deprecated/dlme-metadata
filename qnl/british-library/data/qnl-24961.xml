In consequence of this decision reached at the meeting, the International Telegraph department was informtd of the decision that Afghanistan need not accept this class of telegrams (L»C) with effect from the 1st August, 1936, and was requested to inform the departments of those countries who are members of the International Telegraphic Union to correct column No. 12 of the schedule referred to above.

With effect from 1st July messages with multiple addresses should be addressed direct by you to address of principal addressee. For example messages to Katodon, Lonsimpesh, etc. should be addressed to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, and not to Peshawar as at present. Similarly messages to Simpesh, Simbal, etc. should be addressed to Simla/Delhi direct. On assumption that their meaning is not Known to Afghan Gorernment Code addresses at present in use, vide enclosure to your memorandum 548, May 26th, 1951, should appear as first word in text of message as indication to Peshawar telegraph office to repeat to addresses in India.

It is not possible to agree to Japanese request as such arrangement is prohibited by International Regulations and Japanese Minister’s telegram will have to be booked to destination just as Katodons will have to be booked to London. Arrangements we make at Peshawar for taking copies of these telegrams and sending them to Delhi, etc. are purely of domestic nature and Afghan telegraph service is not concerned. \(ninclosure 4 to Kabul despatch No. 93 dated the 11th July 1936) Copy of an Express Letter No. 183-A dated the 2nd July, 1936, from Minister, Kaoul, to Foreign, Simla.

First part of your telegram of June 30th 139f.l. S^ic Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, London, No. 101, dated the 22nd (received 29th) July 1936. I have the honour to refer to the correspondence forwarded under my endorsement despatch No. 93, dated the 11th July 1936, regarding the adoption by Afghanistan of the international system of telegraph accounting. 2. Although Afghanistan joined the International Telegraph Union in 1928 she had not hitherto been able to reach a satisfactory arrangement with the Posts and Telegraphs Department of the Government of India regarding the working of the Convention in so far as international telegraph traffic via India is concerned. The question was discussed at length with the Indian telegraph expert who visited Kabul in 1932 (vide the enclosure to my endorsement des- patch. No. 74, dated the 4th June 1932) and has ever since formed the subject of prolific correspondence between the Posts and Telegraphs Departments of the two Governments each of which has from time to time appealed to this Legation to urge the other to expedite matters. The chief difficulty in the way of a settlement was one of exchange, and this was to a great extent removed by the stabilisation of the Afghani rupee in November 1935. Afghanistan came to an understanding regarding international telegraph accounting with Russia 5* ^C^i^-as long ago as 1932 (vide the enclosure to my despatch, No. 59, dated the 28th April 1932) and in December 1935 the ‘ Islah ’ published a list of rates for tele grams to all parts of the world via that country. 3. Hitherto it has only been possible to pre-pay the charges on telegrams addressed to foreign countries via India as far as India, and it has been neces sary for public bodies and private individuals who were in the practice of corres ponding with foreign countries by telegram either to keep a deposit in the tele graph office at Peshawar for the payment of charges on telegrams from India onwards as occasion arose, or to address their telegrams to an agent in Peshawar and arrange with him for their onward transmission. The former system was the one followed by this Legation. Similarly charges on telegrams addressed to Afghanistan from abroad via India could only be pre-paid as far as India and terminal charges were payable on their receipt in Afghanistan. 4. The introduction therefore, with effect from the 1st July 1936, of the new system whereby charges on all telegrams despatched to and from Afghanistan via India are to be fully pre-uaid in the country of origin has been welcomed by the ‘ Islah ’ as the removal of a great inconvenience. It has how ever been received with somewhat mixed feelings by the public owing to the very high rates that are to be charged for telegrams despatched from Afghanistan. If the table of these rates published in the ‘ Tslali ’ is correct (vide the enclosure to my express letter No. 183-A., dated the 2nd July 1936, a copy of which was forwarded with my endorsement despatch under reference) this Legation will have to pay twice as much as hitherto on their telegrams to [ India and more thandwice as much on their telegrams to London. My Japanese y/ colleague was much perturbed when he found that his telegrams to Tokio would cost him three times as much as before and enquired whether he could not con tinue the old system of maintaining a deposit at Peshawar. After consultation with the Government of India he was informed that this was impossible under international regulations. There is reason to believe however that the rates pub lished in the ‘ Tslah ’ are incorrect, and if this proves to be the case it should be possible to induce the Afghan Government to amend them. 5. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India.

I have the honour to inform you that the Government o. e Swiss Confederation has received, by diplomatic channel, a proposal of the adhesion of Afghanis tan to the Parcel Post Agreement of London. This proposal states that the auto nomous Direction of Posts, Telegraphs and Telephones oi* Afghanistan desires to apply a surcharge of 50 centimes per p arcel instead of 25 centimes prescribed by Article 8 of the Agreement, in the consideration that the cost of transport is high in Afghanistan. The same Direction adis that Afghanistan will accept parcels coming o nly from Brit i sh Indi a. On the other hand, Article 51, last para of the sail Agreement contains the following provisions; 'When a country which desires to adhere to the present Agreement claims a right to collect a surcharge greater than 25 centimes per parcel, the International Bureau submits the application for membership to all the a Administrations taking part in the Agreement. If, within six months, more than one- third of these Administrations do not vote against the a^plicatior it is regarded as accepted.* 1 With reference to these provisions, the Federal Political Department has requested the International Bureau to make preliminary consultation with the competent Administrations prescribed by the said Article and to communicate to it the result. I beg to submit the application for membership of Afghan istan to the Administrations which are parties to the Parcel Post Agreement, with a request kindly to communicate to me, pres ent ci rcula r , their opinion regarding the levy of a sur charge of 50 centimes per parcel as desired by the Afghanis tan Adminis tration.

The Afghan Foreign Ministry Kabul has sent a copy of letter from Modiriyat Kharija, which is copied and sent enclosed herewith. You would find from its perusal that some irregularities have occurred in exchange of post between the Post offices of Chaman and Kandahar. Since the Afghan Government nas lately been connected with the International Postal system accordingly the Posts were being exchanged properly between the Posts of Kandahar and Ghaman. The atti tude of the Postmaster Ghaman has been against the principle observed in exchange and acimowledgment of Posts, registered letters and thus creates a sort of difficulty. I am sure that due instructions may kindly be issued to the Postal authorities to exchange receipts in accordance with the customary Postal rules. Wi th k i nd re gard s.

The Customs took over the sealed bag and forwarded a receipt to the Post Office, ^ila-i-Jadid.

Receipts granted by the said Postmaster (?) under this arrangement are &amp;t present on record in the Post and Telegraph Office, ^ila-i-Jadid.

Likewise take over the Chaman post at the Customs after grant of a receipt. I shall directly neither take over nor make over posts to you H . Accordingly if this office hands over the post at the Customs, a receipt for the sea lei bag is furnished by the latter. Ko receipt for the registered articles is given, because the Customs do not open the bags, but hand them over intact to the Post Office, Chamsn. Who will then give this office a receipt? 2. The Postmaster further refuses to furnish receipt of letters coming from Kandahar etc. He says 'iron-registered letters, whether official or commercial, are classed as ordinary.

In the reverse direction mail bags are sent by the Ghaman Post Office to tne customs Office where they are handed over to tne Afghan postal representative - usually an ordinary trader ora xorry driver. 2. The Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Karachi, in consultation with the Political .Agent, Quetta, has suggested that the following revised arrangements be introduced as soon as possible, viz., that mail bags from C,ala-Jadid for the Ghaman post office should be conveyed by a representative of the Afghan post Office who would report first at the customs station at the border and thence be escorted by a Gustoms official or By© by a Police officer to the Post Office where he would hand over the bags to tne Postmaster receiving a formal receipt for them at the same time. The same man would receive the Indian mails for ‘^ala-Jadid granting a receipt for such mails to the Ghaman Post Office, the representative of the Afghan post office would be required to be in possession of The Political Agent, Quetta, it is suggested, might arrange for this authorisation direct with the Hakim of ^sla-Jadid. 3. I am to request that tne Afghan Government be approached on the subject and that tne Government of India be informed whether they are prepared to agree to the revised arrangement being introduced.

The Britiah Legation has the honour to inform the Afghan Foreign Ifinistry tU't, at the req &lt;=~t ox the Afghan Consul General in India, the Government of India have had under consideration the revision o. -oe p.esent arrangement for the exchange of postal bags at Cnaman. nhder the existing system, mail bags from q &gt; a 1 a- J&amp;d:Ld are sent to the Chaman Customs Office, whence they are made over to the Chaman Post Office. In the reverse direction, mail bags from the Chaman Post Office are handed over to the Afghan representative at the Customs Office. 2. The Government of India have now suggested the following revised procedure and enquire whether it would be in accord with the wishes of the Afghan Government * - A representative of the Afghan Post on ice would convey the mail bags from ^alarJadid to the Customs station at the border, whence he would be escorted by a British official to the Post Office at Chamsn, and, on handing over the mails would receive the necessary receipts from the Postmaster. He would then receive the mails intended for Afghanistan and furnish the Postmaster with formal receipts. He would then return to '^sia-Jadid. 3 . The Afghan postal representative is not, it is understood, at present a regular official out usually a private trader or motor lorry driver, ana it would be preferable that he should be in possession of a proper passport and a special authorisation from the ^fgh&amp;n Government. 4 .

The remarks of M.dogdanof confirm what has been said oy Mr Gould in various communications this year as to tne increasing vanity and n^t- -ility to foreigners shown oy the Afghan ^o«p| -ment, and particularly oy the Acting Foreign 1 Minister, Ghulam Sadiq and the Commerce ininister, Hadi Khan, noth of them young men witn orief dip^ -lomatio experience in Europe. It seems clear that the Afghan representatives abroad learn nothing of value from tneir e:perience in for- -eign capitals. No douot their contact witn society is limited to official receptions in which tney receive courtesies wnicn flatter theirtheir self-esteem, and to the approaches of • j .; -.. i, contract-orokers and-others whose interest it is to play upon their \anity. Unfortunately this result of contact with Uurope is not confined to Afghans among Asiatic nations. what h.dogdanoff has to say about the re-organisation of the Afghan Posts and Telegraphs is supplemented oy the report ( 3431 /2 7 ) that a M.iou'veret has been appointed for this purp &gt;se. We heard in April 1926 (? 1331/26) that the Afghans were contemplating approaching the Preach for assistance in this matter. In March 192* (? 12^8/26) we had heard that a certain M.Delfieu of the Paris P.T.T. nad secured the post, which was thought at the time to be connected with the question of supplying wireless stations to Afghanistan. We now know that a French syndicate has ootained a contract to supply certain wireless stations, and M.dogdanof things this scheme will be carried through. It remains to oe seen if M.oou\eret will be expected to lend a hand in the establishment of the station- as well as in the reorganisation of the posts and telegraphs. In another connection the project of recommending the appoint- -ment of a Belgian ezpert to re-organise the posts and telegraphs has been discussed. This will presumably now lapse unless or until M.bouveret finds the task too much or him.

Despatch No.87, dated the 5th November 1927.-'fW mmM ' 'L 7 ' ' ft C r* Despatch from His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affaies, No. 87, dated Kabul, the 7th (received 11th) November 1927- Mr. L. Bogdanov, a Menshevik Russian, who has been attached as a Secretary to the French Diplomatic Mission in Kabul since its inception in 1923, is leaving Kabul shortly on the termination of his appointment, and came to say good-bye to me this morning. As he is a noted Persian scholar and has been in close touch with all classes of Afghans in Kabul during the last four years, some of his opinions of the present regime in Afghanistan may be of interest. 2. Monsieur Bogdanov told me that he was much impressed by the grow ing arrogance of the Afghan Government, particularly in their relations towards foreigners. Afghan officials missed no opportunity of administrating pin pricks to their French employes and even to the members of the French Legation, and he understood that other foreigners, and especially the Germans, were similarly treated. But what struck him as most ominous for the future of the country was the open way in which young Afghans, particularly those who had recently returned from abroad, boasted their superiority over Europeans. The Afghans were the most barbarous and ignorant of any orien tals with whom he was acquainted, and it was essential, if the country was to progress, that they should recognise their limitations before they attempted to adopt the education and customs of the West. The tendency to oust the older and more courteously minded Afghan from office and place *in authority bumptious and ignorant youths who had learnt a smattering of Western knowledge in Europe was having a deplorable effect on the quality of Afghan administration, and the position of the foreigner in Afghanistan was becom ing more and more difficult. 3. Monsieur Bogdanov referred to a proposal to depute a Frenchman to overhaul the Afghan Post and Telegraph Departments with a view to facili tating the entry of Afghanistan into the International Postal Union. This pro posal, he said, had been discussed for more than three years, and a contract had been on the point of signature by the French Minister on two or three occasions when the Afghan Foreign Office inserted an impossible clause which brought the negotiations to a standstill. Two French postal experts who had offered their services had been obliged to withdraw their applications, and, unless the Afghan Government completely changed their attitude towards this question, he felt that nothing would come of it. 4. He was of opinion that the contract which had been signed by Mon sieur Yimar for the erection of wireless installations in Afghanistan would be carried through to completion. An expert had recently arrived from France, and the Afghan Government had already paid a considerable sum of money in advance. The intention was to link up the important towns in A fghanistan by wireless and to have a central installation in Kabul which could communicate direct with the capitals of Europe. 5. A copy of this despatch is being forwarded to the Secretary of State for India and to the Government of India. w r GIPD—522(C)F&amp;PD—16-11-27- 30.

Ordinary mails for Afghanistan will now be delivered by the Government Sub- Post Office at Landi Khana to the Afghan Post Office at Torkham, while incoming: mails for India will be received at Landi Khana, and dealt with as ordinary British Indian mails.

A cross-reference 'to this letter has been made on the file (P.4720/23) dealing with the irregularity of the existence of an Afghan P.O. in Peshawar. Though that office is contrary to treaty and we have a perfect right, as well as good reason, to demand its immediate closure, the present is not a very opportune moment for demanding it. Papers are with Foreign Office (sent today) for their comments. Though the Afghan P.O. affords Mabendra Pratap an obvious channel of communication with India, it does not necessarily follow that he uses it; it must be quite easy to arrange for travellers from Kabul to introduce letters into India and post them down country? /c^ ) D.T .Monteath. * 4.1.24.

(Psi't/d V^ 1 Sir, I haveUhe honour to invite a reference to my predecessor's memorandum No. l 6537-P.,dated the 25th Hay 1923, in which the activities of the Afghan Trade Agent in Peshawar with regard to postal matter departing for, and arriving from, Afghanistan were indicated. In paragraph 4 of this memorandum the opinion was expressed that the present system might be allowed to continue on the ground that it was convenient in practice and that no particular advantage would accrue to the Indian Government througi inducing the Amir to establish a Post Office on the Frontier. It was further pointed out that, since a potential centre for Afghan intrigue already existed in the Af^an Trade Agency in Peshawar City, there was no special reason for eliminating the AfgianPost Office on this count. It was suggested that the institution in Peshawar by which the distribution of the Afghan post was carried out was, in effect virtually an un-officiai forwarding agency, and that it might therefore be allowed to continue, provided the Amir's Government applied for permission for its continuance in a regular manner and was prepared to offer suitable concessions to His Majesty's Government in exchange® 2 . In this connection I have the honour to invite attention to subsequent correspondence on the subject ending with Foreign and Political Department endorsement No.110(1 )-F., dated the 15th October 1923 , and to say that further consideration of the whole subject ha» pursuaded me that early action is called for to put a stop to the irregular distribution of Af$ian postal matter now and or discussion. \ 3 . In the arguments adduced in my predecessor's memorandum cited in paragraph 1 above, there is one consideration, of increasing importance. which appears to have been overlooked* It is obvious that under theexisting arrangonents no check of any kind can be maintained over postal matter coming from Afghanistan. It woulr. seam “bat the maiTs for India are probably the only complete class of postal matter in the world which is entirely immune from censorship owing to its passing through no recognised postal agency. These mails are brought to Peshawar by Af$ian employees and are delivered direct, in the case of Peshawar addressees, by Afghan delivery peons, while matter for reposting is so dispersed as to be incapable of reassemoly in any Imperial Post Office for the purposes of scrutiny. It is scarcely necessary for me to emphasise the dangerous character of the means thus afforded for the dissanination of undesirable matter in Inoia. It can only be a question of time Before it isxxxxBrxx - ’ K ' to, if indeed it has not already been used, for this purpose by 1 subversive propagandists, and it is calculated largely to render |nugatory all the efforts of the Government of India employed through other agencies to exclude objectionable correspondence. 4 ” The present un-official Afghan Post Office consists, not only in a Postmaster, but in a complete staff, down to delivery peons; it uses its own postmark and engages in ihe sale of pos^l stamps. That the objectionable nature of this arrangement has been recognised by the Government of India is clearly indicated in Foreign Department memorandum No.555/llO(l)-F of the 30th June 1923, to the address of His Majesty's Minister at Kabul, in which the Minister was requested to take a very early opportunity to draw the attention of the Afghan Government to the infringement of Article X of the afghan Treatv involved in the present arrangements. I would urge that further effort be exerted with a view to abolishing these arrange ments. In paragraph 2(l) of Foreign and Political Department's memorandum No.llO(l)-F.. dated the 13th October 1923, to ms Majesty's Minister at Kabul, the Government of India seem to have accepted the conclusion that it would be impossible to prevent specific cars from Afghanistan from entering British India. There would appear, however, to be no difficulty in stopping cars entering India from Af Aanistan which are carrying mails in contravention ofconecondition!? acceptable to the Government of India, and I think we should insist that all Afghan postal matter arriving in India should be banded over at the frontier to the Indian Postal authorities under arrangements,of a formal character to be recognised by both Govern- ^ents* I have, etc.. / 3d .R.

As refjards Afghan postal arrangements in Peshawar, it was not until they received your despatch reporting the conclusion of that agreement, that the (jovenament of India became aware that there j had been any departure from the terms of Article X of the Anglo- [ Afgten Treaty. The extent of that departure is indicated in the {2 Chief Comiasionar*s Memorandum ao.6537-P, dated the 25th May 1923, of which a copy was sent to you direct. Had the Oovaranwit of India boon aware of the developraant of the unofficial Affhan forwarding agency into a regular Post Office, they would certainly have taken up the matter before, i’or in re-establishing a Post Office in Pesh awar without the express consent of tho Government of India, the Afghan Govemnwit have contravened Article • oi the Anglo-Afghan Treaty and arrogated to thema elves a oo nee as ion to which they are not entitled. Moreover, the Indian Pc jt i alac rities object to the whole system. Afghanistan is not a member of the Postal Union and in the circumstances the Indian Postal authorities are not obliged under anr Convention to accept un- A stamped articles for delivery in India. Mast of the articles are S refused by the addressees «nd there is no way of recovering the vatBfp due which naans loss to the Indian Postal Department. The Government of India agree with you that the carriage of Af#ian*!Br;Hs tWou^i British tsrritory hy Afgjttai agsocy should/bs Pomdt- | _ J ted under existing conditions and that the sioat satisfactory arrangement ^ould be to provide that all postal matter passing between Afghanistan and India (except diplomatic bags in charge of ^credited couriers) should be exchanged by postal officials ol tile two Governments at the boundary# It is requested that f if you see no objection, a very early opportunity should be taken to draw the attention of the Afghan Goverwaant to Article a of the Treaty, and to ask them to dose noun the Post Office at once and make the necessary arrangements for the change of mails at the frontier in aoeordanoe with the universal custom of civilised powers# further the Afghan Government might also be informed thet the Indian rost Office cannot undertake to transmit any unpaid postal articles# duoh articles, if received, will be simply returned by the office of exchange at the frontier to Afghanistan# If Afghanistan will join the International Postal Union, then the Indian Post office will be quite ready to accept articles bearing Afghan stamps and deal with unmid articles in accordfiace with the Union rules# It any however be pointed cut that in afioordance eith the final- Protocal of the Principal Uenvention of Madrid, Article III, even among Union countries the power is reserved under certain conditions to refuse unpaid postal articles. 4.

The question wheth r the present activities oi the Afghan Trade «gent at Peshawar in regard to the receipt and forwarding of postal matt r, from and to Peshawar, should oe checked or not, appears to me essentia_ly one tor consideration| and decision by the Government of India, especially in view oi •i* CO; CO ZD “D o (D the official pronouncement made on the point oy their represen tative, oir Henry ^obbs. I am not in a position to take expert opinion as to the correctness in international law of thes activities, while such pr ctical considerations as the facilities aftorded through them for the evasion of any censorship that might hereafter be imposed, and for the dissemination os undesirable I propaganda, are no doubt already apparent to the Government of India. Subject to these remarks, my views are as follows : On general grounds of policy I should deprecate the grant | to the Afghan Government of any concession which has been formally refused. If, however, it is decided that w&gt;ir Henry bobbs f pronouncement should be reconsidered, I think it important that such a concession should be granted not by tacit! connivance at Afghan usurpation of it, but by an explicit announcement on receipt of an official request from the Afghan Government, and then only in return for a definite quid pro quo.In this particular case 1 consider that it would be inadvisable to permit the carriage of Afghan mails through British territory by Afghan agency, at any rate until the revision of the present Treaty, whether the Afghan government eventually adhere, to the International Postal Convention or not it seems to me that the most satisfactory arrangement would be to provide that all postal matter passing between Afghanistan and India (except diplomatic bags .in charge of accredited couriers) should be exchanged by postal officials of the two Governments at the boundary. This would involve the establish ment of an Afghan Post Office at Tor Imam, and the definite abolition of the Afghan 'postmaster* at leshawar. If it is decided that the present activities of the Afghan J-'rade Agent ana his subordinate in postal matters are to be curtailed in future, I request that I may mindly oe consulted, in view of the possibility of retaliation on the mails of this Legation, as to the methods by which it is proposed to enf orce, such a decision. ■u reference is invited to your memorandum Ko• 295-110(1)-Pr. dated the 12th April last, on the subject noted aoove. 2. As regards the concession to mr. Gmeiner I agree with the views expressed by tne minister at Kabul in his despatch a copy of this memorandum is being forwarded to the lion* ble the ^nief Commissioner of the iiorth &gt;&lt;est f rontier Province, for information.

Under section 7 s the agreement is null and void if all necessary materials are not supplied wits in six months. It is now over six months s iuce t-.e agreement was signed and no materials have yet arrived. Under section 13 the Afghan Government agree thoroughly to repair the road and to keep it in a fair mot or ab l? condition. It is doubtful Whether the road as ever been worse than it has been durii g the last two months, and no real steps are being taken to improve it. ^ny company which takes up the concession is likely to lose money and to havf coi siderable trouble with the Afghan Government and it does not therefore appear to be a matter of regret that the concession has not been given to a british or Indian firm, fhe difficulties in the way of establishing a motor service from -.eshawar to Kabul are i indeed appreciated ay motor firms in iesliawar ana I am informed that in the present state of the road to Kabul no motoragency in Peshawar would be ready to undertake a similar contract. 3. Tne Government of India enquire what exact form the activities of the Afghan Irade Agent in xeshawar take with regard to postal matter for Afghanistan, -mere is in Pesnawar City a building styled the Afghan Post Office. It is quite separate from the Afghan Trade Agency and is controlled oy one Lala Jawahar Mai, who, though formerly clerk oi the Afghan Trade Agen , is „,■' ni.derstocxi to be independentindependent of him and to receive iiis ins true tioiiS. nix co from Kabul* As an instancy of the manner in which the term Postmaster is used and the purposes to v/nich the Post Uilice is put I would cite a ..etter see# by the. in Bombay Manager, Socialist, S*A*Dangi # 434 # Thakardwara, Bombay, requesting him to issue his journal for si:: months by Y-i.P. to the following address t - Bus si an Imbassy, Q/0 Biwan Jawahar Mai, Afghan 1 ostmast( r, Peshawar* Artj.cles for addresses in ^ighanistan received in tee rost Office in 1 eshavrar are made ver by the Bostmaster to -uara one J .

It certainly i mcertainly seeius uriuesirable that tiie aov'i n: ent should be permitted to retain 1... Peshawar, in spite of the terns of the treaty ana v/ithout permission regularly secured, an institution which can be regarded with so much as an Afghan Post Office, and I agree with his Britannic Majesty 1 s Minister at habul in thinking (see . randum uo.ibv, d^ted the. 6th may last to the * &gt;reigu Depart:.lent) that the concession, if granted at 11, — uiu be granted not by tacit con ivance at Afghan usurpation of it, out by ap explicit a.inounceuent on receipt of an official request frod-the Afghan hoveiiL.ient and then only in return for a definite quid pro quo* ^t u same tine it must be n memberec that the presen. te . i , in $ practice, convenient and that no particular advantage would accrue t to the luaian aGverii..ent fr ,m inducing the ^mir to estaolish a post Office on the hrontier. **s long as an ^f 0 ian rrade Agency exists in heshawar it y be used as a centre for hostile intrigue, and from this point of view there is no special reason for eliminating the host Otiice. Apart from certainj)bjecti naole features, such as his sale of Afghan portage stamps ana use oi postal marks for obliterating the stamps, the instit tion managed by L. Jawahir Mai is virtually that of an un-ofiicial forwarding a^ent. It seems to me therefore that the present arrangements might be allowed to continue provided the ^mir’ s ^oveinuent is prepared to apply for permission for their co: ti nun nee in a regular manner and to -tier suitable concessions to his majesty’s Government in exchange. In the event of the Afghans snowin^ disinclination to negotiate, the detention of Afghan postal messengers in t e khyber would form ar easy means of blinking them to reason.*310*3 \ in . 002- j uo( i)-,. :m Xh© Becrotaiy to tho Gorermaent ot Imia in tho ^ ^rai n ana Folitioal Dopartiaont, His lijesty 9 9 Undor Secretary of State for India, India Office, London* Dated • iml«, fr.t 19«J.

The concession which wag granted to Mr. Oweinor fore shadows a monopoly of ^otor transport between the Afghan frontier, at least, ana Kabul* The Oovermatnt of Iixlia agree with the views ex resscd by l!is Majesty 1 a Minister at Kabul in his a*s r atch Ko*4, dated the 12th January 1923 that the laonopoly on the Lakka-Kabul section w uld be a serious blow to motor firms at lesiawar which at present occasionally carry passengers between that place am Kabul urn might reasonably expect to increase their business when the condition of the road has been improved . Hence the Government of India areof opinion that His Majesty 9 a ^overmaant ou^ht not to &amp;ive any reco ’niticm of monopoly of transport on roads in Hritish ^territory* whilst British Indian notor firms are denied access to Afghan roads, and that if a monopoly of transport on Afghan ^Sk^ds is given to any foreign Com any, that ^oa any 9 B lorries \ ami cars ahoi ld stop at the frontier# Bat whether any means can he devised to coiapel them to ao so is not clear* The point is umior anamination* 3* With regard to matters of detail in the Qmeimer agjresment, (a) Articles 21 am 3(- read together raise some doubts* Article 21 provides that no goods or passengers shall oe carried free, bat does not specify that there shall be no concession rates for particular merchants or others. Article 3C compels tbo transport oestjany to deal also in merchandise, at least in one direction. If they d # i rasrahants 9 rork one way there is a great likelihood of their a &gt;iag it the other way. That raises the chance of the Coea any f 3 laerchandise being carried (not 'iree', that i? prevented by article 21 } at rates below th of coiapetin; merchants# It in somewhat &amp;rslogans to the practice at ssa of carrying *on ship f s account 11 - a practice which ie geueriilly held to he inimical to tbe development of trade# (b) It iz not clfct-i what Article 18 scans. If a monopoly of transport be riven, the conditions of working rhonld be analogous to th &gt;86 imposed in a railway 8 o&amp; any, e.g# uniforidty of rates for sa^o goods for long j^eriodn of time. It is very difficult to conduct a steady trade if transport rates are continuously varying.
