I gathered from Jerath, Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Karachi, during his recent visit to Bahrain that no further action has been taken by the Indian Posts and Telegraphs authorities regarding the installa tion of a wireless station at Dubai, 3. Jerath did however inform me that when the British Overseas Airways Corporation evacuate Sharjah - Dubai, the Indian Posts and Telegraphs would be willing to take over their wireless station and make it available for use by the general public. Is this suggestion practicable and worth pursuing? 4. Jerath has also been on opening a Post-office at Sharjah in addition to the one at Dubai, What are your views on this proposal? Lt, Col. A.C.

Dated the 27th of January, 1947. 2nd of January, 1947.^ 2. Your paragraph 3. It is possible that the Reference your letter No.8-41/9, dated the 2 . British Overseas Airways corporation may hand over their wireless station to the Royal Air Force at Sharjah as the latter need the former’s medium fre quency equipment. It might be possible to obtain fuller and more accurate information about this from the Regional Directors of B.O.A.C. and Cable &amp; Wireless both of whom are stationed at Karachi. At present messages for the public are received and sent by B.O.A.C. as agents of Cable &amp; Wireless and the telegraph traffic is about 1,000 telegrams a month producing a monthly income of approximately Rs.4,000/-. This, with the cessation of ’ , C ,, Class, is likely to increase. 3. Your paragraph 4. In 1938 it was decided to open a post office in Dubai instead of in Sharjah because the Shaikh of Sharjah insisted that down B*I. boats should invariably call at Sharjah whether there was cargo or not. I enclose acopy of the last letter of the correspondence. The P.O.T.C. now reports that the Shaikh of Sharjah has agreed verbally to waive this condition, and to provide the building which was shown to the political Agent free of rent for housing the post Office. The Shaikh is also prepared to undertake res ponsibility for the safety of the postal staff and property without charges for guards. 4. A post office at Sharjah would serve, as well as Sharjah itself, Ras al Khaimah and other States to the north and east, and with the development of oil interests on the coast there is a very good chance that the sub-rpost office would be self-supporting from its inception. We should, therefore f I think, take advantage of the generous mood of the Shaikh of Sharjah and pursue the proposal of opening a sub-post office at Sharjah. Sd./- A.C.
