The Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Foreign Office.S.W.1 # Sir, .*e have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with our letter of 16th May, 1918, with regard to the grant of this Company of Concessions covering the territories of the Sheikh of Kuweit and of the Sheikh of Bahrein and to enquire whether the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs can now see his way to instruct the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf either personally or through the Agency of the Political Agents at the various ports, to apply to the Sultan of Muscat, the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, the Sheikh of Bahrein, the Emir of Hejd and the Sheikh of Kuweit, for an exclusive prospecting licence in favour of this Company in the territories of these Rulers for oil and its allied products, viz: bitumen, pitch, ozokerite, etc,. The grant of such an extensive prospecting licence would be without prejudice to the eventual terms of concessions to be granted in the event of any oil beine; discovered. As very heavy expenditure must necessarily be incurred in prospecting in these territories for oil, no payment would become due to the Chiefs in respect of such prospecting licence, and the Company would expect to be permitted to import all requirements in this connection free of duty. Should the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs prefer that negotiations should be opened with these Chiefs by a Representative.of the Company, they would be prepared to arrange accordingly, provided that the political resident was instructed to afford such representative all necessary diplomatic support and assistance. On general political grounds it appears very desirable that all oil concessions in these territories should be in the hands of a single British Company and the activity shpwn by ^ey4e foreign oil companies in obtaining a foothold in undeveloped lands seems to indicate that some action should be taken in this direction in the near future. My Board are aware that the responsibility for these Territories has recently been transferred to the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but in view of the fact that all previous correspondence has been with the Foreign Office they have ventured to address you in the first instance with a request that their representation may be transmitted with copies of any necessary previous papers to the Colonial Office for such action as may be thought desirable. We have etc. for the Anglo Persian Oil Company Ltd. (SD)D.GARROW, paging direotor .downing street, 22nd June 19 21. Gentlemen, With reference to your letter to the Foreign Office marked 'D.G./off' of the 12th ultimo enquiring whether your application for an exclusive prospecting licence for oil and its allied products may be commonicated to the Rulers in the Persian Gulf concerned, I am directed by Mr.Secretary Churchill to inform you that he is consulting the Petroleum Department, The India Office and the High Commissioner for Mesopotamia, in the matter, and wiJL cause a further communication to be addressed to you in due course* I am etc # , (SD) J.B.SHUCKBURGH.

I am, etc., (3D)J.E.SHUCKBORGH. The Secretary. Petroleum Department# The Under Secretary of State, India Office#I (S) NOTE ON COLONIAL OFFICE PRACTICE. In Trinidad the fee charged for a prospecting licence is only l/- an acre a year, which is really the land uax in disguise. However, in the recent case of Uganda substantial fees of £4,000 for 500,000 acres and £2,000 for 300 # 000 acres have been charged. A fee may fairly be exacted for a prospecting licence, but as the amenities o. civilized Government provided in the areas now in question are probably less than in a more settled Colony or Protectorate, it is suggested that the fees should be small - say £500 to £1,000. We attach some importance to charging full royalty on any oil won during prospecting, not for the sale ol .ne money, b^t to discourage running oil concessions commercially under prospecting licences. We think that as soon as an oil tield reaches the commerdial stage of exploitation it- ought to be worked under a lease. Our usual practice is theretoie so allow some small quantity of oil, say 100 tons, to be won free for experimental purposes, and after that to impose full royalty without any of the concessions or rebates sometimes allowed in leases. As to import duties on machintry frJ supplies etc, our view would probably be that it is improper to maive any remission of an estaolished tariff one of the terms of a concession. The concessionaires should pay whatever dues are paid oy the rest of the community under existing or future laws. But as a rule Colonies do not levy duties on machinery or the implements of their industries^ and in tne undeveloped countries of the Persian Gulf it would probably be wise not to tax 'requirements' in the shape of machinery. 4o6.21.Copy of letter No.SD/l928 dated 10th August 1921 from His Excellency the High CommisBioner for Mesopotamia to the Secretary of State for Colonies,London. 1, I have the honour to reply to your letter dated the 22nd June 1921 ^0.129 regarding the desire of the Anglo Persian Oil Co,to obtain an exclusive licence to prospect for oil and its allied products in certain areas in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf littoral, 2, As recrards Fuacat am 5 the Trucial coast, the question is within the sphere of the Government of India and I cannot usefully express any view, 3, As regards Koweit and Bahrein our position as regards oil is specifically safeguarded by the Conventions of 27th October 1913 and of the 14th May 1914 respectively,and subject to any comment which Resident Bushire and the Government of India may have to make I see no objection to negotiations being opened as soon as desired, I would draw attention ^owever to the inexpediency in the case of Bahrein of a concession being given to an i Anglo Persian Oil Institution and suggest that a new subsidia -ry Co, should be formed styled perhaps 'The Arab Coast Company' or w The Arabian Oil Co', 4, Ther^ remains the case of Ibn Saud, The moment is hardly opportune for reising the questio with him;, and I re'com-aend that the matter be delayed until the situation is clearer and we know peecisely what his attitude is going to be towards our Sharifian policy in general,and towards Iraq under Faisal in particular. It is undesirable meanwhile to take any action calculated to give him a false sense of his own importance either politically or commercially.5. I am finally of opinion that it would be good policy in all these cases if the Arab Potentates concerned show that they would welcome it to clinch the negotiation 'by the payment of a fee of say 10,000/- especially if the other party exempts -the 'racMnery of the Company from Custom Duty.oubeldlary company to bo stylod 'The Arab Coast Oil (jX) Conpany', or 'Tho Arabian Oil Gonpany'• I proeruno tho sane Conpiiny would prospect all doim the Arabi m Littoral and Onan, oo porhapo it night bo stylod 'Tho Eactom Arabian Oil 0o2npany l, , imlooo operating all ovor Arabia in Trtiich oaso 'The Arabian Oil ConpanyJ or 'The Angl o-Ar abian Oil Conpany' would bo bettor. 4* As regards llusoat, sJaaci the present Council of ministers is vory ajnonablo, and I think that if they were sounded by tho Political Agont on tho subject we should find that no objection woiad be likolv that negociations rdf ^t bo opened at once with tho uscat Govermont. I^ut an tho Govorrment of India are aware the writ of tho ?ruscat Govomnont does not carry far boyond tho coast, and What view the Imam and the Oinanis would take is difficult to say. I an enquiring fron the Political Agont who has just returned to Hoadquartors if ho can give any idea on this point. 5« In respect of tho Trucial Coast, I would oboorvo that the Sheiks ^Jid Tribes of this part of the world are extraordinarily ignorant and backward # and I think that a suddon request for exclusive prospecting rights would be regarded with the greatest suspicion i*nd would raeet with dotomink opposition in all tho Sheikhdoms. these I think it would bo best in the case of/Sheikhs to endeavour, in the first instance to obtain Conventions similar to those made with luwidt and Bahrain, and later on to try for concession if tho Anglo-Persian Oil Company after poospooting in tho neighbouring countries thought it worth tfhile to prospect on the Trucial Coast. With tho oxcoption of the sheikh of Abu itedas: Dhabi the Trucial Coast Sheikhs h^ve only a narrow strip of sandy soil betweer the Oman Hills and tho seaj whether this is likely to contain oil or not of course I cannot say, but I should thir prospecting there might well be left to the last. 6. i agree with His Excellency tho rlrb connissioner thatthat it would 'be good policy for the Oonpajrxy to pay a - Imp crun to olinoh the negooiations if tho Arab Potentates ooncornod ohorr they would wolcono it end oopeoially if they agree to exempt the machinery of tho Company fron Customs dues# A copy of thfts letter is 'boin^ sent direct to the India Office.

Firstly I think any agreoKent would hare t© be nade with Sultan as it is matter ef Ferei^n peliey and Ouan is theoretically part ef his doHinie*. Matter with hiw would reeolTe iteelf into (A) aeney and he would probably acree to allow prospeetinf subject to royalty in ease #f oil being found* He would be nade to juarartee safety on coast but would kn not bo expressly (responsible for?) interior and leaye us to nake arranjeHonts with tribesnen on our responsibility. Directly this was done it would be necessary to approach Inam and tribesmen. It would be question of noney and thouth netotiations would be nost difficult it ni^ht bo possible to obtain pemission on condition that subsidy would be paid thnn theoretically for protection and if oil/ was found farther subsidy which would really typify royalty. Thic oonplicated nethod only neans as they wouffld not he bound by agreement made by fiultnn and they would consider prospecting against nomal trade and trarol. For those reasons I think emphatioally negotiation® could not bo undertaken for soroe tine.

Downing Street, 28th November, 1921, Sir, With reference to yoyrletter (P.4648) of the 1st of November forwarding correspondence with the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf and the Government of India relative to the desire of the Anglo Persian Oil Company to obtain yn exclusive licence for projecting for oil and its allied products in certain districts of Arabia and the Persian Gulf littoral, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Churchill to transmit to you the draft of a letter that it is proposed to address to the Arlgo-Persion Oil Company on the subject, and to enquire whether Mr. Secretary Kontagu concurs in the terms of that draft. I am etc., (SGD) J.SHUCKBURGK. The Under Secretary of State, India Office. mm. The Secretary, Arsglo-Persian Oil Co. Downing Street, November,1921. Sir, With reference to your letters to the foreign Office of tne 12th May and /6th October lest, regarding the appli cation of your Company for prospecting licences for oil and its allied products in certain areas in Arabia and on the Persian Gulf littoral. I am directed by Mr. Secretary Chrarchill to inform you that he has now received the observations of the Petroleum Departmeiat. the Righ Com issi oner for Iraq, and the Secretary of State for India, whom it was necess ary to consult in the matter. 2. I am to state that itewill not be practicable to obtain for your Company a single exclusive licence over tne whole of the territories mentioned in your letter of the 12th May as the native^rulers must in each case be given the opportmnity of accepting or rejecting proposals made in commercial interests. Moreover, political conditions in the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, and Ibn Saud make it impracticable for applications for licences over those territories to ber • be made at the prisent time, 3, There is no objection, howefer, to negotiations being opened immediately with the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein, but, in accordance with the terms of th^ Conventions with those territories of the 27th October, 1913, and the 14th May, 1914, respectively, it will be necessary for such negotiations to be undertaken by the Political Resident who will receive his instructions in the matter from His Majesty's Grovemment, If the Company is prepared to uication for - 4. procee/d with its app. pro spec tint: licences in Koweit and Bahrein, xlr. Churchill considers that t?ie following conditions should be submitted to the Sheikhs of those territories through the appropriate official channels: (a) In view of the Political status of the areas concerned, which are situated on the Arabian and not the Persian littoral of the Persian Bulf, it is conwidered inappropriate that application should be made on behalf of your Company under the name of the 'Anglo-Persian Oil Co.'. I am to suggest therefore that the application shoula be made in the name of 'Tne Darcy Syndicate'. (b) In the first instance, it is suggested that the application should be for an exploring licence over specified areas, which your Company should define, in each of the territories concerned, (and for) such licence to extend over a period of two years, after which a prospecting licence over smaller areas selected from those explored might be applied for, (c) It womld be necessary for a fee to be offered in return for the above-licences. The amount suggested by the High Commissioner for Iraq as appupriate for each prospecting licence is Rs. 10,00Cr,&amp;I am to enquire what fee your Company would be prepared to offer for the preliminary exploration licence. It is possible that the exemption from Customs dues of machinery usdd for prospecting could be obtained; but Mr, ChuxJeni 11 is o? opinion that no special exemption should be granted to other supplied, (d) It would be essential, also, that only a small Quantity of oil should be won free of royalty during the prospecting period for eyperimental purposes, and Mr, Chrcrchill considers therefore, that a Limit of, say, 100 tons should be fixed for that purpose in each instance. If it should be shewn that a commerical stage of exploitation in the territories has been reached, the concessions should be worked under leases to be obtained for that purpose subject to such conditions as may be agreed on between the parties with the approval cf his Majesty's G-ovemment. 5. &gt; j;&amp;ii0a 5, I am to add that amy applications made by the Company wili be submitted to the Sheikhs concerned on the distinct understanding that by granting an exclusive exploration licence, no right to an absolute monopoly for all oil exploration in the areas in perpetuity will be guaranteed, i.e. after the expiration of the period of the exploration licence, it will be open to the Sheikhs to grant to othet parties a similar licence in respect of any area not included in your prospecting licence. 6. I am to enqurie whether your Company is prepared to accept the conditions set out above end desires that the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein should be approached on the lines indicated.

'6. As regards Lowe It mid tehrein, we note that negotiations tnust be c^ndfcfted by the Political Resident under instructions from His H^Jeaty 's CJoremnient, and agree that application should be made on our behalf in the maaae of the D'Arcy Exploration Company and not in the name of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 4. although our original application was for an exploratory licence, we would prefer, if it can be arranged, that the Agreement with the respect ive Shiekha should be in the form of a Concession, in view of the desirability of settling the extent cf the participation of the Sheikhs in any profits before, and not after, oil is found. 3ut If this is not possible it would, we submit, be necessary to reserre to us under the prorislons of the Licence, th» right to the rrrant of a Concession for worcing such portions of the territories corere-l by the Licence as we may select, on terms to be agreed now. 5. As no geological exauiination has hitherto been made of She territories in luestion it would be necessary for the Licence to cover ISie whole area. In view, also, of the extent of the territories, the unsettled political conditions and the climate which does not permit of continuous field worfc, we fear that the period of two years would be quite Inadequate to permit of the thorough geological examination that would be necessary. For this we consider that a period of four years is tie mlninnsa practicable in the circumstances. v 6. e are agreeable to pay a fee of Hs.lO,0 &gt;0 in respect of each licence on condition that machinery used for prospecting should be exoript from the payment of Customs* i )ues, and that 10 i tons should be fixed as the limit of the oil that should be won, free of Hofalty, durl^ the prospecting period for experimental purposes. ?. 50 trust te^at the abore conditions meet with the approval of His Majesty's Government, and would be glad if the ShelJchs of JCoweit and Bahrein could be approached through the appropriate channels on these lines. rVe have e tc. , v ffl «RS /Jiai,rj-P:'.,^3lAf!

February, 1922, IWj (&amp; MANAGING DIREOTOR tNGLO-PERSIAN OIL COUPANY. Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Churchill to acknow- ledre the receipt of your letter of the 6th of January — . No. HSC/OFF, regardine the application of y9ur Company for the grant of prospecting licences for oil and its allied products over certain areas of the Arabian littoral and the Persian Gulf and with regaro. to the points raised in paragraph 2 thereof to inform you tnau the Resident of the Persian Gulf is bein^ instructed to take an early opportunity of nep-otiatin§ witn the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast conventions similar to^ those obtained from the Sheikhs of Koweit and Bahrein. 2. After full consideration, Mr. Churchill is disposed to concur in the view set forth in your letter, that the grant of exploration licences should be accom- pani ed by on agreement w'th the Sheikhs concerned determining in advance the extent of their participation in the profits which will eventually accrue from the development of the local oil resources under the exploitation lease ultimately granted to this Company. 3. This participation should^ in the opinion of Mr. Churchill, take the form of royalties based upon the net output of crude oil ajid in this connection, he would suggest in the special circumstances^the payment half -yearly of a flat rate royalty of Rs. 3 per ton oi net crude oil (i.e. after * deducting water and foreign substances and oil required for the customary operation of boring plant) received into the Company 's ^ield storage tanks and reservoirs: plus a variable bi-annual payment indicated in the accompanying schedule and based on the average wholesale price at Bombay of kerosene throughout tne period in question. The fixed rent^or minimum ioyalty would be put atRs. 30,000, for which an equivalent amount of oil might be taken. 4. Should the sum of the royalties drawn in one year ^ by the Sheikh equal or exceed Rs. 30,000 no fixed rant will be paid by the Company, but should these royalties orove to'be less than that amount the fixed rent would nevertheless be payable. In addition an annual surface rent of 12 annas per acre on land occupied by^the Company under the terms of the mining lease will be charged. 5. Mr. Churchill does not consider that it will be necessary in this agreement to incorporate^any detailed provisions based upon the accepted Colonial models, gover ning the conditions under whicn the work of the Company: will be conducted since such provisions may be determined when the actual grant of the mining lease is under consideration. He considers^ however, that under this Agreement, the ri^ht should oe reserved to the Sheikh, acting on the advice of the Resident to terminate the concession in the event of the failure on the part of the Company to fulfil such working conditions as may eventual ly be agreed upon or to produce adequate royalties. 6.e © I ho 6. With regard to paragraph 5 of your letter, I am to sav that Mr. Churchill would be prepared to recommend the Sheikh of Koweit to grant in return for an adequate fee an exploration licence to cover the whole of his territories for a period of two years, in the first instance, subiect lo extension for a further oeriod of two years on the Company showing to the satisfaction of tne Sheikh acting on the advice of the Resident, that such extension is justified and on the payment by the Company of an additional fee. 7. This exploration licence would normally be follow ed by the grant of a prospecting licence for t-wo years over' a reduced area, and m this connection Mr. Churchill is of opinion that the aggregate area covered by the licence should not exceed 400,000 acres, and should be divided into not more than five blocks, At the expiration of the prospecting licence a mining ie lease would be granted to J your Company over an aggregate area, not exceeding 100,000 acres, divided into not more than three blocks. 8. The case of Bahrein is^ however, somewhat different and in view of the limited extent of the territories, Mr. Churchill considers that both the exploration and the prospecting licence might justifiably comprehend the whole area, but that in respect^of the former licence no extension of the proposed period of two years should be necessary. The eventual mining lease snould, however, be governed by the same conditions as would obtain in the case of Ko?;ei^. 9. I am to point out that the minimum royalty, payable by the 'Company would be reduced proportionately should the Company decide to take up a lesser aggregate area than 100,000 acrea under &amp;he rhining lease. Company are 10. Mr. Churchill notes that your , prepared to pay a fee of Rs. 10,000 in respect of the prospecting licences in both territories; Wb he observes tnat in your letter no recommendation has been made with regard to the amount of the exploration fees. In this regard Mr. Churchill would aruggest an initial fee of Rs. 1000 subject in the case or Koweit to the payment of an additional fee of like amount should the licence be extended for a further periofl of two years. 11. I am further to explain that the grant and operation of this concession must be conditional upon the maintenance of the strictly British character of tne lessees, and that your Company will be required to give an undertaking to this effect before His Majesty's Government can proceed in the matter. 12. In conclusion f I am to point out that nothing inthis letter which is only intended to set forth briefly the main conditions upon which His Majesty's Government will be prepared to recommend the grant of licences in the specific cases of Zoweit and Bahrein, should be interpreted as in any way superseding the provisions of the model mining lease which is now generally applicable throughout the British Empire.

Sir, I am directed by Sir Philip Llovd-Greame to refer to vour letterk Ko. 5885/1922, of 15th February regarding.the ^nnlication of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for oil rights on tEe Arabian littoral of the Persian GuIj . , and to request you to inform Mr. Secretary Churchill that he concurs generally with the reply which it is proposed to,address the Company and which should provide a useful basis ot negotiations, tnougi some of the conditions may not be wholly acceptable .o tnem. 2. With regard to the question of royalty, there are difficulties in fixing a scaie of fluctuation basea on the price of kerosene at Bombay. The latter does not move freely in accordance with general market conditions, bu- is - special arrangement kept at a level somewhat below the rates ruling in other countries. It is moreover, very difficult at present to say what is likely to be the normal price o. kerosene over the next few years. On the other hand, it is hardly oossible to assess royalty on any other product as kerosene is the most important fraction of the crude oil m the Eastern trade. 3. Subject to the foregoing considerations a fluctuation clause on t-he following lines is suggested:- 'The royalty payable to be fixed at 3 rupees per ton of 2 240 I ds , with an increase of 2 annas per ton for each increase of 4 annas above 6 rupees per two wins m the price ex installation Bombay of Rang^n Victoria oil or other equivalent grade of kerosene oil. The rate for each yea^ to be calculated by taking the average of the^pnces quo^ec. at the end of each quarter of the preceding year . 4. As Mr. Churchill is aware, the rate 01 royalty in India is constant and equivalent to aoout 3 rupees per ton. and he mav wish to consider whether it might avoid comp.-iCcit/iono ii the royalty for Koweit and Bahrein were fixed at a some what higher scale, say, A rupees per ton- The ^heikhs could not iustly complain thatfche royalty was unduly low if it was 33 l/3rd per cent. higheV than that ruling m India and they might prerer to avoid the complicauions ci a^flucuuawion clause. Further, the provision for minimum royalty diminishes the importance of the actual^rate ol royalty untu a substantial production is being obtained. I am, etc., etc., (SD.) J..C.

With reference to your letter No.56754/22 of the 20th instant re^irdin^ the An^lo-Persian Oil Coinpany^s prosp territories of the Sultan of Muscat, I am directed by the application for an oi i? ectinp; licence over the ■ ■ i r j! .v ■.

It would appear that the present time is not : f^eolo^ical investir '' L * course it would pro 1 favourable for commencing p^olofdcal investigations in Oman and in the ordinary course it would probably be preferable to postpone the issue of a licence until the political conditions had improved. If, however, there is any danger of American competition for these ri/^hts as is stated to be the case, it may be desirable to allow the Aiyrlo-Persion Oil Company to secure a definite licence, with some relaxation as regards the time allowed for completing the examination rather than rely on a general assurance of priority. The fact that the Company are anxious to obtain a licence and would be prepared to pay even a small preliminary fee mirJit afford some inducement to the Sultan to accede to the wisehs of H.'l.

S ir, I have the honour to submit a copy of a letter about oil which I addressed to Kis Highness the Sultan in pursuance of the instructions contained in your Secretary's telegram Ho.2009 dated 13th December 1922. I have also the honour to submit in original His Highness 1 s reply. The agreement in its present form was received on the 5th of this month. The date* it bears is that of another agreement for which it has been substituted. The delay in obtaining the agreement in its present form has been due to difficulty in reconciling Kis Highness * s views on fitness of expression with my views on intelligibility. I find I was wrong in saying in my letter 1T0.25.C of 19th May 1022 that the existence of oil near the shores of the Gulf of I'jasirah had been verified by a messenger sent by His Highness the Sultan. I misunderstood what His Highness said about this. He said a messenger had been sent and then proceeded to give some details given him by the original reporter which I understood to have been obtained by the S. G. P. I.—247 P. A. &amp; H. B. M.

In Article I a period of 60 years is mentioned, which was new to me. It is also for 'the whole extent of the territories under his control ,, , instead of the territory within the red semi circle, as in k the paper-which you sent to me.-I pointed this out to A 0 T ## and he said that they had no intention of goin^; beyond the red line at present,-and said that if we liked he would give an undertaking that they would not do so without previous reference to H # M A Government. \ In Article 4, he had put in a clause making the Prospecting Licence renewable for two years, li|:e the Exploration Licence, 0 but cut it out on my raising the point.. I^i Article 6 , he has made the exemption from Customs dues_ permanent, instead of for ten yearB, and has also made them include the 'reasonable personable reouireswents of employees'. says une coapanjd are^very anxious to have this &amp; permanent : j ran^e^iient, and points out that Article should safeguard the - Shaikh from lo»» # In Article I told A r T # that I thought the Shaikh would never agree to the second paragraph with gentlemen like Faisal ad- i^awlsh, Ibn Hallaf, etc, at large, and he says they would not - mind giving him an additional document to the effect that they would not. actually hold him responsible in case of force majeur 0 The most difficult point was in Article X2m In the paper you sent me the rate of royalty was to be subject to revision at the end ox ten years from the date of sir:ru't.ure of the Exploratio n have not got the file wik with me but am sure this isso, whereas in his draft it was -ten years from the date of the first -payment of royalty, - i.e./a possible difference of six years The uolonial ffice letter of 29th March 1Q3S does not seem particular^ ly cle«-r on tae subject, and A.T» said he bad never read it any- thing; except his way.

In the original draft the second of uhese was-to be in the event of an extension of the Exploration Licence but on my suggesting; that it should be on liie grant of a Prospect ing Licence instecid, he agreed, or rather said tiie Shaikh could - have ifeiohever he preferred. 1 shall be very grateful if you will let me ha^e this draft Agreement back to Kuwait (where I hope t arrive on Monday morning) together with your comments, and let me know if you see any objection to my carrying on on TLheae lines, as A.i, wants me *o. On the whole it seems to me to be better than the original, and lu is a simplification to get rid of all the talk about tihe &lt;*00000 acres for the Prospecting Licence. -Xhe other qaestiqn, viz the Water Plant, ia one which I do not , like a little bit» I' enclose a copy of A.x's letter on the subject which requires little cocunent, I fail lo see what it has ^ot to do with cl Co, whose aoney the thing was paid for with, and they do not mention the fact that a considerable portion of this money which was paid by the present Shaikhs predecessor should not have ^ been paid vet according w&gt; the contract. It is a beastly Dusiness from beginning, to end, and what I hate about it so is i^hat it ismy predecessors who have let the shaikh in so, firstly in not warning 'Si '. them a perfectly impossible contracti and lastly, in the case of . . f , kcCollum, when given a power of attorney by Salim, in agreeing to Jv pay up the final settlement before it was due,. Unfortunately, how- J~~ ever, I suppose the tiling has to be settled by law - in ^ contrary ' distinction ^o Justice - so, X suppose the Shaiish would be well advised to accept their-offer and get rid of it, as I Uiink it would always be a white elephant, and difficult for him to run after the six months which 3 # So « Co, would have to run it for. ■j' i-.

ITie A.P.O.O, is the stronger and more expert organisation and in the opinion of His Majesty T s Government Yuur Highness would be well advised to givea them a year in which to select a portion of your Highness territory, so arranged that th» whole sea 'board is not ^aken up. Negotiations with the ilastem and General Syndicate could then 'be resumed by Your Highness. The A.P.O.C. have expressed their willingness to give terms at least as favourable as those offered by the Eastern General in Clause 11. 17 and 24 of the draft agreement and in other portions of the Agreement. For the present His Majesty^ Government consider that Your Highness will be well advised (apart from a lump sum payment) to secure a royalty based on output rather than a percentage share of the capital of the Company, but His Majesty's Government will be glad to advise Your Highness in due course as to the terms of agreement with the A.P.O.C.
