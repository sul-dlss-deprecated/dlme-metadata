SPBLDAR MOHAMMAP XZBMitiL. Sir I have the honour to refer to your letter Ho. D.6241-AA/49 dated the 24th October 1949, 2 # Subedar Mohammad Ibrahim was dismissed from the Muscat Levy Corps by the order of His Highness the Sultan on account of his grave irregularity of conduct in dismissing a Jemadar without the knowledge or permission of His Highness, and in view of his generally unsatisfactory conduct and attitude to the men under his command, which resulted almost in mutiny. The facts were known to the Political Agent and to the Political Resident in the P ersian Gulf, and they declined to intervene later when the Subedar appealed to them against his dismissal. 3 # The Subedar) claims to salary for October 1934, and leave salary thereafter, are invalid,since he was under suspension from the beginning of October, and both pay for this month and leave were forfeited as a result of his dismissal for irregular conduct. 4 . in the circumstances it does not seem possible for this Consulate to make any representation to the Muscat Government on this or any further petition of Subedar Mohammad Ibrahim, and I trust that the Pakistan Government will find themselves in agreement with this view.
