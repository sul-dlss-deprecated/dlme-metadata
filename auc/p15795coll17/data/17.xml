Shane interview</dc:title><dc:creator>Shane, Marion L.,</dc:creator><dc:date>1973-02-10</dc:date><dc:description>Marion Shane was an American professor of English literature at the American University in Cairo from 1960 to 1961, and served as Dean of Faculties from 1962 to 1966. Shane discusses President Raymond McLain’s personal style of leadership and the impact of his self-study initiative and under successor Thomas Bartlett AUC’s increasing engagement with the U.S. government (including for financial support, through McLain’s role as Chancellor) and the Egyptian government, and with other universities in both countries. In addition to AUC’s growth in this period (doubling of the student body, campus expansion, and construction of the new Science Building), he tells of the university’s increasing focus on its programs meeting the needs of Egyptian society and students’ careers after graduation. Undergraduate and graduate programs in Economics-Political Science (including business and public administration initiated by Chair Loren Tesdall) and Solid State Physics (by Science Chairman Adli Bishay) were developed along these lines. Fostering partnerships with universities in the U.S., according to Shane, was critical for improving units like the English Language Institute (in association with New York’s Columbia University), through visiting professorships and graduate assistantships. Other academic units like the Center for Arabic Studies and English (literature) Department are also covered, as well as AUC’s Social Research Center (with the foundation funding it received) and the situation of the Library. Faculty hiring is discussed, including the roles of the Appointment, Promotion, and Tenure Committee and the New York Office, Shane’s recruiting trips to the U.S., and efforts to attract candidates. Shane outlines his work as Dean of Faculties to regularize administrative procedures and base academic decision-making on empirical analysis. He offers a sketch of AUC students, including their class discussion and English and Arabic language skills (which prompted a new Freshman Year program and changes in Arabic language requirements), their grade consciousness, and the financial pressures many faced due to nationalization of family property. Shane draws on his own classroom experiences in discussing approaches to teaching Egyptian students and students’ receptiveness to different kinds of American literature.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
