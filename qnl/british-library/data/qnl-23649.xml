For the first sentence of Article 510 of the said Regulations, the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' When a person who was formerly in the civil or military employment of any Govern ment in India obtains re-employment, whether temporarily or permanently, in Government service or in the service of a local Fund, it shall be incumbent on him to declare to the appointing authority the amount of any gratuity, bonus or pension granted to him in respect of the previous employment.'' 2. For the note under Article 510 of the said Regulations, the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' The principle of this article applies in the case of continued employment on retirement from Government service. The amount of the pension to be declared is that sanctioned origin ally, i.e., it shall be inclusive of any amount that may have been commuted {vide Articles 524 b and 5240)/' 3. In section I of Chapter XXI of the said Regulations, the following shall be inserted as Article 510 b , namely :— ' Notwithstanding anything contained in the rules in this chapter, a wound or other extra ordinary pension sanctioned under Chapter XXXVIII of these Regulations and a wound or injury or disability pension or a disability addition to pension awarded under the military rules shall continue to be drawn by a retired Government servant, civil or military, during re-employment or continued employment, and shall be subject only to the conditions of its award. The amount of such pension or addi tion to pension shall not be taken into account when fixing the pay during re-employment or continued employment. ' Note. —Where the military pension is con solidated and service and disability elements are not explicitly differentiated, the total pen sion may be split up in the following manner. The service portion of the pension will be re presented by the service pension earned or, if no service pension has been earned, by the pro portionate service pension calculated with re ference to the minimum ordinary pension ad missible for the rank and the actual length of service rendered. In calculating this service element, an amount of 8 annas and over shall be taken as a whole rupee, amounts of less than 8 annas being ignored.

For the first sentence of Article 525 of the said Regulations!, the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' Except where it is otherwise expressly provided, the rules in section 11 of this chapter do not apply to a military officer, departmental officer, warrant or non-commissioned officer or soldier who is taken into or alio wed. to continue in civil employ after he has earned a pension under military rules.' 7. For Article 526 (a) of the said Regula tions, the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' When a person formerly in military service obtains employment in the civil department after having been granted a military pension, he shall continue to draw his military pension, but the authority competent to fix the pay and allowances of the post in which he is re employed shall have, in fixing his pay and allowances in the post in which he is re-employ ed, the power to take into account the amount of pension, including such portion of it as may have been commuted.' 8. For Article 526 (&amp;) of the said Regula tions, the following shall be substituted, namely :— ' When, however, a military officer, depart mental officer, warrant or non-commissioned officer or soldier earns a pension under military rules while he is in civil employ, the military pension shall not be granted for so long as he continues in civil employ.' 9.

New Delhiy the 17th March 1934. Deak Sie, The Secretary of State and the Government of India have recently had under consideration the quest ion of the arrangements rrg irdiiig passages provided for officers at Government expense. It has been urged that the promotion and development of Imperial Trade are dependent to a large extent upon the maintenance of the shipping of the British Empire ; and that at a time when Imperial shipping is meeting with severe and unequal competition from State-aided foreign lines it is reasonable that officers who receive grants from Government in respect ot passages should be required in the interests of the Empire to travel by Empire-owned ships. The Secretary of State and the Government of India would be reluctant to impose restrictions on the freedom which officers of the Indian Services entitled to Lee concession passages have hitherto enjoyed as rrg ^rds choice of vessel. At the same time the maintenance of Imperial shippii g is an interest ot the whole Empire and any tendency on the part of officers of the Indian Services to patronise State-aided foreign lines when traveuii g to or from India is detrimental to that interest. The Secretary of State and the Government of India therefore hope that all officers entitled to concession passages will bear these important considerations in mind and travel only by Empire ships, save in exceptional cases where there are very special reasons for travelling by foreign lines.

SLOAN, Joint Secretary to the Government of India, * \ iI ! ■Procedure to he followed when a Governmeni servant is summoned hy a court to produce official documents for the purpose of giving evidence. 4 The law relating to the production of unpublished official records as evidence in courts is contained in sections 123, 124 and 162 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (Act I of 1872), which are reproduced below: ' 123. No one shall be permitted to give any evidence derived from unpublished official records relating to any affairs of State, except with the permission of the officer at the head ot the depaitment concerned, who shall give or withhold such permission as he thinks fit. 124. No public officer shall be compelled to disclose communications made to him in official confidence, when he considers that the public interests would suffer by the disclosure. 162. A witness summoned to produce a document shall, if it is in his possession or power, bring it to Court, notwithstanding any objection which there may be to its production or to its admissibility. The validity of any such objection shall be decided on by the Court. The Comt, if it sees fit, may inspect the document, unless it refers to matters of State, or take other evidence to enable it to determine on its admissibility. If for such a purpose it is necessary to cause any document to be trans lated, the Court may, if it thinks fit, direct the translator to keep the contents secret, unless the document is to be given in evidence : and, it the interpreter disobeys such direction, he shall be held to have committed an offence under section 166 of the Indian Penal Code.' 2. For the purposes of section 123 above, the expression ' officer at the head of the department ' may be held to mean the head of the office in whose custody the document required by the courtis, and vis-a-vis the court which demands its production, that officer should be treated as the authority to withhold or give the necessary permission. . 3. In respect ot documents emanating from a higher authority, viz., the Secretary of State for India, the Government of India, or the local Govern ment, or which have formed the siityeet of correspondence with such higher authority, the head of the department should obtain the consent of the Government of India through the usual official channels before agreeing to produce the documents in court, or allowing evidence based on them,, unless the papers are of a purely routine nature, when a reference to higher authority may he dispensed with. 4. In the case of papers other than those specified in paragraph 3 above, the head of the department should not allow production of the correspondence if it relates to matters which are generally regarded as confidential, or dis closure of which would in his opinion be detrimental to public interests, or to matters which are in dispute in some other coimection, or have given rise to a controversy between Government and some other party. 5. In a case of doubt the head of the Department should invariably refer to higher authority for orders. 6. These instructions apply as well to cases in which Government is a party to the suit. In such cases much will depend on the legal advice as to the value of the documents, but before they are produced in court, the con siderations stated above must be borne in mind, and reference to higher authority made, when necessary. 7. The Government servant who is to attend a court as a witness with official documents should, where permission under section 123 has been withheld, be gwen an order duty signed by the head of the department in the accompanying form. He should produce it when he is called upon to give his evidence, and should explain that he is not at liberty to produce^the documents before the court, or to give any evidence derived from them. He should, however, take with him the papers which he has been summoned to produce. , r ff8. The head of the department should abstain from entering into corre spondence with the presiding officer of the court concerned in regard to the grounds on which the documents have been called for. He should obey the Court's orders and should appear personally, or arrange for the appearance of another officer in the court concerned, with the documents, and act as indicated in paragraph 7 above, and produce the necessary certificate if he claims privilege. / n I 10 HBORDER.

(b) I withhold permission to give any evidence derived from the files for which privilege is claimed under this order.

The following supplementary instructions are issued for the guidance of departmental officers, with special reference to cases in which prosecutions in the criminal courts are, or are likely to be, necessary — (1) All losses of the kind referred to in Article 29 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I,, must be reported forthwith by the officer concerned, not only to the Audit Officer, but also to his own immediate official superior.

(3) As soon as a reasonable suspicion exists that a criminal offence has been committed the senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will report to the District Magistrate and ask for a regular police investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. (4) If the District Magistrate agrees that an investigation may be made, the senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will (a) request the District Magistrate to arrange for the investigation to proceed from day to day, (6) see that all witnesses and documents are made available to the investigating officer; and (c) associate with the investigating officer an officer of the department who is not personally concerned with the irregu larity leading up to the loss, but who is fully cognizant of the rules and pro cedure of the office in which the loss has occurred. (5) When the investigation is completed an officer of the department (accompanied by the officer who attended the investigation) must be made available for conferences with the authority who will decide whether a prose cution should be instituted. If it is decided not to prosecute, the case must be reported through the usual channel to Government for orders.

(8) If any prosecution results in the discharge or acquittal of any person, or in the imposition of sentences which appear to be inadequate, the senior officer of the department concerned will at once consult the District Magis trate as to the advisability of instituting further proceedings in revision or appeal, as the case may be, and if the District Magistrate is of opinion that further proceedings are necessary, will request him to proceed as he would in any other case.

I am directed to invite a reference to the / Home Department letter No. F.64/l0/33-Public dated the 9th January 1934, conveying the orders of the Secretary of State for India on the subject noted ahove. It has come to the notice of the Government of India that different interpretations have heen placed on these orders and it is therefore considered necessary to remove any possible ambiguity. 2. The letter abovementioned says that 'exist ing arrangements' 1 should be maintained, subject to a reservation stated therein. Those arrangements are defined in the corresponclence mentioned in this and the following paragraph. JVorn the Pinance De partment letter No. 979-B-B- dated the 16th August 1922 and the despatch of the Secretary of utate No. 4-Financial dated the 22nd February 1923, a copy of which was forwarded to the Government of ladraa etc. with the Finance Department letter No. 602-0. S.B. dated the 26th April 1923, it will be observed that the Secretary of State held:- ll) that service in an Indian State in the case of an officer on leave preparatory to retire ment on nronortionate if permitted by the Government of India, should ordinarily, and in the absence- 2 - aTDsence of the special circumstaDces defined in the despatch, 'be treated as private employment U.e, the officer should he allowed to receive leave salary in addition to remuneration from the Indian State); (2) that officers ahout to retire on ordinary laeTisiQn should he treated on similar lines, i.e. (a) in the usual case, of an officer who has reached or is approaching the age of superannuation, the officer should he allowed to take any leave which w oula he admissihle to him had he not accepted such employment, and pension contribution should not he Ih) in exceptional cases which would justify such a course, acceptance of the employment might he made conditional on t he officer remaining in the ser vice of Government and 'being placed on the usual Foreign Service terms. 3. The question then arose whether the concession of treating as private employment service in an Indian State during leave preparatory to retirement should he enjoyed hy officers who are in foreign service at the time they apply for such leave. The Government of India held in the Finance Department letter No.7.4 (45)K.1/51 dated the 21st December 1931 that the concession shoud not he granted to officers who are already in foreign service at the time they apply for leave and who propose to continue on duty in the service of the same employer during the leave. The reason for that ruling, as explain ed in that letter, was that the concession was intend ed to facilitate the securing of post-pension employment hy-3- 'by officers proceeding on leave preparatory to retire ment, a consideration which does not o'btain when offi cers are already in foreign service. 4. These orders had the effect of differentiating between officers already in the service of Indian 'tates and those who proposed to accept private employ ment in a »-tate while on leave preparatory to retire ment. It was with a view to remove this differentia tion that the question was again reviewed; and it was decided, in consultation with the Secretary of otate, as shown in the Howe Department letter No.F.61/10/33- Public dated the 9th January 1934 that the concession of drawing leave salary during leave preparatory to retirement in addition to pay from an Indian ^tate should not he granted to officers retiring on proportion ate pension or 'before reaching the age of superannuation if they take such leave after 'being offered or having made arrangements for employment in a 'itate; and that in such circumstances the officer should he required either to retire or go on foreign service terms, 5. n he expression 'the concession ...should not he granted to officers retiring on proportionate pension, or before reaching the age of superannuation^ is sus ceptible of two interpretations, as followai- U) the concession should not he granted U) to officers retiring on proportionate pension, and (h) to ofileers retiring before re-' ching the a^ e of superannua tion; and 12) the concession should not be granted to offi cers retiring on proportionate pension, nor should it be'be granted before reactiing the age of superannuation. (The ambiguity is more apparent if a conmia follows ^proportionate pension' than if it does not). Interpretation (2) restricts the concession more severely than does interpretation (l), and amounts (where the condition introduced 'by the 'if* clause is satisfied) to refusal of the concession during all leave preparatory to retirement. Interpretation (l) and not interpretation (2) expresses the intention; that is, in effect, the concession is ioadmissihle only where the following ingredients occur - (i) premature retirement and (ii) the previous offer, or arrangement, of employment in an Indian Jtate. The concession of drawing leave salary as well as pay from the Indian State is permissible when the leave is the last leave taken before or after reaching the age of superannuation, except when the officer is already in foreign service when he applies for such leave. lit will, however, always 'be open to the autho rity concerned, in the exceptional cases contemplated 'by clause ('b) in paragraph (2) of the despatch of the Secretary of ^tate No.4 financial dated the 22nd Feb ruary 1923, to require that the officer should remain in the service of the Orovernment and be placed on the usual Foreign Service terms). 6. I am to request that in applying the orders to cases which come under the consideration of the local Crovernment, their correct interpretation may be borno in mind.No.F,661/35-Judicial.

Netv Delhi, the 4th December 1935. S ubject:— Revision of the Warrant of Precedence. S ir, The last general revision of the Warrant of Precedence was made in 1922 and was based on the report of a committee which examined the war rant in 1908. The revision made in 1930 was not a general one. Local Governments were novt consulted. The few changes which were then made in the position of officers already included in the warrant were the result of representations made direct to the Government of India. Advantage was also taken of that revision to include new appointments, to omit appoint ments which had been abolished, and to amend the designations of appoint ments where these had been changed. In view of the approaching constitu tional changes the Secretary of State has asked that a further general revi sion of the warrant should be undertaken in time to enable him to submit a new warrant to His Majesty before the introduction of Part III of the Government of India Act, 1935, so that the new warrant may take effect from that date. 2. While they will be glad to consider any recommendations which local Governments desire to make in regard to the warrant, the Government of India are provisionally of the opinion that the general structure of the existing warrant shoud be maintained and that the changes should be confined to the following objects:— (i) the inclusion of new appointments which will be created as a result of the constitutional changes, (ii) the omission of appointments which have already been abolished or will be abolished as a result of constitutional changes, and also of appointments in Burma and Aden, (ill) the inclusion of appointments which have been allotted places, in the warrant by Notification under note 6 since the last re vision, (iv) the making of such amendments as may be required by the gra dual substitution of provincial services in place of certain All- India Services, (v) the removal of anomalies and the clarification of the warrant in matters in regard to which any difficulty of interpretation has been experienced.2 3. J a oi dcr to laciiitate the examination of the warrant the Govern- meiift of India have had it reprinted in draft form which— (i) omits appointments that have been, or will be, abolished and also appointments in Burma and Aden, (ii) includes appointments which have been given places by notifica tion under note 6 since the last revision, (iii) includes appointments in the new provinces which are of the same class as certain appointments in existing provinces, (iv) gives effect to certain minor changes which have been proposed since the last revision and approved in principle but which have been held up pending a general revision. A copy of this draft together with an explanatory departmental memo randum is enclosed. Local Governments will understand that the draft warrant is intended only to facilitate the consideration of changes in the warrant and as a basis of discussion. The memorandum is a purely depart mental one and where any views are expressed in it these should not be re garded as the views of the Government of India. In addition to explaining changes included in the draft warrant the memorandum refers also to certain proposed changes, the consideration of which has been postponed until the revision of the warrant was undertaken. 4. As local Governments are already aware, the Government of India desire to discuss the amendment of the warrant with representatives of local Governments at a conference to be held in the week beginning Monday January 13, 1936. I am to ask, therefore, that the Governor in Council will give the matter very early consideration so that he may formulate his views in time for these to be presented at the conference. It will facilitate the conference proceedings if the Governor in Council can submit by Jan uary 6, 1936, his views on any important points which he would like brought to the notice of the conference. I have the honour to be, S ir, Your most obedient servant. T. SLOAN, Joint Secretary to the Government of India. No. F.-49/9/35-P ublic.

SLOAN, Joint Secretary to the ■ Government of India. OIPD—307 HD—-5-12-35—3,000.A M emorandum on the revision of the W arrant of P recedence. Article 5. —Burma and Orissa have been omitted. Article 6. —The N.-W. F. P., Sind and Orissa have been added. Article 7. —The position of the Chief Justice and Judges of the Federal Court will have to be considered. Article 13. —(i) The Chief Commissioner of the N.-W. F. P., and the Commissioner in Sind have been omitted. The status of the latter officer will be reduced by the establishment of the new province and he should be placed in another article. The Revenue and Divisional Commissioner, N.-W. F. P. was placed in articles 28 and 34, in 1933, and these articles would appear to be suitable for the equivalent officers in Sind and Orissa. (ii) The members of Executive Councils have been omitted from this article and also from articles 15, 16 and 18. (iii) The Resident and Commander-in-Chief at Aden has been omitted from this article and other Aden Officials from other articles of the warrant on the assumption that Aden will be separated from India by the time the new warrant is introduced. Articles 15 and 16. —See article 13 (ii) above. Orissa has been omitted. Article 17. —The Chief Commissioner, N.-W. F. P., has been omitted. Article 18. —See article 13 (ii) above. The Ministers of the N.-W. F. P., Sind and Orissa have been added. Article 19. —In some provinces there will be two Chambers of the Legislature, the Council and the Assembly. The Presidents of the Councils may perhaps remain in article 19 as at present and Presidents of the Assemblies in a new article immediately below article 19. That precedence should, as at present, be confined to the Presidents within their respective provinces. It is for consideration whether Presidents should also be given precedence when outside their provinces. The question of the precedence to be given to Presidents in Simla and Delhi has sometimes arisen. It would be desirable to give such a precedence if this could be done without giving rise to fresh anomalies. Within their provinces Presidents are above Chief Secretaries. If that relative position were to be maintained outside their provinces they could not be placed below article 25. On the other hand if they were to be placed below the Chief Secretaries of their provinces when outside the provinces and the existing relative position of Chief Secretaries is not altered, then Presidents must be placed below article 34 Any mid way position would give rise to the anomaly of some Presidents bein^ below and others being above Chief Secretaries when outside their provinces. Article 23.—The Air Officer Commanding, R. A. F. in India, is to be included in article 21 if the Air Ministry can guarantee that he will always been COTrected designation of the Mag Officer Commanding has Article 24.- The Commissioner in Sind and the Controller of Civil Accounts have been omitted and the Secretary to the Governor -General's Executive Council has been added. Qi A l tule 26 -~ Th e Judicial Commissioners of the Central Provinces and 1 'i fi t?- ! n or ^ 1 ' ed 1 and also the Development Commissioner, Burma and the Director of Development, Bombay. oAA i rtie rt ^.—^e Chairman. Madras. Services Commission has been • ( ed. I he designation of this officer will require alteration, and it is for p'ulf r e ^ ^her'his is the most suitable place for the Chairmen of the Public Service Commissions which will be set up in other provinces. The in'\osn n r', ) f 0 h!'r n ir f T* ad( | ed . b y notification under note 6 to the warrant ■ er t ' lan hv inclusion in the warrant issued in that vear so 307 HD J ^ ^as to facilitate reconsideration when Commissions were established in other provinces. In Madras the Chairman ranks below the Chief Secretary and Members of the Board of Revenue, There are no Commissioners in that pro vince. If the Chairmen of the Commissions in other Provinces, except Bombay and Bengal, are also placed in article 27 they will be above both Com missioners and Chief Secretaries. The Chairman of the Public Service Com mission ranks in article 22 above all Secretaries to the Government of India and on this analogy there would appear to be no serious objection to placing the Chairmen of the Provincial Commissions above the Chief Secretary and there is perhaps no greater objection to having the Chairman of the Commission above the Commissioners than there is having the Vice-Chan- cellor of a University above him. On general grounds it is desirable that the same place should be given in all provinces. It would be difficult now to lower the place of the Madras Chairman. These difficulties could be solved if the Chairmen were placed in article 24, if this is not considered too high. The points for consideration seem to be :— (1) Should the same place be allotted to the Chairmen in all pro vinces ? (2) Should that place be above or below— (a) Commissioners within their divisions, (b) Chief Secretaries? (3) What place (a) above or (b) below the officers mentioned in (2) would be suitable? (4) What place the local Government recommends having regard purely to local considerations? The same difficulty does not arise in the case of Members and the only point for consideration is whether article 44 is considered generally suitable. Article 28. —The Controller of Railway Accounts^ the Deputy Auditor General in India and the Revenue and Divisional Commissioners, N.-W. F. P., Sind and Orissa have been added. The Revenue and Divisional Commissioner, N.-W. F. P., was included in this article by notification in 1983 and, as stated, under article 13 above this article would appear to be suitable for the Sind and Orissa appointments. Article 30. —The position of the Advocate General, Bengal, will to some extent be altered. He will no longer be appointed by His Majesty and he will in future be purely an officer of the Government of Bengal. It is for consideration whether he should not be placed in the same article as the Advocates-General, Madras and Bombay. The positions to be allotted to the Advocate-General for India and also of 'the other provincial Advo'- oates General is for consideration. Article 32. —The Chief Secretary to the Government of the N.-W. F. P., was excluded from this article and included in article 34 by notification in 1933. If the existing relative position of Chief Secretaries is maintained this article will require amendment so as to exclude also the Chief Secre taries of Sind and Orissa. The Chief Secretaries to these local Governments have been placed along with the Chief Secretaries to the Assam and N.-W. .F. P., Governments in article 34. Article 33. —The Chief Controller of Standardisation, Railway De partment has been added. The responsibilities of the Heads of Departments included in this article vary to a considerable extent and it seems desirable to consider whether changes are i^ot required. The Home Department have already suggested that Director, Intelligence Bureau, should be raised to article 26. Article 54.—The cases of the Chief Secretaries and Revenue and Divi sional Commissioners included in this article have been dealt with under lartides 28 and 32.The position of the Chief Commissioner, Delhi, was considered recently when the decision reached was that no charges be made before the general revision of the warrant. The matter is now one for further consideration. Article 35. —A point for consideration is whether Additional and Joint Secretaries to local Governments should not now be placed in a lower article than Secretaries. It is understood that such appointments are somewhat rarely made in provinces. In the Government of India they have already been placed in a lower article than Secretaries. They might suitably be placed in article 36. Article 36. —(i) The position of the Inspectors General and other police officers has recently been considered in consultation with local Governments in correspondence which began with the Home Department letter No. F. 106/ 19/34-Police, dated January 15th, 1935, but in view of the fact that a general revision of the warrant is now being undertaken no recommenda tion has been made to the Secretary of State. In that letter the Government of India suggested that the Inspectors-General of the larger provinces should be placed in article_ 33 and the Inspectors General of Assam, the N.-W. F. P., Sind and Orissa in article 35. Two objections of a general nature were urged by certain local Governments against these and other proposals to raise the position of police appointments in the warrant. These were (i) that this action would be politically inadvisable and (ii) that it would cause jealousy and heart-burning among the officers of other services and departments. The Home Department were not disposed to attach much weight to these general objections because the special position of the police is recognised in the new Government of India Act and also because they do not consider that the changes suggested in the position of these police appointments would attract much public attention or have any political re actions. The specific objections raised to the proposal regarding the Inspec tors General were (a) that the change would place Inspectors General above the heads of certain other departments and also above Secretaries to local Governments and Commissioners; and (h) that it would also place Inspectors General in an article which is at present confined to officers of the Central Government. The Home Department feel that the Inspectors General will have so much greater responsibility for the peace and good government of the provinces than the head of any other department that there is justification for placing them above the heads of other provincial departments. In the case of Secretaries the objection raised was that the change misrH place an officer giving an order above an officer to whom the order is addressed. This objection seems to overlook the fact that Secre taries issue orders in the name of the local Government and not in their own names and that at present they issue orders to officers who rank higher than themselves in the warrant, e.g., Commissioners and members of the'Board of Revenue. Fven if the Inspector General is raised to articles 33 and 35 the Commissioners will still remain above him within their divisions and there seems to be no serious objection to these officers being below the Inspector General outside their divisions. The matter should be considered further in the light of these remarks. (ii) The Director of Commercial Audit was ^iven courtesv rank in this article in 1929. The post was then on a temporary basis. It is for consi deration if the post should now be included in the warrant. (iii) The following posts have been added : — Chief Accounts Officers, North Western, Eastern Bengal and G. I. P. Railways, ' Director, Railwav Clearing Accounts Office, and Senior Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs. (iv) It was proposed in 1930 to include Chief Medical Officers of Pro vinces and Agencies in this article. It is for consideration whether that proposal should now be pursued.(v) It was proposed in 1934 to include the President of the Court of Wards, United Provinces in this article. The Government of India preferred to await the general revision of the warrant and suggested that article 40 would be sufficiently hi^h. There may be similar posts in other provinces. Article 40. —In reply to the Home Department letter referred to under the previous article three of the local Governments concerned were opposed to any change in the position of Commissioners of Police and it does not seem necessary to pursue this matter further. Article 41- —The Collectors of Salt Revenue, Madras and Bombay, within their respective charges have been added, and the Opium Agent, Ghazipur, omitted. Article 42. —(i) Director, Regulations and Forms in the Army Depart ment has been substituted for the Establishment Officer. (ii) It was proposed in 1931 to transfer the Director-General of Commercial Intelligence from this article to article 36. It is for considera tion whether that proposal is to be pursued. Article 44- —(i) In the correspondence referred to under article 36 the Government of India provisionally suggested raising Deputy Inspectors General of Police from article 44 to article 42. There was no strong opposi tion to this proposal and subject to the consideration of any further views expressed by local Governments it may be given effect to. (n') Civilian Superintendents of Clothing Factories havf been omitted and the following appointments added: — Comptroller, N.-W. F. P., Deputy Chief Controller, Standardisation, Railway Department. Deputy Director General of Posts and Telegraphs (Finance), and Members,. Madras Services Commission. (iii) If the Chief Accounts Officers in Sind and Orissa are to be Comptrollers, this would appear to be the suitable article for them. (^iv) It is for consideration whether this is also the most suitable article for members of the other provincial Public Service Commissions. (v) The position to be allotted to the Chief Inspector of Lighthouses, the Nautical Adviser and the Chief Surveyor with the Government of India was considered in 1930. All these officers were given courtesy rank in article 44. They were not included in the warrant because the two latter appointments were only temporarv. It is for consideration if the appoint ments should now be included in this article. (vi) A proposal was made in 1932 to place Command Junior Controllers of Military Accounts in this article. It is for consideration whether the proposal should now be pursued. Article .£5.—The Assay Master, Bombay, Deputy Auditors General, and the Deputy Controller of the Currency, Northern India, have been omitted. The one remaining officer, Deputy Controller of the Currency, Calcutta, can perhaps be ranked along with the officers in article 46. Article 48. —The following officers have been added :— Deputy Chief Accounts Officers, State Railways, Deputy Controller of Railway Accounts, Deputy Controllers of Stores, East Indian, North Western, and G. I. P. Railways, and Supervisor of Railway Labour. Article 49. —(i) The Director of Fisheries, Madras, has been transferred to article 58 in accordance with the recommendation made by the local Gov ernment in 1931. The Government of Bengal will no doubt consider whether their Director of Fisheries should remain in this article. (ii) The Superintendent of Manufacture, Clothing Factory, Shahjahan- pur, has been added.(iii) A proposal was considered in 1930 to transfer the Chief Inspector of Stores and Clothing from this article to article 44. It is for consideration whether this change should now be made. Article 51. —Secretaries to the Agent to the Governor General for the 'Deccan States and Resident at Kolhapur, to the Agent to the Governor General for the Gujrat States and Resident at Baroda, and to the Agent to the Governor General Eastern States have been added. Article 52. —The Central Publicity officer, Railway Board, has been added. A rticle 5A. —The Government of Bombay in 1932 recommended that the Sheriff of Bombay should be raised from article 54 to article 36. The proposal was reserved for consideration when the warrant was next revised. It might be difficult to raise the Sheriff of Bombay unless the the Sheriffs of Madras and Calcutta were also raised and it is desirable to have the views of the Governments of Madras and Bengal on this proposal, as well as the views of the Government of Bombay as now constituted. Article 55. —The following officers have been added : — Collectors of Salt Revenue, Madras and Bombay. Deputy Secretaries to local Governments. | Articles 56. (i) The interpretation of the word ''standing' as used in this article and also in articles 59 and 60 has given rise to some difficulty. In the case of a post borne on the cadre of a regular service the intention was to gi\e the precedence of the article to officers holding the particular post who had ser\ed the number of years specified in the article in the service on the cadre of which the post is borne. But it is reasonable that an officer who has been promoted from a lower service should not rank for precedence below an officer who is graded below him in the higher service, and it is in such cases that difficulty has arisen in interpreting the word 'standing'. If, for example, A &amp; B are Superintendents of Police, A being an officer promoted from the provincial service and B a direct recruit to the Indian Police, A may be senior to B but only have 10 years' service in the Indian Police while B has 20 years service. In that case B would rank in article 56 and it would be unreasonable that A should rank lower but on a narrow interpretation of the word 'standing' he might do so. The Home Depart ment are not anxious to disturb the existing expression 'of 20 years standing' etc., unless this has given rise to such difficultv as to be the cause of serious inconvenience. Local Governments will no doubt consider this matter and express their views. (ii) The following officers have been added : — The Deputy Director of Administration and ^ Intelligence. C l n di an Stores The Deputy Director of Inspection. ) Department. The Deputy Secretary, Railway Board. Officers (of both Men's and Women's Branches) of the Provincial Educational Service, Class I, of 18 years standing. Officers of the Bengal Pilot Service of 21 years standing. Accounts Officer, Grade I, of the Indian Railways Accounts Service of 20 years standing. Assistant Executive Engineers of 20 years standing. (iii) The inclusion of officers of the Provincial Educational Service raises the question of the inclusion also of officers of other Provincial Services which will replace All-India Services. Local Governments will no doubt take this matter into consideration. (iv) Assistant Executive Engineers were included in this article and also in article 60 on the ground that Assistant Divisional Engineers had previously been included in the warrant. It is for consideration whether the position of Assistant Executive Engineers is sufficiently different from that of Assistant Magistrates or Assistant Superintendents of Police as6 to merit their inclusion in the warrant. Admittedly an Assistant Magis trate or an Assistant Superintendent of Police of even 12 years standing is somewhat exceptional and of 20 years' service practically non-existent. Even if there are Assistant Executive Engineers of that standing it seems very doubtful whether they have any title to inclusion in the warrant. Article 58. —The Director of Fisheries, Madras (see article 49 above) and the Public Analyst to the Government of Madras have been added. Article 59. —(i) In the correspondence referred to under article 36 the position of Superintendents of Police of less than 20 years standing was considered. The Government of India suggested that all Superintendents of 1.5 years standing and upwards should be included in article 56 and that those of lower standing should, as at present, be in article 60. The replies of local Governments show that while a majority of these Govern ments were in favour of raising the position of these officers there was some divergence of opinion as to how this could best be effected. Some Govern ments prefer to give Superintendents special precedence within their own districts and article 56 was suggested as a suitable place. The Home De partment adhere to the view that the position of Superintendents should be raised and do not now object on principle to the grant of special local pre cedence. The matter for consideration is therefore narrowed down to the most suitable method of effecting the change and the following alternatives might be considered: (a) the original proposal that Superintendents of 15 years standing and upwards should be placed in article 56, and (b) that Superintendents within their own districts be given special precedence, say, in article 50, and that the position of Super intendents outside their own districts remain as at present. (ii) The designation of the Inspector of General Stores has been amend ed. (iii) It was proposed in 1932 to include the Assistant Military Account ant General in this article. It is for consideration whether the proposal should now be pursued. Article 60. —The Inspector of Clothing Stores, Shajahanpur, has been omitted and the following officers added:— Officers (of both Men's and Women's Branches) of the Provincial Educational Service, Class I, of 10 ^ears standing. Accounts Officers, Grade I, of the Indian ^ Railways Accounts Service of 12 years standing. Assistant Executive Engineers. ) Article 61. —(i) The following officers have been added:— Divisional Engineers, Telegraphs y of less than 12 years standing. Divisional Engineers, Wireless ) Officers of the Bengal Pilot Service of 10 years standing. (ii) The designation of the Secretary to the Board of Revenue, Madras, has been amended. (iii) The attention of the Government of India has been drawn to the fact that while Executive Engineers and Deputy Conservator of Forests ot 2 vears standing have equality of rank in article 60 the Executive Engineers of less than 12 vfars standing are given rank in article 61 while Divisional Forest Officers of less than 12 years standing are given no place m the war rant It has been suggested that Divisional Forest Officers of less than 12 years standing should be added to article 61. This matter is for considera tion.7 (iv) Another point to which the attention of the Government of India has been drawn is that while Superintendents of Central Jails and Civil Surgeons who are not members of the I. M. S. are given rank in article 61, the Superintendents of Central Jails and Civil Surgeons who are mem bers of the I M. S. but are below the rank of Major have no place in the warrant. This anomaly might be removed by the substitution of the fol lowing for the existing entry 'Superintendents of Central Jails and Civil- Surgeons who are not included in any other article by virtue of their military rank'. (v) The Chief Inspector of Factories and Boilers in Bengal and Bombay are included in this article. In the present year the Government of Assam proposed that the post of Chief Inspector of Factories and the Chief In spector of Boilers in that province should be included in the warrant. There appear to be Chief Inspector of Factories and also Chief Inspectors of Boilers in certain other provinces. The question of the inclusion of the Assam appointment is therefore not a separate one. .'fudged by pay the appointment of Chief Inspector of Boilers in Assam does not merit inclu sion. On principle there will be no objection to the inclusion of the post of Chief Inspector of Factories in article 61. (vi) There was a proposal in 1933 to include the Superintendent, Opium Factory. Ghazipur, and the Opium Chemist, in this article. It is for consideration whether the proposal should now be pursued. GIPD—307 HD—6-12-35—3,000.george r. i.

THORNE, E squire , C.T.E., I.C.S., Additional Joint Secretary to the Government of India, T he CHIEF COMMISSIONERS, COORG, DELHI, ANDAMAN AND NICOBAR ISLANDS and ADEN. New Delhi, the 16th November 1935. S ubject : Departmental enquiry in cases of fraud and emhezzlemeid of Government money in which Government servartfs are involved. In the Finance Department letter No. D./243-A., dated the 21st June 1929, general principles were laid down to regulate the enforcement of respons ibility for losses sustained by Government through fraud or negligence of Government servants. It was therein stated (among other things) that it is of the greatest importance to avoid delay in the investigation of any such loss ; that, where it appears that recourse to judicial proceedings is likely to be involved, competent legal advice should be taken as soon as the possibi lity emtrges ; that, where there is a reasonable suspicion of fraud or other criminal offence, a prosecution should be attempted unless the legal advisers consider that the evidence available is not such as will secure a conviction ; and that, w here loss is due to delinquencies of subordinate officials and where it appears that this has been facilitated by laxity of supervision on the part of a superior officer, the latter also should be called strictly to account. These principles were supplemented by instructions contained in'the memorandum attached to the Home Department letter No. F.-317/34-Judl. dated the 19th April 1934. These instructions had special reference to cases m which prosecutions in the criminal courts are, or are likely to be, necessary • and laid down (among other things) that, as soon as a reasonable suspicion exists that a criminal offence has been committed, the senior officer of the department will report to the District Magistrate and ask for a regular police investigation ; and explained the procedure that should follow the investiga tion. &amp; . ^ ^ or convenience of reference these two memoranda are attached to this letter. It is now desired to explain as clearly as possible what is neces- sary to be done in the way of departmental enquiry where a prosecution is, or is likely to be, instituted. It has been found that, where fraud or tmbezzle- I ^ ei i t of Government ^nds has occurred, there is a tendency for the head ot the office or department to regard the institution of criminal proceedings as absolving him from the unpleasant and often laborious task of conducting immediately a thorough departmental enquiry. This natural reluctance may be enhanced by an apprehension that an enquiry may prejudice the result of the trial in a court of law. As a result, there has sometimes been grea,. delay m taking departmental proceedings and the results have been inconclusive. The Public Accounts Committee in their report on the accounts 4 iI of 1933-34 have agreed with the Auditor-General that departmental en quiries should not necessarily be delayed pending decision of criminal cases, as at a later stage the evidence might disappear and the departmental enquiry could not be brought to any con&lt;sJu^ion at all. 3. Experience shows that departmental proceedings cannot as a rule proceed concurrently with a criminal prosecution. Much of the evidence in a case of fraud or embezzlement is documentary. As soon as the criminal proceedings begin the documents go to the court as exhibits, and there they must remain till the case is over and (if an appeal is filed) till the appeal is over. But it is essential that everything should be done to cany the depart mental proceedings as far as possible before prosecution begins. The stage to which departmental proceedings, prior to prosecution, should be taken must depend on circumstances and cannot be precisely defined. The normal procedure is laid down in Rule 55 of the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules : and the stage which departmental proceedings can reach may according to circumstances be any one of the stages described or implied in the Rule— i.e., the preliminary recording of evidence, the receipt of the delinquent's written statement after the framing of a charge, the per sonal hearing, or the enquiry. If it is intended to prosecute, a finding and sentence should not be recorded in the departmental proceedings till after the disposal of the criminal case ; but it must be emphasised that the pro ceedings should be completed up to the point that can properly be reached. 4. A common type of case is that where a number of persons are involved one or more criminally, and others in such circumstances as show negligence, or warrant the suspicion of criminal abetment without sufficient proof to justify prosecution, or have similar features which necessitate a criminal prosecution of one or more and a departmental enquiry against others. In such cases the authority has sometimes neglected to institute a formal departmental enquiry, or to carry it to the requisite stage, before criminal proceedings are taken, with the result that many months later, when the criminal case is over, effective departmental action has been found impracti cable. 5. The general rule should be that in all cases of fraud, embezzlement, or similar offences departmental proceedings should be instituted at the earliest possible moment against all the delinquents and conducted with strict adherence to the Rules up to the point at which prosecution of any of the delinquents begins. At that stage it must be specifically considered whether further conduct of the departmental proceedings against any of the remaining delinquents is practicable ; if it is, it should continue as far as possible (which will not, as a rule, include finding and sentence). If the accused is convicted and awarded an adequate sentence; the departmental proceedings against him will be formally completed, and the proceedings against other delinquents continued. If the accused is not convicted, or the accused is inadequately punished, the departmental proceedings against him will be resumed, as will also those against the remaining delinquents. 6. The proceedings contemplated in these instructions are those which are regulated by the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules. Where action is taken under the Public Servants (Inquiries) Act XXXVII of 1850, this ordinarily takes the place of a criminal prosecution as regards the person or persons 'ace used ; but the procedure as regards other persons involved against whom the Act is not employed should be in accordance with the instructions given above.

MEMORANDUM. In the memorandum circulated with the Government of India, Finance Department, letter No. D./243-A., dated the 21st June 1929, the general prin ciples regulating the enforcement of responsibility for losses sustained by Government through the fraud or negligence of individuals were fully stated. The following supplementary instructions are issued for the guidance of departmental officers, with special reference to cases in which prosecutions in the criminal courts are, or are likely to be necessary :— (1) All losses of the kind referred to in Article 29 of the Civil Account Code, Volume I, must be reported forthwith by the officer concerned, not only to the Audit Officer, but also to his own immediate official superior. Reports must be submitted as soon as reasonable grounds exist for believing that a loss has occurred ; they must not be delayed while detailed enquiries are made. (2) Reports submitted under (1) above must be forwarded forthwith to Government through the usual channel with such comments as may be considered necessary . (3) As soon as a reasonable suspicion exists that a criminal offence has been committed the senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will report to the District Magistrate and ask fur a regular police investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. * By usual letter.• k &lt;&gt; w (4) If the District Magistrate agrees that an investigation may be made, the senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will (a) request the District Magistrate to arrange for the investigation to proceed from day to day, (b) see that all witnesses and documents are made available to the investigating officer, and (c) associate with the investigating officer an officer of the department who is not personally concerned with the irregu larity leading up to the loss, but who is fully cognizant of the rules and pro cedure of the office in which the loss has occurred. (5) When the investigation is completed an officer of the department (accompanied by the officer who attended the investigation) must be made available for conferences with the authority who will decide whether a prose cution should be instituted. If it is decided not to prosecute, the case must be reported through the usual channel to Government for orders, (6) If it is decided to prosecute, the departmental representative will ascertain from the prosecuting officer whether, having regard to the engage ments of the prosecuting staff, and the state of work in the court which would ordinarily hear the case, it is necessary to move the District Magistrate to make special arrangements for a speedy trial, and will request the pro secuting officer to make any application that he may think necessary. (7) When the case is put into court by the Police, the senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will see that all witnesses serving in the department, and all documentary evidence in the control of the department, are punctually produced, and will also appoint an officer of the department (preferably the officer who attended the investigation) to attend the proceedings in court and assist the prosecuting staff. (8) If any prosecution results in the discharge or acquittal of any person, or in the imposition of sentences which appear to be inadequate, the senior officer of the department concerned will at once consult the District Magis trate as to the advisability of instituting further proceedings in revision or appeal as the case may be, and if the District Magistrate is of opinion that further proceedings are necessary, will request h:m to proceed as he would in any other case. Appeals against acquittals can be made only under the orders of a Local Government. (9) The senior officer of the department concerned present in the station will see that, in addition to the reports required under (1), (2) and (5) above, prompt reports are submitted to Government through the usual channel regarding— (а) the commencement of a police investigation ; (б) the decision to prosecute in any particular case ; (c) the result of any prosecution ; {d) the decision to proceed further in revision or appeal in any case ; (e) the result of any proceedings in revision or appeal. (10) Notwithstanding anything contained in (2)—(9) above, the senior officer of the Department concerned present in the station may, if he thinks fit, refer any matter through the usual channel for the orders of Government before taking action. Note -—In Delhi, the Superintending Engineer concerned will discharge the duties imposed above on the senior officer of the Department concerned present in the station.

Copy also forwarded to all Provincial Governments for information. A memorandum of general principles to regulate the enforcement of responsibility for losses sustained hy Government through fraud or' negligence of individuals. 1. Means should be devised to ensure that every Government servant realises fully and clearly that he Avill be held personally responsible for any loss sustained by Government through fraud or negligence on his part, and that he will also be held personally responsible for any loss arising from fraud or negligence on the part of any other Government servant to the extent to which it may be shown that he contributed to the loss by his own action or negli gence. The cardinal principle governing the assessment of responsibility in such cases is that every public officer should exert the same vigilence in respect of public expenditure and public funds generally as a person of ordinary prudence would exercise in respect of the expenditure and the custody of his own money. While, therefore. Government are prepared to condone an officer's honest errors of judgment involving financial loss, pro vided the officer can show that he has done his best up to the limits of his ability and experience, they are determined to penalise officers who are dishonest, careless or negligent in the duties entrusted to them. 2. It is of the greatest importance to avoid delay in the investigation of any loss due to fraud, negligence, financial irregularity, etc. If the irregularity is detected by audit in the first instance,' it will be the duty of the audit officer to report immediately to the administrative authority concerned. If the irregularity is detected by the administrative authority in the first instance, and if it is one which should be reported to the audit officer in terms of Article 20, Civil Account Code, Volume I, he must make that report immediately. Every important case should be brought to the notice of superior authority as soon as possible—the administrative authority should report to his superior and the audit authority to his superior. Should the administrative authority require the assistance of the audit officer in pursuing the investigation, he may call on that officer for all vouchers and other documents that may be relevant to the investigation ; and if the investigation is complex and he needs the assistance of an expert audit officer to unravel it, he should apply forthwith for that assistance to Government who will then negotiate with the audit officer for the services of an investigating staff. Thereafter the adminis trative authority and the audit authority will be personally responsible, within their respective spheres, for the expeditious conduct of the enquiry.\\ here account offices exist intermediary between audit and the adminis trative authority, the account offices will discharge the functions prescribed above tor audit, but a report will still be necessary to the audit officer in terms of Article 29 of Civil Account Code, Volume I. 3. In any case in w T hich it appears that recourse to judicial proceedings is likely to be involved, competent legal advice should be taken as soon as the possibility emerges. In the case of losses involving a reasonable suspicion of fraud or other criminal offence a prosecution should be attempted unless the legal advisers consider that the evidence available is not such as will secure a conviction. The reasons for not attempting a prosecution should be placed on record in all such cases. 4. In cases where loss is due to delinquencies of subordinate officials and where it appears that this has been facilitated by laxity of supervision on the part of a superior officer, the latter should also be called strictly to account and his personal liability in the matter carefully assessed. 5. The question of enforcing pecuniary liability should always be con- sidcred as well as the question of other forms of disciplinary action. In deciding the degree ot the officer's pecuniary liability it will be necessary to look not only to the circumstances of the case but also to the financial circum stances of the officer, since it should be recognised that the penalty should not be such as to impair the Government servant's future efficiency. In particular, if the loss has occurred through fraud, every endeavour should be made to recover the whole amount lost from the guilty persons, and if laxity of supervision has facilitated the fraud, the supervising officer at fault may properly be penalised either directly by requiring him to make good in money a sufficient proportion of the loss, or indirectly by reduction or stoppage of his increments of pay. It should always be considered whether the value of Government 2)ropertv or equipment lost, damaged, or destroyed by the carelessness of individuals entrusted with their care {e.g., a policeman's rifle, a touring officer's tents, a factory motor lorry, an engineer's instruments) should not be recovered in full up to the limit of the officer's capacity to pay. 6. One reason why it is important to avoid delay {vide paragraph 2 pre ceding) is that in the course of a prolonged investigation Government servants who are concerned may qualify for pension, and it is held that under the rules as they now stand (measures to rectify this are under separate consideration) a pension once sanctioned cannot be reduced or withheld for misconduct committed prior to retirement. It follows from this that, as a primary pre caution, steps should be taken to ensure that an officer concerned in any loss or irregularity which is the subject of an enquiry, is not inadvertently allowed to retire on pension while the enquiry is in progress, and accordingly, when a pensionable Government servant is concerned in any irregularity or loss, the authority investigating the case should immediately inform the Accounts or Audit Officer responsible for reporting on his title to pension and the authority competent to sanction pension, and it will be the duty of the latter to make a note of the information and to see that pension is not sanctioned before either a conclusion is arrived at as regards* the Government servant's culpability, or it has been decided by the sanctioning authority that the result of the investigation need not be awaited. 7. The fact that officers who were guilty of frauds or irregularities have been demobilised or have retired and have thus escaped punishment, should not be made a justification for absolving those who are also guilty but who still remain in service.

Suhject:- AttaclMent 'by courts In India of the leave salary of G-overnment and -\ailv.ay servants who are on leave In Sn^land. It has recently come to the notice of the Govemiueno of India that as the law stands at present no ueauciion can legally 'be maae under an attachment order issued 'by a court in India from the leave salary (not oeing less than salary) payable in England to an officer of any of the x naian Ser vices. Sub-Bule (l) of rule 48 of Order j QCI im the .First Schedule to the Code of Civil rrocedure, 1908 places the obligation to withhold the amount attached on the person whose duty it is to disburse the salary or allowances of the officer concerned. Such salary or allowances are payable in the Uuited Kingdom 'by the High Gommissioner v,hen the pay ee is on leave in that country. But the writ of a civil court in India does not 'run' in England; in other words an attacuBBnt order served on an accounts officer in Inaia imposes no legal obligation on the High Commissioner in london. ouo -^ule (3) of rule 48 no uoubt purports to rentier orders unuer sub-rule (i) effective in the class of c; se unaer consiaerauion, but in fact it fails to do so. Allowances payaole out of Indian revenues wherever payable, are 'things wiohin British Inaia'. within the meaning of the clause (a) of sub-section (l) of section 65 of the Government of India Act and do not cease to be within the Jurisdiction of the Indian Legislature by reason of being payable in the Imited rvingciom, ana there is thus nothing ulLra vir^s in sub-rule (3) of rule 48 read/ by itself. But when the. sub-rule (3) is read with sub-rule (l), it emerges that the ostensible effect in such cases is —I r' *NiS, to require the High Comiiiissiorjer, ''oeiDg the person w L ob e duty it is to disburse the all^waiices, to withhold the amount in the United kingaom, iiuhereas no provision enacted hy the Indian Legislature ca n valialy operate to require a person in the United Kin^doni to take aclion there. 2. The J-overniiient of Inuia are or opinion that officers should not esca..pe the effects of attachment orders oy reason of l^eing on leave in Sngland ana the law renders Government liable tor the amount attached v^hile the Juage- ment-dehtor is in receipt of salary payable out of tue Indian revenues. They have, therefore, had unuei thfeir consideration the 'best means of overcoming the fiifficulty which arises from the present state of the law. One possi ble course of action would 'be for the Accounts Officer on wham an attachment order is served in respect of an officer on leave in England to issue a fresh leave sal .ry certi ficate to the High Oommissioner in Lonaon making the per missible deduction from the iea,ve salax'y of the oiiic^i , and for the Accounts Officer in India then to remit to tae court Vne amount so ueduct»ed. 1 his course vvoula oe in conflict with the provisions of suo-rule (iy 01 rule 48 which places the obligation uo withhold the amoun'o attacnea on the disbursing authority, ana tuat sub-rule woula require amendment before this proceaure woula oe legal. One effect of this form of proceaure woula, however, \oe to render the amount arawin in British ^nala liable to the payment of income tax, ana Lhe Government of Inuia do not consider it reasonable that the liaoility to attach ment should be allowed to set up a liability oo income tax which would not otherwise exist. They have accordingly aecided not to ^raceed on taose lines out to sanction the continuance of the system whereby an Accounts Bfficer inIndia on receipt of an attaohement oraer I'orwards it for compliance to the High Commissioner 'who withholds payment of the attached portion of salary ana instructs &amp;h€ amount• Accounts Officer to pay an equivalent^mto Court in Inaia. They recognize that this system has no legal sanction hut since it is more favourable to the officers con cerned tiat a system under which they would be liable to income-tax on deductions made in Inaia ana as it is not likely to he challenged in the Courts, the Government of India agree to its continuance.
