Jo Dear General Department y In Group Captain Veryard*s report on his visit to f last month (see our letter 223/8/48 of the 17 th March) you v v will notice a reference in paragraph 5 to the meteorological work done by Consulates in Persia. Our delay in following up this matter has been due to tbe difficulty of ascertaining the present position at Bushire and Bandar Abbas. EfTiuitJif -7 of the 17 th Cctober r 1^47, repeated to Foreign Office as I ' tTo .32 Saving) by Meshed, Zahidan and Bushire only. TTo special staff is employed any longer at any of these posts. The equipment is as it was a year ago, and the instruments stated by Veryard to be in store at Bandar Abbas were, in fact, never despatched from Karachi. The joint view of this Embassy and of Veryard is that the reports are valueless and that nothing can be done to give them value so far as the British autlprities are concerned. From the financial point of view they constitute a slight drain on our resources since presumably they form part of the running expenses of the Consulates which are borne by the U.K. Government, and it is at present uncertain to what extent the latter will be able to recoup themselves from the Governments of India and Pakistan. Veryard, moreover, holds that ’’except possibly for climatological purposes and forecasting of monsoon rain fall, the reports were of little value to the Pakistan Meteorological Department”. We therefore suggest that you should take the matter up with the Pakistan Government and ascertain 'whether they agree to the stations being closed, and any remaining equipment disposed of either by return to Pakistan or by sale to the Persian Government. It would be well to ascertain that the Indian Government too agree to this course of action, or alternatively that they have no interest whatever in the matter. It is now clear that meteorological reports are being sent to the Pakistan Meteorological Department, to whom the control of the stations was allotted in the partition of August 15 th last (see Tehran telegram to Hew D elhi No. 258 Yours ever CHANCERY.
