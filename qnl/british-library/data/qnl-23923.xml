Political Agency, Bahrain, the 7th April 1934. From Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch,I # A., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Sir, I have the honour to request sanction for the supply oi two Typewriters, one Arabic and one English, for the use of my Court. 2. Owing to the appointment of an Assistant Political Agent it has become necessary to remove the Court from the Agency building to another at some distance away and access can no longer be had to the typewriters in the Agency Office. It is necessary for the Court Office (Indian Assistant and two clerks) to have a typewriter in each language. 3. I ask for the iSnglish typewriter to be a noiseless model, because for reasons of secrecy and of lack of other suitable accommodation it is necessary for my confidential, clerk to do all confidential letters in my own private office where I find the noise of the present machine most disturbing to thought and interrupting to conversations and telephoning. I propose, therefore, to use the noiseless machine in n\y own office and to transfer the present machine used in my own office to the Court office# 4. I, therefore, request that Controller of Printing Stationery and Stamps, Calcutta, nay be asked to supply me withwith one English Remington Noiseless 6 C foolscap typewriter with metal case, and one Remington Arabic foolscap typewriter foolscap size with metal case. It would be convenient if the necessary instructions could * scut oy « lr »11 „d if t». could bo | | supplied at once, as the Court will be moved in the course of April 1934* ’ I If Your most obedient servant I have the honour to be Sir Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain*No:634. 13th April 1934.

Instances have come to the notice of the Central A Stationery Office where difficulties have been experienced by officers in obtaining condemnation certificates from the local representatives of the makers of machines which have outlined the normal span of life and reached a stage when further expendi ture on their repairs would be unprofitable. Doubts seem to exist *• as to the real implication of rule 82 of the ’’Rules for the Supply and Use of Stationery Stores, 1S24, reprinted 1930”, which provides that no typewriter, duplicator, or ns copying machine should be sent to the Deputy Controller for condemnation until it has been examined by the local representatives of the makers and have been recommended by them for condemnation. Under Rule 74 nf the condemning authority is the Deputy Controller and the agents’ report is a mere guide to that end. The rule is not intended to put an embargo on the officer concerned making a reference direct to the Deputy Controller, Stationery, for condemnation of a machine, when he feels that difficulties arise in the matter of securing a condemnation certificate contemplated in rule 82 to the impediment of work. In such cases, it is open to the officer to make a reference direct to the Deputy Controller, Stationery, for condemnation of the machines.

In addition to the Government typewriters there are, I think, four Remington portable and two Imperial portable typewriters owned by officers and cleiks. 5* I have little doubt that if the Remington rypawriter Company were to send a competent typewriter mechanic to Bahrain he would get other repair work besides that of the Agency* 6. I am told that the Remington fype.riter Company’s mechanics in Basrah are indifiereni and should be avoided, but I cannot speak of this iron my own knowledge. Lieutenant Colonel, political Agent, Bahr in.hr&amp; I am using the Underwood Typewriter No.2438403-5 lor a lew months. The typewriter is in good working order. Sometimes, however, the ribbon is apt to become sick of moving from one reel to the other. This defect is automatically removed and, I think, is due to the 4e reels being rusty. The machine is oiled twice a week and cleaned everyday. The above is the specimen of work on my typewriter. f OPlV'm- L'i-'- — ■**** '-g. ^ l 7~ tij\ H i VRemington typewriter - being used by the itecord-keeper This machine is in good working order and with overhauling this would last for another five years. &lt;V\' Vimperial typewriter.

Political Agency, Bahrain, the 9th Januaiy 1936. Prom Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.L., Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Secretary to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf Bushire. Warding i’ypewril; ers in the Bahrain Agency. Sir, I have the honour to report that on the 31st December 1935 I made a personal inspection of the seven typewriters in the Bahrain Agency and I enclose a list of them showing their distribution and ages. Of them one is in good condition and three are in reasonably good conaition, though requiring certain small adjustments, and three do not work. 2* . I think that I should explain that there are no lacilities whatever in Bahrain for getting typewriters attended to and that the climate with its corroding salty dampness and penetrating dust, is particularly hostile to any delicate machine. Repairs can only be carried out at Karachi and experience shows that a repaired machine goes wrong again usually unless it has continual skilled attention.3. I have condemned two machines - one a Remington brief size machine No.LL/37743 and one Under/ood brief size machine No.2414812-b - as they continually give trouble. fhere is no record in this Agency when or irom where the Remington machine was obtained. A few parts were replaced in Karachi in September 1933 and the machine appears to have been in use ior many years. The Unuerwood machine ’was received in May 1939. Many parts which were worn out were replaced in Karachi in August 1933 and it was also overhauled and cleaned. and i&amp;glish Oifice has increased remarkably in the past two years and is still increasing. I cannot afford to have it held up or badly typed owing to the typewriters being in indixierent order: this is particularly so, as much of my work is with films like The Bahrain Petroleum Company whose typescript is oi an high order of neatness. I&gt; therefore, request that the Controller of Stationery may be asked by telegraph to replace urgently the two machines mentioned in paragraph 3 above with two Remington brief size typewriters, Model No.30C (see serial No.635 in the Central Stationety Office price list for 1935-36). The machines should be sent by railway passenger train to Karachi, whence they can be shipped by Messrs MacKinnon Mackenzie and Company Limited, Karachi, direct to Bahrain. They should not be sent by the all-sea route from Calcutta as it involves long delay. On receipt of the new machines those condemned will/- 4 The volume of work in the Confidential Office7 . will (unless I receive contrary orders) be sold by public auction and the proceeds will be credited to Government. 6. fhe 'Remington Arabic typewriter machine No.404/11/80001 is not wording satisfactorily and typing can only be done slowly and mistakes due to the bad adjustment are frequent. As you know, a great deal of important Arabic correspondence is carried on by the Bahrain Agency Vernacular Office and apart from the volume of work, it is not fitting that letters addressed to His excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin f Isa Al Khalifah and to the other “Rulers of the Arab Littoral should be marred by inaccuracies and mis-types due to a bad typewriter. The volume of work is even now sufficient to warrant the supply of a second Arabic typewriter and there is eveiy probability that the Arabic correspondence will further increase this spring due to various developments in ^atar and on the frucial Coast. It is desirable, moreover, that I should not be dependent on a single Arabic machine, as if it goes wrong all letters and the copies have to be hand written which involves great delay. I therefore request that I may be furnished with a second Remington foolscap size Arabic typewriter (Standard Model No.40A Arabic), and that it may be sent by passenger train with the two typewriters asked for in paragraph 4 and 5 above. As this type of machine is not catalogued in the list for 1935-36 I am not in a position to (piote the number in the price List. 6. As soon as the new Arabic typewriter a-rrives, I will then endeavour to get the present Arabic typewriter adjusted at the nearest spot where mechanics are available.■, v V No. mn mAIL 111-17/a \ ' '4 The Political Agent, Bahrain, presents his compliments to i’he Controller of Stationery, Calcutta, India. and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s) v 7 in case a telegraphic reference is made to him by the honourable the Political 'f’esi^ent in the Persian Gulf.

Press the soaked rag lightly on the ribbon on the macnin in such a way that two folia of the ra^ are on eacn side of tiie ribbon, then slowly wind the ribbon on the oui jr sppol. I^ave the soaked ribbon on the machine from 12-14 hours. The ribbon will then have been revived by the re-distribu - tion or the colouring matter more evenly on the fabric.

At tjiis Suage, the riboon will, be ready for • re-inking* as described below, 1013.035 it has already shown fraying or other damage to the labrie which will have rendered it unsuitable for further use.

G. Dixon, political Agent, Bahrain, The Secretary to the Hobble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Bushire, /V x a A / 1. Letter No. 106-17/8/ dated the 3th January 1336 2. Letter No. 965-17/8, dated the 28th April 1937 3. Letter No. 318-17/8, dated the 8th May 1940 I have^the honour to ref r to the three letters from this Agency noted in the margin and to say that our position as regards J. English typewriters has now become parlous in the extreme. The untidiness of some of the letters sent to you from this Agency, due to bad adjustment and other defects in the typewriters, may have been noticed. That you have not received others e'ven more untidy is aue to the f^ct that, after having first b een typed on one machine and found too’untidy for issue, they have had to be retyped on another machine, with a consequent waste of labour and paper. 2. I enclose a list of the 8 E nglish typewriter slat present on our charge, in order of their agej I h&amp;v e recently had them inspected and overhauled by the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ type writer^-mechanic. They are inadequate as regards both quality and quantity. It has already been stated, in paragraph 4 of the first letter referred to in the margin, that toe typescript of firms in Bahrain is of a high order of neatness. This is as true to-day as it was in 1936, and it is at present a source of sorrow and embarrass^ment to me to compare the degree of neatness of the average letter sent out by this office with that of the average letter that we receive. Y/e have only one typewriter that is less than six years old, and only three (Nos. 3, 6 and 8) that type with sufficient neatness to be suitable for letters to outside authorities; and of these three, none is available to the English Office, unless it is borrowed for a special occasion with much inconvenience to all concerned. Of the rest. No. 1 has lain unused in the Head Munshi»s office for some years and has now been condemned by the typewriter-mechanic as completely unusable: it will be sold for what it can fetch and the proceeds credited to Government. No. 2 would also in normal times have by now been condemned, having ten years which are oowimaeiy. regarded as the a Government typewriter in less mojst and corrosive climes^ Soro it-not-that I felt that in war time it was incumbent upon us to use every machine until it was quite incapable of further use. No. 3 has only remained in tcimp^rarlly good order owing to the fact that it is less used than most of the others. Conversely,Nos. 4 and 5,. the most used of our machines, are no longer suitable for typinglletters owing to the enormsus amount of work that has been demanded of them, though they can still be used for drafting and other internal use in the office. 3. The reasonl for the amoun^/that these two machines, in particular, have Rad to perform is that in the last six years our establishment has considerably increased but without a proportionate increase in the number of our typewriters. The straits to which we have been reduced can be gauged from the / fact /- /v 2 tha't w«r« f«r««d tlm# ag« X% pure ha •• lacally a aacand- hand typawitar af uaknavm vintaga awing ta aur praaaing naad far mara maahinaa. In 1937 aur aatabliahmant numbarad 10 , including tha Indian Assistant, and they had between them, as the result of the soaond letter quoted, 8 typewriters including a portable machine, binao then, while the number of the typewriters on our charge has remained the same, our sanctioned establishment has increased by four members to its present strength of 14, including the Indian Assistant, and our volume of work has increased to an even greater extent. Every member of the establishment has cause to use a typewriter and the present shortage of machines oaaa-sions delayd and dislocation of work. If these are to be avoided, the total number of English typewgdters we require is 11 and the barest minimum that will suffice is 10 . 4. I would therefore request that the Controller of Stationery. Calcutta, may kindly bo askod to supply this Agency as soon as possible with four new typewriters, for preference Remington Brief models which have been found most suitable here. As I have said above, the only one of our machines which has at present been condemned is No. 1 but, though I do not propose to discard any of the others until it is absolutely necessary, it is likely that before long No. 2 also will have to be condemned. In any case I propose to reserve the new machines exclusively for th'* typing of letters and to use the old machines for internal use in the office. With this arrangement I do not anticipate having to condemn •rv of the rest of our maahines, even the much used Nos. 4 and 5 for a considerable time and I can safely say that with the arrival of four new machines ahd the continued bestowal of as much care on the maintenance of our typewriters as the almost incomplete absence k of facilities in Bahrain makes possible, it iill not be neco &gt;-:rv to • ask for further machines for some years. 5. If my proposals meet with the Hon 1 bio the Political Resident 1 s approval, will you kindly ask the Controller of Station ery urgently to send the four machines as soon as possible by B£ *ff P£ &amp; er to Karachi or Bombay, whence they can be chipped here by Messrs. Uackinnon Mackenzie &amp; Co., whom I will address on receipt of confirmation from is 0 i. Their despatch by goods train would occasion too long a delay.

If a hill ior repairs was Ks.132/- we ought to go into the matter, as that is more than quarter of the price of a new typewriter, dhat was wrong. Please go into matter, inspecting each machine— if repairs are needed machines had best be sent to political Agent, who can see to them. If typewriters are bad enough, we can arrange for them to be replaced at once the new machines being sent to Political Agent at Karachi or Delhi so that he can bring them back. I think replacement case has to go through Residency so matter should be taken up at once. Please let me have full information, so that good case can be made.

I give below a precis of the history oi the typewriueg in the Agency and their present distrioution. (1) Two 'Underwood' machines were indented ior xn February 1929 and received m ..lay oi the sa^e year (p* ibid). Both machines were repaired in 193d, m^ny parts .hich were worn out oeiug repxacea in adaitxon to over hauling ana cleaning (p. loia;.

( 3 ) in February 1931 a 'Barloc*' machine was indented xor but due to the machine not being stocked by the Stationery Department (see p. 97 ibid) a 'Remington' Policy size typewriter was supplied (p. 95 ioid). On receipt it was xxkuk impossible to wori£ tne mac nine ana it was returned to tne Controller oi Stationery io / ibid). An Imperial m^cniiie «as maenteu ior m xus ^lace (see pp. 118-22) out alter a protractea eorres^onaence the P.A. was forced to ta^e the Remington (see p^. 106 -- 40 ), which v/as received in March 1932 out ol oiaer ana v;as returned to India. It was received bacic after (O « r.on.oc 1 63, 171, 176 and 179) repairs. (See pages i (4) In June 1932 an 'Imperial' machine was indented for (see pp. 146 and 169) and was received in April 1930, in an unserviceable condition.(p» 193) It was returned to Ranchi to Major Bremner, P.A. Muscat, on recess at tne time, who was requested to see the Agents aoout tne matter (see pages 198-99). It was put in oraer e*ud returned to us.

From the above it v^ill oe patent tnat w^tii the exception of the two Underwood aud the Noiseless Remington fifcichines (see para^ra^h (l) and (o) above), ail the others (English type) were received, in a damaged condition; aud it is arguaoie Whether a machine once damaged aud put ri b ht woula ever give satisfaction.

In my note dated trie 50th July l9oo I did intend Xu sending twdbiore machines to .karacxxi when P.A. went on recess, out in view of tue lact that the Imperial and Remington were already daaoa^ea and repaired I spoxce to Captain Cole, who agreed that it would oe prelereole to try uo ^et a. new machine, since the cost of xxx&amp;xg freight cum repairs on machines did not warrant the trouole or expense. 5. If you so desire I coula send tue Remington (paragraph 2(5) above) and the Imperial machine s (paragraph 2 (4) above )^to P-A. with a request tacit he call for a report from tne Agents in haracni^see P.R's. orders referred to aoove). If the machines can be condemned ('teide instructions at p. 9 oi current volume), then P.A. could send his report and request for new machine/machines to r.n. direct from Karachi to save time.

The 2 Underwood Machines after undergoing extensive repairs in 1933 and in 1935, are in woricing order. The cost of these repairs was iis.48/8/- in 1933 and xus.132/-/- for one machine only in 1935. We also had to pay &amp;S.82/8 ^in Customs duty in 1933. These machines were received in May,1929 and have therefore not outlived their official life. 2. The Arabic Remington is^in working order. //&lt;j 3. This Remington -Policy Size- was supplied in April 1931 but arrived in an unworkable condition, even the keyboard frame being out of the rectangular. The machine was retumed to the Controller of Stationeiy and t f -2) after some correspondence, was received balck in March 1932, again in an unworkable condition. It was retumed for repairs and is now again out of order. The cost of these latter repairs was its.35/10/-; and the amount spent in freight etcetera was considerable (the usual freight -Bahrain-Karachi, one way is iu&gt;.6/4/- minimum)• The machine appears to be in such a bad condition now that further repairs may easily cost as much as those for the Underwood in (1) above, which was repaired this4 / ^ This Imperial machine was received in April 1933 (exactly ten months after it had been indented for), also in an unworkable condition. It was put in order by the Agents and returned. It is now again out of order. 5. The Confidential office typewriter is now in the recess office, Karachi and appears to be working satisfactorily. In addition to the above major repairs, all typev/riters have undeargone local repairs a number of times. In my opinion, the typewriters in paragraphs 3 and 4 should be condemned and replaced by new machines. I say this, in view of the experience gained in the case of the Underwoods (paragraph 1). Large sums were expended in repairs and though they are working, they are not really satisfactory. It is also arguable that a machine that was received from the factory in a faulty condition can ever be put right again. 6. Moreover, if we can get these two machines replaced quickly, the two Underwoods, which are liable to break down at any moment, could also be put up for condemnation and replacement. 7. I do not think that the Controller of Stationery quite understands our position in the Gulf. In India, there are Agents of typewriter^ firms in nearly every big station; here it takes at least a month to get one repaired Moreover the excessive humidity in Bahrain considerably lessens the life of a machine. 8. The ordinaiy rule in force for condemning a typewriter is that a condemnation certificate from the local representatives of the makers should be obtained when the machine has outlived its noimal span of life and/-and reached a stage when further expenditure on repairs 1934, from the Central Stationery office, Calcutta, this rule is not intended to stop an officer making a reference direct to the Deputy Controller, Stationery for condemnation of a machine when he feels that difficulties arise in obtaining the above condemnation certificate, to the impediment of work* In such case, he may make a direct reference for the condemnation of the machine* 9, I feel that we also have a good case for asking for a portable typewriter, for use on tour.
