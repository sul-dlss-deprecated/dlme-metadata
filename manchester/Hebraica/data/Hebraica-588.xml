As part of the activities of the "50 Jewish Objects" project, Jacqueline Nicholls created "Handle with Care" in response to the Library's materials: 1. handwritten fragment from Maimondes’ Mishah Torah 2. The Book of Wonder 3. a hamza (an amulet in the shape of a hand), and 4. Elaine Feinstein’s poem ‘Hands’ - the memory and touch of one who is not there. Artwork: Handmade book, presented within tyvek pillows reminiscent of the supports used by the Library. The books covered were made from photocopied, pulped sheets of Rambam’s Mishna Torah, moulded in empty spaces of my cupped handed. The book is made from a concertina, on one side are drawings of the spaces created by the fingers as they hold and touch. The other side are some of my notes and reflections from being in the archive. The artist made cut-outs of the negative spaces of the hands, so when the concertina was bound at one edge, only glimpses of the writing can be seen. An echo of the some of the holes and spaces of the items in the books in the archive. On the pillows are printed the phrases “handle with care” and “the traces and the spaces that our bodies leave behind”.</dc:description><dc:type>Fine Art</dc:type><dc:title>Handmade book - Eighth opening</dc:title><dc:relation>Handle with Care</dc:relation></oai_dc:dc></metadata></record>
