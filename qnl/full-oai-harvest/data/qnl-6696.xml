The letter discusses and includes a report from HM Vice Consul, Zabul concerning his meeting with the Sarder [Sardir] Muhammad Amin Khan Nauroi of Seistan [Sistan]. The report covers the Sarder’s offer to lead a rebellion in Seistan, Afghanistan against the Iranian Government, a request for clarification on his position should he, his family and followers move to Baluchistan, Afghanistan and the Vice Consul’s response to said offer. The report includes an appendix detailing the background and structure of the Nauroi Sarabandi Sarders, and the Nauroi tribe.The file also contains related correspondence including a letter from William Rupert Hay, Deputy Secretary to the Government of India, to the Vice Consul expressing concern over his response and reservations over the Sarder’s motivations. A specific concern is raised regarding a perceived distinction the Vice Consul made in his response, between the Government of India and HM Government, and a letter in reply from HM Consul General addresses and refutes this concern.A subsequent letter from HM Consul General to the Secretary to the Government of India External Affairs Department, Simla, suggests that the Sarder and his followers plan to leave Iran for India soon.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul-General, Khorasan</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Seistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Baluchistan</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Afghanistan</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000466.0x00033d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
