This correspondence is concerned with querying or disputing items of expenditure, or with changes to accounting practices. This correspondence is primarily between officials of the India Office (primarily the Account General and the Under Secretary of State for India), Foreign Office officials (primarily the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs), and representatives of the Government of India (primarily the Accountant General and the Foreign Secretary).Specific matters discussed include adjustments to be made for the salary of John Calcott Gaskin, a query related to the payment of the salaries of Sir Percy Cox and Stuart George Knox during the First World War, a dispute over the refusal by the Foreign Office to take a share of maintenance of Bakhtiari Sowars in Persia during February-March 1919 (see ff 152-158 for detailed notes), construction work at the Ahwaz Consulate, the supply of flour to Shiraz in 1916-17, and an adjustment in the charges for civil works.The following sets of financial papers can be found within:expenditure by the Imperial Government in Persia, and at Nakawn Lampang (Lakhon) and Chiengmai.

However a printed copy of a letter dated 25 June 1915 with enclosures dating back to 2 June 1915 has also been included. It concerns a revision to the rates at which leave and pension contributions are calculated.Each part includes a divider which gives the subject and part numbers, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references contained in that part by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Accountant-General</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Accountant-General, Central Revenues</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Siam</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>British</topic></subject><subject><topic>Consular services</topic></subject><subject><topic>Diplomatic service</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000102#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
