With regard to the exchange of ordinary criminal intelligence etc., the Basrah Police could co-operate with Bahrain to any extent. For purely finger print work the expert should be sent to Baghdad, but, if he is a fully qiaLified man this would be an unnecessary expense as all essentials of finger print work are standardized throughout the world.
