The following brief ^etch of the more salient features of the Recent Poli- political history of Persia during the past few years will help to o/reraia t0ry explain the present situation in that country. By the beginning of the present century, the condition of Persia, which for some years had been giving cause for grave anxiety, had grown quite intolerable: The Snah, Muzaffar-ud-din, was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers, who were living on the spoils of the Government and country. He had parted with the treasures inherited from his father and with most of tho imperial and national domains. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans, the proceeds of which he had spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his favourites. There was a yearly deficit and the debt of the country was growing daily. Disturbances broke out everywhere, and the popular discontent was not appeased until the Sh^h, in August 1906, had signed a decree granting constitutioDaJ Government to the people. A Majlis or National Assembly of 162 representatives of all classes, elected by their peers, met in October of that year, A few days later Muzaffar- ud-Din died. The new Shah, Muhammad Ali, adopted a reactionary policy and made every endeavour to crush the Nationalist movement. Insurrections broke out in the principal cities and finally in 1909 the Shalj abdicated his throne, being succeeded by his son, Ahmad Mirza, a boy of 12 years old. The ex-Shah retired to Russia, a pension being'allowed him by tho Persian Government. There was, however, no improvement in the state of Persia and fresh disturbances broke out every where, notably m Pars. During 1911-12-i? several attempts were mad'e by the ex-Shah and his brother, Salar-ud-Douleh, to overthrow, the existing GovernmL-nt. These all ended in failure. - These MC37CGS bdisturbances, however, coupled with the attitude adopted by Russia, who, by the end of 1913, had on one pretext and another sent some 14,000 troops into Northern Persia, had brought Persia to the vei'ge of ruin. Her treasury was empty, she had no military forces available to suppress disorders or to collect revenue, and there was no strong public man to be found to direct efforts to reform. Most of her troubles were ascribed to Russia, wliich had consistently thwarted every effort at reform ; but Great Britain also incurred much odium for connivance. During the Great War, Turkish troops and German agents intered Persia in order to cause further difficulties for the British Government. Their efforts were successful to a certain extent and they had the effect of still further increasing the difficulties of the Persian Government. An additional danger arose early in 1920 from the advance of the Bolsheviks to the borders of the former Tsarist Empire in Tfans-Caucasia and Turkistan. Their arrival there was a signal for an attempt to get Bolshevik agents into Persia, and for the commencement of a violent anti-Persian campaign in the Bolshevik press. The general tenor of this campaign was that a revolution must be caused in Persia to get rid of the Shah and that, if the Persians themselves could not initiate such a revolution, the Bolsheviks would invade the country and bring it about themselves. On the excuse of capturing the Volunteer Caspian fleet which was interned at Enzeli, the Bolsheviks, in May 1920, landed troops at that port, got into touch with Kuchik Khan and the local Persian revolutionaries and com menced an advance on Tehran. The Persian forces, backed as thev were by British troops, checked this advance but were unable to drive out the Russians altogether. Tinder the Anglo-Persian Agreement, concluded in 1919, the British Government had offered to loan to the Persians, the sum of two million pounds sterling and to reorgani/e the Persian Army and finances. A military mission, as also^ a financial adviser and staff, were sent to Tehran to report on the require ments of Persia in accordance with the terms of this agreement. But the Persian Government were from the start only half hearted about the agreement, and put obstacle after obstacle in the way of its ratification.Early in 1920, the Persian Government commenced to nego tiate a treaty with the Bolsheviks by which the latter agreed to withdraw their troops from Persia and to grant generous con cessions to her in return for permission to establish a Bolshevik Legation at Tehran and Consulates in all the chief Persian towns. The treaty was signed in February and shortly after its signature Saiyid Zia-ud-Din with the help of the Persian Cossack Divi sion overthrew the Government at Tehran, and set to work to institute reforms of a sweeping nature, which included the re organization of the Army and finances under British advisers. He also annulled the Anglo-Persian Agreement and upheld the Russo-Persian treaty. Jealousy and intrigue caused Zia-ud- Din's fall in May, and this gave a handle to the newly arrived Russian Minister to start an anti-British campaign in the capital and to advance the Bolshevik cause in Northern Persia. The Cabinet which followed that of Zia-ud-Din has come more and more under Russian influence, and at the present time the country is being exploited by Russia owing to the inability of the weak and corrupt leaders to break the spell the Russian Minister has cast over them. The national finances are chaotic, and the future appears to be far from hopeful unless Persia can break away from her present position and set her house in order with the advice and assistance of some power other than Russia. In 1856 the Persian Government besieged and seized Herat, Military thus breaking its engagements with the British Government. Anglo^' t IPcrsiciii On November 1st, the Governor-General of India declared War ^ war against Persia for breaking agreement and seizing Herat. 1856 ' 57, Two courses were open to the Government of India for the invasion of Persia. 1 17] r (1) To march across Afghanistan. This would have been difficult and expensive, would have irritated the Af ghans, and probably have brought on another Afghan war. (2) To send an expedition by sea to the head of the Persian Gulf, and thence to carry out direct operations against the interior. The latter alternative was adopted. On November 11th, the first troops left Bombay. b24 The expeditionary force embarked at Bombay, Karachi and two smaller ports, in sailing vessels (towed by steamers) under the command of Major-General Stalker. &gt; 1- Total strength, 5,670 fighting men (of whom 2,270 were Europeans), 3,750 followers, 1,150 horses, 430 bullocks. ,y ' r/iajS On November 26th, the fleet (8 Indian Navy steamers, 7 Eteam and 30 sailing transports) assembled at Qishm. Here it was discovered that the doolies and bearers had been left behind. Great confusion prevailed owing to the transports anchoring indiscriminately, ships carrying different arms were ail huddled ^ together, and the brigadiers were quite unable to exercise their commands. On December 3rd, the island of Kharag was occupied. On December 7th, the force disembarked at HalTleh Bav 12 miles south east of Bushire. This place was selected because the water there was good, landing easy, and no defences existed ere is a good landing beach at Bushire, but it is under fire he disembarkation took two days, a strong north-west breeze having caused delay. The operation was covered by the Sons SUn drOVe the eUemy out of the date planta- r . TA n December 9th, the enemy were dislodged from Reshire nlh h if 1 a ' , ( : a7 1 the, 7 edoubt ' defend ed bv Tangistanis and other half-Arab tribes from the vicinity. Under a combined bombardment by the fleet and field artillery the infantry assault ed. 1 he cavalry then pursued the fugitives along the beach. On December 10th, the plan of attack on Bushire was as follows .-gun boats to force the creek north-east of the town and south east 'St , ^ ^ ^ ^ attack was ' ^ ^ Iv carried nnf tt &lt;- , S- I nis was imperfect- boXle^ to eS?L Te thna± 0rcek ^ began surrendered before the 'land attack devebped^SS e Bushlr6 ^ who' were'liberated? for'^TuSa T0WeIWUskete I—^ V EnglandX c The sanitary state of Bushire was found to be bad. The troops encamped one mile outside the walls near the water supply, a cavalry out-post with guns being posted two miles fur ther on towards the hills. The want of sufficient boats to land stores from the fleet was badly felt. The inhabitants brought in supplies and were well pleased to receive ready money pay ments, after their previous experience of Persian troops. The enemy had collected troops at Shiraz and were report ed to be at Farashband and advancing to Kalimeh. They had brought a considerable artillery train by a circuitous route, some 18 pounders coming by Firuzabad, and had established two' supply depots, one at Chahkutah, 20 miles distant, the other at Borazjun, 45 miles. Their chief transport was small hardy donkeys. General Sir James Outram with the 2nd Division of the expedition, consisting of the 14th Light Dragoons, the Scinde Horse, 1 Troop Royal Horse Artillery, two field batteries, 78th Highlanders, 2:3rd and 26th Bombay Native Infantry and a composite battalion consisting of 10 fight companies of native infantry, left India in the latter half of December, reaching Bushire at the end of January. » Chahkutah was first destroyed by a cavalry force. As the enemy were cutting off supplies from Bushire, an advance on Borazjun was then decided on. On February 3rd, General Outram left Bushire, taking 3 battalions British infantry, 3 battalions native infantry, 3rd Bombay Cavalry, Poona Irregular Cavalry and horse and field artillery, total 419 cavalry, 18 guns, 118 sappers and 4,116 infantry. Practically no transport was available. No tents were taken and each man carried a great coat and blanket and two days' cooked provisions. The commissariat arranged for bringing on reserve rations. The march was made by night, bitterly cold at this time of year. After 26 miles the force halte 1 for the day. Severe dust-storms followed by hail and rain, which drenched every one, and a cold piercing wind made the march very trying. Borazjun was reached after another trying march, and 'a night of cold and rain, the force having covered 46 miles in 41 hours. The depot was taken after a slight skirmish with the enemy's cavalry, the entrenchments being quite insignificant6 Battle of Kliflshab. The village cJose by might have been utilized as a formid able defensive work, having high walls, towers and a ditch 15 feet deep ; while all round it were cactus and thorn fences. All the ammunition and everything else that could not be carried off was destroyed. On February 7th, provisions were running short, and a retire ment on Bushire was commenced by a night march. About mid night the guide lost his way, and the enemy attacked. The troops coolly formed up and lay down under fire till dawn, losing, how ever, two officers and six men wounded and one man killed. On February 8th, when day broke, the enemy were seen drawn up with their right on Khushab and numbering 6,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 15 guns. 'They were attacked by the cavalry and artillery, the infantry being in support. • The artillery made very fine practice and the Persians broke and fled. The 3rd Bombay Cavalry charged and broke up a square of Persian infantry Con+inuous rain now set in. The force resumed its march that evening. The country had become a swamp, and the roads were almost impassable, ankle deep in sticky mud, half clay, half sand, and many men lost their boots. The guides misled the force which marched throughout the entire night. The infantry reached Bushire on the evening of February 9th ; heavy rain was still falling, but the men were in excellent spirits. Successful operations were then undertaken against Muham- mareh nnd Ahwaz, the war coming to an end with the treaty of Paris, signed on March 4th 1857. The conditions of peace were—The Shah to withdraw his iroops from-Herat, relinquishing every claim of sovereignty over it, and to refrain from all interference with Afghanistan ; to recognise the independence of Herat; prisoners taken at Herat to be released without ransom. The British Mission to be received a I Tehran with apologies ; the slave trade to be suppressed in the Persian Gulf and apologies to be made to Mr. Murray for the insolent conduct of the Shah and his minister. In May the troops were withdrawn from Muhammareh to Bushire or India7 Bushire was occupied till October, pending the carrying out of the conditions of peace. During the occupation of Bushire, the inhabitants of the Personal town and surrounding districts were quite friendly. This was ® f x ^^'p C e ! also the case at Muhammareh. At Bushire the troops were dition. healthy. There was a great scarcity of forage and fuel. Chagha- dak, 13 miles off, was suggested as more sanitary. Great dis comfort was experienced from the prevailing strong north-west winds, which blew the whole day regularly, raising dense clouds of fine penetrating sand. The only way to mitigate the nuisance was to build mud walls round the tents. The force appears to have been very badly provided with transport. It must have relied for transport and its gear on what was obtainable in the country, but came to the opinion that no hostile force landing can confidently count on local resources. It succeeded in purchasing 2,500 camels in Basra and some 8,000 mules in Baghdad. A simple boring apparatus for sinking wells was recommended. Landing operations were generally difficult in the Gulf, Bombay bandar boats were found very useful for this. The recent history of Fars has been one of incessant disorder 1 vith lawlessness at a premium. Governor-General has follow ed Governor-General in rapid succession, but up to the present, except during the existence of the South Persia Rifles, not one of them has really been able to cope with the administration of this backward and lawless province. In 1911 robberies on the Shiraz-Bushire road reached their height, even an English lady doctor being severely maltreated. The British Govern ment was obliged to strengthen the Consular Guards and the 39th Central India Horse were set to Shiraz. In the autumn of the same year the formation of a Gendarmerie under Swedish officers was commenced. In December the escort of the British Consul was attacked and he himself wounded. 1912 brought little relief to the situation, the 39th Central India Horse remain ing virtual prisoners in Shiraz. In December Captain Eckford of that regiment was shot by raiders while on a shooting ex pedition. In 1913 the cavalry were withdrawn from Shiraz. The Gendarmerie gradually improved and by the end of 1914 order had been completely restored on the Biishire-Shiraz- Isfahan road, while the security of other roads had greatly improved. The outbreak of the war and German intrigues.8 leading to the defection of the Gendarmerie, threw matters back and the province once more relapsed into a state of anarchy. In 1915 Wassmuss, a German propagandist, was actively working among the tribes of South Persia and eventually inspired the Tangistanls to open violence. In August 191.'), they made several raids on the outskirts of Bushire. The following month a force consisting of two Indian infantry regiments, a squadron of cavalry and a mountain battery under the command of Bri gadier-General Brooking, supported by two of His Majesty's men of war, undertook punitive measures against them, even tually dispersing them and breaking their resistance in Septem ber of that year. In November 1915 the British Consul and colony at Shiraz were arrested by certain rebellious Khans assisted by the Gen darmerie and were not finally released tfll August 1916. In the latter year the organization of a force termed the South Persia Rifles under Sir Percy Sykes was commenced, the latter with Lieutenant-Colonel Gough, the new Consul for Shiraz, reaching that place in November. In December a rising took place at Kazarun, the rebels driving back a small force sent against them by Sir Percy Sykes. Through the intervention of Soulat-ud-Douleh the chief of the Qashqai tribe, matters were temporarily patched up, but no punishment was ever inflicted on the Kazarunls for their rebel lious behaviour. During the rest of 1917 and early part of 1918 the South Persia Rifles was busily engaged in dealing with the Arab and other robber tribes, several of whom were taught a severe lesson. During all this time the attitude of, the Soulat continued doubtful and unsatisfactory, till finally in May 1918 he openly showed his hand and declared war aaainst the British and the South Persia Rifles. A severe defeat was inflicted on his forces near Khaneh Khabis after which the British troops foil back on Shiraz, which place was shortly afterwards practi cally invested. Most of the South Persia Rifles, however, in Shiraz remained staunch, whilst the Qawam and the Governor- General co-operated loyally with our troops. Severe defeats were inflicted upon the rebels who ultimately broke and fled. The Soulat was deposed from his Ilkhan T ship of the Qashqai tribe, his halfbrother, Sardar Ihtisham being appointed in his place. Bushire Operations, 19 the early part of the great European War German agents who were at work amongX v* 1 the tribes of South Persia with the object of embarrassing the active operations which were being undertaken in Mesopotamia by the British Expeditionary Force and also as a direct menace to India, succeeded in affecting the tribes to such an extent that in the early part of 1918, fed by false promises and vague hopes, they began to display a very pronounced feeling of hostility which took the form of active brigandage on the main communi cations between Shiraz- and Bushife and Bandar Abbas and Kerman. In order to restore confidence in the power of Britain and to allay the situation a iorce was assembled at Shiraz under the command of Brigadier General Sir Percy Sykes, consisting of two squadrons of cavalry, a mountain battery and 3 battalions of Indian Infantry. This force which was known as the Shiraz Column worked in conjunction with another similar column having its base at Kerman. In addition a force of three battalions of Indian Infantry, two sections of mountain artillery and one squadron of cavalry was assembled at Bushire under Major-General Douglas by October 1918, and a light railway was built from Bushire to Borazjun. This force when it advanced to open the road to Shiraz drew off a consider able number of the tribesmen who were opposing the Shiraz Column. The country was swept as effectively as possible, but owing to the guerilla tactics of the tribes the operations entailed heavy marching and counter-marching before the resistance was finally broken up in March 1919, when the whole ShTraz force was transferred to Bushire and Bandar Abbas, certain units of its effectives being amalgamated with the Bushire force and the rest returning to India. There were no pitched battles of any importance during the two years' operations, but several small skirmishes, in which the enemy as a rule fared badly. A feature of the advance of the striking force was the exceed ingly poor resistance put up by the enemy in spite of the great advantage they possessed owing to the very severe nature of the country. In three places in particular, the Pil-Fili, Malu and Tang-i-Turkan passes, it was fully expected that a passage would only be forced after a severe struggle. The two latter passes would appear to compare favourably from the point of view of a defending force with any pass on the North-West Frontier of India. Actually however the longest time the troops were held up ;vas a period of 2—3 hours at the Malu Pass which was finally forced with negligible casualties. Indeed it was made abundantly clear that the fighting qualities of the Persian villager of this part of the country, when opposed by a properly10 equipped and organised force, had beea greatly exaggerated. Though the lawless nomadic tribes who have no settled homes and have always made their livelihood by highway robbery still continue their customary depredations on a small scale, the country, as a result of these operations, enjoyed so long as the South Persia Rifles remained inexiatence, an era of tranquillity since March 1919, probably rarely known in its history, and traffic was able to pass freely up and down.the main commercial routes. In June 1920 the Bushire Field Force which had up till then been retained at Bushire as an emergency measure and as a moral factor was withdrawn and a return was made to this pre-war strength of the garrison.\ '?■ ifc: 11 CHAPTER II tsalo Jon i Geography. Southern Persia, except for - a coastal strip some 15 to 30 Genera1, miles broad, is a country of ranges of rugged and barren hills, almost all running from north-west to south-east and gradually rising step by step till the valleys in the centre are from four to seven thousand feet above sea level. Needless to say these hills offer considerable obstacle to the progress of troops. It is in the valleys that the life of Persia lies, and they are often exceedingly fertile and well-watered and have been con sidered by experts to be capable of supporting a population at least ten times as numerous as is now to be found in them. The irrigation system has been well-developed as far as carrying t e water along from where it is found to where it is needed, but there is no system of reservoirs, and a vast amount of water runs to waste in the salt lakes of the country. The water system is a very complicated one and leads to a number of disputes every year. It would require very careful handling in an occupation of the country, if popular feeling was not to be aroused. The country is practically devoid of trees except where they aye been cultivated or protected in private gardens ; this is possibly due partly to the lack of proper soil, but more probably to the lack of any State control to prevent deforestation; from the way trees grow in private gardens there seems no reason why t le country should not be well-wooded if given a proper chance. - mU lo -tew 1 il ! bi«vrltniw »'to (a) Tars and the Gulf Ports. FSrs is one of the largest of the provinces of Persia, and from Fars. the British point of view almost the most important. It is bounded on the south by the Persian Gulf, while on the west its border marches with that of Arabistan. Starting from a few miles north of Bandar Dllam, where Arabistan and the Liravi district meet, the frontier follows the course of the Shur stream which runs a few miles east of and parallel to the Hindian river, from the sea until it crosses the Hind':an near Deh Mulla. Going north the frontier then crosses the Ram Hormuz-Beh- behan road between Jaizan and Kuraisheh and follows the Kuh- galu-Bakhtiari tribal boundary until the Qashqai country is reached.12 The boundary between the Bakhtiari territory and the Qashqai country (or Isfahan province—it is not always clear which) is then followed, B a said being well within the former. The line, however, does not attain any precision anywhere. In this volume the Kuhgalu country is not dealt with, and the west ern boundary of the portion of Fars described in it runs from 13 miles north of Bandar Dilam in a semi-circular sweep, which passes well to the east of Basht and joins the line of division men tioned above to the east of Basakl. The boundary between Ears and the province of Isfahan is scarcely less vague ; according to one version it crosses the Shlraz-Isfahan road just north of Yazd-i-Khast ; according to another 7 miles north of that village, where it runs along the ridge of the Gard-i-Gir hills ; while according to the Farsnameh half way between Amlnabad and Maqsud Beg. The eastern boundary marches successively with that of Isfahan and with those of the Abrkuh and Shahr -i-Babak districtsof Yazdandof the Sirjan district of Kerman. Kerman province first adjoins Fars from a point some miles west of Lsfinabad in the kavir. From this point the joint frontier runs south-east to Abu Bakr where the most northern point of Laristan is met. Turning south-west to N'rlz and then slightly eastward to Darab, the remainder of the eastern boundary of Fars is coter minous with the western border of Laristan ; the same district accompanies Fars on the south : as its southern boundary now runs west and slightly south to Jahrum (which is in Fars)-linally turning more southward and meeting the coast of the Persian Gulf, seven miles to the east of Tahirl in the Shibkuh district. Gulf Ports. ( The area under the administration of the Governor of the Gulf Ports consists, with the exception of Dashti and I)ashtistan, of the^yhole of the coastal strip extending from Bandar Dilam to the point where Persian and British Baluchis tan meet. South of Mi nab however on the BTaban coast from Jask and the sea board from the latter place eastwards along the Makran coast Persian sovereignty is merely nominal. The Mudlrs, or Customs Inspectors at Jask and Chahbar are the only Persian officials who are found in this section of the Gulf, and their presence is only possible through the measure of protection afforded by the existfnce of a British garrison and telegraph station in each place. (.See also Military Report on Persia, Volume IV, Part I.) This strip varies in13 width from 25—50 miles. In 1 this volume the districts which physically, though not administratively, form part of Ifars or Laristan, are described under those provinces. lars may be di\ided climatically and to some extent Fars. General physically into three divisions description. (a) The Sardslr or Sarhad, forming part of the central Iranian plateau (or high country). {h) The Garmslr, or low hill country, through which access is obtained to the plateau from the sea, and (c) The coastal plain, which varies in width from 12 miles near Bandar Dilam, more than 30 miles round Bushire to only one or two miles or even less behind Tahiri. lii') Sardslr. This covers roughly speaking all of the province Sardsir. which lies north of a line through Mian.Kutal, Firuzabad, Jahrum and Darab and embraces the greater part of the province'. From the sea as far as Shiraz, the mountains form a series of ridges roughly parallel to the coast, divided from each other by valleys of from four to ten miles in breadth. They are in general very fertile, and afford abundant grazing ■ even in the garmslr, water is always obtainable at no great depth, but lack of population, and the anarchy, which with rare intervals has long prevailed in the province, combine to retard its agricultural development. From Shiraz northwards the mountain system is less regular and the valleys generally more undulating, though 'very fertile ; the limit of cultivation is about 8,000'. The hills are as a rule barren ; oak forests are found in Fars only along a narrow belt scarcely 15 miles broad near Mian Kutal, extending far to the north-west, but not more than 50 miles to the east. North of Shiraz there is little forest, except near the Tang-i=. Bulaghi; mountains are seldom over 4,000' from top to base ; from the sea northwards they rise tier upon tier, increasing gradually in elevation, the folds inclining outwards in all directions from a centre, and fairly regular ; the increase m height of the in ervening valleys is proportionate to that ,0f the hills. The termgarmsir, in native parlance, signifies all districts Ga rmsir. between the sardslr and the sea, though for our purposes it is convenient to consider separately the coastalf mps 14 district which formB a part of it. It consists of valleys, seldom more than 5 miles wide, running roughly parallel to each other in a north-west and south-east direction, separated by barren mountain ranges some 3,000' in height. It is sparsely populated, villages, in some parts, lying at a great distance from one another; numerous rums demonstrate the existence in former times of a much larger sedentary population ; the plains and valleys are sparsely wooded, the only common tree being the tundr or jujube, but on the higher hills there is a very large quantity of wood, small trees as a rule, wild almonds, hannk and kulkhung predominating. Every village, however, small, has a patch of cultivation round it, the intervening country being desert. Grazing is usually excellent, but dry after May ; nomad tribes frequent this tract from November to April, spending the rest of the year in the sardslr. The date palm flourishes everywhere even in the more northerly districts; the fruit is but little exported, but forms an important addition to the indigenous food supply. Kaza- run represents about the most northerly point of cultiva tion of the date palm along the main caravan routes. Coastal Strip. Coastal Strip. —This is the flat alluvial tract lying between the sea and the most southerly mountain ranges of Fars. It is generally level, partly alluvial and partly sandy, studded with date palm plantations and very sparsely wooded with the hundr bush. It has a relatively large population amounting in all to some 100,000 persons, and includes the districts of Liravi, Haiat Da fid, Rud Hilleh, Angall, Shabankareh, Ziral, Mazarai, Borazjun, Tangistan and Dashti. This tract commences from a point some 13 miles to the north of Bandar Dllam, where from the sea to the coastal chain of mountains is only a distance of 15 miles, and stretches south for roughly 150 miles until the southern border of Dashti is reached, where the coastal chain again comes to within a few miles of sea. This plain in good years produces large quantities of grain.

It is under the Deputy- Governor of Dashti and Dashtistan, who however has little authority there and seldom collects the whole of the revenue due.

Rivers. Rivers. —The greater part of the drainage system of Pars flows into the Persian Gulf. The rivers from west to east are as follows : — (1) The Khur Khalil, entering the sea near GanSLveh. ^ (2) The Rud Shur, entering the sea 10 miles south of Bandar Rig. (3) The Rud Hilleh (formed by the junction of the Daliki and the Shahpur streams), entering the sea 20 miles north-west of Bushire. (4) The Chahkutah, entering the sea 10 miles east of Bushire. (5) The Mand, entering the sea at Khur Ziarat. (1) The Khur Khalil forms the harbour for the sailing craft and sea traffic of the villages of Ganaveh. A Customs post and a growing village is situated on its northern bank at the mouth. About one mile from its mouth the creek begins to wind through a deep cutting, and the bed of the stream winds across the plain behind the Kuh-I-Bang, and south of the village of Shul at the foot of the coast range. It is a salt stream, and is practically dry a few miles beyond its mouth for the greater part of the year, except during the rainy season. (2) The Riid Sh'lr (generally called Shur -i -Bldfi) is a salt stream flowing into the sea a few miles south-east of Banrlar R?g. It forms the boundary between Rud Hilleh and H dat Daud until east of Bidu, and between Haiat Da'xd and Shabai- kareh till it reaches the hills {Mcth'tr). When crossed near Bidu it has a broad bed, some 20 yards across, and shelving sandy banks, but is au most seasons easily fordable. Reco^ni^ed fords exist 2 miles east of Chehar Rustal and 2 miles west of fe un eh. At the latter quicksands and holes are encountered. The average normal depth of both is 3 feet. At Chehar Rustal, neai its descent from the hills, it flows through a deep cor^e, and, though shallow, is broad, and in May there is a consi derable volume of wa er. After the rains 'in January the R;id Shur overflows its banks, and together with the' Rud Hilleh puts the country between the two streams under water for many miles, and makes travel ^311-nigh impossible. Rud Rilleh. Urileh river is an estuary composed of the Shahpur and Dahk, rivers which units at Daraigah, about ' mlle3 ove lta uaoutu It is navigable by stnaL' aailinc Rud Shur.31 craft at certain seasons as far as Cham-i-Tangi, about 1.8 miles up. At Mahmadi it is a -wide stream, 30^—40 yards broad running between high banks perhaps 30 feet high, and ifj usually crossed by a ferry. In the rainy season the accumulation of water from the mountains sweeps down, and overflows the banks on both sides, often doing great damage to buildings. For more than 20 miles in length, on either side of the river, the land is for miles under water. There are fords at most villages. (6) The Slidhpvr river, alternatively know T n as the Rud- shal. khaneh-i-Shmn, rises in the Einjun hills behind the Tang-i- Chakan. After winding through this pass it debouches on to the Shahpnr plain. At Kaleh Hakim Bashi it flows through a hroad gully, having on its northern bank high cliffs, while tho southern shore shelves. It is here some SO yards across and has a swift current. After leaving the Shahpur plain not far from Bushakun, it flows past the base of the Kuh-i-Surkh and thence to Rudak. 1'rom Rudak it passes north of the Kutal-i-Kumarij till it reaches the village of Charum, where it is about 25 yards across, and has an open bank on the one sioe. It l hen flows through the Khisht plain on its northern side past the village of Aikiini, where it is some 40 yards across, some 3 feet deep before the heavy rains and is used for irriga tion. Thence it passes down to the coast plain through the district of Mazarai and becomes the border of tho Shabanhareh and Zlra districts. At Saadal ad, the chief town of Zira, it is about 80 yards wid9 ; its waters are much sweeter than those of the Daliki stream. There are fords about 2£ miles by road above Charfm, at Char! m, f mile below Chan m, Z ra, Saadabad, Dai\ dgah and Kulul, where it joins the Ri d Hilleh. The normal average depth of these is 3 feet. A small boat ferry exists at Mehmadihahl, but is not fit for horses. (c). The Bah Id river, alternatively called the Rudkhaneh-i- Dallkl. Shur, traverses the Jirreh valley, and, passing through the mountains of Jamilah, emerges a few miles above the Dalild bridge ; its waters, which appear very deep, are known as the Darya Quli. Below the Daliki bridge they are very swift and deep in places. The river does not debouch on to the plain by the caravan track, but turns off to the right. It then becomes the boundary between Ealiki and Boiazjun on its left bank and Zira on its right. In its course through Borazjfn41 11 32 in the- neighbourhood of ZUlrat it has out innumerable gullies all over the plain and a wide detour has to be maae. The' Daliki bridge consists of 6 stone arches made of large cut stone blocks. The road way is 30 feet wide with a parapet, 3 feet high on either side. It is paved with flat stone blocks. The highest tirch is the third from the south end and has a clearance of 20 feet. Other arches have a clearance of about 15 feet. The bridge is in good repair, but is not strong enough ior heavy motors. Its total length is 120 yards. The water channel is under the south end, and after rain is only about 25 yards wiae. The current is strong. There are fords at Daliki, Hooregah and Kulul, though ordi narily the stream is fordablefor cavalry and .infantry almost anywhere. The water of this river is very salt. Chahkiituli (4) The Ckdhk'fdh stream may be traced bach to the small river which waters the productive KhavTz (Khaiz) valley. It is deep in places, hut never very broad on its passage down towards Ahram. In the plain between Ahram and Chah-i- Plr there is practically no water in the autumn and its chief importance would seem to be the way in which it ha^ cut up the plain for several miles and rendered it boggy, treacher ous and impassable in the rainy season. In the summer it is dry save for a few shallow pools of water here and there. At Ahmadi the river-bed is about 15 yards across, and has little water, except after the winter rains, when it is frequently un- fordable for days. Hand. (5) The course of the Mand Hiver, known in its upper reaches successively as the Waz and Kara Aghach, was for long unmapped. It rises in the mountams north of Khan-i-Zinian at a place called Bun Rud; it i. cn flows south south-east past Aiur to Kavar, its waters being utilized for irrigation at many points from Khan-i-Zinian to Pas-i-Rudak in the Dizgah plain. It enters the Kavar plain by a defile, in which an ancient stone dam built for irrigation purposes exists; thence it flows down the Kavar-Khafr valley to Taduan, where it cuts through the end of the Kuh-i-Safid by a remarkable gorge and, after a circuitous course amongst the mountains of the Simakan district, emerges to the desolate Manyun valley (20 miles west of Jahrum) where it is joined by the Fasa stream (practically dry in summer), by the Maimand stream, .Jid, a little further down33 bv a fresh water river rising west of the deserted hill fort of Kalat-i-Zangibar, and flowing past the walled yi lla ge Madkhun in a narrow gorge. It obtains access to the ^ r ; 0 - Karzin plain, which it waters very completely, by a, very narrow and precipitous gorge through the mountains, part of which is quite impassable even on foot, lor some way after this it can be followed on horse or foot, through the plain. Afzar and Laghar-o-Maku, through the Tang-i -Shahnyan to Kupkab, near' Gird Bisheh, where the valley is about 3 miles broad. | _ Its course now becomes impassable for some miles until i emerges on to the Dizgah plain, where it is joined by— (i) The Kurdeh stream, dry for eight months in the year, rising a few miles west of li afta\ an, (ii) the Alamarvdasht and Fidash stream, one branch nsiiife a few miles south of Lar, another branch, running through the Tang-i-Khur, appearing to dram the neighbourhood of Khunj, Bukhard and Bmaru. though this is doubtful; _ _ (in) the Shur river, a salt stream, rising m the KhwajSi district, north of Firuzabad ; this tributary greatly exceeds the main stream in volume and is for tlie greater part of the year quite unfordable ; below the junction the waters of the Mand, by which name the stream then becomes known, are too salt to be of use for irrigation 5 (i v ) the Jam and Riz stream, fresh, but dry for 8 months in the year. It will be seen from the above survey of the river and its tributaries that it drains a very small volume of its waters is due to ^ ^ ' ts ™' 1 . n embraces no lofty ranges, except perhaps tlcKl-. ■ Tt is also eloquent of the small rainfall of Lanstan that the Wamarvdasht tributary, though 200 miles long, and uoth a basin as large as that of many an English nvei, is quite dry 8 months in the year. i , . . The Kara Aghach river is or was bridged at the following KaaAgl**. points: — (a) Khan-i-Zinian. [b) Kavar (bridge in ruins), ; C37CGS 1034 (c) Qir-o-Karzin plain. The t'ul-i-Arus, a two-storied bridge, the roadway being in the upper storey. It is not certain that this bridge still exists. (d) Near Baghan. Remains of an ancient bridge. The river is useless for navigation; it is fordable except in flood time even at its mouth, where the depth at low water does not usually exceed 3J feet. It can be ascended by native craft of 40 tons burden almost as far as Kaki. Khur Ziarat, which forms its mouth, is a small creek with low banks which can be entered at high water, but the entrance is exposed and does not form a good harbour for native craft. For a short distance to the north of it, and for some miles southward, the coast of the mainland is swampy. There are certain rivers of Pars which do not reach the sea ; there is only one such of importance, the Kur or Bandamir of which the Pulvar is a tributary. The Pulvar rises in the Chehar Dangeh district, with a branch rising in the hills north of Dehbid. The main stream flows through a lake or marsh in Latitude 30° 30', Longitude 52° 50' and is crossed by the Shiraz-Isfahan road under Khan-i- Khirgah. It flows through the Mashhad-i-Murghab plain past Pasargadae and the tomb of Cyrus, and through the Tang-i- Bulaghi to Sivand and Khafrak, finally effecting a junction 'with the parent stream in Marvdasht. The main stream known as Kur rises in the Ujan valley and runs north-west to Dizkurd, then turning south and south-east . runs through Kam Firuz and Ramjird to Marvdasht, where it forms extensive marshes in spring time ; then passing through the Kurba it falls into Lake Niriz. The river is extensively used for irrigation and many dams obstruct its course. Thirty miles above Pul-i-Khan it is dammed by the Band-i-Nasirl, so called from the fact that Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1890 repaired the structure, which was originally erected by the Achsemenian kings. Eight miles below Pul-i-Khan is the dam of As'ad-ud-Douleh upon which stands a bridge of 13 arcl es, 20 yards in length. Other weirs are Kushkak, Qar^sun, Husainabad, Band-i-Tilaku (21 miles south-south- eait of Khur) and Pifa Mas.35 cwStfV^r 1 of the 3alt iata wiioh - a They are briefly described below : — (1) :Dar ^-i-Parishan ; in the Kazarfm tnct, 13 miles south-east of the town of that name; a long narrow sheet of water stretching north-vvest and south-east about 3J miles long by! to 1 mile broad. &amp; J v On its south side it is very shallow but doubtless deepens towards the centre; lofty limestone hills he to north and south of it: it is fed by a stream conung in from the south-east close to the village of lamur; its marshy banks afford excellent grazing and good shooting and fishing. (2) The Dashi-i-Arjan Lake, in the plain of the same name' Dasht-l-ArJ«n. dries up almost entirely in summer; extensive marshes lie on its banks. f3) Mahdrlii, the smallest of the three main salt lakes of M »haria.

In a dry sumtner season the water evaporates entirely and the bed naay then be crossed on foot,; the salt which remains is extensively collected ; it is of fine quality and much in demand throughout Fars. Water-fowl such as swans, flamingoes, and ducks abound. The shores have no sandy beach, but consist of soft, fine, evil-smelling mud. It contains no fish. There is a fresh spring at Khur. Several wooded islets break the monotony of the surface of the lake. i)237 The principal towns in Fars are ;— Towm. Slnrdz. —Elevation 5,100 feet, the capital of Fars, by post road Shlra, ' B26 miles south-south-east of Isfahan and 182 miles rtrrth- east of Bushire. It is situated on the right bank of a stream in a fertile and well-watered plain about 7 miles wide GMrrounded by mountains. Rich gardens and vineyards exist in its vicinity. The stream, which sometimes has a certain volume of water from December to April, is usually dry for the rest of the year, the water being used lor irrigation purposes. It empties itself into the salt lake, the upper margin of which is perhaps 12 milos from Shiraz in a south-easterly direction. Five miles south ot Shiraz the valley is separated from an extensive marsh by a low range of hills. The city is irregularly circular in shape flanked by semi-circular towers, rising some feet above the parapet, which is bounded by a dry ditch. Both towers and wall are in bad repair, the latter in some instances having fallen and filled up tiie ditch so that it is quite easy to ride through the gaps. The southern wall is in tolerable repair. The circumference of the wall is about 4 miles, but in more recent and peaceful times the suburbs have become enlarged so that the original outline is no longer clearly traceable. More than half of the enclosed area of the city is taken up with bazaars, maiddns, the Governor 's palace, gardens, stablea and other public buildings, leaving the remaining space for occupation by the inhabitants. The city has 6 gates • The population is probably not over 50,000, including about 7,000 Jews. There are in Shira* fifty considerable mosques, besides many others of inferior note to a total number of fifty, eleven colleges, fourteen bazaars, thirteen caravansarais and fifty-six baths. While the houses of Shiraz are, in general, smail and the streets narrow and filthy, the great bazaar, built by Kanm Khan and commonly called the Bazar -i-Vakil, situated at the north-east corner of the city, forms a distinguished exception to this general description. It is built in the shape of a cross and is about 500 yards in length by 120 yards in breadth, having a vaulted roof 22 feet high. Local provisions of excellent quality are obtainable, and are found in abundance. The J rA-, or citadel, in which the Governor-General of Fars resides, if a rectangular building about 80 yards square, with large open spaces on three sides. The palace within is far from being an elegant structure.38 A British Consul resides permanently in Shiraz. About half a mile outside and north-west of the city is a garden where the staff of the Indo-European Telegraph Department live. A chief branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia is established in the city. Communications radiate in every direction, but only by caravan, except to Isfahan, to which there is a carriage road. The tomb of the celebrated poet Hafiz is half a mile outside the city. Among the local manu factures are rough carpets, ndmad (felt), tents and curtains, small arms, swords, daggers and foot wear. The local wine is celebrated. Abftdeh. Abddeh. —Elevation 6,100', a town about half-way between Shiraz and Isfahan on the road between them ; it is the chief place of a district of the same name under a Deputy Governor (subordinate to Shiraz), who is generally a local man and has for years been a nominee of the Ilkhdnl of the Qashqai. The town is walled, but there is a considerable population resident, without the walls and in adjacent villages. The estimated population is 8,000. The Indo-European Telegraph Department have a station here, with a clerk in charge ; there is also telephone com munication with Qumisheh and Dehbid. The wall is reported to be in good condition. It is of mud varying in thickness from 8 feet at the bottom to 4 feet at the top. Most of the houses are of sun-baked brick, one-storied, and are well built. The remainder are of mud and straw. The Fort is situated about 1,200 yards'to the north of the town: Its walls are of sun-burnt brick from six to eighteen inches in thickness. The chief industries are the manufacture of malikls (Persian cloth shoes), furniture, inlaid wares, felts and carpets. The majority of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture, the chief crops being wheat, barley, opium, raisins, grapes and almonds. Water is plentiful and good. Each house has its own well. There is also a qandt which runs through the town, known as the Qanat-i-Khirat, which contains sweet water. The plains around Abadeh are intersected with numerous qandts which bring fresh Water down ft-om the hills. Supplies plentiful, as also is fruit, in season; climate good ; the winter is severe but less so than at Dehbid.41 and covers a considerable space. The buildings are of stone and mortar and have an appearance of solidity and neat ness which is wanting in mud habitations: they are als J o frequently stuccoed. Many of them are fortified, possessing parapets and loop-holes for musketeers. The town is reckoned to contain 3,000 houses, quite one-third of which are in ruins, imparting a desolate look to the streets, which is rather belied by the scenes of activity in the commercial quarter and in the crowded bazar, where some 50 60 shops are to be found. The situation is on the north-west side of a well-cultivated vale on a slight rise. Palms and walnut, orange and lemon trees are nearly the only verdure it possesses. There is an office of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart- ment here, open for international traffic. The population of the town in 1919 was said to be 10,000 persons. The total population of the valley is about 20,000 souls and is well armed. They are quick -tempered and are always fighting each other. There is a colony of 200 Jews, chiefly engaged in the goldsmiths' trade residing around their synagogue on the southern edge of the town. The people are proud of their orange gardens, but the oranges are either sour or bitter. Provisions are abundant here, except in spring, and the valley abounds in forage ; it is said to be very healthy except in the autumn months. Water is supplied principally from qandts. It is noteworthy that Kazarun is the home of many muleteers engaged on the Bushire-Shiraz road. Firewood can be procured. Warm felts, hair ropes for draught cattle, pack saddles for draught cattle and malikis, an easy shoe for hill-marching, form the manufactures of the place. Blacksmiths, farriers, leather dressers and tent makers are to be found here and in the vicinity Timber, called safidar, which is a white poplar, plane and walnut trees are procura &gt;le. Saltpetre is found in the neighbourhood and powder might be made here with little labour. Snow is collected in the moun tains to the north-east of the town and brought down for use in summer. Towards the Shahpur end of the valley are rice swamps and a large amount of rice is imported from Khuzistan and the Mamassani district.44 Twenty-one feet is the greatest draught with which a^ vessel can safely enter the inner anchorage, and for this depth of water , the conditions have to be favourable, the height of the tide being influenced by the prevailing wind. With a southerly wind go d tides are experienced, while with a northerly wind the reverse is the case. The latter predominate. The holding ground in both anchorages is of a soft mudand is good, and there is no rocky bottom in th^r vxcmtV. Wrth^a southerly wind especially, or with a northerly wmd the outer anchorage soon becomes unusable owing to the heavy swell, and in any fresh breeze sufficient sea rises to make the disembarka- tion of troops and stores a task of considerable difficulty. The distance from the wharves to the inner anchorage is 3 miles, and to the outer 7 miles by the boat channel. In the channel between the inner anchorage and the wharves on^h^ feet of water is obtainable at low water. J he draught o^aft employed for discharging vessels should therefore, rfpo«ible, not exceed 4 feet 6 inches. The maximum rise of tide at Bushire is about 6 feet 6 inches, but, as pointed out before, this rise to a great extent depends on the prevailing wind. No fixed moorings are provided. Coast. —The coast is shelving, generally sandy, but rocky in places. Cliffs run from the south end of the t^wn for half a mile to the south. Thence no more cliffs occur till Reshire, 5| miles south of Bushire. Tides and currents.—TiAe* do not run strongly enough to interfere with landing in boats, and there are no dangerous currents. Ligh/s. —Two lights placed vertically are exhibited from the British (town) Residency flagstaff ; one white, fixed, is 72 feet above high water and should be seen from a distance of 1 miles ; the other red, fixed, is 54 feet above high water and should be seen from a distance of 11 miles. Light Buoys.—A light-buoy exhibiting a white occultiiig light every ten seconds, eclipse 3 seconds, is moored in outer anchorage in 4| fathoms of water, 4J miles westward of the British (town) Residency. A light-buoy exhibiting a red occulting light every ter seconds, eclipse 3 seconds, is moored in 2 4 fathoms of watei45 * near toe anchorage, 2-h miles north-westward from the Resi dency. Beacon. —A beacon, an iron tube carrying a pole surmounted by a ball, 15 feet high stands in about 4 feet of water on Eas- al-Marg, a Sand bank some 1| miles north-west of the Eesi- ♦ dency. Pilots. —There are 4 or 5 local pilots, but pilots are hardly required except in thick weather or with a bad sea on the bar. Tugs and Launches. —The following launches are at present (March 1922) at Bushire : — 1. Steam launch, 85 feet long, belonging to the British Political Resident. 2. Steam launch, some 85 feet long, belonging to the Persian Customs Department. 3. Small motor launch, about 15 feet in length, belong ing to the above Department. 4. Sea-going motor launch, about 85 feet long, belonging to the British India Steam Navigation Company and i used for their mail service to and from steamers. Dredging. —The port would be greatly improved by dredg ing. Landing place for troops.—In addition to the usual landing place at the Customs House, a landing can be effected almost ' anywhere on the beach to the south of the town presuming it is quite calm. With anything of a sea running the task of landing troops on the beach would be highly dangerous, if not impossi ble.' Ships lying in the inner anchorage are sheltered to a certain extent from the kaus, but not in any way from the shamal. A convenient place at Biishire itself is abreast the town Residency, on a sandy and rocky beach. The most con venient place outside the town is a natural landing stage at Dastak below the cable house at Reshire point. At Dastak below the Reshire cable station there is a wharf of stone and cement with a frontage of 70 feet and wharfage area of ^ibout 4,500 feet, which would be of great use in fine weather and smooth water for landing purposes. Owing to the rocky nature of the bottom and the depth of water alongside at low tide, i.e., 5 feet, it can only be used in smooth water. A heavy ground swell run* in with any breeze, but more especially with a southerly one, which also tends to make itw 46 dangerous for any vessel lying alongside this wharf in shallow water. There is no shelter of any description from the prevailing winds, i.e., southerly and north-Westerly, and, as Dastak is 11 miles from Bushire by sea, there is some risk in using this wharf except in settled weather. The construction of a break-water from Reshire point in a south-easterly direction so as to form a sheltered anchorage would be an expensive undertaking. In l^oP, the troops landed on the open sandy beach in Hal- iileh bay, 10 miles south of Bushire, which was found in every way suitable. If there were no opposition, the CuBtoms House is the most convenient landing place, as it is sheltered, has a long line of mud embankment faced with stone, and deep water for boats alongside. Animals can walk ashore from native craft, but there are no facilities for them. Two other landing places are opposite the former Russian and German Consulates, where the shore is sandy and firm. In all the above cases however troops, even if landed in small boats Carrying 15-20 men apiece, would have to wade a short distance to reach dry land. Shamah and the I aus would interfere with boats loading along side the ships, and their passage ashore. Provided the Shamdl is not blowing, stores can be landed at Bushire all the year round &gt; but troops cannot well be landed between April and October on account of the extreme heat. A heavy swell sets in about a month before the monsoon. Sailing Vtssels belonging to liv shire:— 1. Fishing boats 2. Mashuwehs and a few halams which trade between the Gulf Ports; of these some 50 are small craft used for the ferry from Bushire to Shif: average tonnage 5—6 tons. 3. Large sized vessels trading between Bushire, India and Zanzibar. Mashuiv&amp;hs and Bums and one bugga- low. i. Mashuwehs, harbour boats working between the wharf and vessels in the roadsteads.

Tonnage. 121 200 25—40 30 50—70 30 15—2049 About 80 yards of creek frontage to the north-west of the condenser plant is fronted by Persian godowns which would be useful as storerooms and workshops. Wharf Coolies. There are 1,000 to 1,500 coolies always present who unload vessels, etc., but during harvest times (spring and August—September) not more than about 500 would be available. In one month's time however, if hostilities with the Persian Government did not exist, 1,000—1,500 GoUId easily be collected. Convoy jrownffa.—Plenty of space is available to the south of the town, about 500 to 1,000 yards from the store depots. There is no real grazing ground near; the water, though brackish, is fit for animals. Mules used on the road always camp somtf 10 miles out near AhmadI, where there is grazing. Sanitation. —Arrangements are usally nil. Soil. —The soil everywhere is very sandy and would cut up. Wherever a landing was made, light tram lines would be advisable. Telegraph. —The Indo-European cable leaves the water at Re^hire, where there is a staff of some 15 European and Eura sian operators. Camping ground*. —The best camping ground would be on the high ground to the west of the Imamzddeh, the Sabzabad Residency, and Reshire. This position commands the whole town and approaches. Water is said to be plentiful, and the best obtainable in the peninsula. The site is the most healthy in the neighbourhood. Note on the accommodation taken up hy the British Force during 1918 occupation of Bushire and Reshire (Vide Map .) The whole area was divided into two administrative areas divided by the line X X on the map. These areas were known as Bushire and Reshire, respectively. The former in cluded Bushire town. («) Bushire. accommodation taken up in the town of Bushire consisted of houses rented from their Persian owners which accommodated chiefly the Embarkation and Marine Staff, and the necessary 8. and T. personnel required for dealing with the handling of stores, etc., and the staff of the Bushire Ordnance Depot. A certain number of huts were erected near the wharf for thp accommodation of Indian personnel whose duties necessitated their being close at hand. This personnel was Subsequentl-tf MC370GS E50 - also for Field Park, Telegraph and Signal stores. A re«t. camp was formed about 1 mile from Bushire . own in a southerly direction and close to the main Buslure -Reshire road in Square A 30 A. This camp eventually consjtedof l-.hu Indian troops, 3 huts for officers and mess, and 4 f « r Brl ^ 0 e t ^ ranks with the necessary latrines, cook-houses, • o^modated the Indian LaW Corps wovkmg at the C^s wharf and the Alilitary Police employed under the Lmbaikation StafT It was also occasionally used to accommodate troops on arrival from overseas or awaiting embarkation. Another camp known as Pioneers' Camp was situated m Square B 10 and formed the main station and headquarters of the Bhshire railway. In it were accommodated Railway personnel. Telegraph and R. T. O. staff and a hospital. All the water for this area was brought m transports from India. The German Consulate (Square D 31 B) was taken over to accommodate the R. A. F. personnel and a Lab ' 1 ' formed near the Bushire-Reshire road in Square I) -4 to ac* commodate a Labour Corps working mtbe vicinity. ^ (6) Reshire. —The greater portion of the houses m Reshire were taken over and rented for military accommodation, ihey were occupied as follows: Offices and residences.— „ ^ Tr j q * House.

Headquarters, c. and T., Medical and Works Services. *House JB.—Base Offices, Mechanical Transport, Ordnance Depot, Base Post Office, including accommodation for Base btaii and other Base officers. * House C. —Headquarters 3rd Echelon, including offices and living accommodation for complete staff. *Houses ,D, E, F, G. —Houses occup ed by officers of various units situated at the Base. - - •It should be borne in mind that, although these houses were occupied in 1918-19, they may have fallen into-a State erf disrepair.M Hospitals.— * House H. —A British General Hospital wag accommodated in this house with beds for British Officers 23 and British other tanks 41, total 64. * House J. —An Indian General Hospital was placed in this house which gave accommodation for 182 patients. Huts and tents were erected in the vicinity to accommodate respectively 50 and 404 patients, making the total accommodation up to 636 patients. *HouseK. —Occupied by Medical Officers. *House L. —Occupied by Nursing Sisters. Both at House K and L tents were used to supplement the accommodation avail able in the houses. * House M. —Occupied by a battalion of Indian Infantrv and the E. F. Canteen. ' r Huts for the overflow were erected in the vicicity of the house. * House N. —A large number of Warrant Officers, Non-Com missioned Officers, and British other ranks occupied this house while specially constructed buildings were erected near by for others. The personnel of units up the line were accommodated in huts erected in the courtyard of House B, and the kits and baggage of these units were stored in the outhouses belonging to the same house. It should be explained that House B is of very large size and contains a number of outhouses of consi derable capacity the total capacity being such that with the addition of a few huts constructed in the courtyards there is ample room for a battalion of Indian infantry, A large hutted rest camp sufficient to accommodate a batta lion of Indian Infantry was formed in Square J-24-D. Thia camp was first of all used to accommodate units prior to their moving up to the line. Afterwards it was used at? a Deta Is Camp and also for a certain amount of overflow of depot per- sonnel of units up the line. The British officers belonging to the camp were accommodated in House 0. iQi« I iV h fw d ? e b K rnei f n l , ? lin&lt; ?i bat ' tlipse houses were occupied iu 1918-19 they mav imve fallen juto a 8tate of disrepair. e2,(v Camps were also formed in Square H.-5 known as Andar Bandar. These were chiefly used by Mule and Camel Corps prior to going up the line and also at times as segregation camps. A certain proportion of a Labour Corps was also camped there for a short period. A Government Dairy Farm was located in a building in Square J-22-C. Sheds were constructed in the vicinity tor 8 J cows, and the land in Square J. towards the sea was cultivated for vegetable growing, etc. t The water for the Reshire area was manufactured in the Dastak condenser (Square M.-9-B.) The water was pumped from the condenser to a large reservoir or tank at P. From this reservoir it was distributed to units under Supply and Transport arrangements. Water was also obtained from the wells of Andar Bandar, which was distributed by means of donkeys. Minor ports. Of the small ports between Bushire and Lingeh only the following five are worthy of mention : — • (1) Daiyir .. Port of Dashti. (2) Tahiri ' .. Saliseh Port (see special notice below). (3) Asalu .. Saliseh Port. (4) Mughu .. Shibkuh Port. (5) Charak .. Shibkuh Port. The chief reasons for their importance are: (a) their good anchorages. (b) The fact that they are starting points for caravans proceeding to the interior. (c) The comparatively-speaking large amount of trade which passes through them. The Saliseh Ports are (from Bushire to the south)— Sheikh. Population. 1. Kangun .. Sheikh .. 800 1 2. Tumbak .. Sheikh Khatim .. 400 j All are under the 3 Tahiri .. 600 I Govemor-Gen- 4! Asalu .. Sheikh .. 200 j eral of the Gulf 5. Naiband .. Muhammad .. 200 J Ports. From the first four much firewood is brought to Bushirc. The population is a mixture of Persians and Arabs.^7 53 Tahirl is one of the Saliseh ports, approximately half TahiiL way between Bushire and Lingeh. It is in a small open bay, formed by two low points 2 miles apart and covered with date groves. The village is built partly on the shore and partly up the side of the coast range, here 700' high. It contains 150 stone houses, inhabited chiefly by Arabs with some Persian Shi'ahs. Water is obtained from wells 3 fathoms dfeep. A few horses, donkeys, cattle (25) and sheep and goats (300) are the only live stock reported here, but more are said to be inland. Tahiri has 14 sailing boats, chiefly bums of 15—20 tons average burthen. The importance of Tahiri lies in the fact that vessels can be brought quite close inshore, instead of, as is usually the case in the Gulf, having to lie a long way out. The bay deepens regularly from the coast to 8 fathoms at J mile off shore. The only routes into the interior are by two passes, by blocking which an enemy could be confined to the narrow strip along the sea coast. The hinterland is sparsely populated and little known, and thus the place would appear admirably adapted for smuggling operations. The inhabitants own about six trading sambuqs. Bandar Dllam. —A small port of the Liravi district, but not Bandar Dilam. forming part of it administratively ; 85 miles north-north-west of Bushire and at an equal distance east-north-east of the Shatt- al-Arab bar. The town stands upon a low coast running north and south, and consisting of a strip of rocky land 10' to 15' above sea-level with swamps behind extending several miles inland. Half a mile, to the south is a little cultivation with some trees, and to the east is a plain containing a few villages dependent on .Dilam. A square fort in a very delapidated condition stands in the middle of the town and i| miles to the north-east is the fort of Tunub, which protects the water supply. The town formerly belonged to the Dutch. The anchorage for vessels, about miles off the shore, is sheltered from the sharndl and partially from the kaus ; the bottom is of soft mud and the depth of water four fathoms ; native craft lie close in to the beach in a creek in a mud flat. Landing is difficult, because of the mud, and cargoes are unloaded and loaded by means of donkeys.J4 54 The population is from 1,000 to 2,000 souls of the Behbehani tribe and is entirely Shi'ah ; all are Persian-speaking, but about one-third of them can talk Arabic as well. Some are culti vators in the surrounding Liravi district, others are sailors or fishermen, and the remainder merchants or shop-keepers. The resources of the place are inconsiderable ; drinking water is scarce and indifferent ; it is brought from Tunub, about I mile distant. About 20 horses, 200 donkeys and .00 sheep and goats are owned by the inhabitants. There are 35 sailing vessels, chiefly bums, average tonnage 15—20 tons, also some 20 small fishing boats. Bandar Elg. Bno'lar Rig. —The port and chief town of the Haiat Daud district, 30 mites north -north-west of Bushire. It stands upon a low sandy coast, which runs north and south. I here is p. creek at the town, fronted by two sand banks, inside which native craft lie aground at low water. On the north and south the towi; is adjoined by cultivated lands belonging to adjacent'villages, and on the east, at about 2 miles distance, is a chain of low sandhills, which screen it from the view of the traveller as he approaches on that side. Ihe only defensive work is the loop-holed, semi-fortified residence of the Khan, built of stones and mud. The village possesses a few date trees and two unimportant shrines. The inhabitants number about 2,000 souls ; they are a mongrei breed in whom Arab and Lur blood predominates. Persian, rrodified by the Lur dialect, is the language spoken. The people are cultivators, boatmen, sailors and traders ; ■ they are reputed peaceable and not fanatical, but they are fairly well armed with modern magazine and Martini rifles in about equal proportions. Few of the male population are without a rifle of their own. They are Shi'ah Muhammadans, but tradi- tiona survive of a time when some of them were Cabrs. Water is obtained from shallow wells, about 10 in number, some f mile north-east of the village. It is of excellent &lt; uality but hardly more than sufficient for the requirements of the inhabitants. A force of 100 men could probably be provided for without difficulty. The water from the wells in the village itself is brackish. About 50 horses, 100 camels and 150 donkeys, also 100 cattle and COO sheep and goats are owned in the town and there are 35 sailing craft, chiefly mduhiiwehs with55 a few hums ot 15-20 tons burthen. There are also some 6-8 small fishing boats. A Persian post office was opened hem about 1901 and a telegraph office about 1904. Bandar Rig is a very prosperous port, dealing principally with Bushire and Kuwait and serving the considerable district of Haiat Daud and a part of the district of Shabankareh. The bazaar contains about 50 shops. Exports are wheat, barley, gum, wool and cattle. The Persian Icrdn is the basis of currency, but rupees and dollars also circulate. The unit of weight is a Hd&lt;him man equal to 20 Tabriz man of Bushhe, and consequently different from the//a.v/im of that place, which is equivalent to 10 Tabriz wan of the same town. The stand- aid of length is a gaz of SJ inches. GanaveJi.-^-A small port about 10 miles north of Bandar R'g GaoSveh. at the mouth of the Khu'r Khalll, which extends some two miles to the north-east. The Khur has a depth of 6 feet at high tides and 4 at low tides. The former stone quay which was situated on the west bank has fallen into rains and is not used now. There are no landing facilities. There is an anchorage inside the Khur which is 50 yards wide just above the quay. There is room here for at least 20 heliums drawing 5-6 feet. They are aground at low water. There is also an anch iraoe for large ships outside, and this is sheltered from the north and south by sandy points, but is open to the west. There are some local craft which trade with Bnshire, Bandar Abbas and Masqat. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have recently made Ganaveh the base for their investigations for oil inland at Dasht i-Qil, and for this purpose have erected a wireless set at the port, w hich can communicate with Maidan-i-Kaitun and Dasht-i-Qil. The village of Ganaveh contains some 250 houses, chiefly of brick with a few reed huts. The inhabitants who number about 1,300, are peaceful and quiet. They are of mixed race similar to those of Bandar Big, but the Persian element predominates. They possess very few arms. Their chief occupation is trade with the Gulf Ports and importation of goods from the interior. Water is good from some 6 wells situated one mile to the north-east of the village in sandy soil. There is a camping ground for two brigades here.66 (h) Yazd* Ywd. The province of Yazd occupies a central position in Persia both geographically and commercially. Its boundarie-' &amp; re very ill-defined. To the south-west it is bounded by Fars (vide previous paragraphs). Its western border runs from t e junction of Fars and Ispahan along the border of the latter until it reaches a point 25 miles north-west of Nain where it runs due east and marches with Dasht -i-Kavir to the south west border of Khorasan. This it follows in a south-east direction to the junction of Kerman and Khorasan, some 100 miles north of Keraian itself. Hence it passes due westward again south of Bafq to a point 45 miles south-south east of Yazd town, where it bears south along the Kerman border to its junction with that ot T ar-s. The province itself is but little inhabited and consists of a number of villages in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of Yazd to the north-east, north-west, south-east and south west and comprising some 951 villages in all. Hie population in 1900 amounted to 20,000 inhabitants. Yazd, elevation 4,075', capital of the district, lies 200 miles ST™' south-east of Isfahan, and some 220 miles north-west of Kerman. Its chief characteristics are the number of wind towers {bddglr) and water reservoirs (db ambar). The streets are narrow, dirty, unpaved and half filled with sand. Houses have often two underground stories. Great plains extend to the north and south, but gardens for at least a mile from the city are gradually dominating the sand» The old town, in which is the ark or citadel, the residence of the Governor, has walls, bastions and a ditch. The arh, too, is well fortified and calculated to resist the attack of a mob. The main bazaar is fairly well built and lighted; the side ones are dark and dirty. The population is put at 60.000, and among these the Parsls form an important community. About 1,000 live in the city, and 6,000 more in villages outside. The streets in their quarters are wider, cleaner and more sanitary, and their houses better than in the rest of the city. There are about 1,000 Jews ; these have a hard life. A few native Indians engaged in trade live here, and a small European community exists, including five missionaries. The feeling against them has died away and they ^re now not only respected but liked.57 Yazd is commercially the most important point on the caravan route of 1,000 miles between Bandar Abbas and Meshed, It is a great receiving and forwarding depot for goods, and to this it mostly owes its wealth and importance. Opium is its most important export, and weaving the chief industry. The great hindrance to a development of trade is want of transport; for this camels are mainly used. Roads radiate in every direction to other important cities. Yazd has a telegraph office on the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment line from Tehran vid Kerman to Kuh-i-Malik Siah. The entire crops of the province, in a good year, only suffice to supply the city for three months. There is a British Vice-Consulate and a branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Ardakdn. —This town, 3,639' above sea level, is situated Ardakan. some 35 miles north-west of Yazd on the most frequented caravan route to Kashan. It lies in a hollow with its three villages Sharifabad, Turkabad and Ahmadabad ; the popula tion is about 17,400, including the villages. The town is surrounded by walls with pepper-pot towers above which rise the wind towers. There is a large covered caravansarai which is in a good state of repair. There are some 37 qandts of which only 3 have sweet water. There is a post and tele graph office. It is here that the Indo-European Telegraph Department lines from Reshire and Kuh-i-Malik Siah to Tehran join. Nam. —Elevation 5,300', lies between the Bilabad or Nain, Surmeh Kuh mountain on the west and a short irregular range of no great height on the east at the junction of the Yazd- Tehran and Yazd-Isfahan roads. The town is in a ruined condition. It contains about 1,000 inhabited houses and as many empty ones. The population is about 5,000. It has a roofed bazaar of about 60 shops. It also has a caravansarai and a post and telegraph office. Water is plentiful from qandts' but somewhat brackish. The town is surrounded by a brick wall 25' high with a moat which is in a dilapidated condition especially on the west side, where the ground completely commands the town. The ditch is 12 to 15 feet deep and 19 to 20 feet broad. Ba fq. —Elevation 3,200', lies 70 miles east of Yazd; popula- Bafq. tion 3,000. It stands in the midst of a wild desolation, and ancient qandts supply it with brackish water. It abounds inS8 mulberry, pomegranate and palm trees which fill the gardens extending two miles to the north of the town. From a dis tance it looks prosperous but it is in reality poverty-stricken. There is no trade as the town lies off the main route. Mountains. Mountains. —One of the chief ranges of the great mountain system which runs across ^Persia from north-west to south east cuts across the province of Yazd to the west of Yazd city. Roughly speaking it extends from Nadushan to Kalvand, and consists in itself of several ranges also running from north-west to south-east and connected by high ground with an average elevation of 5,500 feet. The highest peaks of the range are the Shir Kuh, 13,740 feet, the K lh-i-Tizarjan, 13,986 feet, and the Kuh Ardarushk, about 14,500 feet. These hills as a rule rise gradually from the Yazd side and fall abruptly on the other side to the level of the plateau. •i (c) Ldnslan. Laristan. Laristan is bounded on the south by the northern shore of the Persian Oulf opposite the Pirate Coast, and has a coast line of about 220 miles. On the north-west and north it marches With Fars, on the north-east with Kerman and on the east with the district of Shamil. lake most provinces of Persia its boundary on the land side is ill-defined and vague, but it may be taken as starting in the west from the eastern boundary of Galehdar and from there take? a semi circular sweep in a north-east direction to Bidshahr, passing just to the south of that village and some 20 miles south of Jahram; from here't runs north-east to a point about midway between Rusta | and Furg and then, taking a curve to the south via Kakhu and Guhra and Latidan, to the sea at the mouth of the Shiir River neSx Khamir. The southern bounda ry is the Persian Gulf as far west, as, but excluding Mughfi, and * thence to the Galehdar border the boundary of the ShTbk h dist rict. The surface of the country is diversified with plains and mountains, the general trend of the latter being trom north- north-west to south-south-east, but the ranges in these parts are not so extensive as in the other parts of South Persia, nor do they attain the same elevation,—^seldom exceeding 6,000'. Mountains rise along the whole extent of the coast giving it a bold appearance, while many oi the peaks serve as land marks tor navigation.Rivers. —The rivers are unimportant, the largest being, Rivers, perhaps, the Shur, which flows into the Clarence Straits near Jshamir, but this like many of the smaller streams, is salt, and therefore not of much value for purposes of irrigation. The capital town of the province stands at an alti- Towns, tude of 2,97,'/. It is 153 miles from vShiiaz ard 127 from Lar ' Bandar Abbas, situated at the west end of a valley running from east and west and nestling at the foot of lo\v s limestone hills, which block the west extremity of the valley ; it is not visible from any great distance on the roads leading to it. It is an uiiWcllled city covering about ^ square mile&gt; dominated by two steep, limestone hills about 400' above the level of the city. The north hill contains one or two huts ana the ruins of an old fort. The north slope was formerly descended by a large ditch with bastions,, the remains of which are still Visible. The other hill is crowned by the ruins of an old mud fort, now entirely dilapidated, and commanded from the top of the northern hill which is about 1,200 yards away. Lar has a population of approxiir^tely 8,000 souls. There are no local manufactories and the place owes its importance to the fact that it is a centre of trade and a halting place for large caravans. It'has a covered bazaar with shops ; close to the west and east ends of the bazaar !j*ei o are two large roofed cisterns, some 35'deep, containing a large supply of good water. The houses are usually commodious and well-built with a central courtyard. There are numerous cisterns in which rain water is collected and a number of large wells about 70' deep which • give brackish water. There is also a large qandi giving a large supply of water. The residence of the Governor is in the centre of the town surrounded by a strong wait flanked with towers. In the centre of the town and close to the bazaar there are two large sarais about SO' square surrounded by small rooms. Fnrg or Fnrl:. —Elevation 2,890', Furg is the next town of importance. It is situated 156 miles from Bandar Abbas, 189 Tnirg ' miles from Lingeh and 197 miles from Shiraz. The town is built in the form of a square with sides about, 400 yards long and is surrounded by a high mud wall, flanked at intervals of 75 yards by round mud towers, while a larger tower in the centre is used as a keep. There is no moat and the defences are in a very dilapidated state.60 Furg was at one time an important place, but now, though capable of accommodating 1,000 people, has only 100 to 150 inhabitants, while the total population of the Furg plain, exclusive of wandering Arabs, of whom many pitch their tents in the neighbourhood, does not exceed 500. It has a bazaar but there are very few shops. Lingeh.—Roadsfead. —Ships at Lingeh usually anchor | to | mile from the landing place, and are able to do so in all weathers. There is room for a great number of vessels, but no fixed moor ings are provided. Coast. —The coast is shelving, and the beach sandy. Alt ground near is low lying and sandy, with a gentle rise inland. Five fathom line is half to three quarters of a mile from shore. Tides and current*. —Tides do not run strongly enough to interfere with landing from small boats, and there are no dangerous currents. Pilots. —No pilots are required, since there is no bar. Launches. —One of the Customs launches, size about 85 feet long with a 6 foot draught is generally stationed here, but no other steamers of any lund. Landing places for troops. —Tf inexpedient to land troops op posite the town, they could utilize any point up to 5 miles to the west or 10 miles to the east. The shore is everywhere sandy and shelving though rocky in places, and transports could approach to within half a mile. Normally the surf is negligible, but when a south-east gale is blowing it is dangerous to land from small boats. Native boats. —Some 20 or 30, of 25 to 35 tons, and num bers of smaller craft, are always available. In non-pearling seasons 50 to 66 boats are left drawn up on the beach. Supplies. —Large stocks are not kept by the Lingeh mer' chants. In an emergency, a force of 1,000 men could be pro' vided for for a period of 2 weeks. Landing Facilities. —There are two small boat harbours, both some 80 yards square, formed of stone breakwaters. One is situated some J mile west of the Fort, the second about 200 yards further on. The inside of these harbours has lately Belted up, and vessels drawing 6 feet of water could not well get61 iftside. Tho outer walls of the harbours could be used as a wharf. Depth of water here at high tide is about 9 feet. The western most of these two harbours would be the best to use for the reason that the shore is better, and from the landing place a road leads straight out through the town to the camping grounds outside, and is of sufficient width to allow mule carts to pass without trouble. From the eastern harbour the streets through the bazaar to the outside of the town are extremely narrow and tortuous and are practically impassable to wheeled traffic. Landing appliances. —No steam engines, winches, trollies, carts, hawsers, cables, etc., are available. Wharf and lightermen. —In the cool season about 200 coolies, who are mostly Minabis, are employed, but in the hot season labour is very scarce as the majority go off to Minab. Convoy grounds. —A large open space, J mile from the store godowns is suitable, with large birkehs (tanks) from which, in normal years, ample water is available ; there is no grazing in the vicinity. After good rain camels bring in grass from places 3 to 9 miles distant. Excellent camping grounds exist outside and to the north of the town, where the ground is flat and of stony sand which however in many places becomes rather a quagmire in wet weather. Two spots are particularly suitable for a camp on account of the proximity to a number of birkehs. The first starts I mile north-east of the wireless station and stretches 1 ,100 yards to the north and 2-3 mile to the east. Within £ mile of this point are some 20 birkehs. A wide road leads straight from the landing place opposite the Fort, half a mile distant. The second camping ground is |- mile due west of the western extremity of the town and 2—300 yards east of the Quarantine station. The level ground commences within 300 yards of the shore and is some 800 yards square. Within I mile there are 12 birkehs. This camping ground would be the most suitable for use if troops were landed in the westernmost of the two boat harbours described above. Sanitation. —There is no scavenger class and no sanitation whatever. Mosquito curtains are a necessity at all seasons. The climate is reputed the best of any port in the Gulf, The summers are slightly hotter than Bushire, but the winters are milder. Rain usually falls from November to February and averages-about 4 J inches annually.62 Store Depots.- —At least 25 store houses, situated in the vici nity of the landing stages and of average dimensions, 22 by 20 by 14 feet, would always be Obtainable, and sufficient room to store some 200,000 bags of grain in all could be found; Some 30—40 shops near the water front are nearly always empty and could be used for storage purposes; average dimensions 25 by 8 by 12 feet. These store houses and shops are well made of stone and have watrer-proof roofs. Communirations. —In 1917 a small wireless station of th e Indo-European Telegraph Department was established at Lingeh. It is in charge of two operators, and is situated just outside the town half a mile due north of the Persian Fort on the sea-shore. The station is in direct communication with Henjam Radife^U oi Bo oy ^ihoibm odJ i-v, ootaoa vtj i si itfodid For further details, see Chapter VII. Water. —All sweet water is obtained from large hirlcehs the total number of which is 42 dependent on rainfall. The well water is indifferent. With the addition of pipes, a much larger area could be made available for water-supply. It should be noted that the water of the hirkehs is only fit to drink if boiled or sterilised. Neglect to do this is the direct cause of the great prevalence of guineaworm among the in habitants of the town. Except in the case of a very small force landed soon after a heavy rainfall, distilling plant would be advisable, Population.—Thxs at present amounts to 12,000 souls, chiefly Arabs and Persians with about 800 Negroes locally known as S';dTs, the deseendanfce of slaves. Only 1 per cent, of the fighting men are supposed to have arms, which are seldom produced except under the incitement of mullahs. They are a degenerate and cowardly race ; incapable of offer ing resistance to an enemy attacking their town. Three-q uarters of the inhabitants are directly or indirectlv in the pearl trade.(g) 63 kevici. ' '' ' - - .n ' CHAPTER ITT. 'OOBto Ethnography. empty ' eil3 ' on8 The origin of the Medo-Persians was probably the same as 11 made that of the natives of Tndia. At least as far back as 1000 B .C., the ancestors of the Persians and Indians were an Aryan race of tie originating in the country afterwards known as Bactria, from bd at which they migrated. One stream swept south-east into India, another south-west into Persia. Plato describes the Persians Fort on as originally a nation of shepherds and herdsmen, occupying i fljji a rude country such as naturally fosters a hardy race of people, capable of supporting both cold and hardships, and, when needful, of enduring the toils of war. Over these ancient settlers during a long course of centuries swept wave after wave of UMt conquering invaders,., each of which left its mark on the 1. Tlie original race. The result is the Persian of the present day. of i miiti whom those inhabiting the northern parts of the country natu- )ly. It rally show more of the characteristics of the invaders from ' fit to Central Asia, while to the south-west the Arab element predo- fct minates. The nomad mountain tribes are the only ones who the in- have had a chance of preserving their individuality, though simE the people of Ears pride themselves on the purity of their origin, irouid which is proved by their complexion and features. The Persian peasantry and nomad tribesmen are of good General Charac- souls. physique, but townsfolk and most people of good family are ttristics * locally the reverse. The Persians are not now-higli-spirited and warlike} ■■ent.of they are crushed by conquest and bad government, and their eh are brains and manhood are being sapped by excessive consumption is. of opium, and by vice. They are not frugal, but like to eat and dress well, however poor they rnay be. Their best quality is their cheerfulness. Erectly Only a cursory study of Persian history is required to realise the lamentable lack, or at any rate the feebleness, of the popular spirit, and also the fact that Persia is not merely a house divided against itself, but a- rickety structure, kept together by external pressure, which every kind of domestic discussion tends to rend to pieces. Wild semi-nomad tribes in even/ part of the kingdom, are ready at any moment to disown allegiance to the Central Government and can be restrained by nothing64 ■FSre. but force and fear. The mullds of the Shi'ah religion are re actionary and dread anything that may weaken their preroga tives or dispel the superstition of the masses; they, therefore, deprecate the spread of civil rights and liberties to their bond slaves. The governing and upper classes are all reactionaries and royalists, being steeped in corruption, and having battened for centuries on such ill-gotten gains as an iniquitous system of government allowed them to squeeze out of tbe masses. The Persians are an emotional people, quick to seize upon a new idea or doctrine and their subtle active brains render them peculi arly susceptible to the influence of any kind of sentimental or abstract teaching; hence a Persian crowd is easily manipulated by a demagogue. So it follows that a few enthusiasts of the younger generation, who have imbibed western ideas of freedom and constitutional rights, experience little difficulty in excit ing an enthusiasm of popular feeling, at least momentary and spasmodic. Thus, during the nationalist movement, at one time a fanatical populace was clamouring for a constitution and abolition of hoary wrongs, and at another was acquiescing, almost without a murmur, in the cannonading of its national assembly, or the arrival of foreign troops to restore order. Cha racteristics such as these are insufficient to bring about a success ful revolution, but afford a magnificent field for the machina tions of agitators and adventurers. The success of the cons titutional movement was largely due to the adroit use of such inflammable material by a few bold leaders (mostly aliens), who supplied the necessary courage, resolution and practical ability, which the Persian patriots lacked. As to any hopes that in the future Persia may grow strong and independent enough to conduct her own administration, with her own trained and proven leaders, two obstacles stand in the way. The first is the lamentable vanity so marked in the Persian character which precludes them seeking or ensuing a good example. Up to a point they may appreciate, or even imitate, what other nafions have achieved. The other obstacle is the reactionary Shi'ah religion, with its vested interests, its fanaticism, and its hatred of progress and modern enlightenment. {a) Fdrs. Fdrs. —No census of Pars has ever been taken and there are no figures of any kind from which it is possible to deduce a reliable estimate of the population : the figures given herein32 65 are based in some cases upon detailed taWes of the number of houses in each village, and in others are estimates based on the relative area and populousness of each district. In making such estimates five souls have been reckoned per house, a figure which has been found in practice to be fairly reliable 'w hen applied to villages. Nomad tribes have likewise been reckoned at five per tent. The total of the nomadic and semi-nomsdic tribes works out as follows :— Qashqai Khamseh Boir Ahmadi .. Mamassani Dushmanziari Lashani Mishmast Sundry minor tribes Families. .. 33,015 .. 17,330 6,100 2,700 2,(»0 1,500 300 .. 12,030 Total 75,005 families or say, 3,75,025 souls. The above figures and all estimates of tribal strengths a v e dated before the influenza epidemic of October-November, 1918, when the tribal losses were very heavy. It would be no ex aggeration to say that the nomad tribes of Ears lost 20 per cent, of their total numbers during the epidemic. The sedentary population numbers about 500,000. The most densely populated districts are:— (1) The coastal strip from Dllam to the mouth of the Mand river, commercially and to a large extent adminis tratively dependent on BOahire, with a population of over 100,000. ' ; (2) The country north, north-east, east and south-east of Shiraz within a radiua of 60 miles of that city, with MC37GSB »66 I . Arabs. Lurs. an estimated population, including that of the capital, of 140,000 made up as follows :— Setting 'aside such an abnormal occurrence as the influenza epidemic, there is no indication that the population is increas ing ; on the contrary, everything tends to show that it is either stationary or decreasing. The inhabitants of the provinces of Fars and Laristan are of several quite distinct types. Along the coast and for some distance inland, from Kangan eastwards, are colonies of Arabs from the opposite coast, some of them comparatively recent arrivals, gome of long standing. The population of the ShTbkuh prtrts is predominantly Arab. These Arabs are mostly Stmnls with a few Shi'ahs. They are bilingual and are gradually being absorbed by the stronger Persian element around them'; they keep to their Arab dress, and, amongst themselves, to their own speech, and it is plain from their features and other physical characteristics that they are of a different racial type from their Persian neighbours. In the Haiait Daud district and further east will also be found colonies of Arabs, mostly SunnTs, with a few Shi'ahs from Hin- dijan. The population of the coast is however for the most part Persian, biit of a type quite distinct from that met with in Central iP '.'ir {Mni'O' •! r. i - ^ ^ -■ 10.- ..

Those from the ports are much in demand as coolies in ports even as far a field aa Karachi and Basra. They are skilled sailors and fishermen, professions which imploy a substantial proportion of their number; and, when trained and subjected to discipline, they would be in many respects superior to lascars for work on board- ship. The crews of the Customs launches and of the Persian gunboat ' Persepolis ' are drawn from this source, and seem a useful and handy lot of men. The Qashqai nomads are of Turkish origin and monopolize Qashqal 4 with the Khamseh the lion's share of political influence in Ears. They are sufficiently powerful to disregard the Persian Govern ment, if it suits them to do so, but have been prevented hitherto by dissensions among their chiefs from showing a united front; nor is there any sign that this state of things is likely to alter in the future. Physically they are perhaps the finest of the tribes of south-west Persia, except the Mamassani, who are said to be physically fine men. Of the Khamseh, of five tribes only two, the Shaibani and Khamsetu Jabbareh, are of undoubted Arab origin and form the so-called Arab tribe. They aggregate 15,000 tents and are immigrants of the 7th Century A. D. from Arabia; they still retain their ancient tongue. The originof the remaining tribes is doubtful; all alike are marauders. Lastly comes the sedentary population ; north of Shiraz peisiana. this is predominantly of old Persian stock ; lacking enterprise, personal courage and the power of co-operation, these wretched villagers have ever been the prey of the nomads, who so despoil them of their livestock and crops as to make it almost impossible for them to keep body and soul together; these remarks also apply, though in less degree, to the population of the Fasa, Sarvistan, Kavar and Ivhafr districts. South of Jahrum and Shiraz the villagers are more virile, with a strong admixture of Lur or nomad blood, and in Laristan the villagers are not less savage and predatory than the nomads. The populations of the towns of Bushire and Shiraz are again well-defined types, and recognized as such all over Persia, That of Bushire is much mixed ; Arabs, Persians, Lurs, and tribes, of mixed blood, such as BehbehanTs, have settled in the town and intermarried, forming a peculiar type; they wear peculiar i'2i dress,- into which the kulah does not enter. The populatioli numbers about 15,000. Their well-bred manners conceal an unreliable and ungrateful disposition, and they are inclined to be uncivil to foreigners though less so now than formerly. The townspeople of Siuraz are said to be of a less mixed Iranian type than is encountered elsewhere, but ib is diAicult to fix upon any feature as predominating or distinctive ot them The town population includes a certain nrmbor of Armenians. Shlrazis are notably given to pliilosuphical speculation, and the BabI movement has found widespread support in the town. Coastal region. The tribes which inhabit the coastal region and are known by the names of the various districts they inhabit have been separate entities for centuries ; they are clans in the sense of the Scottish clans before the 18th century, some districts having feuds with others lasting generations, others having traditional friendships with certain of their neighbours, retaliating as a tribe any raid or injury done by an aggressor. In the better organised districts the hereditary chiefs or Khans direct the inter-tribal and external policy of the tribe so that much depends on the sentiments and capacity of the Khans, As regards the local interests of the chiefs and occupations of the tribesmen and peasants, the districts fall into three natural categories :— (a^ The northern districts, Liravi, Haiat Daud, Rud Hilleh and Shabankareh are primarily occupied in agricul ture and possess large hocks towards their mountain frontiers, where grazing is carried on during the spring and summer. The) also have three busy little ports in Bandar Dilam, Bandar Rig and Gana- veh, the first named serving for the supply of the inland market at Behbehan and the Kuhgalu tribes, the other two for that of the nomad tribes across the mountains. The Khan's incomes are derived from the taxation of cultivation and certain port dues, etc. The Khan of Shabankareh has the advantage of administering the river-irrigated district of Z;ra. which produces valuable quantities of dates, cotton, etc. « (6) There is also considerable, though less, cultivation of grain in Borazjun, Chahkutah and Angali. Far the most important interest of the Khans of these0) 69 districts and of DalikT now lies in the high road for trade into the interior of Persia which passes through their villages. They levy a rich income from tolls on caravans using this highway. The Khan of Angali in addition has a strong interest in the tolls he collects at Shif from goods transhipped from Bushire for Shiraz. In this respect his interest runs counter to that of the Khan of Chahkutah, for the more caravan traffic that goes by the land route, the less toll money comes to the Khan of Angali. (f) The third category in the coast region is represented by Tangistan and DashtT, the latter a most ex tensive district stretching for many miles across the mountain chain. Tangistan has always had a heterogeneous tribal population, turbulent and warring among themselves, village against village. It is not very fertile, the date groves are not very productive, and, though the villages round Gurak grow much vegetable produce, the chief income of the Chiefs lies in the fruit gardens of Khavlz in the hills and in the Ahram date gardens. Donkey traffic for Flruzabad and Shiraz is blackmailed to some extent by the Khan, but his chief source of wealth has been the arms traffic. Dashti on the other hand is a vast grain-growing district with a river flowing through it. It also possesses extensive date cultiva tion. Here the Khans have no caravan traffic to batten on. From being well governed and tranquil, the district has in the last forty years fallen into a state of chaos and has become divided under many petty village headmen, most of whom are at feud with one another. In ail ca^es the Khans resent any interference likely to im pair their sole control in their districts or over their tribesmen. The methods adopted however differ. The Khans of Haiat Dafid, Rud Hilleh and Llravi are members of one family and work in close co operation and consultation under the leader ship of Haider Khan of Ha at Daud, who resides at Bandar Rig, with the Khans of Angali also allied by marriage and largely under their influence. Haider Khan and his relatives make a point of paying regularly the revenue due by their districts to the Persian Government, and of Leaping very good order70 and security, besides giving some support to the local Customs authorities, preventing smuggling and maintaining correct relations with the Governors. By fulfilling these obligations they consider they give no legitimate pretext for further inter ference by the Governors and are entitled to manage their own internal and external affairs. The Khan of Shabankareh and Zira has also paid the revenue due fairly regularly, but he is less astute than the above named and his districts are often in some disorder as a result of bad management. The Khans of Borazjun, Tangistan and DashtT have not been in the habit for some years of paying their very considerable taxes, and, relying on the powerlessness of the Government authorities, have often flatly declined to do so. Chahkutah has behaved in a similar manner. Tangistan and Dashtl are always in the bad books of the Persian Government. As regards the relations of the Chiefs to one another Liravi, Haiat Daud, Hud Hilleh, Angali and Shabankareh have been on peaceful terms with one another for a number of years. The Khans of Shabankareh and Zira have for many years been at feud with the Khan of Borazjun, while the Khans of Daliki, being allies of Borazjim, support the latter in this feud. Angali has a standing feud with Chahkutah, which in turn is hostile to Tangistan. Tangistan is divided against itself and has a long standing enmity with Haiat Daud, while the Dashtis for the most part are on bad terms with the Tangistani village headmen. All the Khans of the littoral, even his allies of necessity, dislike and distrust Borazjun. Haiat Daud, Rud Hilleh, Liravi, Angali, Shabankareh and Zira have been consistently friendly to British interests, while Borazjun, Tangistan, Chahkutah and Daliki may be expected to show hostility. Of the DashtTs some headmen during the Great War threw in their lot with the Tangistan s, while others ( adopted a friendly attitude towards the British. The Nomad Tribes of Pars. .'Nomad Trlfcea. ^ The principal nomad tribes of Fars are the Qashqai and Khamseh tribes, the former Turks, the latter partly Arabs of mixed origin. Of secondary importance are the Mamassani, Lashanf, Mishmast, Boir Ahmad! and Dushmanziari. who take no part in provincial politics, but, like the others, indulge freely in highway robbery. All these tribes, whose total num-71 comd bers together with a number of smaller and less important ones, are estimated at something under 77,000 tents, are described in detail below. Always lawless, and seldom completely under the control of the Central Government, the nomads of Fars were nevertheless seldom a source of serious anxiety to the Governor-General of Fars, until the last decade of the 19th Century : for they were 111- armed, and in consequence unable to withstand Government troops under proper leadership : they even furnished military forces to Government; above all, their forces were uneducated and disunited. Khamseh. —The Khamseh (--lrafe;c-five) tribes are (1) The Arabs. jdni w Khn mseh. (2) The 'Ainalu. (3) The Baharlu. (4) The Baserl. (5) The Nafar. »-)'■ tJK d nun The Nafar tribe originally numbered some 1,000 families' but these are now to a large extent dispersed and settled in Bakhtiarl country. Part of the tribe remains however, and is still considered as a unit of the Khamseh tribes. Of the above tribes, the Arabs and Baserl alone are migratory. The 'Ainalu, Baharlu and Nafar are of Turkish origin, as also are the Baser!, with the exception of one tireh or sub-tribe the Turbur Cheharbuncheh, whose language is Persian. The Arabs are, as their name implies, of Arabic origin and came originally from Najd and Oman. The headship of the Khamseh is now hereditary in the Qawami family. The following is an approximate correct statement of the strength of the Khamseh tribes in April, 1918. Families. Arabs .. •• •• •• 10,1HU Ainalu .. •• •• 1,200 Baharlu .. •• •• 1,200 Baseri .. • • • • 4.500 Nafar .. • • • • '&gt; • .Total 17,33072 With perhaps the exception of the Ainalu and Baseri, the main characteristic of the Khatoseh tribesmen is a propensity for robbery. Several small sub-sections of tribes make their living by agriculture or caravan ■work. V\ ith these exceptions every Arab is at heart a robber and loses no opportunity of indulging this propensity. So marked is their tendency in this direction that their own chiefs are in many cases unable to restrain them. No tribe in Persia bears the same unsavoury reputation for petty robbery as the Khamseh Arabs. Aral) ,. (a) The Arabs.—The Arabs came originally from Najd. Oman, and Yemen in the seventh century, and with a few ex ceptions retain their nomad habits. Those 'who came to Pars and are now known as the Khamseh Arabs are of nomadie habit, their summer quarters being near Bavanat, Qunquri, Sarchahan. etc., and their winter quarters in the Bulak-eh- Sabeh, i.e. Fasa, Darab, Furg, Jahrum, Jiyum, and as far south-east as Tang-i-Dalan. They are divided into the two : -main branches, (o) the Jazbareh, and (6) the Shaibani, the former having originally 28 sub-tribes, and the latter 23. The Jabbareh Arabs are also known as the Arab Kuchi. The former number approximately 6,630 families and the latter 4,500. They originally spoke pure Arabic, but this is now much corrupted, and is a mixture of A rabic, Persian, Turkish and Luri. The one exception is theTurbur Cheharbuncheh, (Buzsuxkhi, Jelodari and Lur) who speak Persian. An approximate list of the Arab tribes showing their summer and winter habitat, and their routes of migration -will be found in Appendix A. AinsHu m The 1 Ainalu. —The 'Ainalu came originally from Turkis- tan and settled in Fare in the thirteenth century. -Their strength is variously estimated at from 800 to 2,000 families. One thousand two hundred is an approximately correct estimate in all probability. They were at one time migratory with their yaildq, or summer quarters round Ramgird and Marvdasht They have now however become sedentary and Kve south west of a line from Sarvistan, Fasa and Mahdevan, the majority being south-east of Fasa. They speak TurkT. A small section ^the Dindarlu) live 3 in the Dudeh valley about 30 miles east of Shlraz. They have settled down to a peaceful agricultural life. The Dudeh valley is the j rincipal market garden d Shlraz.&amp; 73 The present Kalantar of the 'Ainalu is Najaf Quli Khan. The tribal sub-sections are as follows :— Sub-Tribe. Bayat Afshar-Ushagi Chayan Jargheh Ghalbash Amir Hajilu Bulaghi Dindarlu Sakkiz Raisbeglu . Qurt Zanganeh Ekhlaslui Nagd Ali Ushaghi ] ranahahl Habilat. Kaiabulagh- Abnarak, Fasa. Fasa. Rudbal, PIr M'lrad. Karabulagh, Fasa. Daraku. Attached to the per son of the Kalan tar. (c) The Baharlv, —The Baharlu are of Turkish origin and Baharlu. 'came to Persia and settled in Fars in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They were originally migratory and had their summer quarters in the districts of BSmj rd and Marvdasht and their winter quarters near SarvistSn and DSrab. They have now for many years been sedentary and live on the banks of the Darab river. They are said to number about 1 ,200 families. The tribe is rich in horses and appears to have a rooted objec tion to undertaking any journey or military operations on foot. Until recently they were noted robbers, but in 1917 the Qawam inflicted severe punishment on them and this has had a saiutory effect on them. They speak Turk!. (d) The Baserl. —The BSserl believe themselves to be descen' BaserL dants of the Basra Arabs. Thej speak a corrupt form of Arabic. The tribe probably consists of ^,500 families, though estimates vary considerably. They are not ordinarily addicted to robbery. They own large numbers of transport animals which they ply for hire. This is theiir chief source of livelihood and it is in all probability on account of this that they do not migrate far. With the exception of the VaisT section their summer and winter •quarters are all within a radius of about 50 miles of Shiraz city -and close to the main caravan routes.74 Thev are divided into main sections, (a) the Vaisi, and (h) the Allah MirzaT, the sub-divisions and habitat of which are given in Appendix B. Nafar (g) The Nafar. —The Nafar are of Turkish origin. The tribe is now insignificant and consists of not more than 2,300 tents. It lives in the Gerash district and is sedentary. Moqata'jafc. The Moqdtajdt. —(Arabic moqdtaa, a contract) are a collec tion of Arab tribes, who, having no Kalantars of their own, were originally contracted to one Haji Jaffar Beg by the Qawam-ul- Mulk, who headed the Khamseh between 1820 and 1855. They originally numbered some 10—15 tribes, large and small, living in various parts of the Khamseh country. They have rapidly declined, and there are now only a few families left. There are a few in the huluk of Sarvistan who are known as Zoghah, their means of livelihood being principally the burning and transport of zocjhdl or charcoal. There is another small isolated group of families in and around Qasr Dasht and another H\ ing in Sai (ShirSz). These are engaged in cultivation. In some of the larger Khamseh tribes a few families may st'll be found, and the QaraT, Ardbiz, Tattl and Tarbor are also said to have belonged to the Moqata'jat. (Qgehqai. Qdshqdl. —There is a tradition that, when the Turkom an tribes during the Mongol invasions reached the province of Persian 'Iraq, a band of them fled and settled in Ears, and that the Turkomans called this band Qdshqdl, i e., ' those who ran away' {from [qdchmak — to flee). Changes in pronunciation after wards converted this appellation into Qdshqai. 1 he langu age of the QSshqai has remained Turk! to this day and the inhabitants of Fars usually speak of them as ' Turk.' , In course of time the original band became divided into two parts because a large section retained the nomadic habit oi migration in spring and autumn. The one part kept the Tur koman appellation of Khalach, the other was called QashqaJ, each having several branches, ail known now-a-days as Qashqal. Of all the ttrehs, or clans «of to-day the Shishbuluki and Farsimadan are of the very few stated to be Khalach in origin. The Qashqai move further in their annual migrations than any other tribe in Persia. Their qishldq extends as far south as Biz, Jam and Galehdar, and their yaildq as far north as the country west of Qumisheh. Their western boundary reachea to within a few miles of Behbehan and their pastern limit to tl'.e'75 'Q:r-0'Karz~n plain. They will not be found in the Kara Aghach valley from Kavar to Tadun. It would appear that the Qashqal 11 does not number more than 30,000 families. They themselves reckon an average of 5 souls per family, giving a total of 175,000 persons for the whole tribe. The above figures include the Ilyats alone., To this must be added the numbers of villages which come under the jurisdiction of the Ilkhfi.nT. These probably number some 20—25,000 families The llkhani therefore exercises control •over 30,000 families of Ilyats and 20—25,000 villagers in the Sarhad and Garmslr, making a total of 50—55,000 families. A very large portion of Ears is in the hands of, or connected with, the QashqSis, and the settled population of those districts and the men left in charge of land under cultivation by the tribe form a large addition to the numbers of the actual tribesmen. In many cases the settled villagers detest the tribesmen. The Qashqais are nomadic, not only by traditional custom, but also because their tribal wealth and food supply depends so largely on their flocks and herds that the necessity of leaving the hot regions before the grazing in the valleys'has been dried up by the hot spring sun of Southern Fars, and of seeking fresh pastures on the high plateaus of Northern Fars, is imperative, while the climate of the Sarhad is too bitter during the winter months, and far more firewood can be obtained in the hills of the Garmslr. Their sheep and goats not only provide milk, meat and clarified fat, which are staple items of their food, but the wool and hair is used by the tribes for weaving their own tents and covering, and carpets for sale in the towns, from which source each tent derives a portion of its yearly income. The poorest tribesmen are said to own 300 animals. Sheep too find a large sale among the settled inhabitants of the south during the winter season. Those sections of the tribes, which possess a large number of horses and animals, sow each winter in the valleys of the Garrtmr which they are in the habit of visiting each autumn, and the harvested grain is ready for their consumption on their return in the autumn. Thus the wide valley of Farashband is almost entirely cultivated by the Shishbuluki and some 200— 300 tons of grain are probably raised there every spring. Of late years also the chiefs of the Qashqai, and, in imitation of them, some of the Khans of the fir eh s have acquired, seized Or bought large properties in the Qashqai districts or huTuk the south.76 This factor in the life of the tribe has great influence on their regular migrations backwards and forwards ; some of these properties, for instance, raise large quantities of rice, a staple article of food. They are now one of the richest of the nomad tribes of Persia and the best armed, their proximity to the sea coast in winter having enabled them to make large purchases of rifles and ammunition on favourable terms. They have seldom come into direct conflict with the Persian Government, as their proximity to Shiraz and Isfahan, their large flocks, extensive landed property, and lengthy migrations have always made them peculiarly vulnerable. The Qashqai—in their winter quarters at any rate—do not camp in the open valleys ; one does not see a hundred or more tents pitched in one place, and indeed one might travel many miles through the heart of the QashqSI country without noticing an encampment. Their custom is to select secluded valleys and ravines on the hill side, which are to an extent protected from the winter weather and also near water, and in such spots four, ten, or twenty tents may be seen together. The enormous extent of coimtry occupied by the Qashqais and their distribu tion in sparse units,widely scattered over extremely mountainous country, not only prevent the tribes from accumulating in any one place in more than a small fraction of their real strength, but also would seem to make any operations against the tribe or certain sections of it a difficult matter. Moreover, in many cases the tribe in its winter quarters is divided and settled in distinct portions, far apart from one another. They resemble generally the Lur nomads of south-west Persia, but their language is a dialect of Turki, though most tribesmen understand Persian fairly well. In appearance they compare favourably with their Lur compatriots ; they seem on the whole to be taller and fairer than Bakhtiarls, and certainly more so than Lurs. In religion they seem more orthodox and less supersti tious than their Lur neighbours. The migrations of the Qashqai differ little from those of other nomad tribes. Their principal transport animals are camels and donkeys ; mules, are scarce and only used by the Khans, and cattle are not extensively employed; they are probably the only tribe in South Persia, except the Arab, who use camels for the purpose. *77 The migration takes place twice a year, once up-country and once down, and varies to the extent of very few days. About the vernal equinox, or Nauroz, they commence to strike their black tents and move slowly north ; they leave their northern pastures rather before the middle of September, and come back to their old camping grounds in the south. Their summer quarters, known as Sarhad, are near the northern boundary of Fars, west of Qumisheh and Yazd-i-Khast, and reach to the eastern slope of the Kuh-i-Danna (the Kuhgalu tribes being on the south-west of this range) ; their winter quarters are in the Garmsir or hot regions of Fars, ranging from the vicinity of Behbeban to near 1 ar, but never south of the range of mountains bordering the coast-line, that is to say, generally, more than 40 miles inland as the crow flies. _ The principal route is that adopted by the Barashfiri, Kashkuh and others, who, coming from Behbehan and the Mahur-i-MailaCun district respectively, strike the Bushire- Shiraz post road in the neighbourhood of Kazarun and follow the general trend of this route as far as Dasht-i-Arjan and Khan- i-Zmian, whence they either proceed via Chehar-i-Eahdar, and cross tue Shiraz plain to Jiyum and Baiza, or more direct to Ardakan. £rom the latter point they disperse by various routes to their summer quarters. A few tribes previously used the Tang-i- Allah-o-Akbar, north of Shlraz* but this is not usual now the whole .t keeping well to the west of Shiraz. Tribes coming from Galehdar, ' A lam arvdaeh t, Afzar, etc., generally pass through Lnehar-i-Rahdar on their Way up-country. It is rarely that the tlrehs change the course of their migra tion and, any deviation from the customary lines being difficult for the larger tribes, to block their upward path is not only the easiest, but the most effective way of putting pressure upon any particular tribe, or on the tribe as a whole. The only divisions which are of any practical importance and wmci! may become, on occasion, political entities are the Dara- shuil, Kashkuli, Shishbuluki, and Farslmadan. The supp ort of IllSLf ibeS ' or at lea8 t their neutrality, is necessary to any The migration of the Ilkhani and his Amalch, or household troops, is shown in Appendix D. Generally speaking the downward migration of the whole IJ converges on Baiza and Juyum to the north of Shiraz, and thenQashqai Tribal Sections. DarashufI, divides, the Darashurl, Kashkuli and Farsiiftadan going off to wards Shahpiir or Dasht-i-Arjan, while the Shishbuluki and many smaller tribes, the llkhanl and his adherents strike south via Jirreh, Farashband, Khwajai and Firuzabad. The route of migration may slightly change from year to year if the supply question necessitates it. The general route however rarely changes. As far as possible the tribes avoid the main roads and villages, and camp in such places as pro vide good grazing for their numerous flocks. The date of commencement of the northward migration dep ends upon the crops which have been sown in the Garms'.r and which must be harvested before the whole of the tribe can leave for the Sarhad. Thus, though the first tents are struck shortly after Nauroz, it may be anything from 10 to 40 days after this date when the last tribesman moves. Details of the migration of each tribe are given in the details of the various sub-tribes. Tribal Sections. —It is a well-known tradition that the Qash qai were from the beginning 44 clans, or tlrehs. Some of these have disappeared and others have dwindled to a few tents. Some bodies of the Qashqai have gone over to Bakhtiari country, or in a less degree to the Khamseh tribes in times of stress,, while some of the smaller branches have become merged in the larger. On the other hand many branches are to day composed of elements in which little of the original Qashqai stock can be traced. A list of the tribal sections is given in Appendix D. (a) The Bar ash urls, came originally from Turkistan and settled in the bul r ik of Garmabad in the ' Darashur ' valley. In point of view of strength and tribal wealth the Darashurls are the first of the Qashqai tribes. They number 3,500—4,000 families. The present chief is Aiyaz Kihka. Their Garmsir is east and south-east of Behbehan and their Sarhad in Vardasht and Garmabad (near Simarum). Their migration is via Sar Abnaniz, Marg, Shahpur, the Kazarun district, thence via the Shahi road to Khanl-Zinian, to Kudian, Haftbarm, Tang-i-Kullar, Baiza, Kam Firuz, Dizkurd, Khusru Shirin, Hanna, Garmabad and Vardasht. They should arrive in the Sarhad about May 16th, but the last of the tribe does not leave the Oarmslr until the shatvl crops have been harvested, i.e., about 30 days after the Nauroz (March 21st). These crops are sown on arrival in the Garms'ir at the beginning of the winter.82 Eahlml. Igder.

Their Garmslr is-in-the Dashti valleys, west of Farashband, and their Sarhad on the banks of the Rud Khaneh RahimT, south-west of Qumi- sheh. This is the furthest north of the QashqaT sarhads. They migrate by the usual Qashqai route from Firuzabad to Khuru Shlrln and north to Rud Khaneh Rahlmi. (j) Tlie Igder, 'originally migrated from Turkistan to Fars.

It is not known who he was. but some 9,f the tribesmen say he came originally from Arabia, while others maintain that he came from Dashtistan. The whole of their country now belongs to Muin-ut-Tujjar. The MamassanTs are said to be of mixed origin, having come from Behbehan, Pusht-i-Kuh, Arabistan and as far north as the BoTr Ahmadi country. The tribe has three main divisions, called (1) Bakesh, (2) JavidI (or Jowl), and (3) Rustam after the three original chiefs. As these sections became stronger they were again sub-divide(d. The Mamassanl country is bounded on the north by the district of B'slit, on the south by the Dushmanzian country, on the east by Ardakan, and on the west by Marg and Gurspick They speak a dialect of Lur -Persian which differs but little from ordinary colloquial Persian. The Kalantars and Kadkhu- das all speak correct Persian in addition. Like the Qashqai the Mamassani is dark skinned. Above the average height and of excellent physique, he is a lover of sports and all outdoor pursuits. Formerly a notorious robber 4 ''({B sritsmaa arfi ai noiiai^im eti to sfavx , a s )rgoMv 4 5 8ii rfa lie has of recent years adcypted a morfe peaceful agrictfltural life. Ihe MamassanI country is on the whole prosperous and weH- governed. The Mamassani is sedentary within his own boundariei. The Rustam and Javidi sections move a short distance to villagea which have the advantage of a slightly better climate during the summer. There is however no organised tribal migration. The religion is orthodox Shi'ah, and the tribe has a reputation for bfjing meticulous in its religious observances. The tribe numbers about 13,500 persons, of which the Rustam contributes 6,000 souls, the Bakesh 4,000, and the Javidi 3,500. The sub-sections of the tribe are given in Appendix E. Ldshdnl. —The Lashams were until 1874 a sub-tribe of the Qashqal II. They are divided into two sections both sedentary, the one living iji Khafrak and the other in Abadeh-i-Tashk. They number about 1,500 families. The LashanTa have for many 3 T ears beeh renowned as the most daring robber tribe in Fars, their expeditions taking them as far as Khorasan. The tribe formerly lived almost solely on the proceeds of robbery, which had become so fixed a habit with the young men of the tribe that the chiefs had very little hold over them. In the autumn of 1917 however a column of Indian troops severely punished them, and destroyed all their forts. Since this time robbery has practically ceased, and the tribe is now settling down to an agricultural life. During the summer mouths the tribesmen live in tente, which are however pitched near the houses occupied by them in the winter. ' The sub-tribes are as follows ;—• Khafrakis :—Total families 500. Banusar. Bazwand. Khalilwand. Tutaki. Shahwand. Abadeh-i-TashkTs :—Total families 1,000. Iriwand. Najmuddimvand. Eliaawand. Abdullahwand. Khezerwand. Yazdanwand. Muradwand. Bahmanwand.

Tke following three tirehs are also now attached to the Bah- mSnwand, though they pay revenue direct to Government: (1) Molhak, (2) Tolamaki, and (3) Kushkaki. Mishmast. —The Mishmasts are an indigenous tribe, but Kve almost entirely in tents on the Arsinjan plain round Arsinjan itself. Certain sections of the tribe occasionally take up their quarters on the Saadatabad and Saidun plains, more especially in winter. Two villages within 6 miles of Arsinjan, Fijan and Paniran, are reported to be their headquarters. They, like the Lashani, are great robbers by nature, and formerly used to join the Lashanis in their expeditions. They are also on good terms with the Cheharrahi, Tutaki (robber tribes in the Bavanat district), and Feraghehl (an offshoot of the BakhtiSri), living in the Abrkuh district. They have however not been to the fore in raiding expeditions since the Lashanis were punished. Bolr Ahmicll. —Tye Boir Ahmadl tribe is the most important of the Chehar Buncheh group of the Kuhgalfi tribes, which also includes the Churam, NuyT and Bavl, all of which are considered to belong to the Pusht-i-Kiih division of the KuhgaKi, though settlements of the Bolr Ahmadl are to be found round Behbehan. With the exception of the Malla Qobad section, which is sedentary round Sisakht, the Sarhad and Garrnsir of this tribe are :— ^^.-Tal-i-KMsru, Sar Rud, Sisakht, Chinar Dasht-i Bum, Safid Dar, Kuh-i-Dil and Vazak. Garmslr. —In the district east of Behbehan and north-west of Mamassan! country, in Sunkarabai, Kalat, Deh Dasht and Suk-i-Changalvar. In 1917 their strength was stated to be as follows :— Families. Under control of Shukrnllah Khan .. .. 2,000 Under control of Karon Khan .. .. 2,300 Under control of Qairl Muhammad AH .. 800 Under control of Mulla Qobai .. .. 400 Total 6,100 The Boir Ahmadi are a wild lawless tribe, previously much addicted to robbery. During 1918 and since they have been89 'i They have places of worship known as fire temples. Their dead are disposed of by being exposed in * towers of silence' till all the flesh is devoured by carniverous birds. In this area they are found at Yazd, which is their chief centre in Persia. There are a few in ShTraz and Bushire. They are not now persecuted, though formerly they were much so. They are generally despised by the orthodox Persians. This religion prevailed in Persia until the Arab invasion. Bdbis. —Followers of Mirza Ali Mahomed and dating from 1844. They pretend to play no political part, but in reality Babism has become more of a political movement than a reli gion. The Babls are loathed by other Persians and in conse quence prove useful as agents. The tenets of Babism are no c J er gy» no prayers, only dogmatic belief in God and His mani festations, whether by Zoroaster, Moses, Jesus, etc., or bv Baba ' Ullah. Mahome- constant ibjection-90 . : f ' j' ■ ■ 's CHAPTER r T Climate and Health. ? rtl &gt;&lt;1 r The principal characteristic of the climate of Southern Persia, especially inland, are its intense dryness, a most valuable one for storage purposes, as it means that weevils and other insects requiring moisture are practically non-existent. The seasons follow the European plan of having the rains during the winter, and from about April to November one can usually count on having cloudless skies. The rainfall is not a heavy one, but the soil, especially in the Shiraz valley, is, as a rule, as tenacious of moisture as the air is the opposite, and marching is 'unpleasant after rain if it has been at all heavy. In* the in land valleys the summer heat varies with the altitude and may be taken to be that of the hill stations in, India of from 1,000 to 1,500 feet less altitude. This is probably due to fhe bare rocky hills which are always close at hand, to the lack of rain, and to the absence of trees. The end of August usually brings the end of the summer heat accompanied almost invariably by a marked drop of temperature. The rains begin in Novemler ani at the higher levels of from 4,000 feet and upwards some snow may be looked for from Christmas Day till the end of March. Rain seldom falls in the tropical Indian fashion, but rather in lighter European showers. The extent and nature of the country of Persia is such that it offers, like India, every variety of climate and every variation of heat and cold. The climate of Persia may be roughly divided into three periods :— (a) In the Garmsir and on the shores of the littoral the heat in summer and autumn is intense and the ports become hotbeds of malaria and are almost insupportable for Europeans. During these sea sons it is perferable to march by night, even as late as October. {h) In winter cold winds prevail; and in the spring when the heated air of the deserts in the south-east begins to rise, a strong north and westerly wind sweeps down the valleys from the mountains of Kurdistan.91 (c) In all the provinces spring and autumn are the best time for military operations. In spring there is more rain, but seldom sufficient to interfere seriously with movements, except when, owing to the pre sence of mountains, small rivers and streams, usually nearly, if not quite, dry, become flooded so as to be quite impassable. There is less rain in autumn, but Indians and Persians are liable to fevers, probably owing to the great difference in temperatures by day and night. (a) Fdrs. General. —Extremes of heat and cold will be found in sum. ^ iIrs - mer and winter respectively in the province. The main road to Isfahan traverses plains 7,000' above sea level, and deep with snow in winter for days together, the temperature falling to as low as 15° F. in . winter while in summer there is a maximum shade temperature of 90° F. In consequence, during December and January it is frequently almost impassable to caravans, especially as the plains, marshy at all times, are deep in mud, consequent upon heavy rains, which commence about the middle of November and may be expected at intervals till the beginning of May. Snow falls at 5,000 and above from 1st December onwards. On the passes between Shiraz and Kazarfm it may lie for as long as three weeks, but,, as a rule, not more than ten days ; at such times the road is practically impassable. On the other hand in the coastal areas it is intensely hot from May to September, while in the winter the cold is not excessive. The nights are cool, and there is a remarkable diffe rence between the day and night temperatures in the hottest months. Sh'rdz. —Rain may be expected between November 21st Shiraz. and April 15th, with occasional showers from the latter date to May 31st. Rain rarely falls more than three days in succes sion. Snow may be expected at any time between December 15th and April 1st, but rarely after that date. It seldom lies for more than a day on the plain. The nights are often intensely cold between January 1st and the middle or end of March. A minimum temperature of 17 0 F had been recorded in January.92 Heat, at and above 5,000', begins about the end of June and lasts till the end of August, when there is always a marked fall in temperature. Even during the hottest weather the nights are generally cool. It is well to sleep in the open air if possible from May to October ; dew falls from the middle of September onwards in the plain above H,000, and, later, below this altitude. The best season for moving troops is from 1st April to end of May and from middle of September to middle of November, but it is possible to move troops over the main routes all the j'ear round. • There is in Shiraz an utter absence of sanitation or any organized system of drainage, each house having its own badly constructed cesspool, cleared out at the will of the individual, thus rendering the whole sub-soil saturated with refuse matter. The water itself is f ood, but, owing to a bad system of transport ation into the town by means of qandis, which are in some sec tions open, it is easily infected and during an epidemic prac tically out of control within the city walls. Considering the in sanitary condition of the town with its badly-planned and crowd ed houses, dirty, narrow streets, uncontrolled water-supply and absence of any system of drainage, Sluraz is singularly free from epidemics of specific diseases : the periodic (usually annual) epidemics of diphtheria, small-pox, enteric, chicken-pox and measles do not cause a large mortality. These usually occur either in spring or autumn, with dysentery somewhat severe during the height of the summer. Epidemics of cholera occur at intervals of a decade or more. The last epidemic, of 1904, was, in comparison with that of former years, very severe, the mortality being probably not less than 5,000. The specific infectious diseases—typhus : rubella : intermittent, scarlet, dengue and yellow fever : beri beri : plague: hydrophobia , and actinous cases—are practically unknown. Cases of anthrax, tetanus and leprosy are occasionally, though rarely, seen! The only striking points about health conditions of Shiraz are the marked number of cases of diseases of the cornea and conjunc tive, dyspepsia, ascites and venereal diseases, especially the latter. In Shiraz itself the direct rays of the sun are felt through the day out of all proportion to the general temperature. The temperature seldom remains at a high degree for more than three or four days at a time, but a south-west wind during the summer months is often unpleasantly warm and relaxing. In of the praises lavished on the climate by former travellers.93 there seems little doubt that it is often trying to Europeans, and there is a consensus of opinion amongst residents that the climate is less good than at first sight appears ; though excellent in winter and spring, it is spoilt in the summer and autumn by the prevalence of malarial fever. The main conclusion to be drawn from the foregoing survey of the climate and sanitary conditions of Shiraz would seem to be—- (1) Troops cannot be housed under canvas either in winter or summer, except for short periods, without danger to health ; this is particularly the case in winter with Indian troops. (2) Careful sanitary arrangements arc necessary to protect troops from disease : and they should not be can toned close to the town, and should draw their water, from wells if possible; there are several good wells in the neighbourhood of the Consulate and it would seem a very desirable precaution both on military and sanitary grounds to have one dug within the Consulate grounds. Bushire.- —The hottest month is August and the coldest are Buahlro. January and February. In summer the thermometer has been known to rise to 115 • 6°. The worst period is between 20th July and 16th September, owing to the excessive moisture in the air. The rainfall is mostly in November (1 • 72 // ), December (2-58'), January {I ■23'), and February (O'VS'). This may be said to constitute the rainy season. . These four months are intermittently stormy and cold on shore, the sea being rough. It seldom actually freezes, but the thermometer occasionally falls almost to freezing point. Fires are almost a necessity in December, January and February, and welcome after sundown until the end of March. In March and April the rainfall is usual ly in the form of brief showers, the sky remaining otherwise clear. The prevailing winds are the shamaJ or north-west, and ha us or south-east. The former prevails at sea for nearly nine months of the year and blows very cold and boisterously in the winter months; a sharnal or ' nor-wester ' lasts usually three days. The same wind blows almost incessantly during June and July and, though then less violent, relieves the temperature94 neat the coast. At this season it is called locally the ' 40 days wind Until August the nights are generally tolerably cool; from thence up to the end of September they are sultry and still, with heavy dew. The hot season is from the beginning of May till the end of October. May is usually very dry, June and July moister, August and September very moist and oppressive. October is the transition month between the hot and cold weathers and is variable. The hottest temperatures (109° to 115°) have been recorded in August. The cold season commences on the sea coast about 15th November and is keen and bracing. From the beginning of December to the middle of March, it would be difficult to find a finer climate. The lowest tempera ture recorded of late years is 34' 2° when there was a fall of snow, but this is abnormal. The best season for the movements of troops through Bushire would be (1) from 15th March to 30th April and (2) from 1st October to 30th November. Between the 1st May and 1st Octo ber the heat for the first 60 miles from the coast would be very trying for troops on the march, and would be oppressive even on the plateau. In December, January and February the cold on the plateau is excessive. During the same periods the sea is most likely to be propi tious for the landing of troops in the difficult harbour of Bushire. The sanitary condition of the town is bad, yet the place is not unhealthy. Malarial fever is the most prevalent disease among the natives. Ophthalmic and other eye diseases are rife, caused by flies, dust, glare and insanitary habits. The water from wells in the town is bad and bitter. Water is available on Bushire Island as follows :— Drinking water for men :— (1) Fresh and distilled water :— • From the 2 condensers at Dastak and from the storage tank at Reshire which have the following capacity: r ■ Gallons per diem. 15,000 80,000 Dastak condensers Storage tank at Resibre i! -95 ■ sV The two condensers at Dastak have a capacity of 14,000 and 5 6,000 gallons a day respectively, but for continuous capacity the above figure should be taken. The storage tank at Reshire is situated in the Telegraph com pound and is connected with the condenser at Dastak by a 3 ii ch pipe (4,800 feet Iong)'laid underground. * ■ ■ ■ ; A cattle trough and stand'pipe for filliflf'drinking water carts exist on the road adjacent to the tank. A pipe line is laid to tbe buildings occupied 'as Regimental Headquarters and Statioxi Hospital {vide Sketch Map). There is a covered in reservior built of stone and cement some 40 yards from the easternmost jetty at New Customs {vide Map). The capacity of this reservoir is 120,000 gallons and was u ed for the storage of drinking water brought in steamers for. the use of troops in the early days of the Striking Force in 1918. It is now in disuse and, as efforts are being made to sell it, it has not been included in the account of fresh water available on Bushire Island.

Yazd is so situated that none of the disagreeable effects of damp are felt. The water is not found at less than 200 feet below the surface and the climate is very dry. The winds come down from the north and east, in spring and'summer, with great force, bringing such sandstorms, that the place becomes as dark as night; while great desiccating heat waves burn up everything in their w ay. The quantity of sand in the town has a good effect on the sewage system. During the summer heat, say the middle of June to about the end of August, life in tents in the plains in the day time would be almost unbearable, and it would be necessary to protect animals from the direct rays of the sun ;■ the nights, on the other hand, are tolerably cool The plains are particularly barren and little or no shade could be obtained from trees; there are, however, large gardens in the vicinity of Yazd, where ample shade could be found In the valleys of the mountains to the west of Yazd, and at Taft a place about 16 miles also to the west, which is a summer resort for the inhabitants, trees are numerous. From Yazd to Taft there is a good carriage road, and roads to the valleys bevond are not difficult for mules, donkeys, and horses. DurinJ the whole of the winter, it would be possible to live in tents in the plains ; but it would be very trying and some means of heating them would be necessary. Transport animals would have to be sheltered from the cold, especially during the night. Prom the beginning of April to the end of May, and from the middle of September to the end of November, would be the be s t time for being under canvas, and, except for occasional sandstorms, the weather would leave nothing to be desired.^2) 97 i -! The average weather is summarized as follows April weather pleasant, except for sandstorms. May—never uncomfortably hot. June —generaIly hot, but nights cool. July—hot, but nights fairly cool. August—hot, but cooler about the middle of the month nights cool. ' September —warm to cool. October —pleasant. November generaliy cold, snow on hills. December —cold, occasionally mild days. January—cold with cold winds. February cold with cold winds. ^tarm' 1 tIle middl0 0f the m0nth il be f! ins to ««♦ ■ J he , f,om degrees of frost in winter lo 00 —-105 insummer in theshade. f„ the monTtaiS + W v eSt 11 18 0001 durin S ^e day in the summer and chilly at night.

In the autumn the heat is more oppressive than in the summer, but in winter and spring the climate is pleasant. The cold is never great and snow seldom falls. The rains, which are not heavy, fall in the winter or early spring and are almost always accompanied-by a south-east wind, which, though often violent, hardly ever continues for more than three or four days at a time. The inhabitants depend largely for their water-supply on wells and on cisterns and reservoirs built with great labour to collect the scanty rainfall. The above also applies to the sea j)ort of Lingeh, where the water from hirkeM is almost ex clusively used, as that of the vrelis is brackish. General Medical Conditions. Drinking water should always be boiled, or treated chemically, except when drawn straight from a spring. Dust is very bad during summer and autumn, and, with the glare and consequent prevalence ol eye diseases, makes coloured spectacles desirable. Mosquitoes flourish up to 4,000 feet, wherever there is stagnant water ; malaria therefore is prevalent and mosquito nets necessary : these are also useful during the day to keep off the swarms of common flie«. Sand flies are ubiquitous and troublesome ; they may be in a measure avoided by sleeping well away from any walls. Muslin bags are recom mended forsleepin,' in. Only muslin or nets of mesh 24 strands to the inch give protection. Repellants such as Oil of Citronella, Vermijelli, Oil of Eucalyptus, Oil of Bergamol in Kerosine, etc., have been recommended. Of tropical diseases malaria and salel: are the only common ones. The latter is probably the same as the Delhi boil, and is a very indolent sore, which heals over, only to break out anew. It leaves a disfiguring scar, usually affects the face and forearms, and may be avoided by frequent washing and the use of antiseptic soap. It is probably contagious from case to case and also from dogs, which suffer from it. Possibly also it is conveyed by some insect. An attack gives immunity. To avoid it all slight wounds should be kept covered. Guinea worm (dracunculus medinensis) is prevalent in some parts especially at Lingeh, due to the drinking water being from ab -ambdrs (local name reshia).•5. 99 Cholera visits Persia at intervals of about 12 years and inocula- tion is advisable. Plague has never obtained a firm footing but in 1008 the returns showed 140,038 deaths from this cause. Fever ia frequently malarial, but more often the result of chill, digestive disturbances or exposures to the sun. Enteric fever is very common, and inoculation a necessary precaution ; also vaccina tion, as small-pox is very rife. Dysentery is common, especially in the South, and is frequent ly followed by liver abscesses. Venereal disease is rampant. Anthrax is very common both in man and beast. Bilharzia may also occur. Medical. Disvcnsnne «.—There is a dispensary at BusTiIrc which ia housed in a very dilapidated Persian house. A new hospital is now being built and will shortly be ready. It is situated alongside the British Town Residency on the sea front. The cost of erection is being borne partly by funds raised by public subscription in the town, and partly by the British authorities. The dispensary is under the direct supervision of the Resi dency Surgeon, Persian Gulf. There is also a charitable dispensary at Lingeh which is in charge of an Assistant Surgeon.

The amount oi supplies obtainable in Southern Persia at {he commencement of operations, whether with or without the approval of the Persian Government, will be almost insig nificant owing chieflj^ to the unwillingness of the inhabitants to bring in what they possess for sale. During the early part of the B 5 shire operations of 1918 no local supplies, of any kind were obtainable, but, as confidence was restored and it came to be realised that all supplies provided for the force Avould be well paid for, the, hesitation on the part of the inhabitants gradually disappeared, and as the force advanced a considerable amount of fodder and other arficles was obtained. Until therefore expe rience has taught that the necessity does not any longer exist, all supplies should be carried, even including fodder for animal!?. (1) Fdrs. i {a) Articles of supply obtainable. ■fm, supplies. Wheal. —Wheat is harvested in July and August in the high- Articles of sup- lands and in March in the coastal area, and in between these Whe 0 at tainable ' months in the country in between according to elevation above sea level and the climate. The biggest holders of wheat in each district are the ruling Khans, a large proportion of whose revenues is obtained from dealings in produce; though they do not trade much in their own names, purchases can be made through the.'r brokers. Bice. —After wheat, rice is the most important crop as regards human consumption, and a Persian's material pros perity is guaged by the number of times a week he can afford to eat rice. There are two kinds generally recognised in Shiraz, called respectively shahrl and charnpeh. The rice is of very fair quality, but generally whiter in colour than Indian rice. At Shiraz the rice comes mainly from the fields lying to the east and south of the city near the marshes and the salt lake. It is sown towards the end of May and reaped in October. Dhal. I h l. —There are two sorts of dhal grown in Persia The commonest, known a-s adas, is similar to German leuUls_ It is jtGOft 1Q1| purple-green in colour, very hard and takes a lot of cooking. r l he other variety is called mashak and is not recognized as being' in the same family. It is very similar to the Indian mung, and is softer and cheaper than adas. The commonest pulse eaten by the Persians is noJchud, or gram, which however ^ of very much finer i.uMity than Indian gram and is never fed to animals. ■ ' - t ■ ;; Adas is sown in April and August and reaped in August and October. * ' •: 'I.- Mashak is sown in August and reaped in October. NakJmd is sown in April and reaped in August. OU.—Qhi, locally known as roghati,- is of fxccllent quality, GhL far better than that obtainable in India.. It is mostly made from sheep and goats milk and is whiter in colour ■ than cow.s g,u. It is ,usual]y made in March and April during the lambing ana kidding season, and is cheapest at this period. It is usually packed and Sold in goatskins. It should be possible to collect considerable quantities. Its use, however, is by no- means universal; the pcover, classes both in town and country cannot/ afford it. It is one oi the most A ^aluable products brought in to the towns for sale by the nomads au'i xts ^leo largely bought bv pedlars in exchange for cloth, etc., being roadilp' portable.. There is. however, no large reserve of it available as a rule, and any exceptional demand would send up the price rapidly. It can usually be bought mlioh cheaper south than north of Slifraz. Barley. —Barley is the universal grain fed to animals in BarCey - Persia and is generally given without being either, crushed or soaked,. though occasionally Ihe latter is done. The quality varies, but in size it is above the;Indian average. • Its condi tion is usually very good. .Its chief defect is? the amount of dust and dirt with which it is mixed, amounting on an average to 5—6 per /jent. The harvest season varies according to the height above sea level; in the coast belt it is about March and April, and at Shlraz in July.. Maize.- —Maize, or zurat haldl, like gram is used entirely Maize, for human consumption. The harvest is in July and August. Millets. There are apparently two varieties . known as aihia ^ zurat ka'ab, and alano. The former is rather like - joivarl; but smaller. It is used to adulterate wheat and is fed to poultry. The latter is dark and sijijiller, like bain.102 Bran and OaU. }fran and Oafs. —These are generally unobtainable. Bhoosa. Bhoosa. —Bkoosa, or Icah is the staple fodder of the country, and the quality is ordinarily very fair, though it usually con tains an undue quantity of dust and dirt, so that an extra ration up to 30 per cent, may be necessary to keep animals up to con dition. Bhoosa is either from wheat or barley, the former being the whiter and better of the two. It is harvested in the Shiraz plain with the wheat and barley between July and Sep tember. Lucerne. 1 Lucerne—This is used largely as both a green and a dried fodder, and is obtainable green all the year except from Decem ber to iebruary, though this depends on the severity of the winter. The first crop of lucerne is to be avoided as it gives horses the itch. Spices'. Tea and: SufJar ' Tea ' Ginger and Turmeric. —These are all imported, mainly from India, as also most of the chillies used. Bait. Salt. Salt is obtained from the various salt lakes and is plentiful, cheap and good. Rock salt is also obtainable in the hills around Kamarij and in Sarvistan. Dried Fruits, Vegetables. Dried fruits.—-Dvied raisins, figs and dates, and to a lesser extent dried apricots and peaches are usually available as they form an important part of the Persian national diet. Vegetables. Considerable quantities of fresh vegetables should normally be obtainable, onions being as a rule the easiest to come by. Potatoes are not easy to obtain, but the follow- '''' s ' lou ' (1 available during the periods shown against them : Beans, broad and French, (lobya and bagala) Beetroot, (chogandar) Brinjal, (badinjuri) ., Cabbage, {kalam) Carrot, {zardak or nargisi) Cucumber (balang) .. Lettuce, (kahu) Peas, {nakhud) Pumpkins, {kadu) .. Spinach, {isfanaj) Tomatoes, {badinjun farangi) Turnips, (shalgam) .. April to July. December to March. June to October. November to April.

December to March.t r 103 Jfeaf.-^The great bulk of the livestock in Persia belongs Mca&lt;i to the tribes and is therefore migatoiy and uncertain in numbers in any particular district. The tribes migrate during March and April and again in September to Kovember to and from their summer quarters, and their flocks and herds accompany them. The supply of livestock therefore naturally depends on the nearness of the tribes. As a general rule there shoi:ld bo no great difficulty, when other supplies are coming in, in obtain ing meat in areas close to the tribal settlements. The actual supply is very large and of very good quality, and in consequence the price is comparatively little liable to fluctuation. If grazing is obtainable, it wotild be economical to lay in a considerable reserve. Cattle are by no means plentiful in Southern Persia as they are not used in draught at all for transport and very little unt;er pack, while the Persians eat little beef. In size the cattle aro small and humpless, but they carry very good condition and should give an average outturn of at le^st 250 lb. Sheep are all of the fat-tailed variety and give excellent mutton. The average outturn is about 30 lb. Goats are of two kinds, a Fttiall long-haired mountain goat with an average outturn of 15 tb, and a larger, though not proportionately heavier, animal similar to the Indian goat, giving about 20 lb. (b) Grazing. Grazing is obtainable for from 2—3 months in the lower Grazing-. Country to 6—7 months in the highlands in fair proximity to the roads, but could only be taken advantage of by a force going very short stages, or by animals on a staging system having at, least enough time for going S—-4 miles each way to grazing. The season and the amount available vary much according to the severity of the winter. (c) Fuel. If 00(7.—Fuel is likely to be a difficulty for a considerable Fuel - force anywhere in Persia, and one can never count on being able to gather one's firewood, though in most places a fair amount of light brushwood suitable as a fire-lighter is obtainable. Purin^ the Bush ire operations in 1918 firewood was always a diifieulty, . as, although it is plentiful in the hills beyond Khisht, it was found by no means easy to induce the villagers to bring it in104 Charcoal. Hills. Storage of Supplies. Firewood is classed under the two heads of 'mountain' and ' garden,' the former being the drier, better and more expen sive of the two. Garden wood is mostly chenar, walnut, willow, ash and fruit trees. The best season for getting in a stock of wood is from June to September. From March to June, while the sap is still running, it can only be got, if at all, from Per- sians who happen to have laid in a stock, as the Persians will not cut it then. It is usually brought in on donkeys in pieces 5 feet long and requires spliting. Charcoal. —-Charcoal is largely used by the Persians for cooking and in braziers, and is always obtainable in Shlraz. (d) Mills. Except at Bushire the bulk of the mills are of the water type, using horizontal stones 3 feet in diameter, and turning out 300—400 lb, per hour, or about 4,000 lb. per diem. The out turn of flour to wheat is from 97—98 per cent., no bran at all being apparently produced. There an? usually mills in all vil lages with a population of 800 or over, and the proportion of mills to inhabitants seems to work out at one per 1,000. Occa sionally in a place like Bandamir. where the water facilities are exceptional, the grinding for all the villages within a larger radius is done in one place. (e) Storage of Supplies. Storage is much assisted by the extreme dryness of the climate, already referred to, so that no particular precautions have to be taken against weevils, damp, fungi and other con comitant evils of a damp climate. Rats and mice, however, are to be found and require the ordinary precautions. The Persians do not build any special stores, but use the same kind of out-houses and godowns as are to be found in India, except that a grain store will often have a small trapdoor in the roof through which the grain is poured after it becomes impossible to get any more through the door. Straw and barley are not, as a rule, stocked in these godowns but in pits and small rooms scattered about in the villager, and one of the principal difficulties in supplying troops, is the collection of fo lder from these various caches, as it has all to be weighed before it can be taken over, and this wastes much time.105 {/) Packing. ' Gunny bags are practically unobtainable in ShTraz. The Packing, local equivalents are not obtainable in large quantities and, though very strong and durable, are expensive. Gunnies should therefore be brought by a force of whatever size entering the country. (?) Supplies available in coastal area, excluding Bushire.

Sirrr.liesinland. j n orf i er to meet the demand for fodder and provisions which i!s created by the passage of large caravans of merchandise up and down the main roads, the stocks of fodder available at various stages are generally considerably in excess of the quantities actually grown by the village concerned, as fodder is; brought in from the area round for sale to persons in the village who make a business of supplying caravans. &amp; It thus happens that with a few exceptions large stocks of bhotrsa and barley art available at every stage from Bushire up as far as Isfahan, and more could usually he brought in at short hotice. It should however be carefully noted that the whole of the countryside lying along the main caravan route to Shlraz and thence to Isfahan is as regards surplus supplies available for sale almost entirely dependent on the annual rainfall. Irrigated land produces little, if anything, beyond bare local needs. For the last 10 years this rainfall has steadily decreased, and, whereas previous to 1910 wheat was exported in quite large quantities direct to Europe, since that time the yield has barely sufficed for the needs of the local inhabitants. So small were the crops in some years that large amounts of foodstuffs were imported from India along the Bushire-Shiraz road and as far as Isfahan. The present year (1922^ should give excellent harvests as the rainfallA ' 107 has been particularly heavy, but figures which may be given should not be relied upon with any degree of certainty or even approximation for following seasons. All statistics therefore for supplies in South Persia, unless otherwise specifically stated, should be considered as dependent on a good rainfall the previous winter. Bvshire Town. —With the exception of fresh vegetables ]3Q8hire Town, practically all the food supply for the 16,000 inhabitants of the town comes in by sea, either from the Angali districts via Shif, or from Haiat DaOd, via Bandar Rig and Ganaveh. Firewood is imported from Tangistan, chiefly by boat from Daiyir, and partially by donkeys across the masluleh. A considerable trade exists with Karachi for in 1 ported articles of food, especial ly sugar. There are three mills for grinding flour in the town, but the supply is only just aboirfc c qual to the demand. In good harvest years there is a fair expert of wheat and barley from the port, the whole of this being collected from the surrounding districts, chiefly Haiat Daud and Shabankareh, by buyers from Bushire. The bazar is well stocked. There is a large vegetable market and a meat market; and the ordinary grain and grocers shops are spread throughout the bazar, the bulk of the grain being at the southern end of the bazar and near the wharves. Tea is largely drunk by the inhabitants, and a large stock is always held. Sugar is exported to the hinterland. Prices are high and subject to the most violent fluctuations, their relative cheapness when compared with India^ depending on the exchange value of the krdn. If necessary, by resorting to substitutes for ordinary ration articles, there is no reason why 6,000 men should not live on local resources for a month without unduly straining the bazar, though there is no question that any such action would result in greatly inflating prices. Bushire. Island.—This, is a sandy waste with patches of Bashire Island ' rock outcropping at frequent intervals, and in the summer no one would think it was capable of producing even an indifferent crop. Fruit gardens and date palms are found near houses, and pits, dug down through the top layer of rock, are found all over the island containing vines and fig trees. When;; the winter rains fall, barley and wheat are scattered on the ground by hand, donkeys, ponies and bullocks are yoked to primitive ploughs, the seed is ploughed in and left to the hand of God. If good rains are received, there is a good crop, and if the rains108. Chaghadak. V tl-i fail, the crop fails. Iso extensive irrigation system is possible, as there is no water. Most of the wells are all brackish and only hold stifiieient water to irrigate: small plots containing a ica vegetables. I hese are chiefly broad beans, lettuce, carrots, beetrpot, tomatoes and spinach during the &gt;vinter, and melons, ladies fingt's, onions, brinjals and cucumbers during the hot moi.ihs.

Good grazing for camels is to be found on the hills to the north of the sarai. There are large quantities of gypsum in the surrounding hills, and lime of excellent quality could be burnt here. There is ample firewood on the surround ing hills for a brigade for a month. ■Bdhddr. —A certain amount of barley bkoosa and can be Rahdar, drawn from the surrounding villages. Eice of good quality, • wheat of very good quality, Kabuli gram and maize are also grown in the area, but not to any large extent. Firewood sufficient for a division could be obtained. The sheep and goats of the Kashkulls are pastured round about. The early spring is not a good time for purchasing livestock, as this is the .time when the tribes are making their ghi and the wool clip has not yet been taken. Kdzarun. —Lying as it does in the centre of a well-watered Kazarun. and flourishing plain, this town could probably support two regiments. There are extensive fruit gardens, to the south of the town, containing oranges, pomegranates, grapes, mulberries and tigs. A. small quantity of oats, are grown near the town. ^Barley is the chief crop, and there are large quantities of barley and blioosa obtainable, both of excellent quality. Sufficient wheat is grown for local consumption. In an average year sufficient grain and fodder should be available for a division of all arms for at least ten days. Firewood is brought in from the surrounding hills where there are large quantities available, but large stocks are not kept in the town. Fresh vegetables, can be Obtained all the year round, say for 100 men. There is a fair quantity of locally grown rice. Rock salt of excellent quality, quarried in the hillsHear Kamarij, is sold in the bazar. Water, which is plentiful from running streams from the hills, is of excellent quality. Jdhrum.- —This town is well supplied with straw and barley Jahrum. from Unirrigated lands ; both are cheap in normal years. Two regiments could live on the country in ordinary years here. The average annual output of grain is estimated at 1,275 tons. Fasd, —At times it is very difficult to obtain fodder at all, T ,a ^. especially, after the passage of the Khamseh. There is the extensive irrigated cultivation. Fasa is the centre of the Knamseh tribes' country, and ha^ some importance from a mili tary point of view in consequence. Two regiments could liveno on the country in ordinary years. The average annual output of grain was estimated in 1911 at 2,950 tons, while that of the neighbouring district of Sarvistan was 2,970 tons. Abadeh. Abddch. —The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here, but for the winter supplies would have to be laid in before December. Firilzabad. Firu zdhdd. —The market town for a large district: not much difficulty should be experienced in keeping one regiment here ; no difficulty in winter. In fact, one regiment of cavalry or infantry could live on the country almost anywhere, as supplies would be always obtainable from villages in the neighbourhood. In 1911 the average annual output of grain was estimated at 820 tons and of rice at 1,630 tons, while the output of grain in the adjoining district of Slmakan was estimated at 1,430 tons. Iqlid, Mahin, Bavanat, Ardakan, Baiza, Marvadasht, Arsin- jan, Sarvistan, Istehbanat, Darab, 'Alamarvadasht, Khurmuj, and anywhere in DashtT, Dashtistan, and the other coastal districts as far as Behbehan would be favourable centres for obtaining local supplies. If the local population is actively hostile, and opposition is encountered from villages at which it is desired to purchase supplies, ohly mountain-guns could effectively break down their resistance and force them to give up their supplies, which are generally scattered in small store-houses all over the village; it is improbable however that villagers would offer more than passive resistance to an invading army. As regards the provisioning of troops at Shiraz without the consent of the Persian authorities, the possibility of a general boycott must always be reckoned with, even if the Persian Government do not actively object to the presence of the force at Shlra/,: it is therefore undesirable to send a force to Shiraz, which is not in a position, if necessary, to compel the sale of food-stuffs which it requires. ' But it must be realised that the force, whether inShiraz with the consent of the Persian authorities or not, must be dependent mainly on supplies of fodder, etc., brought in from outlying districts, either directly by its own transport, or through native ageiiey ; if disturbances prevail outside the town, or if the tribes are taking active measures to make a boycott effective, villagers will be prevented from bringing in supplies, and prices will rise rapidly111 obliging the commander of the force to make his own arrange ments to bring in fodder and food-stuffs, possibly by force, from outside. For this purpose the best districts would generally be the following :— (1) Kavar, very fertile, (2) Khafr, south of Kavar, very fertile. (3) Sarvistan : fertile 30 miles south-east of Shlraz. (4) Kiirbal, Marvdasht, Raiza and Ardakan ; all very fertile. Firewood is plentiful near Kavar, and at Khan-i-Zin'an and Dasht-i-Arjan. It seems that the average crop of wheat and barley per house in a village is about 1,200 mans Shirazi, or 9,000 lb. ; if half be available for sale to the outside public, the produce destined for the market would be about 2 tons per house, or 40,000 tons for Shiraz and 50 miles round. Of this quantity half should be available for the use of an occupying force in a normal year, though of course prices would go up rapidly if so large a quantity were needed. In a bad year, 10,000 tons should be available. Assuming the requirements of a cavalry brigade with transport to be about 20 tons a day of wheat and barley, a force of this ■size is about the maximum, which, it can be safely assumed, could live on the country as far as grain is concerned ; a rather larger number of infantry could be supplied, but it might be necessary occasionally to feed them on barley flour. There should be no difficulty in providing 10,000 men with flour, as long as native agency is not relied on to bring in the wheat from the districts. Flour is never stored in large quanti ties ; the wheat is sent to the mill to be ground in small quan tities as required. Mills are numerous round Shhaz, and there should be no difficulty in hiring one or more for the use of a force. It is very uneconomical to purchase flour ; it is better to buy wheat and have it ground under supervision ; this is the only way of obtaining good flour with certainty ; bran and barley are largely used as adulterants. (2) Yazd. Articles in daily use are fairly cheep, the only dear thing in comparison beinu wheat which has to be imported. The entire crops of a whole season are only sufficient to supply the112 Laristan. 'Iratisport, Gen erai. wants of the capital for a period of three months, whilst an average rrop is only equal to a two months' supply. Only the well-to-do people use pure white bread which is mad': from flour imported from Fars. - Isfahan and Khorasan. Water is obtain- erl mostly from kandts and is sufficient to water about 20,000 acres. Water is reached at a depth of 180 to 200 feet. Timber is imported from neighbouring hills and firewood is obtainable, though not in any large quantities. (3) Ldrittln. Laristan is one of the poorest and least productive provinces Of Persia, ranking in this respect only second to the Bashakard country. This is due in part to the lawlessness of the in habitants, but still more so to the country itself. Much of it is an arid desert diversified by rocky hills and valleys of sand and salt. The inhabitants depend to a large extent for their water-supply on cisterns and reservoirs built with great labour, to collect the scanty rainfall, and upon welts. Ky far the most important product is the date, which flour ishes everywhere. Some wheat and barley is also cultivated especially in the Lar and Bastak divisions, whieh also support immense (locks of sheep and yoats besides smaller numbers of cattle, donkeys and camels. The swamps opposite Qishm Is land can provide large quantities of fuel, a scarce commodity in this province, and a considerable quantity is also obtainable ^rom the Kuh-i-Gavbus ranlie hear Bastak. (B) transport. With the exception of an almost negligible quantity in Bushire and to a lesser degree Shuac, thsre is no wheeled transport in Southern Persia. Where water and forage are available, the mule is the best and fastest animal, but there are some places where the scarcity of these makes the use of camel transport imperative. Donkey caravans are also much used. I or employment with his own animals the Persian caravan man, oi ' ndf i a I fir, is excellent, but when he is merely in charge ol animals not his own property much supervision is necessary. His endurance and stamina,are marvellous and his wants as regards l ood and clothing very small. He is usually accustom ed to handling arms, and a Martini-Henry carbine is the most useful weapon, if it is desirable to arm him. He treats his ani mals \\ kn g-ea- care and kindness. The length of marches is dependent on the water-supply ; the f'rst march is always madeim short, and subsequent ones average about 20 miles; 30—35 miles is not an unusual distance for a long march. For equipment an ample supply of ropes should be brought with a force. The supply could probably b6 kept up with O black goat-hair ropes in the country. S. T. C. gunny sacks are only obtainable in small numbers ; the Persian sack is much too heavy. Jhools could be. made up in large quantities in any Persian town. Yakdansof the Indian pattern are most suitable for cnmd and mule transport. Caravan men dislike any article weighing over KM) lb. For watering purposes provision must be made for drawing water from wells, sometimes very deep. Picks, shOvelS, crow bars and galvanised iron buckets are necessary for clearing out existing wells. For use in Persia the S. T. C. galvanised iron Water tank is most satisfactory. Persian pack mules are a very fine form of transport, the Mules, animals being as good material as the men who drive them. The mules stand from 13-2 to 14*2 and look even bigger owing to the peculiar high two pointed saddle. They are always in very good condition, although they work under far harder con ditions, than would be considered possible in India, the recog nized load being 40 mans or 290 lb. The normal daily ration is about 7 lb. of barley mixed up with 15 lb. of bhoosa. The Persian donkey is an exceptionally hardy animal and very Donkeys, much superior to the Indian donkey both in size and strength. The Persian thinks nothing of giving a donkey a load of 215 lb. Though slower than the mule they are nevertheless capable of doing equally long marches. Donkeys receive the same feed as horses, barley 7 lb. daily, or on the road with loads 10 ft. and one Shah man of bhoosa daily. The number of camels in and around Fars is not so great Camela- as formerly, and their quality is not very high. Most of them are weak and weedy with poor carrying power, their maximum average load being only 320 lb. In Bushire and Shiiaz there are a, lew carts, (half a dozen, carta but not more) chiefly of the four-wheeled fourgon type. There are, however, few opportunities ordinarily for the use of wheeled vehicles owing'* to the badness of the roads. During the Bushire operations, in 19}8, when a certain amount of im provement had been made to the roads to the north of B^- shire, a special light-draught single mule cart, made specially MC37CGS &lt;2District. v.j'f J) ^ ; Horses.

There are no camels around Shnaz either to the west or the east. In Bavanat district, however, the tribes men own large herds. Kazarun, Shiraz and Sivand are the principal centres for obtaining mules, and it is said that around the first named there are some 2,■000 and around the last about 1,000. The tribesmen own considerable numbers of horses and breed extensively. The Qashqal, which is to be found in large numbers in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, is the best. Most of these are of a cobby type with short heavy necks and slack loins. Their average height is about 14-1 hands. They are, however, reputed to have neither heart nor manner. In the Daiab valley the Baharlu own a great many brood mares of good quality, averaging bigger and heavier than those found round Shiraz. It should ordinarily be possible to buy 100 useful horses in the valley in a month. A large number of donkeys are to be found everywhere. As in the case of the coastal area, however, the amount of trans port possessed by the inhabitants only suffices for their own needs. V' (2) Yazd. The camel is the chief transport animal m the province, Yazd. .though mules and donkeys are also used. In the town and TMnsport. districts there are some 5,000 camels owned by the local inha-116 Laristin. Transport. i 1 11 [• bitants, and these are almost entirely employed in the caravan traffic towards the south. It is said that a certain amount of camel-breeding is done in the Shahr-i-Babak district. No mules are bred in the district and very few are owned. Those that are seen in Yazd come in from outside in caravans. Don keys are numerous and are used considerably for transport pur poses, but rarely over long distances. No good horses are bred in the province, nor are many kept. (3) Laristan. ? ,. Camels and donkeys are the chief means of transport, but no figures are availablfe a^ to the numbers belonging to the inhabitants. It can be safely assumed, however, that for any dperations in Laristan all transport would have to be provided from outside. Veterinary Note. In 1917 during the march from Bandar Abbas to Shiraz the outstanding feature from a veterinary point of view was the number of cases of foot lameness in the transport mules, and the extensive galls from the pack saddlery and palans in the mules and camels. The mules were not shod, and, as the going was very hard and stony and the marches long and arduous, thev suffered exceedingly from bruised feet and laminitis, and a good many had to be left behind at the various stages. The Assistant Director of Veterinary Service with the column reported that, had the mules been Shod with the special wide-webbed shoe which is used for indigenous transport animals, the percentage of foot trouble would have been much less. He advised that all mules sent to Southen Persia should be shod before being sent up country, preferably with the local pattern shoe, though the Indian pattern shoe Would be better than nothing. The advantages ard disadvantages of the Persian method of shoeing are described on page 118. The 1 ersian pack saddle has many advantages over the Indian pattern for use in Southern Persia. For though it appears somewhat huge and cumbrous, it distributes the weight over a much larger surface than does the Indian pattern. These saddles do excellently in the hands of the Persian charvdddr. The following contagious diseases are found in the area under review :— Glanders, mange (Sarcoptic) and fever (probably piro- . plasmosis)Cz: 117 There is little doubt that glanders is very prevalent in South Persia, and, though it is well recognised as a contagious ciseasc, affected animals are frequently allowed to go about spreading the germs owing to the Persian dislike of taking life. As regard?, the horse, the common type seems to be of an acute farcy nature, numerous bi ds usually appearing in various parts of the booy. An acute catarrhal type with swelling of beth submaxillary glands, and ulceration of both sides of the septum, nasi has been met with. The chronic type oiten seen in the west, i.e., unila teral enlarged submaxillary gland with nasal discharge and ulceration of the septum nasi on the affected side is not in evi dence. In mules the disease appears to be of the type usually met with in mules, viz., an acute bilateral catarrh with extensive diffuse ulceration of tJie septum nasi. I\o record exists of any case of chronic glanders in the mule in this part of Persia. As regards the mallein test, the reaction to this appears to- be more delayed than in other countries. It is quite common for there to be practically no swelling at the 24th hour, and subsequently an enorn.ous typical rea tion, which proceeds for several days, to develop. There is almost invariably marked cording. In typical reactions there is generally marked sys tematic disturbance with disinclination to feed.. Mange is also a prevalent disease, and little or no notice is taken of it by the inhabitants. The prevailing type is of ihe sarcoptie variety, and it runs a normal course, the most commu^ situations being under the saddle and along the back and neck. Ringworm, strangles and catarrah are also, noticed, One of the chief causes of in r ection is the. use of sttrais for- SiifCJEj stabling. The sarai'&lt; throughout the country are in a filthy condition, ideal for the growth of germs. Unless they can be w tb taken over by the army and disinfected, and then kept solely for oughit military use, they should not be used at all. wgli Two parasites are chiefly met with, (a) bots (stomach), which Tte 1 are very common, and (h) ascarides, which are met with ccca- tfr. sionally. The dry climate, however, does not favour the hatch- i under ing out of ova. Horses and mules are shod in Persia in a manner, Avhich, me thod of ' pi® the natives say, gives them the best foothold and protection shoeing over rough stony passes.118 The hoof is shortened to the required length with a clumsy cutter ano rasp, and a thin plate, which covers the entir~ lower surface of the foot, except for a circular hole over the irog, is then fitted by cold hammering, and secured on each side by four large headed nails about 2£' long, w hich are rongaiy clenched. The plates are not countersunk and the heads of the nails all project and give a foothold even on sheet roc-. Ihis pattern of shoe, has been tested by Indian Cavalry . ana transport unites and condemned, because mud works into the hollow parts of the sole, through the hole in the centre of the shoe, and the sole, being enclosed, cannot be properly cleaned and thrush is induced. On the other hand, it is pointed out that horses, shod in the ordinary way, are almost inevitably lamed ,jy th.e rocks and stones on such roads as that between Diishire and Slnra.;; also the Persian pattern is exclusively and successfully used by all Persian muleteers, men who spend their lives on the road, and do practically all the carrying trade of the country. British officers travelling in Persia all speak layourably of the shoe, especially for mules, though for horses opinions Qifter. Taking everything into consideration, it would appear that animals, required to work over dry, rocky, stony ground would best be shod with the Persian pattern, while those vvoncmg over wet, muddy, soft ground, or piq netted in s J ta ' dmg8 ' which are hable to get damp and foul, siouia be shod with the ordinary shoe. » I •Tc i 0' pi «« m. .^4!^. . ronu jkii id moiisu lis .

Northern Coastal Zone. Tanjistan. Dashtlstftn. M ilitary. ? At the present time it may be said, that no regular Persian Army is in existence. The Governor-Generals and Governors of the various provinces keep up just so many irregular troops as they are obliged to by the exigencies of the local situation, but the numbers vary to such an extent that it is impossible to secure any satisfactory figures concerning these forces. The following are the numbers of armed men available in the various districts and tribes :— Coastal districts north of B shire. —The armed forces at the disposal of the Khan of Haiat Da d are estimated t 1,500 ta 2,000 tufangchis in normal times. In 1909 Haider KhSn des patched some 400 armed men to BSshire to assist the Darva -beg! in his expedition to Tangistan. The Khan can also dis pose of the armed forces of RM Hilleh, numbering some TOO' tufangchis, as well as contingents from Gahaveh and LTravI numbers unknown. The Shabankareh and Zlra districts are said to be able to muster 1,500 tufangchis. Tangistan. The number of men in Tangistan armed with modern rifles may be estimated at about 1,000. There are how- over so many blood feuds and enmities that it would be as a rule unlikely to find more than 300 acting together. In the attack on Bushire m 1915 and the operations against the Tands- tan s m the same year their forces numbered 5JO -fiOO on each occasion Among these however were included a number of sup porters from Dashtistan.

On tie whole it 120c • Cs: 121 ia improbable that a series of rapid movements into the district would ever be opposed by more than 500—600 men, and that only if they had received ample.warning of the movement and had time to collect. An invasion of Dashtistan might under the same circum- s^a-ces be opposed by 2,000 men, but, if the Tang'stams had first been dealt with and were not in a position to join in, it is unlikely that so large a number would ever be got together. The tactics employed by these men are to hold trenches and sangars, but if resolutely attacked they do not wait for the enemy to get close up. They are adepts nt taking cover some say they are fairly good shots. They hang on the flanks of an advanc ing column and harass it with long range fire without ever allow ing their enemy to come to close quarters. Once their v llages are seized and their country over un the r resistance collapses almost immediately. There is a great scarcity of ammunition ia these districts. Khamseh.

In 1911 when the122 Khamseh were united against Nizim-ea-Saltaneh and Saulat-ud- Doideh in the fighting in Shiraz eity the Arab forces numbered some 3,000 men. That the Arabs can and av IH fight was proved m 1918 when a squadron of Burma Mounted Infantry attacked a group of Arab encampments and a stubborn fight of four hours' duration ensued. In the 1911 fighting in Sh raz against the Qashqa i the Arabs showed great spirit arK,! determination and inflicted a severe defeat on thei • enemies. It has yet to be seen what, these tribas would do against a tillery. It is improbable that they would stand against a well -directed fire. The Khamseh tribes are well armed though they possess a greater var ety of rifles than the Qashcja s. Most patterns of rifle may be found among these tribes, but they are chiefly armed with Mausers, Lebels and Martinis. It is difficult to arrive at any estimate of the quantity of ammunition in the possession of the tribes. In April 1918, ammunition was reported to be scarce among the Arabs, and it would appear that 100 rounds per rifle is a safe maximum estimate. The Kalmfrs of each tribe have a sraall reserve, probably not more than a few hundred rounds. In March 1916 the Qawam-ul-Mulk was presented by the British Government with 2,000 non-charger loading Lee Enfield rifles and 3,33,000 rounds of ammunition, but no distribution of these arms has been received and it is not known among what tribes they were divided. The Qawam also has two German machine guns, but both are out of order and he has very little ammunition for them. His artillery consists of one 9 cm. Turkish mountain gun for which he has practically no shel. (a) ^4rats.—The fighting men of the Arabs are approxi mately as follows :— Jabbareh .. .. •. 4,900 Sliaibani .. .. .. 3,250 Total .. 8,150 For further details regarding the numbers of fighting men in the sub-tribes, see Appendix A. (h) \Aiti r il r '. —Tiie fighting men of the 'A inala may be taken at 700 lufanychls and 109 sowars armed with a variety of ridas123 They probably have less ammunition than the other Khamseh tribes as they are not addicted to robbery and therefore do not purchase ammunition to the same extent. (c) Bahdrlv.—^he Baharlus are said to be able to raise 1,000 sowars and 500 tufangchis under favourable conditions. The tribe is rich in horses and appears to have a rooted objection to undertaking any journey or military operations on foot. They are reported to have fairly large reserves of ammuni tion. {d) Bdsen.- —For number of fighting men see Appendix B. (c) Nafar.—1% is doubtful if the Nafar can now raise more than 100—150 tufangchis. Qdshqdis. —For every family at least one fighting man may QashqaU. be reckoned. This gives a theoretical total of 30,000 fighting men, but this represents the maximum number of rifles avail able in the tribe. No llkhanl, however, has ever been able to maintain a force of more than 4 ,000 —5,000 men in the field at^any one time. In 1911 when the Qashqa s were united against the Khamseh tribes and again during the fighting around Shiraz in May and June 1918 the llkhani had not more than 4,000—5,000 Qashqals under his command in spite of favourable circum stances. In the latter instance the whole 11 was mobilised for migration to the Sarhad. the Qashqals are well-armed. It is reckoned that there are in the tribe at least 20,00iy—25,000 modern small-bore magazine rifles (chiefly Mausers). During the operations against the Qashqa.s in May and June 1918 no black powder was observed and all wounds were small-bore gunshot wounds. During these same operations the enemy was plentifully supplied with ammu- nition. Their expenditure was considerable and must have greatly depleted their stocks. After recent experience, however, it would be a mistake to reckon on a shortage of ammunition. The Qashqai has a reputation for bravery which he did not belie during the operations of 1918. The Darashurls, Kashkul s, Farslm idans, Shishbulukis and Ghallehzan UghrTs are regard ed as thj warrior clans. Mobility is the Qashqa s' strong point. At the (irst sign of a retirement, hills which 'were apparently empty of tribesmen will swarm with sowars and footmen, all moving at their utmost pace. The Qashqai rides light and will force his horse to an all-out gallop over the roughest ground. Their ponies are small and wiry and will climb hills which would124 appear well nigh impossible. In the fighting round Sh raz it was found advantageous to keep fire fights at 70 800 yards. In this way Lewis and machine guns inflicted considerable casual ties on 'the enemy with comparatively small loss, as the Qash- qa 7 is a poor marksman at ranges oyer 500 yards. On several occasions the Darash rT horsemen charged in mounted, firing from the saddle. On arriving withjn 40—50 yards of their enemy they wheel and gallop back to their starting place. Envelop ing tactics are much practised by them, and they will when ever possible, attempt to outflank an enemy. Ihe Qashqai does not dig himeslf in, but utilises any natural cover he can find (on the crest of a hill for preference) or constructs sangars.

Mammsanu—The fighting strength of the Mamassanis is estimated at 230 sowars and 2,(m tufangchis. ihese are said to be good rifle shots and to have a reputation for bravery and stamina. The tribe is said to be well-armed, but ammunition is short. Ldshdnl. —The Lashanis can possibly turn out 1,500 fight ing men, but the tribe is not well armed or well supplied with ammunition. During the fighting in September 191/ it was computed that about 50 ppr cent, pf their arms were small bore and the remainder Martinis, etc. MishmasL—This tribe is reported to be well armed with Mauser and other small bore rifles, and to possess very few Martinis. A great number of rifles belonging to the Gend armerie are said to have passed into their possession during the Great War. They are reported to have 200 rifles and are gen erally well supplied with ammunitioa. Bolr Ahmadi.—Oi the 3,300 fighting men belonging to this tribe Shakrullah Khan in 1918 controlled^ 1,000, Karim Khan 1 ,400, Qaid Muhammad Ali 150, and Mulla Qobad 150. The Boir Ahmadi has a reputation for pluck and stamina fmd he is much feared by those who come into contact with him, even more so than the Arabs or Qashqais. The footmen of the128 Dushmanzlari. In the autumn.—kh^r the Qashqais go down and until the passes become blocked by snow, i.e., from the end of September until the end of November, or middle of December (if the weather is favourable). Their robber bands are much larger than those of the Arabs or of the Qashqais, being seldom less than 100 strong and some times as many as 300—400. Only about 10 per cent, of these are mounted. A curious procedure which the Boir Ahmadls are said to adopt occasionally is to send a dozen footmen, armed only with sticks, along the road. These start a quarrel with the C/i-ar- vadars of the particular caiavan they wish to rob (generally at some fixed joint and, in the middle of the resulting fight and confusion, the main body of the robbers suddenly appears on the scene and drives off the laden animals. Dushmanzidrl.—This tribe can probably turn out some 1,500 fighting men. They are described as a warlike tribe and well-ara ed. Nothing definite is known as to their arms and ammunition. A statement given by one of their chiefs gives the following distribution of armed men among the various villages :— (J Village.

Raised by Sir Percy Sykes in 1916 and com manded and trained by British and Indian officers and instruc tors, they formed an efficient safeguard for the tranquillity of the districts where they were stationed, and their presence acted as an effective deterrent to the local badmashes who, pre vious to their formation, had rendered the majority of the trade routes impassable. In the area under review was stationed the Headquarters of the South Persia Rifles and also the Fars Bri gade. These were located at ShTraz, and the Fars Brigade had detachments at Kazarun and Borazj an. This Brigade consisted until the middle of 1921 of one battery of artillery, one regiment of cavalry, two infantry regiments, one machine gun squadron auad one field company of engineers and was entirely self-contain ed, possessing its own veterinary, medical, signalling and trans port personnel. Its strength amounted to 3,400 officers and men with 4 guns and 6 machine guns. It has now been dis banded. The Persian Government will probably maintain a small force to take its place, but this cannot either in numbers or efficiency provide an adequate substitute for the South Persia Rifles in the task of maintaining law and order.

All the R. A. F. personnel have now been withdrawn and the station has been closed. The hanger of 8 bays, suitable only for small and medium sized machines, has been left on the ground. A small store of petrol and oil has also been retained. Care takers for the hangar are being provided by the local Persian authorities undei 1 arrangements made by the Political Resident, Bushire. The aerodrome is 600 yards s: uare, and its surface is level and good. It is however very exposed, and in the dry weather sandstorms are liable to prove a serious source of trouble. .

It is easily defensible from the land side, as the track from the interior across the mashileh is commanded by a ridge rising 100 feet above the road level. From 1916—18 the town and island were defended by a chain of 10 posts, connected by wire entanglements, starting from a point near the sea shore S.-W. of the Residency at Sabzabad and extending across the neck of the island to the edge of a deep indentation of the sea into the rAashihh. This plan of defence was found to answer well. (Vide Map of Bushire Island). There are no modern fortifications, but at Reshire there is a deserted redan. The town formerly had on the land side a wall 30 feet high and 5—6 feet thick, pierced for musketry. The town has however long since overflowed its old boundary and the wall has been de- stroved in so many places and built around that for purposes of defence it may be said not to exist. There are no sea defen ces. &gt;' iHnH ' ■■ ■ll Guns. —There are at present 2 modern breech-loading guns in existence at Bushire. One is a 77 m.m. field gun and the other a much smaller 70 m.m. calibre. Both of these are mounted on carriages and are in fair condition. They are of Austrian manu- ^Adture. Ammunition available is very scanty, certainly not more than 30—40 rounds. The 2 guns are at present in the poroh of the Finance Department, overlooking the Khur- Sultani, but there is no one in Bushire who is capable of serving them. Situated in the yard of the old barracks in the south of the town are 2 modern breech-loading guns of 85 m.m. and 2 howitzer of 22 c.m. bore. These weapons are altogether useless, having beeta left exposed to all weathers in the courtyard for many years past and being in consequence pitted with rust and with many parts missing including all the sighting apparatus. There are be lieved to be some few rounds of ammunition for the two 85 m.rn. gnnti i n some of the sheds of the barracks, but that for the howit zers was never in Bushire, having been sent by mistake to Enzeli. There are 3 small muzzle-loaders on carriages outside the south of the town and a number of dere ict muzzle-loading gums, del Qi 133 lying about in various places. The former which have carriage^ and caisssons are used for saluting purposes. ,( . - r u • ; The inhabitants of the town and peninsula possess a good many Martinis and modern magazine rifles with 50—80 rounds per rifle. They number at the outside 1,000 and are not a fighting class. Their military value is negligible. The mashlleh, especially when dry, for 15 miles is most excellent ground for cavalry, which can also work well up to the bases of the hills. The rnashileh, however, becomes very deep and sticky after rain. About 15 miles from Bushire a long ridge passmg through Gurak offers a position facing south-west to a force advancing on Bushire from the east or south-east. It commands all thc^ lowlying ground towards Bushire, and has a mean elevation of about 300 feet above the level of the plain. It would also afford a position facing north-east to * force covering Bushire against an enemy advancing from the east, though its extent would require a considerable body of troops to hold it. Lingeh has no sea defences and no garrison, nor is there LiHgeh. any position which could be held with any prospect of suocQue to oppose a landing on either side of the town covered by the fire of a g.mboat. The houses however come right down to tfie water's edge along the sea front and it would be a matter con siderable difficulty to shell riflemen posted in the upper stories of houses overlooking the landing places in the town. This situation would of course only arise in the event of a,stubborn resistence being offered by the townspeople, an occurrence most unlikely to take place. The town is situated in the open and the country round rises gradually, but with a bare stony incline for some 3 miles. At the summit of the rise a precipitous escarpment is reached, which drops to a salt plain 50 feet below and about a mile broad. This again drops 30—40 feet to another plain, which stretches for some miles to the north-west of the town. On the north-east the mountains gradually close in and reach the coast line some 5 miles east of Ling h. A few guns placed on the ridge would command the whole country to the north and west. Owing to the formation of the country there are only three approaches to Lingeh from the north and west. A fourth road leads along the back of the mountains and eventually comes in from the east, joining ths main road from that quaiter. Any force marching either by134 this or by the sea-coast road would be exposed to shellfire from ships in the harbour. &gt; There are only 2 small muzzle-loading guns on carriages in Lingeh. These are situated oil the sea front in front of the old Fort.. The^ are used for saluting purposes. During the threatened raid on Lingeh in 1910 the fighting foree of the town proved to be 70 tufangchis, and 200 men under the Shaikh of the Arab quarter. These numbers probably still hold good with approximate accuracy. About half the above force would have magazine rifles, the remainder small bore, Martini and old fashioned large bore single-loading rifles. Am munition for all classes of firearms is not plentiful. Ten masomV towers were built. These as a whole were placed in good posi tions and six of them were taken over as picquet posts by the British naval force which landed. These six alone remain and are in good cO idftrpii. The local tribes until recently possessed few rifles and very little ammunition, but during the height of the gun-running operations modem arms and ammunition were introduced into the district. The natives are not warlike nor fit to be trained as soldiers. Note on the Qdshqdls.—ln any military operations against the Qashqals the main factor to be considered is that they are as a whole a migratory tribe, that their wealth mainly depends on their flocks and herds, and that any stoppage or interruption of their annual migration would result in their losing much of their livestock owing to want of means of feeding them. When on the move they travel very .slowly, grazing as they go and often staying a few days in a place where the grass' is better than else where. Cattle, sheep and goats move over the hillsides ; nipn. women and children with the baggage animals carrying their belongings keep along the tracks. It will be understood how extremely vulnerable they are during these migrations. They are obliged to keep to their Regular routes within certain narrow limits, as otherwise they encroach on the rights of other sections qr tribes and consequently provoke their hostility. In addition to the fact that all their moveable property is practically at the mercy of organized raiding parties, troops in occupation of Shlraz and the Kazaruil valley in October and November could, by blocking their routes, keep theni up in the high ground where their cattle and sheep would all perish from lack of grazing during the winter. Similarly troops at these places in the spring135 could prevent tVieir moving to their summer grazing ground with a like result. For this reason they would probably hesitate to engage in open hostilities with a fairly strong force moving up to the Shiraz valley during the winter months, though they might resist a smaller force if they thought they could block its advance. Military Note on the Arms Traffic. —The chief place in the Tram *' Gulf, whence there is a small but steady flow of arms into Persia, is Koweit, where considerable quantities of • 303 service rifles and ammunition have been accumvlated. These have been collected from the former battle fields of Mesopotamia, from friendly tribes of that country to whom large issues of arms were made by the Government during the war, and from the tribes of the King of Hedjaz, who were well supplied with ser vice rifles for use against the Turks and are now selling off their surplus stock. These arms are exported ,from Koweit in two directions* Py far the larger number are smuggled across in dhows tp the Persian coast between Bandar Dilam to a point about 40 miles south of Lingeh. Smaller numbers find their way across to Makian. During the first nine months of 1920 there were 600 to 800 rifles landed at various tim.es from Koweit and its neiglibour- hood along the strip of coast between Bandar Dilam antfe Lingeh. 95 per cent of these were *303 service rifles, the remainder being of various types, principally Turkish Mausers. The latter type is little in demand owing to the difficulty in obtaining ammunition for ; t. Each rifle is usually accom panied by about 100 rounds of ammunition. Besides this large consignments of ammunition were carried separately estimated at not less than 100,000 rounds. Practically the whole of this quantity is absorbed in the province of Pars, where, in addition to the local inhabitants, tbe nomad tribes provide a never ceasing demand. The proof of the abundance of service rifles now present in Pars is their • price which near the coast averages about 40 to 50 Tomans (roughly 120 to 140 rupees) for a service rifle and 40 to 50 rounds. The price of ammunition is 12 tomans (about 40 rupees) per 1C0 rounds. There are few villages along this strip of coast in which there is no. less than ono rifle in each family.136 Between 1920 and the present time (March 1922) not more than 300—400 rifles with about 10,000 rounds of ammunition were landed on this strip of coast. This shows a considerable diminution in the numbers as compared with the figures for the first nine months of 1920, and there appears to be little doubt that the traffic generally in this area is on the wane. It is however considered that this smuggling will never cease entirely so long as surplus stocks are brought over to the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf and Persian officials on the opposite side con tinue their present apathy and corruption. The recent troubles in Iraq and the subsequent disarming of the rebellious tribes brought about a greatly increased demand from that quarter with the result that a big percentage of the trade in arms across the Gulf to the Persian coast was diverted to the needs of Iraq. . The coastal strip more especially from Bandar Dilam to the southern boundary of Dashtl may be Said to be well stocked with rifles, tbe great problem for the owners however being how to obtain ammunition. This commodity is undoubtedly scarce and shows indications of getting a good deal dearer. This remark applies particularly to ammunition for Mauser rifles brought into Persia before the Great War, and which is now prac- cally unobtainable.73 137 CHAPTER VII. C ommunications.

Telephones.—'There is telephonic communication between Reshire and Bushire town. The exchange at Reshire is situat ed in one of the buildings occupied by the garrison and is con nected to the houses occupied by the Regimental Mess, officere' houses, the Residency at Sabzabad, to the Town Residency in Bushire, and via the Persian exchange to the Town telephone system.

The approximate radius of this type of installa tion, which is of the latest pattern, is 400 miles. It has com municated with Basra and with the similar R. A. F. set at Bandar'Abbas. Pos Offices. —British and Persian civil post offices exist in Wireless, the Persian Gulf coast at Bilshire, Lingeh, Henjam, Bandar 'Abbas, Jask and Charbar. At Henjam, Ja.sk and Charbar they are in charge of officials of the Indo-Furopean Telegraph De partment. Persian post offices exist at Kazariirt. Sbirg,/ and Abadeh. Letters take five days from Bushire to Shiraz.140 CHAPTER VIII. Political. Administration. The Government of the country consists of a Shah, a Majlis or elected National Assembly which rarely sits, and a Cabinet. The latter is nominated by the Shah, but in theory must retain the confidence of the Majlis. In practice it does not do so, but it really governs the country. The country is divided into 33 provinces, under Governor-Generals or Governors. These provinces are divided into districts, sub-districts and parishes', each in charge of officials subordinate to the Governor General or Governor. The administration is corrupt and in efficient. The dispensation of justice is always summary, but the Persian Government has no jurisdiction over foreigners, who are tried by their own Consuls, except in the case of subjects of countries which formed part of the Tsarist Russian Empire, 'who are subject to Persian law. (fl) Far*. Ears is divided for administrative purposes into a number of Governments, Deputy Governments and districts (huluks). Next cotne towns and districts under the rule of Deputy Gov- erners ; such are Abadeh-i-Iqlld, Darab, Eiruzabad, Jahruni, Kazarun, Qunquri (and Eavanit) and ShuSz (under a Eeg- lerbegij. Lastly some d stncts (or comm only recognized asad- ministiative units but as a rule unprovided with any definite ly responsible local authorities. A few of these on tlis coast, such as Dashti, Daud, Angali, and Chahkutah have powerful local Khans, who can control the whole district in which they reside but such men will seldom be found inland, as theexistonce of powerful nomivd tribea makes local autonomy impossible.141 The following maritime districts are under the control of the Governor-General of the Gulf Ports Lingeh and District. Bandar Abbas and Biaban District. Jask. Charbar. ) r The remaining districts of the coastal region, DalTki, Borazjun and Tangistan are usually known as the Government of Dashti and Dashtistan subordinate to the Governor-General of Fars. Administration amongst the tribes is carried out by the ruler or supreme chief of the whole tribe who is called the Ilkhdni with whom rests the responsibility of the policy of the tribe also. The llkhani as a rule deputises one of his relatives to act for him in the collection of revenue and the management of the internal affairs of the tribe, and this person is known as the llhegi. . In addition to this every branch of the tribe has its own headman who is called the Kaldntar and is appointed by the llkhani and llbegi, being subject to none save the rulers of the tribe, and he is responsible for the internal management of his own tireh or branch of the tribe. The appointment of the Chief of the Khamseh tribes is here ditary (subject to the approval of the Persian Government) in the Qawami family. Immediately under the Qawam is the Pishkar-eh-Arab, appointed by the Qawam himself and in authority over all the Arab tribes. The llkhani of the Qashqais is appointed by the Central Government and is responsible to them for the collection and payment of the revenue. Both he and the Ilbegl must be of direct descent from the Shahilu elan. (.6) Yazd f ,y. • ', u The province of Yazd is administered by a Governor with his headquarters m the town of Yazd.

The district of Lingeh which geographically forms part of Laris- tan is subject to the Governor of the Gulf Ports, who is represent ed there by a Deputy-Governor. Miscellaneous. Coinage. The unit of money in Persia is the krdn, a silver coin, the value of whioh varies with the price of silver. At the rresent time, (March 1921), 370 krdns are the equivalent of Rs. 100. The coinage consists of Copper .. PaZ=:in size to Indian pice] Used only SKahl—in size to half an[ in Kho- anna. J rasan. Nickel .. 1 Shdhi~-£o krdn ] Not accepted in 2 8hdhl~^ 6 krdn [ Khorasan.

A gold iomdn has a value of 22 krdns. A toman in silver is worth 10 krdns. Accounts are sometimes reckoned in dinar, an imaginary coin, the ten thousandth part of a toman of 10 krdns. A krdn therefore = 1,000 dinars ; one shdht == 50 dinars. » t! ill i v Iit • ' S&lt;&gt; • ■ i /-('l The favourite coin is the silver 2 krdn piece, often called a gudgdrl by Afghans and Baluchis, this being their pronuncia tion of Qajdri, a name given on account of the image of the Shah on the coin. The Imperial Bank of Persia issues notes which are current in all towns of Persia, though a discount is generally charged, if out of the circle in which issued. Branches in this area are at Bushire, Shiraz and Yazd.m \ v_.. 143 ♦ Weights and measuies differ in almost every province and Weights, town.

Provisions are bought and sold by the man and of these there are several in use. In the accounts of the Central Government the so-called Tabriz man and its double the shdh-man only are employed. A kharvar of Tabriz! mans equals 649 pounds or * 8 Indian maunds. A Bandar Abbas man = 9 lb. A Lingeh man ' = gf lb. A Bushire man = 7 • 75 lb. A Shiraz man = 7 • 36 lb. In actual practice there is an extraordinary variation in the weights at different places. There are two main standards of weight, one for retail work and the other for wholesale. The for mer is used by all grocers, fishmongers and greengrocers and is generally 7} lbs. to the man, i .e., the Bushire or Sh raz man This is a fairly constant weight. The wholesale weight is the Hashimi man, which is used for large purchases of grain fodder firewood, vegetables, etc. It is the habit when purchasing in the districts to buy without weighing; the grain is in a godown or in a heap on the ground, and the buyer makes an estimate of the quantity and bids for it.. This is followed by extensive haggling. The Hashimi man is very elastic, ranging from 124 to 250 lbs. It is a difficult weight to deal with, as in Bushire for instance it will vary from 124 to 140 lbs. according to the article being purchased, and also according to whether the season has been favourable or the reverse. The chief articles affected by the seasonal changes are grain and fodder. Wood is always bought and sold at 140 lbs. to the man. Vegetables in bulk are/ 144 Liquids.

Forage is sold by the kharvar. Liquids are weighed, not measured. The unit of linear measure is the zar, or gaz, and of this standard there are also several, the most common bei ng the socalled Tabriz one equalling 40'95 inches. The farsakh is the distance an animal loaded with baggage can traverse in an hour. Jkfi i!$h&gt; naI NOTE. Military Reports are intended for the use of officers in tlie field only and it is proposed to reduce their bulk very considerably, everything being omitted which has not a direct military value to those operating in the field. This volume of the new series of Military Reports of Persia has been written up here from material available, much of which is defective and out of date* It is hoped, however, that it will afford a useful basis for working on and give a clear idea of the scope of the information required. All officers to whom a copy is issued are asked to co-operate in the preparation of a further edition of this publication.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000884.0x0001a1_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/20/C201/2</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000884.0x0001a1</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/20/C201/2</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘Military report on Persia.
