From the second, it appears that while the tribal basis of the frontier settlement of 1922 between Iraq and Nejd was emphasised by the Treaty of Mohammerah it had apparently always been contemplated that that Treaty should be succeeded by some instrument giving a full geographical definition of the frontier line 3.

Air Ministry, W.G. 2. Sir, I am commanded ty tiie Air council to refer to Foreign Office letter E.6928/2429/25 of the 3rd December forwarding the draft of a despatch to His Majesty's Minister at Jedda, instructing him to explore with the Saudi Government the possibility of a general settlement of the major questions outstanding between that Government and His Majesty's Govt. 2. The Air Council have no comments to offer on the draft instructions, but in connection with the most important point at issue, namely the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, they desire to take this opportunity of inviting the attention of the Secretary of state for Foreign Affairs to the view expressed by the Air Ministry representative on the Standing Official Sub-Committee for questions concerni^ the Middle East at their 33rd and 37th meetings, regarding the difficulty of defending the Sheikhdom of Qatar if the frontier of Saudi Arabia were advanced any further east than the “Blue Line'. If, in fact, the Saudi Arabian r ?MA _ 1 frontier is aligned as suggested byiMr. Laithwaitel in his letter of the 7th November 1934, it seems likely to lie within 5 - 10 miles of the frontier of Qatar; and unless aircraft are allowed to cross the frontier in pursuit of any raiders who may carry out 'tip-and-run” raids, the prob lem of defence would be rendered more difficult. 3. It is felt that at this stage of the negotiations with the Saudi Government the point is of relatively minor importance, but the Council are of opinion that it is one that should be borne in mind should the question of giving protection to the Sheikh of Qatar arise in the future.

I was therefore much interested to learn from Dickson, (when I stopped at Kuwait for a few days on my way out), that at the Ojair Conference in 1922, when Cox met Ibn Saud for the purpose of settling the Kejd-’Iraq frontier, at which Dickson also was present, Ibn Saud fought very hard for a tribal boundary between the two States. It was not found possible to arrange this, but conditions as between the territories of tne small Trucial Coast Shaikhs and Saudi-Arabxa are very different to those existing between Saudi-Arabia and •Iraq, and the fact that Ibn Saud was then in favour of a tribal boundary argues that he would welcome the idea now, provided that after further investigation we can put this proposal forward to him as suiting us. 3 . Dickson is of course an expert on Arab tribal affairs and I enclose three extracts from an interesting report / J.G.Laithwaite Esquire, . The India Office, London©1 ^ - 2 - report. wliich I asked him ‘to make lor me* Extract A shows Ibn Saud’s general ideas in 1922 on the subject of tribal boundaries, and presumably they would be much the same now * Extract B mentions briefly a small and successful experiment in tribal boundaries which Dickson himself carried out in f Iraq, and which is a good augury for its trial else where • Extract C gives Dickson’s ideas as to the fixing of tribal boundaries between Ibn Saud and the Trucial Coast territories. I am sending copies of this letter with enclosure to Metcalfe^ and Calvert at Jedda* Perhaps the Foreign Office would be good enough to let Byan have a copy. ■ J - cA Extract from Note by Lieutenant Colonel H.H.P* Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, on Ibn Saud*s attitude at the “G^air' meeting with Sir Percy Cox in November 1922 with special regard to the question of what he considered the best form of boundary between ‘Iraq and Nejd. ***** At the Oqair Conference in question which was attended by Ibn Baud, Sir Percy Cox, the Minister of Public Works (for ‘Iraq) and Abdul Latif Pasha al Mendil of oasra (un-official Adviser to Ibn Saud), I distinctly recollect that Ibn Saud started off by insisting that the Dhafir, an ‘Iraq tribe of Bedouin, was his and that it was necessary for his boundary to extend right up to the Euphrates not because he wished to control that river, but because the Dhafir as well as his big bedouin tribes actually movea up annually to the Euphrates and would never be denied right of access, which was a question of life and death xor the desertman. When it was pointed out by Sir Percj Cox that this claim was a ridiculous one and could not be dis cussed, Ibn Saud gave in over the Dhafir tribe and adopted the more reasonable line that to safeguard the rights Oi. his own tribes and prevent future trouble there should be a tribal boundary described as above and by the system of wells and grazing grounds owned by each tribe. This, he said, would be easy as everyone was aware of these, and each tribe from the days of Abraham knew exactly which were its wells and grazing- grounds and which were not. That is to say he advocated for instance that the southern most wells claimed by the Anaze, Dhafir and Kuwait tribes (excluding Mutair, Awazim and Ajman which he claimea) should form the boundary, while any wells known to be r* rvrnmnTi /- 2 - conuaon property tsuch existed 'oetween Anaze and Dhaiirj ar.d between Dhafir and Kutair tribes) were to be declared neutral. When asked how the claims to these wells were to be proved Ibn Saud retorted that the Desert world knew them as clearly as the light of day, and moreover tribal 'Wosems' or marks, existed on the inner walls of almost all of them, and in the unlikely event of a dispute arising in the matter the 'Ahl el Khibra' or wise men with knowledge, could put the matter right. In any case Ibn Saud maintained the right of Nejd tribes to go up to the Euphrates to make their annual purchases* *****#: B I myself had bitter experience as Political Officer, Muntafik, of the futility of the old Turkish, arbitrary boundaries between LlWaS and only found relief from inter-Liwa tribal fighting when at my suggestion Sir Percy Cox concurred in my introducing' tribal boundaries.c Extract from Note by Lieutenant Colonel H.R.P.Dickson, Political Agent, Kuwait, on Ibn Baud's attitude at the ’’Oqair' meeting with Sir Percy Cox in November 1922 with special regard to the question of what he considered the best form of boundary between 'Iraq and Nejd. ***** As regards the question of fixing some sort of a boundary between Ibn. Saud and the Trucial Coast tribes, resulting from the new Blue Line policy: If I may say so, I consider the only sensible way to settle such problem would be to have a tribal boundary. As a preliminary, the Murra tribe must be acknowledged to be Ibn Baud's, and he must be asked what other tribes he claims in the hinterland. The Trucial Coast tribes, I believe, are those making up the 3ani Yas and Jowassim confederations. They include the various trucial coast towns and hamlets right up to Qatar. Ibn Baud must be told in any agreement come to, something in the following lines: I He must respect the tribal wells and grazing zones in the interior used from time immemorial by the Trucial Coast tribes and tneir Shaikhs. Both his and the Trucial Coast tribes may pass into each other's territories in search of grazing when necessary, without let or hindrance. Saudi tribes should at all times have the right to 'Musabilah' to the coast towns (i.e.buy their provisions there), and neither he nor the Trucial Coast Chiefs must prevent such operations unless carried out in a non-friendly and non-peaceful manner. The tribes of either Saudi Arabia or of the Trucial Coast /- 2 - Coast if grazing in each other’s country to he liable to pay Zikat to either Ibn Saud or the Trucial Coast Shaikhs as the case may be. Some clauses should also be inserted to ensure that Ibn Saud did not order his big tribes to settle permanently in Trucial Coast territory, simply by way of bullying, though if left to themselves they will of course give no trouble. It is an axiom that Mejd tribes will never voluntarily want to hurt coastal towns or their tribes anywhere in Arabia, as they draw supplies from them, and do not want their ikusabila stopped. Any trouble will always be caused by the hinterland ruler who can bring pressure, in this case Ibn Saud. * *:£* **It is requested that in any further communi cation on this subject the under-mentioned letter and number may be quoted, and the reply addressed to — The Under Secretary of State for India, Political Department, India Office, London, S.TF. 1. p.

He regrets that, in these circumstances, he is unable to concur in the terms of paragraphs 4 and 5 of the draft despatch to the Minister at Jeuda in its present form and he directs me to suggest for the consideration of the secretary of itate for Foreign Affairs that the third sentence of paragraph 4 and the whole of paragraphs 5 and 6 should be omitted and that the following should be substituted. •This subject was discussed at a meeting of the Official Middle East sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence on 8th November, at which you were yourself present, and you will be familiar with the general position at the present stage in regard to it.

The State Demirt lent would be glad of any Information as to whether this were the case* 2. I explained to Mr. Millard that the position was still as it had been described to the United States Government last summer (see K 2481 and N 4327), and as I had myself explained it to Mr 0 Loomis on the 20th July (S 4784/2369/91). The boundary line agreed upon with the Ottoman Government in 1913 and 1 14 was still Internationally legally valid 8 since Saudi Arabia was one of the Succession States of the Ottoman established by a new and formal agreement. We had made the position perfectly clear to Ibn Sand and to the United States Government, and ao this position was the legal position m International Law it was unnecessary that Ihn Saud should formally recognise it. In point of fact Ihn Saud had raised certain objections to our attitude, as he maintained that he had authority over certain tribes extending to the east of the blue and violet lines. But this did not affect the legal position.3. I asked ’'r. imiard whether this enquiry was concerned with the Saudi concession to the Standard Oil Company of California, He replied that it was, as it might affect the Company if there were any question of moving the eastern frontier of Ibn Baud's dominions a few miles to the east or the west. I repeated that I had explained the position quite clearly to !/r.

(Paner Ho 0 LhEo ( 0 ) 159) c THE CHAIRMAN said that the meeting was being held to discuss with Sir Andrew Ryan* prior to his return to Jedda 5 the general question of relations with I bn Baud. The main question to decide was whetner the proxjosal xoi a general settlement of outstanding questions should be pursued or not. MR. RENDER recalled that the suggestion for a new general comprehensive settlement witn Ibn Sand nad originally been put forward mainly as a result of the difficulties which had developed over the question of the 'Blu ' Line'. It was clear that we should have to make some concession to Xhn Saud in this area, &amp;nd j-x concession was not to he represented as a surrender it was desirable that it should be brought into some kind of general settlement. Moreover the concession could then •n n pr , -j- n o©cure a favourable settlement of be used as a lever wo ^eoai o a. xc, . , .. ^ _ u. + ..,r&gt;o oa thp vnweit blockade, such other outstanding mauters a.o ^ne -ewtx ^ r»rNm-nTpiip'Hsi ve settlement was buillj The proposal lor a Gompreneueivc however, only tentative, and it was only on a purely x i 4 . 4 +. y.,- a nppn discussed with tentative and informal basis thu. i- Cu.a Puad Bey Kamza during his visit to England in September. The intention had been to work out something much more a . f,r 4 i &lt;-• + pt-s * but e owing to definite before submission to .nin-oi ■ -, , i this ti' d not yet been possible, so xh^x various delays 9 tms nmn j qppretary of State for Foreign formal approval of the oo^reiai.y + -h-p™' obtained. The delay had been Affairs had not yet been obt^inc .-3- mainly due to the diiticulty of 1 obtaining any indication or Ibn baud’s desiderata regarding the n Blue Tine 5 ’. puad cey Hamza had oeen asked to state these desiderata* but had been unable to do so. Eventually the Saudi Minister had* on the instructions of his Government* made a statement regarding Ibn baud’s claims. Although it had been extremely vague* it snowed that Ibn Saud was putting his demands very high; and indeed he appeared to be claiming the greater part oi south-eastern Arabia. It was for consideration whether* m vicv.- of the extent of these claims* the idea of a general settlement based on a compromise in regard to the ’’Blue Line” could be pursued with any real hope of success. The present meeting had been called firstly in order triat the Foreign Office representatives might report what had passedwith particular reference to conclusion (a) of the Sub-Committee’s meeting of 13th September* and secondly owing to the desirability of reaching some conclusion on the general question of principle prior to Sir A* Ryan’s impending departure for Jedda on 23rd November. It was very desirable that Sir A. Ryan should be furnished with some preliminary general instructions * and if the lines of these could be agreed on it would then be possible to submit a concrete proposal for ministerial approval. The sooner this could be done the better. As he had indicated* the question whether negotiations for a general settlement could profitably be proceeded with turned mainly on the question of' the ’’Blue Line”. It was therefore necessary in the first instance to reach some conclusion as to the policy to be followed on this point. The position now was that His Majesty's eovernment had officially taken their stand on the legal vctlidi ^y of the ■ '’Blue” and ’’Violet'’ Lines* but had indicated tiiat tney would be ready to compromise* as part of a generalsettlement. Ton Saud on the other hand had indicated in a general way that he claimed the whole of the ’’desert area”. Meanwhile s informal discussions had taken place with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf 9 while on leave 9 and with Mr. Bertram Thomas 3 the explorer of the Ruba-al-Khali desert; and these discussions 9 as shown in the papers which had been circulated^ threw a somewhat new light on the problem. In these circumstances the various courses open to His Majesty's Government might perhaps be summarised as follows:- (1) To take our stand firmly on the ’’Blue” and ’’Violet” Lines 3 and to refuse to offer any compromise or to recognise I bn Saud as possessing any rights to the east and south of these lines. It was clear that this would only result In a major quarrel with Ibn Saud over a matter where we were* incidentally 5 by no means sure of our ground. In these circumstances this course could presumably be ruled out au once. (2) To try to reach a settlement by offering a territorial compromise to the east of the ,v Blue and Jio±e u Lines. This was the course originally contemplated at the time of the meeting of September loth; t-Ub in view of the con siderations to which Mr. Thomas, in particular, had drawn attention, it seemed open to very serious objections and now seemed unlikely to prove feasible in pr^cblc^ ( 3 ) T o admit Ibn Sand’s full territorial claims. This would be open to many objections. It w°—d crystallise a territorial situation v/hi^n it mi^hu cult and undesirable to maintain indefinitely should the _ ^ + Ar&gt;pbia or the allegis 1106 balance of power in south-eastern Arabia 01 4 - -1 r&gt;I- nnp'P • and it would in any case of the tribes eventually cnang ?X -5- ■9 still involve the difficulty of fixing rigid territorial limits in the shifting sands of the desert. (4) To leave matters as far as possible as they are, without seeking further to define or clarify the situation. The objections to this were that, unless something were done to fix a limit to Ibn Saud f s authority, he was likely steadily to extend that authority, and might well eventually succeed in establishing it on the coast itself, which might bring him into conflict with our Arab proteges and would be open to the gravest political objections. It was in fact most important that something should be done without delay to fix a limit for Ibn baud’s sphere of expansion to the east and south and particularly towards the sea. Moreover to leave matters as they were might lead to serious difficulties over the grant of concessions, etc. , and probably over the precise extent of the Standard Oil of California’s existing concession in Hasa. (5) To fix an inland limit (it was later suggested that this might run parallel to the coast 100 miles xrom the coast on the north and 000 on the east and south) for the territory to he regarded as falling under the full territorial sovereignty of our Arab proteges, and to create a kearn &lt;al belt” nn the inland side of it. Much would depend here on the character of the neutral belt, but generally speaking there were serious ocjections to the creation of any kind of unregulated vacuum, uuile neutral zone, as at Koweit, subject to joint, ana often conflicting, sovereignty, was open to eeen more objections. (6) The creation of a special 'desert area', subject to a special desert rlgime, within a kind of 'ring fence' as tentatively suggested in the paper which had already been circulated as M.E.(O) 162.Briefly this last suggestion was that a special f, desert zone 1 ' should he created* within which I'bn Baud should he able to maintain his present loose overlordship over the tribes* hut in respect of which the various parties concerned should* hy a kind of mutual self-denying ordinance renounce certain rights or claims* particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the grant of concessions* the establishment of permanent fortifications* etc. It would he an area rather like a maritime zone* where rights would he personal and not territorial* and, to continue the analogy, where the tribes could he regarded, so to speak, as flotillas, flying a particular flag, hut free to change their allegiance if they eventually wished to do so, and possessing no territorial ties. Meanwhile, in his conversations with kuad Bey Hamza, he had taken the line that His Majesty’s Government would only he prepared to modify their attitude of rigid adherence to the legal boundaries set up hy the AngiO' Turkish Conventions, as part of a general comprehensive settlement, in which they should obtain satisfaction in other directions; and he did not think, therefore, that these conversations had necessarily committed his Majesty s Government to making a concession, or to negotianting a general settlement, although it was clear that a concession would have to be made if a major quarrel was to be avoided. MR. LAITEwAITE pointed out that the further informa tion which the political Resident in the Persian Muir had been asked to collect was not yet available. Until it was available and had been considered, the Secretary of State for India felt unable to reach any decision as between the various possible methods of dealing wlth the 'Blue Line' question. He agreed, however, that there was no objection to a discussion of a provisional character in general terms at this stage on the information\ v X -7— present avail aisle* ViHnlle agreeing as to the ohiection to a solution on the 'basis, ol tne creation of a Neutral Zone 5 he said that he did not think that sou-e variant of this solution ought to he completely ruled out of court at the present stage. If there were to he any chance of persuading ibn Saud to agree to a Neutral Zone^ say 5 50 miles from East to 'west running from the base of the Qatar peninsula to the 20th parallel of latitude ? it would be well worth our while to face the inconvenience involved on the assumption that Ibn Saud would have no rights to the hast of such a zone. Speaking personally, however 5 he was much attracted by the solution suggested in Mr. Hendel's letter of 7th November which was based on previous discussion with the India Office. Clearly the details would need closer consideration 3 and the situation might be affected by the information awaited from Bushire s but prima faci e it had much to commend it. In particular ? it would ease the position as regards applications to develop oil in the Trucial States. Our present policy was to Sberilise those States from the oil point of view* but it might De impossible to maintain that attitude. If * however 9 we could secure the adoption of the ring fence solation o± tue boundary problem and the ring fence was sufficiently deep, it would be possible for us to agree to the grant ox a concession^ for example, in Abu Dhabi* to cover half or three-quarters of the distance between the coast and tne southern border of the ring fence. As in the case of Qatar * we might offer the Sheikh protection within the area of the concession in return for his giving iu to a company designated or approved by us, while between the southern border of the concession and the border of the ring fence the Air Ministry would have the room to deal with raiders s etc. , to which they attached so much importanceSIR ANDREW RYAN said that he still considered that a reasonably generous territorial concession to Ibn Baud on the question of the 'Blue Line' was the sole means by which we ^ could obtain a general settlement. He fully appreciated the difficulty of defining a boundary in a desert area inhabited only by wandering tribes. He pointed out 9 however, that in every previous similar case (e.g. Iraq and Transjordan) it had been found necessary to define some geographical limit in desert areas and the results had on the whole not been un satisfactory. Ibn Sand was less impressed by legal considerations than by fear of H.M. Government and anxiety lest they should use their power to compel him to accept the 'Blue Line'. He was perturbed at the British attitude, although he was sincere in his conviction that he was not legally bound by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions, and would not accept the contention that the frontiers laid down in them were valid. Sir Andrew Ryan considered that he might with some hope of success suggest to the Saudi Government, on his return to Jedda, some settlement on the lines suggested by Mr. Rendel, i.e. a loose system of control by Ibn Saud over the desert area, subject to the qualification, however, that, in his (Sir A. Ryan’s) opinion Ibn Saud would never entertain the suggestion that no concessions should be given in this area for twenty years. On the other hand, he thought that Ibn Saud might be induced to undertake not to grant a concession, in the inter mediate area between territory under his sole control and the coastal principalities, except to a group approved by both the British and Saudi Governments, a group for instance in which the participants approved by them should nave an equal interest. Sir A. Ryan took the opportunity of observing that he had felt greatly handicapped in his previous discussions with -8-Fuad Bey Hamza by his inability to refer to the question of oil 9 unless Fuad Bey should himself bring this question up 9 which he had never done. He would like* if only speaking for himself in the first instance, to be able to tell Fuad Bey frankly that the question of oil was influencing every question in east Arabia, and to try to elicit information as to the existing commitments of the Saudi Government, notably as regards the territorial scope, on the eastern side, of the concession they had given to the Standard Oil Company of California. He was convinced that this would be the best means of elucidating the situation and exploring the possibility of some agreed settlement. WING COMvANDER PIRIE pointed out that if the boundaries proposed by Mr. Rendel in Paper No.M.E.(O) 162 were accepted, the territory of Ibn Baud at the Dohat-es-Salv/a would be brought very close to Qatar and the task of protection at this important point would be rendered very difficult. It would be an advantage, therefore, if the original {, Blue Line” could be adhered to at this point. MR. RENDEL recognised the drawbacks of any arrangement which would bring Ibn Saud f s frontier so close to the base of the Qatar peninsula as the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa. It would of course have been most satisfactory if the proposed special desert area could have been extended in some way up to the Gulf of Bahrein, so as to keep the territory under Ibn Gaud’s full territorial sovereignty further away from the so- called Qatar f, protection line”. Unfortunately, it was at this northern end of the ”Blue Line” that Ibn Gaud had the strongest claim to a re-adjustment of the boundaries, since several Akhwan settlements already existed near the head of the Dohat- es-Salwa. Mr. Rendel felt sure therefore that unless we agreed to recognise Ibn Gaud’s full territorial sovereignty as extending in this area at least up to the head of the Dohat-eo- Salwa it would wreck any hope of a settlement of the major question regarding the limits of the ”desert area” in the hinterland. nMR, SEaL thought that the main justification for the intervention of H,M, Government in the affairs of the desert tribes (as distinct from those inhabiting the coastal area) v/as the possibility of mineral v/ealth ? and in particular, oil, being found in the desert area. He agreed with Mr 0 Rendel that it was important to prevent the political influence of Ibn Saud from expanding over the Trucial etc, tribes under our protection; but he pointed out thrt the desert refgime suggested by Mr, Rendel would allow Ibn Saud f s political influence over the tribesto expand unchecked in the hinterland towards the maritime tribes so long as his prestige remained the paramount factor in Arab politics, Mr, Rendel ? s scheme would have the additional disadvantage of sterilising mineral development for perhaps a lengthy period. If the territorial sovereignty of this desert area passed to Ibn Saud, a difficult question of protection would arise if oil etc. were ever exploited, in view of the wild character of the desert tribes. He agreed that at the present time H.M, Government had no rights over the inland areas not claimed by their Arab clients, but then neither had Ibn Saud, and the status of this territory was, in fact, that of }, res mullius''. It would, therefore, be open for H.M. Government to acquire the right to have a voice in the disposal of these concessions in agreement with Ibn Saud, who was the only other possible claimant. He, therefore, welcomed the suggestion that had been put forward by Sir Andrew Ryan that oil and other mineral concessions in this area should be a matter for settlement jointly between H.M, Government and Ibn Saud, although he deprecated the suggestion that the ultimate sovereignty in the area should vest in Ibn Saud, in view of the difficulty this would involve over protection.COLONEL MACKESY thought that the two fundamental factors were (a) to exclude Ihn Saud from obtaining a footing on the coast line, and (b) to make sure that any potential mineral or oil wealth should not fall into foreign hands. If such were found it would hardly be possible to prevent exploitation. Unless some definite boundary were laid down now we should only be laying up a store of trouble in the future. He suggested thrt an outer hard and fast boundary line, say, some 100 miles from the coast, should be fixed, Avhile an inner boundary, i&lt;,e,, the strip along the coast, only would be administered. This was similar to the system followed on the North Nest frontier of India, where the outer, or ^Durand 5 ' line, was the actual boundary, while the inner, or 'administrative &gt;f boundary formed the limit of effective control, MR. LAITHWAITE said that if the proposed 'desert area' could be sterilised so far as concessions were concerned, it would greatly ease matters, otherwise a difficult question would arise. It could not be overlooked that His Majesty’s Government had no rights of their own in Central Arabia and consequently could have no right to grant any concessions. Any claim to mineral rights in these regions could be made by them only on behalf of the Sultan of Muscat or the Trucial Sheikhs. But neither the Sultan nor the Trucial Sheikhs had, he thought, any extensive territorial claims in the hinterland. SIR ANDREW RYAN said that his suggestion did not contemplate the creation of any dual right on the part of Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government to grant concessions, but would be merely an agreement by Ibn Saud not to grant concessions except to parties in which British interests were adequately represented. He recognised that this would involve a special limitation of Ibn Saud’s sovereign rights in this area, but he thought this might possibly be secured. -11--12- He strongly shared the view that it was necessary to ensure that the territories of the coastal Sheikhs and the Sultan of Muscat were contiguous along the coast line, i.e* that Ihn' Baud should not extend his authority to the coast* If this were secured he did not consider, subject to oil considerations, in which he had meant to include economic concessions generally, that an admission of Ihn Baud’s sovereignty up to the confines of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman, would adversely affect the interests of HoMo Government 0 Some use might he made of the fact that Fuad Hamza, in a hook published by him in 1932, had given a map showing a dotted line running generally southward for about 150 miles from Pchat-es-Salwa and ending indeterminately in the desert. This might be invoked as an indication of what Ibn Saud considered the limits of his area to be. MR. RENDER thought that it would be most satisfactory if some arrangement could be reached with Ibn Saud by which he should agree not to give any concessions in the ’’desert area 1 ’ without the consent of His Majesty's Government. It would not be possible for His Majesty’s Government to claim rights in respect of concessions in the desert area as representatives of the Trucial Sheikhs, since the territorial rights of these Sheikhs could not possibly be regarded as extending so far inland; but His Majesxy s Government could no doubt take the line with Ibn Solid that, ■ 'they were ultimately responsible for — or at least most intimately concerned with - the coastal area from Bahrein eastwards and southwards to Aden, it was reasonable that they should claim to be consulted over the grant of concessions in the interior, since, if concessions were granted to foreigners in that t.rea, the interests of the coastal belt would certainly be effected, if only owing to the fact that anyone operating a concession in the desert area could only approach the site of the concession through the coastal belt. On the other hand, the grant of concessions would be definitely an act of territorial sovereignty, and might enable Ibn Saud to establish much more permanent and effective rights in the desert area than had been contemplated in the suggestion( 0 ) 162 The desert area was so put forward in (0) 162. The desert area was so inaccessible and so barren that it did not seem a very likely place for the development of concessions in the near future. But the possibility of its proving a rich area at some more distant date could not be excluded* It was not only a question of oil ? but of possible other minerals. There had been suggestions that there mighu be Bold m some part of the area 9 and some other important natural wealth might be discovered. Again if foreign enterprises were to seek to develop the area &gt; they might well 5 as m the case of the desert crossed by the new Iraqi pipeline 5 he able to bore deep wells which would produce enough water to enable irrigation to be carried out ? thus changing the whole character of the country. In these circumstances he felt that it was most important that any settlement should be subject to revision in not more than 20 years time, an that every effort should he made to prevent the premature crystallisation of territorial area. If, however, Ihn Saud insisted on the right to grant concessions, he agreed that it ',ouid he essential that his Majesty's Government should have a say in the matter* , 'i whv it was that He could not for the moment recolxec, ~ j r -a + n r eter to oil in his Sir A* By an had been instructed not no . „ 4 - tj c. t.housht that conversations tilth the Saudi Government - - + -vt nr e r v on e 9 and t ha t t h er e the reason probably was a temso. ^ J - &gt; be no objection to . nof.renoe to oil being mc»» no,, it tin A. w thought 1, Oeeirebl..

RAH SJO'RDM RQhTIBR. CPU ChU SI Oh . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - That in the light of the discussion and on the information at present ^available they were impressed by the possibility of a settlement on the broad general lines suggested in Mr. Rendel’s letter ^to Mr. Laithwaite, circulated as Paper ho. M.E.vO) 162 5 on the understanding that the special regime would be one oi renunciation or limitation and not of administration r, and subject to a satisfactory disposal of tne. question of concessions in the desert g.i ea. The question was raised whether it would be necessary, in order to improve the hope of Ibn Saud’s aoceotance of a settlement on the lines in question, to recognise him as sovereign in the desert zone, though subjec to servitudes, but this question was reserved. Tn there circumstances they recommend mat the orooosal be more closely examined with a view to a conclusion being reached, once tne information awaited by the Policital Residen , has been received and has been considered. THE CHAIRMAi! thought that further information wuo necessary before a decision could be reached. A survey was being conducted in the neighbourhood ol x oinu ^ a report might be expected in December. MR. BLALTER observed that two new points of xmoortance emerged from the Acting High Commissioner’s despatch of the 26th October. The first was tne proposal that boundary in the north-east should commence at the^ , . ~ irer i&amp;ian 39° east and parallel 32 north intersection of mei. luian oa and not from the summit of the Jeoei Anaiza, ®nd second the suggestion that the line ix, Should be some ten miles further eastward. It seemed Impossible, however, to proceed further with the consideration of the best method of dealing with the frontier question until the result of the further survey was known. -14-MR* REMDBL agreed that further information was re quired before a conclusion could be reached on the question whether or not to try to include this question in a com prehensive settlement. On the other hand, it must be borne in mind that the Saudis had recently become much more vigilant on the Transjordan frontier, and that it might not therefore be possible to postpone a consideration of this question much longer. The question of the Transjordan frontier, however, was not likely to prove a decisive factor in reaching a decision whether to aim at a gene-i.6.1 settlement or not. Important as it was in itself, it was definitely secondary to such questions as that of the 'Blue Line' and that of the koweit blockade, which were the main factors to be considered in discussing the possibility of comprehensive settlement. As regards the possible readjustment of the fiontier which had been referred to, he felt that, while it might be possible to clear up various difficulties on this frontier by a re-interpretation of the Hadda Agreement, it would be quite out of the question to obtain from Ibn Saud any actual territorial concession, however smaxl, involving a modification of the Eadda frontier, except possibly in return for some important territorial con cession elsewhere. TEE CHAIRMAN observed that the Transjordan Government could not well claim that the latitude and longitude should be accepted as defining the frontier in one place, i.e., at the north eastern point, whereas at point L they wished to stake their claim on physical features and not on the latitude and longitude fi^ed for that point. CONCLUSION* THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - that the question of the Saud i-Transjordan frontier should be deferred for the present and discussed on receipt of fui'ther -1 vV-f'/'\T»msa'h i on .-16- fEIT )CKADE. MR. LAITiRVAITiS said that the correspondence which had been circulated to the Committee showed the present | a position. Nothing could be done until the Sheikh dropped his claims against Ibn Sand. Unfortunately some further delay was likely before we could take this matter up with the Sheikh. The political Resident had been given a discretion as to the moment at which to approach the Sheikh. MR. REN DEL said that, until the question of a com prehensive settlement had been raised in connection with the discussion of the problem of the ’’Blue Line”, the Foreign Office had always contemplated that the ivoweit blockade question should be dealt with as a separate issue, as in the previous somewhat analogous cases of Saudi-Iraqi and Saudi-Transjordan relations. It had oeun thought that any important concession in regard to the 'Blue Line” might have rendered a settlement of the noweit blockade question a good deal easier. But if we were now to make our concession to Ibn baud over the Blue ^ine subject to a number of unpalatable conditions and provisos, he would probably cease to regard it as a concession, and it would no longer furnish a lever for negotiating a settlement of the Koweit blockade. In that case it would presumably be necessary to revert to the idea of dealing with the Noweit blockade separately. DEBT TO HIS SIR AlbDR'EW RYAH, in reply to the Chairman, said he uid POVERIMEHT . not consider that the prospect of a general settlement ^ould be improved by an offer at this stage to drop His Government's claims against the Saudi Government, amounting-17- ESTION CP E ii!R AL TTLEMENT. to some £o.j 0 ♦ Oii the other hand he could not conceive that i-L ^ general settlement of o the a Questions were in sight $ it should be imperilled by insistence on the payment of these claims as pax*u of it. His view was that tne claims should be kept alive for the time being, without necessarily being press ed too insistently unless conditions v/ere more propitious than they had been since the last strenuous effort to effect a settlement of the claims, made, by His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires towards the end of 1933. A waiver of the claims img* perhaps be contemplated at a later stage, e.g. in the form which Sir A. Ryan had tentatively suggested some little time ago, i.e. by setting the claims off against the rental which Ibn Baud had asked for the grant of facilities for aircraft, including the provision of landing grounds. MR. BRIDGES said that if it should appear that there was no prospect of obtaining repayment of this debt, it would probably be preferable that it should be offset against some concession rather than written off without any corresponding gain. Having surveyed the various outstanding issues, the Sub-Committee reverted to the Question whether tney should recommend that His Majesty’s Government shodid continue to aim at a general comprehensive settlement oi all outstanding questions or aim at taking the varioas questions in isolation. MR. REHDEL said that when the proposal for a general settlement had at first been made, it was conuemp-^ted tna His Majesty’s Government would be in a position to ma&amp;e a conspicuous concession to I bn Saad on ti.ie 'jUGotion of ’’Blue Line”, and that there would be less risk oi this\ concession proving damaging to our prestige, and more- advantage to be gained from it as a lever for obtaining counter concessions from I bn Gaud in return - particularly in regard to the Koweit blockade - if it were to be included in a new general comprehensive settlement oi ull cuustaxiding questions. But the position had now somewhat changed. Iu seemed clear from the course of the discussion that His Majesty 9 s Government would not now be able to offer Ion Sa ud any spectacular concession over the question of the 'Blue Line'' e On the contrary it was now most douctful whether it would be possible to persuade Ibn Baud to accept any kind of settlement on the terms now contemplated, since, although we should be leaving him a pretty free hand over a very large area to the east and south of the ''Blue' and 'Violet' lines, we should be making this concession subject to conditions and limitations of his authority, which it would be very difficult and perhaps impossible to get him to swallow. he should be lucky if we got Ibn Baud to accept anything approximating to our oresent ^loposa' , end it would consequently almost certainly be impossible to represent those proposals as a real concession for i mvi-i q W nuld mean thal one bargaining purposes elsewneic. • -vs -t* q n’F.n oral set tlenient of our main arguments for aiiTU &amp; would be undermined, and it migm, tnnxefoxe should do better to take each cyestion in isolation.. p ^nn rse» general objections, Moreover, there were T ox y. -p had recently drawn dt t cnt i on to which Sir John Dirnon himseli ro^-tlon (The oroposed Anglo-persian Treaty;, in anotner connection - t o Tnnmber of controversial questions to attempting to pool a ..umber o - particularly in the East, into a portmanteau settlement P s : l1 i !-19- buoh a method oiten ended in enabling our adversaries to play off one Question against another and to obtain promises 01 concessions from which we could not subsequently recede. Fuad Hamza himself had given us an opportunity of escaping from the proposal for a general settlement by the objections which he had raised at the second meeting on September 20th to what he had called ' marchandage ”. it must be remembered, however, that it- was I bn Baud himself who had first suggested the idea of a comprehensive settlement of outstanding difficulties, and such a settlement would still present great advantages. Apart from settling the major issues of the south-eastern frontiers, the Koweit blockade, etc.,. 5 it would clear up the position as regards the Treaty of Jedda, which was unsatisfactory, and would offer an opportunity of securing a settlement of a number of other outstanding points of minor importance. MR. LAITHWAITE said that the India Office felt that matters had. now proceeded so far and so much had been done to arouse the Saudi expectations that it could hardly fail to affect our relations sith the Saudis prejudicially if we did not pursue negotiations with them. The India Office were in these circumstances in favour of tmrsuing discussions at Jedda and the balance of advantage in the light of what had passed in the talks with Fuad seemed to lie with aiming at a general settlement. But they thought in the first place that it would be a mistake to rate the prospect of a satisfactory issue to the negotiations too nigh or to be disappointed if nothing came of them; secondly, that we should not rate the value of such a settlement to I bn Baud too low. Not only was he apparently very anxiousto secure our general support consequent on his apprehensions (for uhich there seerned to be no foundation) of a Turco- per si an combination against him ~ a lact Yvnich^ incidentally ^ might make him more reasonable in discussion - but 3 apart from that ? he seemed to appreciate a great deal better than the Persians that our goodvvill was a substantial asset to him. Mr. Laithwaite did not agree tnat the concession con templated in regard to the ’’Blue Line” would be regarded by I bn Saud as of little value. While it might not be as extensive as he would like, he would at any rate get away from the Lines of the 1913-14 Conventions and he would secure the formal recognition on our part of his position in a considerable area to the Last oi the ’’Blue Line . SIR ANDREW RYAN said that on the whole he would prefer to adhere for the present to the plan of attempting a generau settlement with the Saudi Government, or rather as he wouio prefer to put it, the simultaneous settlement of all major questions. There were several such questions, in wmen one party or the other desired satisfaction, or which they both had an interest in disposing of. Toe most important or those which Eis Majesty's Government wished to see settled was that of the Kovseit blockade, and Sir A. Hyan did not think thnt they would be able to obtain a settlement of this important matter unless they could offer Ibn Gaud some kind of con cession in some other direction. He also felt that attempt to secure a comprehensive settlement would be consonant with the general line taken m trie recent ...is cussions with the Saudi representatives during the two or three months, however non-committal tnese had been. -GO-v^\ -21- As regards the value as a lever of any possible concession to Ion baud over the Question of the south-eastern frontiers^ he felt thot the Question would turn very largely on what was done in regard to sovereignty. If His Majesty’s Government were prepared to recognise Ibn baud’s sovereignty over the whole, or the greater part, of the wide area which he claimed, to the east and south of the ’’Blue” and ’’Violet” lines, even though making their acceptance of his claims conditional on his acceptance of certain ’’servitudes” - e.g. that he should not grant concessions without the consent of His Majesty’s Government - he thought that the recognition would have such value in the eyes of Ibn Saud as to confirm the chances of obtaining a satisfactory settlement of other Questions, Ibn Baud had to consider Arab opinion, which would be greatly impressed if he could represent himself as having resisted alien pretensions in Arabia. He could represent his acceptance of ”servitudes” as necessary, provided his sovereignty were admitted. If it were not admitted, the value of the ’’Blue Line” Question as a lever would be greatly diminished. Sir A. Ryan added that Ibn Saud might be expected to boggle more over the admission of flying rights in the area than over a bargain regarding economic concessions. While thus advocating adherence for the present to the idea of a general settlement, Sir A. Ryan thought that it would be easy at a later stage, if it should seem more desirable, to switch over to the idea of the separate settlement of the various issues, since Fuad Bey Hamza himself had given us the opportunity of doing this by his remarks regarding the objections to any kind of ’’ marcharidage -’, to which Mr. Rendel had just referred. Should Fuad revert to thifi suggestion it would be possible for Sir Andrew Ryan to express readiness to deal with the various Questions separately, but to propose that in that case the question of the Koweit blockade should be taken iirst.-22- CONCLUSION, On the question 'whether or not His Majesty’s Govern ment should aim at a general settlement 5 i.e. ? the simultaneous settlement hy comprehensive agree* ment of major outstanding questions s the Sub committee recommend that His Majesty’s Government should adhere for the present to the idea of securing such a settlement ? hut that Sir Andrew Ryan should he given full discretion to revert to the idea of separate settlement of the various questions at issue should he see fit.

I also enclose a copy of a letter dated 7th Novemher from Rendel, which you will he interested to read, we have not yet oeen aole to consider it xiere ana much must clearly turn on the information which we hope to receive from the Gulf. 3 . I am sending copies of this letter ana its enclosures to ketcalfe ana Loch. Yours sincerely, J.G. LAITHWAIT. The Hon*hie Lt.Col. T,C. Fowle, G«B.E., The Residency, Bush ire.£,.V : \ * ^QU' 7 v„„' O (E 6769/279/91) L_ 9 3 4 I FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l, j 7th November, 1934. o My dear Gilbert, With reference to your letter P.Z.6810/34 of the 5th November, enclosing a note of Bertram Thomas^ views on the south-eastern Arabian frontiers question, and to our various recent conversations on the subject, I write, as arranged, to put on record the very tentative suggestion which I mentioned to you for a possible solution of this problem on new lines in the light of the further information now available. 2. The most important new feature in the situation seems to me to be the point which Thomas brought out in his talk with us on the 51st October about the extremely shifting and temporary character of tribal allegiances in this area, and the probable impermanence of any overlordship which may at any one moment be exercised over the desert tribes by whoever eepy -sent by air mail happens / '.G. Laithwai^ jje, ESSbOgURE tN* ytr-— 13 mgH334happens at the time to he the most powerful of the neighbouring Arabian rulers. If Thomas is right in stressing this point to the extent he does, it is perhaps more important than we at first thought that we should avoid tying our hands by any premature recognition of Saudi territorial sovereignty over a wide area over which it may no longer extend in practice when Ibn Saud dies and his personal prestige begins to be forgotten. Indeed it seems possible, from some of Thomas 1 s remarks recorded in the note enclosed in your letter, that Saudi influence over some of the northern tribes in the desert area may wane even before Ibn Sana's death, if Ibn Jiluwi, whose personal prestige has apparently done so much to bring these tribes within Ibn Sand's sphere, were to disappear. 3. The main object of my tentative suggestion would be to try to meet this difficulty by the creation of a special 'desert zone”, within which it would still be possible for Ibn Saud to maintain his piesent loose overlordship over the tribes, but in res ect of whi^h the/the various parties concerned should, by a kind of mutual self-denying ordinance, renounce certain rights or claims, particularly in regard to such acts of territorial sovereignty as the granting of concessions, the establishment of permanent fortifications etc. It would not be a 'neutral' zone with so-called 'equal rights', nor a mere 'no man’s land' where there would be no rights at all, but an area - rather like a maritime zone - where rights would be personal and not territorial. It would have to be subject to a special desert regime , which could I think be so devised as to enable Ibn Saud to maintain any personal rights which he does at present effectively exercise over the nomadic tribes - e.g. the right to levy a certain amount of zikat (either as tribute or as insurance) in the loose and rather undefined way which Thomas has described to us, etc. But at the same time it would preclude Ibn Baud - or for that matter ourselves acting for any of our proteges - xrom giving any oil or other concession implying territorial severeignty/(tS) \ sovereignty, or from establishing permanent territorial claims to the area in question. 4. Of course the main difficulty of any such suggestion will be to get ibn Saud to accept it. the other hand the present position is that Y/e have taken our stand on the 'Blue Line' and do not admit that Ibn Saud possesses any rights whatever to the east of it. We have offered him a small modification of the 'Blue 'Line' but he apparently claims the entire desert up to the coastal belt. We could not possibly, I think, particularly in, the light of what Thomas hasrtold. us about the shifting character of tribal allegiance in this area - agree to recognise Ibn saud's full territorial sovereignty over so large an area; ana it seems to me that it is just possible that some arrangement on the lines I am now suggesting, by which Ibn saud might be enabled to maintain a kind of loose personal sovereignty over the tribes over the whole of the desert without acquiring any territorial rights, might offer the means of reaching some compromise between the /the position on which we have at present taken our stand and his own extravagant claims. 5. My idea is that this 'desert area' should be circumscribed by a kind of 'ring fence' consisting of the boundaries of the areas over which the surrounding rulers can be reasonably represented as having claims to exclusive territorial sovereignty. 1 would suggest that this 'ring fence' line should be drawn in such a way as to give the maximum possible amount of territory to the Trucial Sheikhs, the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and the Aden protectorate. This would enable us to have a wide margin for purposes of any necessary defence measures - e.g. pursuit by the Royal Air yoree o^ fugitive raiders, etc. One of our main objects would of course be to secure a complete renunciation by Xbn Baud of any claims of any description over the area to the seaward side of that line where it would bound the territories of our pr o te ge s. 6 ./6* The rough framework of the kind of agreement X have in mind would be somewhat on the following lines:- The Contracting parties, 'with a view to resolving 'certain difficulties which have arisen in connexion with 'territorial boundaries in south-eastern Arabia,' would agree as follows: A special 'desert area', subject to a special desert regime, shall be created, the boundaries of which shall be as follows (These lines are merely tentative suggestions to serve asp as is for discussion)# On the west, a line starting from the head of the Debat es-Salwa and running due south to parallel 19, and thence in a west south-westerly direction to the Eastern boundary of Nejran. 7. on the east fc# a line running from the same point on the pohat-es-Salwa in a south-easterly direction to the western corner of the sabkhat-al-Amra salt lane ( juot west of the Khor-el-Odeid), as shown on such-and-such a map. Thence due south to the well of Baniyan (the well itself could be on one side of the line or on the other, according to what seemed most suitable), as shown on such/such-and-such a map, where it appears on the intersection of Meri&amp;an 51 and parallel JiS (as shown on that map). Thence in an east-south easterly direction to the true intersection of Me ^ id an 55 and parallel 22. Thence due south to the true intersection of Meridan 55 and parallel EO. Thence in a west-south westerly direction following the edge of the limit of the sand dunes of the Ruba-el-Kali desert (which is well marked), as shown on such-and-such a map, to a point so many miles due north of Tarim in the Wadi Hadramant. Thence in a north westerly direction (see below) until it rejoins the westerly limit described above. 8. Ibn Saud would then undertake (in whatever form such an undertaking could be made most palatable to him) to put forward no claims of any description whatever to the areas to the east and south of the line described in paragraph 7 above from the head of the pohat-es-Salwa to such-and-such a point (e.g. where it crosses the so-called violet line) and His Majesty’s Government for their part, and on behalf of their proteges, would undertake to put forward/10. forward no claims to the area to the west of the line described in paragraph 6 above. special provision might OY have to be made for the sect jean of the line between Nejran and the so-called violet line, where it may march with the Yemen. 9. Within the ”desert area' none of the parties to the convention 'would possess any exclusive territorial rights, and in particular they would undertake to refrain from granting any concessions and. from establishing any permanent fortifications. They would also undertake not to raise objections to the passage over this area Cf each other's aircraft. But a system of loose overlordship might perhaps be described which would recognize Ibn Baud's present de facto rights. The contracting Parties would further agree that the special regime set up for the 'desert area' should in the first instance last for a period of, say, twenty years only, and that at the expiration of that period it would be subject to reconsideration at the instance of any of the Parties concerned.10. This is an extremely rough and tentative outline of the sort of thing I have in mind, and I recognise that the fuller information which we are awaiting from the Gulf may materially alter the position. Moreover I have not yet had time to consult Andrew Ryan about it, and he may see serious objections to it which have not yet occurred to me. in any case there are obvious difficulties even as regards the mere definition of the boundaries let alone the definition of the regime itself. 11. It is also for consideration whether we should not try to include a much larger area to the west of the blue and purple lines within the 'desert area'. This would, I think, be in accordance with the actual facts of the situation, and would make a tidier job of the whole thing from the purely geographical point of view. It seldom pays to disregard geographical factors. At the same time Ibn saud will presumably object to giving away his full territorial sovereignty over anything to the west of the blue and violet lines, particularly as it appears from philby 1 s map that he does in fact exercise a fairly definite/\ definite territorial sovereignty as far to the south east as the parallelogram bounded on the north and south by parallels 22 and 19 respectively, and on the east and west by meridians 50 and 52. These, however, are points of detail which can be considered if and when we find that the general principle of a special desert area subject to the kind of regime which I have indicated, is worth pursuing. 12. My chief fear is that Ibn Saud is likely to make his great difficulties over abandoning claims to territorial rights over any area even to the east of the blue and violet lines. But it is just possible that, if it were only by some arrangement of this kind that he could secure our acceptance of his claim to personal over lordship over to agree. 15. I sm sending a copy of this letter to Hind* Yours ever.''h?, J .FORSII&amp;N, P.FFICl), S. W. 1. , 6th November, 1934 (E 6371/279/91) My dear Gilbert, With reference to our conversation this morning about the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, I think you may be interested to have the following copy of a minute which Ryan wrote a week or two ago on another paper - which you have since seen - connected with this question:- u Ibn Saud wants to leave the whole position fluid and to continue to rest on the negative ground that he will have nothing to do with the Anglo-Turkish arrangements; that his sovereignty extends well beyond the blue line and might extend over the whole littoral from Qatar to Muscat but for his obligation under his own treaties with H.M*G.; and that, as he is on the best of terms with the local rulers, there is no need for a definition of exact boundaries, least of all a definition under the auspices of an alien and non-Arab Government. I still think that one y of the best ways of driving him into a more positive attitud would be to emphasise on our side the importance which theMr. Wakely, b.&amp;\ Please see previous submission on F.z.6039/34. ^. If It was agreed on that paper, after discussion in the Middle ^ast Committee, that H.M.G. might he prepared to make concessions in regaru to the Eastern limits of Sauai Arabia, as generous as was consistent with their own strategic and other requirements in Eastern Arabia and the legitimate claims of our proteges, as part of a satisfactory general settlement; that the political Resident shou-ud obtain certain information to enable us to take a decision as to what our maximum concessions could be, investigating in particular tne possibility of a settlement on the basis of attributing certain tribes, as distinct from territories, to Ion Saud; ana that the Service Departments should consider our strategic desiderata once information was available; meanwhile, that the Foreign Office, in/oiscussions with Fuad Hamza, should make clear the conditions on which and the extent to which we were prepared to consider the modification of the Blue Line, but should maintain that the Blue Line was the legal ana international boundary and binding as such on Ibn Saud. The discussions with Fuad Hamza have been separately submitted. A copy will be found on P.Z.6188/ 34 below. The discussions in fact went into rather more detail than had possibly been contemplated at an earlier stage, but this had the advantage that it enabled the Foreign Office to emphasise still more clearly that we took our stand on the Blue Line ana that we should not be/2. be prepared to consider exaggerated claims on tne part of Ton 3aud, and that it was essential that we should know the King's claims if we were to consider the question profitably. Fuaa Hamza was not in a position to make any firm reply on this point ana he agreed to make an urgent reference to Ibn Saua. We have since had (see papers flagged at P.Z.6355 ana 66h9/34) tne King’s reply. In the case of Qatar he is prepared to accept a boundary running across the base of the Qatar Peninsula which has, he says, for long been an accepted ae facto boundary as between himself and the sheikh. ^ as regards the remainder of the area affected by the Blue Line, the King merely put forward vague claims to the *aesert rt generally as distinct from the coastal belt, sir Andrew Byan doubts if we shall get any much more positive aefinition from Ibn Saud of his aesiderata in this area until we are really at grips with him. 3. Meantime, enquiries are proceeding in the Persian Gulf, the result of which is not yet available. It is undesirable to hasten these, since by doing so we might affect the quality ana extent of the information which is being obtuinea. at this ena there have been informal talks with Mr. Bertram Thomas. A note on points which emerged from conversations which he had at the India Office on 19th October is flagged on p.z.6810/34. In a subsequent discussion with Mr. Hendel ana myself he took very much the same line as he had at the Inaia Office. We have also nad from the Persian Gulf an extract from Mr. Thomas' very interesting ana important report of a reconnaissance in Oman in 1927, the impression left by which coincides closely with the impression left by Mr* Thomas in his conversations here. Tjt &lt;v U \yCcuA fa /va» f3. 4. There have been the very important telegrams s which are submitted simultaneously with this iile ana which suggest that Ion Saua himself may well he content to maintain trie present indefinite position,under which he can exercise influence and control East of the Blue Line, ana that he would prefer this to a ^ttlement which would further emphasise the independence of the Trucial Sheiiaiaoms and Muscat ana the, fact that their special treaty relations are with H.M.G. and not with Saudi Arabia. 5. There is to be a uiscussion in the Middle East Cownittee on Thursday on the conversations with Fuad Hamza ana the question whether it is desirable to pursue the iaea of negotiation with Ibn Saud. A separate submission has been made suggesting that it would be difficult not to do so in the light of what has passed. As regards tne Blue Line, Mr.Rendel is mucn impressed by tne information received from Mr* ‘Thomas aid is now inclined to, favour tne creation of a No-Man’s Land, to be known as the *Desert Area H ana to be subjected to a special regime, within limits accepted by both parties, in Central Arabia. He is writing to set out his views on this point in greater detail, ne would also, if possible, like to get some decision from the meeting on Thursday as to the line of the instructions to be given to Sir A* Ryan. I told him on this that we would consider the 'desert area' suggestion; but that it was clearly impossible to reach a jrDr ' decision either on this or on the question of instructions until the information which we are hoping to receive from the Gulf was available; ana that, suoject to confirmation by higher authority here, I thought that we should not be prepared to concur in any instructions to Sir A. Ryan “feis -st-age or until that information had been received ana considered both by us and by the service Departments. If we/we were unable to issue final instructions to the Minister before his return the right line for him to adopt at Jedda would seem to be that it was really impossible for us to make much advance until we had a clearer indication of the King’s desiderata; that vague claims to the desert as distinct from the coastal tract were not satisfactory, and that if he wished us to consider any modification of the Blue Line as part of a general settlement he must be prepared to put up some more specific proposal. 6 . I submit that I might be authorised to take this line in trie meeting. The importance of the discussions with kr. Thomas is that they have revealed the extreme difficulty of reaching a satisfactory settlement to be embodied in writing with Ton Baud on either a tribal or a territorial basis. But we may well get information from the Gulf which will alter our view; Mr. Rendel's suggestion for a desert area under the control of neither party and subject * to a special regime will need careful consideration. ^£n any event we cannot ourselves at the moment state with any confidence what hinterland limits we wish to claim for the Trucial Sheikhdoms* The Service Departments too are likely to wish for time to consider what territorial limits for our proteges, or what type of settlement is consistent with the safeguarding of their strategic desiderata. But there is, of course, no harm, and may be advantage, in a general discussion of the position on the information so far available so long as it does not result in detailed instructions to the Minister.■V \ INDIA OFFICE, &lt; i i IT ALL 9 3 *.»• I T* L* 6810/34* 5Ui November 1954, / Ivjy bear Hind, I send herewith a note based on a talk which we had here with Bertram Tnomas on the 19th ectober, I am sorry Tor the delay, but I had sent the text to him Tor concurrence and have only just had it back.

Des iraMlit.v ana practicability of fixed boundaries; , xu the li 6 ht of his experience of 1 n Mr. Tiiomas hvaX )ia saw very strong objection to laying down fixed ■boundaries as represented by a line on the map in the hinterland of the Trucial sheikhdoms, Muscat, etc. Such a line was meaningless so far as tribes and local rulers were concerned. The tribal boundary was tne only real one. Moreover, the situation in the hinterland was essentially fluid and a line which might represent the position at the moment would he unlikely to do so 9 say, in ten years’ time, even if the general political situation remained the saiie, ana certainly would not ao so once any major political alteration (such as tne death of Ibn Saud, the death of Ibn Jiluwi, or the reassertion of the influence of Abu Dhabi) had taken place.1 v 5. possibility of settlement on a tribal basis * While a tribal basis was likely to be very much more satisfactory than a territorial basis, Mr. Thomas saw great difficulty in a settlement of this nature. He admitted that it might be possible to earmark settled elements of particular tribes such as the Manasir and to separate them from the nomad elements for the purpose of a tribal settlement. But he repeated that tribal allegiances were very light end varied very rapidly, that the area of the dira or circle within which a tribe operated might well be affected by failure of grass, etc, ana that individual Sheikhs were not necessarily in. a position to pledge trmir triors to a certain allegiance. Political prestige in those areas was largely a matter of wealth ana patronage, and Koweit, Abu Dhabi, Nejd and Muscat had in the past exercised an influence the extent of which had varied largely from time to time according to their economic position and their power to extend patronage. He thought we should be incurring great risks if at this stage we entered into any written settlement with Ibn Baud which attributed certain tribes to him. Incidentally the Manasir were historically an Abu Dhabi tribe, although in the last five or six years they had paid zakat to Ibn Saud. 4. -mn aiud’s Influence to th e e a st of the Blue Lino and tne payment oi zaKhl. It. Thomas.in thd first placa confimaed a suggestion already made from the Gulf that zakat represented no more than a mild form of insurance carrying with it no suggestion of suzerainty or sovereignty and corresponding closely to the ancient danegeld. It would he dangerous in his view to hase any/any settlement merely on the fact that zakat had been paid hy a particular trihe at any given time* What in practice happened was that a trioe which foun^. itself engaged in hostilities with another neighbouring tribe, which, like itself, hau not paid zakat to, say. Ion Saud, seized the opportunity, by sending a camel or some small similar tribute to Ibn 3auu to secure his moral support in any raiding which it might undertake. The dah-oer and the occasion over, the payment of zakat would lapse. Or again, nomad tribes might tender an offering to Ibn Saud, or to Ibn Jiluwi, if they found themselves in the course of their wanderings near the borders of Nejd or close to some area in wnich Saudi influence was strong. They certainly would not regard themselves as committed to any permanent allegiance uo Ibn Saud by such a payment. Or again, a member of the sheikhly family, who had designs on the ruling sheikh, or who found himself threatened by that sheikh, would send a present to Ibn Jiluwi by way oi strengthening his hands against his own ruler. 5 # influence of Ibn Jiluwi - Mr. Thomas was of opinion that the iniluence of Ibn Jiluwi was the most substantial feature of the Sauui regime in north-eastern Arabia. Ion jiluwi’s strongly marked personality, his strength, ana his severity had acquired a great influence for him among the Bedouin. In Mr. Thomas' opinion the influence of the Saudi Government in the hinterland of the area to tne east of the Blue Line was likely to be very substantially reduced with Ibn Jiluwi's death. Ton Baud, unless n0 could find an equally dominating lieutenant, would not himself be in a position to carry anything like so much weight. The/4 6. T Ii e re I i£i ou s c oni I ic t .

The Imam ana the Ibadhi tribes were for practical purposes, though not formally, independent of the sultan. For reasons they would, however, oe likely to be religious equally hostile to Ibn Baud. In the south-east, in Dhofar, there haa never been any question of baud!

The prestige of Ibn Saud in Peninsula Oman is in direct proportion to his strength and ability to harm it* There is no foundation for believing that some of the tribes being so-called Wahabis* they desire the extension to themselves of the Imam’s full temporal authority. The Hanbali sect to which the Dhahirah tribes in a large measure belong* is not* as practised here* essentially different from the Maliki or Shafi orthodoxy* Inherited from a time when it took a narrow and fanatical form and imposed at the point of the sword, i t is now whittled down to a moderateness and toleration that make it unrecognisable as Wahabism* So-called co-religionists of Ibn Saud, these tribes are inveterate smokers, though as a relic of past proscription, they do not as a rule grow ’’the weed” in their ownterritory* They would not gladly suffer the introduc tion of the rigid tenets of Riyadh. On the other hand Ibn Saud they cannot defy. hopelessly divided against themselves into the Hinawiyah and Ghafiriyah factions, unable or unwilling to unite or sacrifice separate tribal sovereignty which is the genius of their system, it is only Ibn Saud who in the past hundred years has been able to invade and dominate them under a single authority at Baraimi. They know that it is only he who may desire and is able to do this again. But it is not invasion that they fear which prompts them to pay ’zakaf • This spectacular method, which the first invader, Abdul Aziz the Wahabi, used at the beginning of the Nineteenth century is no longer necessary. To-day it is the power of letting loose a strong tribe to raid a weaker Dhahirah one and carry off its camels without hope of redress or retaliation tnat is Ibn/— s - 2 - Xbn Saud's strength. Thus immediately before the arrival of Ibn Baud's zakat collector, one of the Bani Yas tribes was raided by the Al Murra and lost a hundred and fifty camels. Payment of zakat to Ibn Baud is therefore a kind of insurance against the raider. It is the wisdom and economy of the present Abdul Aziz to bring his insidious pressure to bear on a wavering tribe through a strong and loyal neighbour whose interest it is to be ensured the iruits of victory. Mindful of the lessons of the ruthless if intermittent Wahabi occupations of the Dhahirah, the people of reninsula Oman do not belittle the man of Riyadh who to-day has repeated the exploits of his forerunners, but they do not love him. In reality it is not Ibn Saud himself whom they desire to propitiate but his viceroy Ibn Jaluwi, Governor at Hofuf, whose activities extend to these Eastern marches. Under this lighter regime Ibn Baud's influence does not as itdid in 1800 penetrate into the Oman Sultanate or even to Wadi Jizzi, nor does it reach the Coast as it did at Sharjah in the Eighteen Sixties. Its design seems to be to bring the Baduin camel tribes of the Bhahirah - the Minasir, Mizariya', Bani Yas baduin, Ka'im, Albu Shamis, Dhuwahir, Daru*, Awamir, Bani Ka’ab and Bani Qitab - to acknowledge a nominal degree of subordination and pay zakat without trouble or expense, or military measures calculated to rouse their antagonism. Clearly the tribes in close proximity to Hasa e.g. Minasir and Mizariya' are unable to resist, those further removed, the Bani Yas Badu (who also derive strength from their coastal connections), the Na'im, Dhuwahir and Daru' are in a stronger position, while the Bani Ka'ab and Bani *itab aresufficiently remote to say , K0 ,. it is the widdom of Ibn Saud to demand from the first, request from the second, and leave it to the volit- ion/3 volition of the third. The mazakki this year, one Iiiluhaiiimad din flaneur of the Hurra* tribe, collected zakat on the following basis. One dollar on each camel from the ^uwar* i.e. one year camel upwards. One dollar on each ten head of sheep and goats. Poor caravaners were exempted and remissions were made to the moneyless Awamir. The Darn* paid very little and the Bani Ka*ab and Bani Qitab not at all. But behind the zakat collections, the power ol Ibn Baud to turn one of these tribes within his influence on to another, its possibly hereditary enemy, and the lear felt within a tribe of its being left in isolation, give him an undeniable prestige. When these facts are realised the volte face of Shaikh Saqar after promising you support ^ -&gt;j« for the Royal Air Force Expedition (Ibn Jaluwi is inwardlyl not on good terms with him) and the initial terror of Shaikh \{ Salim of the Bani Ka’ab to harbour the Royal Air Force parti ^ will appear to he acts of self-preservation and give the observer pause before condemning* DHAKridT'' ) Thus the situation in Jau, or the Baduin northern ^_SXR. l of the phahirah. The southern half of Dhahirah starting at Dhank is called SIR. Xts inhabi are chiefly settled and mainly belong to the Ghafiriyah faction and the Ibadhi sect. Ibn Saud has made no overtures here and his agent would be unwelcome m any of its chief towns Ibri, Sulaif, Al Araqi, Ainan or Paris. It will be remembered that in December 1925 the Imam of Interior Oman, and Shaikh Isa bin Salih invaded and overran Dahirat al Sir. ostensibly tb.ir eWeot ... to resist «.bi enero.ob.ents .hiol, ..re believed to thre.ten Mint Proper its.ll • their/-4- their move was seen however to involve worse implications, namely the subordination of Sir, predominantly Ghafiriyah, to a Hinawiyah hegemony, misunderstandings arose and the army melted away* Sulaiman bin Hamyar, Ghafiriyah, defected at the instigation of his co-factionists on the opposition side, and the Imam and Isa were obliged to abandon the Expedition. Biraimi and Dhahirat at Jau generally, Hanabi In sect and Ghafiriyah in politics, would never tolerate the extension of Hanawiyah and Ibadhi influence into Dhahirat al Sir. In the event of a Wahabi invasion in strength I opine that Dhahirat al Sir would follow the lead of Dhahirat al Jau, which must submit. But spasmodic zakat collections alone, which represents the present measure of Ibn Saud r s interference in the Dhahirah, will not suffice to draw Dhahirat al Sir to his allegiance. Each small settlement prefers its independence, inclining in times of trouble to some historical local alliance. Thus Ibri has an historical link with the Biyam tribe of Sulaiman bin Hamyar. Sulaif looks to the Daru'. Al Araqi had in times past a distant understanding with Al Hamriyah. Ainain and Dariz, the only Hinawiyah elements, lean towards the Imam and Isa bin Salih. ^mam is strategically the Southern gateway of Dhahirat al Sir, but Ibri, surpassing even Biraimi, is the great commercial centre and bazaar of the Baduin. WADI JIZZI. 'j There remains the tribal situation of Wadi Jizzi. To the foreign invader the open settlements of the Dhahirah present an easier and richer reward than these poor and inaccessible mountain settlements- The tribes of the Wadi Jizzi, Muqabil, ^unud, Hadadna, Rushaidat and Shuwamis are generally speaking small and relatively un important, Shafi in religion and Ghafiriyah. Reference has/H _ v \&lt;5fe) \ -5- has already been made to their villages (See Part l.b.): but the forwarding of the Air Route may given them an importance which they otherwise would not have. In the lower part of Wadi Jizzi below Khan they oome under the jurisdiction of Muscat, above it their independence is rendered nominal by the internecine strife which drives them to seek alliance either with the Na f im or Bani Ka f ab.

It is understood that the Royal Air Force officers are recommending the route Auhi - Mahadhah - Abu Dhabi instead of Sahar - Biraimi - Abu Dhabi which is a longer distance and lies to the south (see map). Tribal opposition to the air route falls into two categories (a) coastal (b) interior. The coastal tribes' opposition will in the face of our sea-power break down the moment that it is decided (i) that the Air Route must happen (ii) that co-operation to this end will materially benefit them and that obstruction will materially harm them. Their recent action, calculated to induce us to despair of the obstacles and abandon the project, is the only card they have to play. If and when they see that they have to concede they will concede gracefully. Interior tribal opposition is not so easy. It is bound up with the Ibn Sa'ud question. Ibn Baud's nebulous position in the Dhahirah will have to crystallise oeiore the Baduin tribes can be expected to take a definite line, ihe question of whether Imperial Air Route interests will best be served by (a) Government recognition of Ibn Baud's position in Peninsula Oman, or (b) Ibn Baud's entire exclusion therefrom, does not come within my purview. But it can be stated definitely that his present half and half position there militates against any of the interior tribes co-operat ing with us. They do not know where they stand. In this connection it would seem that as Ibn Baud can already collect zakat by moral force the present indeterminate position suits him. His own interests do not require his risking- tribal opposition by an attempt to obtain complete sovereignty over This has an important bearing on what I presume to/ the area•to be the vital position along the Air Route, namely the half way landing ground at Mahadhah in Bani Ka'ab country. I tentatively sounded Shaikh Salim about the Royal Air Force using this place as a landing ground. He said he was friendly disposed but pointed out the difficulties. (i) the Ibn Saud question, and his own fear that he will fall between two stools. (ii) he could never agree to foreign troops being quartered there, or to buildings, or any action which would discredit him in the eyes of the Arabs, (iii) he could never agree to Mahadhah being used in operations against Arab tribes. I pointed out that these views were based upon a misconception of the objects we sought. As regards the first point, Shaikh Salim’s opinions deserve attention. His support of the Royal Air Saud’s Agent is not likely to have endeared him to Ibn Saud: his opposition to Ibn Saud’s claims in the Dhahirah are well known: to allow Bani Ka’ab territory to be used by our aero planes is calculated to estrange Ibn Saud still lurther and result in his being raided by Dhahirah tribes acting under instructions. In such circumstances he must walk warily. If, he asks, as a result of satisfying our Air demands he exposes himself to these risks will We afford him assistance or protection in certain eventualities ? Shaikh Salim before he is able to agree to our proposals will therefore want to gnow how he stands vis k vis Ibn Saud. If he is satisfied on this point he said he is disposed to agree. Should the Trans-Oman Air Route be decided upon I suggest the following monthly subsidies to tribal Shaikhs. Shaikh Salim bin Diyan (and Ma'adhid) for rent of landing/ Rs. 100Rs. landing ground at Mahadhah and protection throughout Bani Ka^h territory* 30 Shaikh Ahmad bin Abdullah for rent of landing ground at Auhi. 30 Shaikh Salim bin Abdullah for protection in southern half of Wadi Jizzi. 30 Shaikh Hamdan bin Khalfan for protection in northern half of Wadi Jizzi. Between Mahadhah and Abu Dhabi it may be advisable to subsidise - in conjunction with Abu Dhabi - one of the Bani Yas Baduin sections 30 Hs* per mensem for protection in case of forced landings in that area. Over and above this an occasional douceur of Rs.50/- to the Awamir and other Baduin who wander into this area would appear to be advisable. The total cost of this would be about Rs.3,000/- per annum.( . ■ ■ « r \ / KJ 37932/34 Secret i „ /: ‘ D ‘JjtililiSU HKij^CrHAM from th .0 Be or ary of State for the Colonies to the Hesi&amp;fmt at Ad@n» (Sent 2.45 25th Ootoher, 1954.)

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your telegraphic enquiries regarding the hinterland boundaries of the Sultans of Hadhramaut with whom His Majesty's Government are in treaty relations. These Sultans areHis Highness the qu'aiti sultan of Shihr and Mukalla, whose terri- tories include the Shibam district at the western end of the Hadhramaut valley, and the Kathiri Sultans of Seiyun and Tarim, whose territories lie along the Hadhramaut valley to the east of Shibam and as far as Qabr Hud. 2. The Kathiri Sultans are not in direct treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, but their country is included within the limits of the Aden Protectorate by virtue of clause 5 of the Qu'aiti- Kathiri Agreement of 1918, in accordance with which the Kathiri Sultans accept the Qu’aiti Sultan's Treaty with the British Government as being binding upon them. This Agreement was made with the approval of the Foreign Office, which at that time controlled Aden Protectorate affairs, and a copy of the Agreement is now no doubt in the Colonial Office records. 3. It is difficult to define with precision the hinterland boundaries of the Qu'aiti-Kathiri Sultans north of the Hadhramaut valley, our information about that area being at present very meagre. The tribes living to the north of the valley are the Mil Sa'ar, the Ahl ’Awarrdr and the Ahl Manahil. Secretary of state olonies, London. All three are referredmi referred to in the 'Hr.ndbook of Arabia** as being Hedhramaufc tribes, and tlie two former are reported to look on the qu’aiti Governor of Shlbm as their overlord. The Ahl Manshtl are probably In a similar relation to either the Qu’aiti or the Kathlri Sultaas, but this point needs verification. All three tribes should, in ray opinion, bo re® being within either qu*alti or Ki 4. to far as 1 a® aware, the countries of three tribes extend northwards to the southern edge quarter, which forme the natural northern of the Kadhramaut, and which, for^Bolitical end strategic reasons, ought, in nay opinion, to be the frontier of the Men Protectorate in that direction in the event of a modification of the blue and violet lines of the Anglo-Turkish Convention. 5. I regret that I am at present unable to state with any degree of accuracy the exact position of tfa# southern edge of the Empty Quarter, and it has net so far been ascertained by th© reconnaissances of the Royal Air Force. 1 understand, however, that it ilea at &amp; distance varying from about 2D sailer (from Tarim) to about 60 miles (from Shibam) north of the Hsdhramaut valley. 6. It hag already been arranged that Mr. W. F. Ingrams, O.B,, Political Officer, Mukalla and the Hadhramut for some auturaa to study political conditions there, and the Officer eomtaancling th® Forces in Men and the Political Secretary also intend to visit the Hadhramaut for a few clays next month. Group-Captain Portal proposes to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by thi« Vi' it.'X ■ ) visit to arrange more extended aerial reconnaissances than have hitherto been made to the north of the Hadhramaut valley. 7. When these flights have been completed end Mr. Ingrams has made his report I hope to be in a position to reply more fully to your enquiries. In the meantime Group-Captain Portal and I are agreed that, in any revision of frontiers in this area, all territory lying to the south of the Empty Quarter and to toe west of the boundaries of the Sultan of Muscat should, on strategic as well as political grounds, be included in toe Aden Protectorate. 1 have, etc., (3d.)

COPY SEN s 2 6 OCT 1954 ^ rD uj &lt; UJ H- O lU K) sS“ My dear Gilbert, I have shown Walton^ letter No. P.Z.6039/34 of the 26th September, about frontiers in Eastern and South- Eastern Arabia, to Ryan who has read it with great interest. He says that he too has been attracted in the past by the idea of a settlement based on the attribution of tribes rather than of precise areas, and he still sees great force in the arguments adduced by Fowle in support of it, It should, he agrees, certainly be borne in mind as a subject for further exploration, but it appears to be open not only to the objection indicated by Fowle himself in the second sentence of paragraph 7 of his note of the 21st September, a copy of which was enclosed in 'Walton s letter to me, but also to the objection that, in the event of futxire economic developments, e.g. projects for exploiting oil, it would be very important to know to whom particular geographical areas belonged. As regards Fowle’s own objection,/ J.G. Laithwaite, Esq.objection, it will, in Ryan’s view, 'be of great importance to prevent Ibn Sand from establishing the position that he can extend his authority to the sea hoard between the coastal rulers* He recalls in this connexion a statement made not long ago by the Sheikh of Qatar that there was an area between him and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi which they regarded as a neutral zone, but in which Ibn Saud exercised authority which they could not dispute* It is interesting to note that the frontier settlement between Iraq and Nejd in 1922 was approached from the point of view of an attribution of tribes - see Article 1 of the Treaty of Mohammerah. Ryan suggests that it may perhaps be worth while to refresh our memories as to the evolution by which that Article was superseded some months later by the first Protocol of Uqair# 2« I do not myself think that there is any fundamental disagreement between Fowle and ourselves* We fully realise that allegiance in Arabia is tribal rather than territorial, and that it is not physically possible to draw clear-cut frontiers in the desert. We are indeed already/* already approaching 'this question on a trihal basis&gt; e»g* we have asked Fuad Hamza and the Saudi Minister to let us tooT* over what tribes Ibn Saud claims to rule. Nevertheless, the difficulty foreseen in paragraph 7 of Fowle’s note is a very real one. If we were to try to define Ibn Baud’s dominions merely by tribal allegiance - and we are agreed that some definition has now become necessary - nothing would be easier than for Ibn Saud to claim rights over all members of his tribes wherever they were in Eastern or Southern Arabia, and to use tribal migrations for pegging out claims which would eventually become claims to territorial sovereignty. 3. The fact is that the old days of personal, as opposed to territorial, nationality are coming to an end even in Arabia. Even there territory, like territorial waters, must hear some kind of national label - even if it is only an artificial one - because it is no longer politically practicable, with modem developments such as air communications, the discovery of oil and minerals, etc., to have a vacuum. 4./41 4* Our BUggestion for a definition of a South-Eastern frontier for Saudi Arabia, which should be theoretically co-terminous with the frontiers of the territories of the rulers under our protection, was intended to take all these factors as far as possible into account© My own idea was that the frontier should, wherever possible, be laid down - theoretically and geographically, and not, of course, on the ground - in the emptiest possible places and as fUr as possible from the areas effectively administered by either side© It would correspond to a line dividing national rights over certain wide gulfs or inland seas* It would then be possible to work on the basis of the existence of a wide geographical belt on the seaward side of the new frontier, which would be in effect a no-man s- land which we should not regard ourselves as bound to protect in any sort of way, but whe re Ibn Sand would be precluded from pegging out territorial c laims or claiming any territorial rights© 5© You will remember that the Ain Ministry have always/always taken the line that the Royal Air Force must have a fairly large area of virtual no-man 1 s-land in which ”to turn round”# It seems to me that if the artificial frontier were pushed as f&amp;r into the desert as possible, it would be possible for the Air Ministry to regard this wide belt on the seaward side of it as a sort of empty area which would enable them, for example, to pursue % 7 retreating raiders without crossing Ibn Baud’s frontier# 6# The artificial frontier line thus laid down would, therefore, be more of an insurance for a remote future against unnoticed and dangerous expansion than an effective 'frontier” even in the sense of the desert frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq# No doubt Ibn Baud’s tribes would migrate from side to side of the frontier# They would remain his subjects; but if they reached any places where there was a territorial administration on the non—Saudi side of the frontier, they would be subject, as foreigners, to the territorial administration. The position would be much the same, in fhct, as it is in North-Eastern Transjordan or Western Koweit, where tribes owing allegiance to the various territorial/territorial rulers concerned wander backwards and forwards but still maintain a main babitat or domicile in the country of their main allegiance and are subject to various local arrangements, so as to avoid duplication of taxation etc. I fear that I have set down our views on this subject at rather undue length, but I thought that you might care to have a full statement of the position from our point of view, and might perhaps like to have them in a form in which they could be communicated bodily to Fowle.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 368 of the 11 th October enclosing a copy of a record of a conversation held on the 3rd October with the Saudi Arabian Minister in London regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia, I have to inform you that on the 15th October Sheikh Hafiz Wahba called again at this Department to discuss this subject. 2 . He said that he had communicated to his Government the views which had been expressed to him on the occasion of the conversation referred to above and that he had now received King Ibn Sand’s reply, which was as follows. 3. King Ibn Sand’s claims in South-Eastern Arabia were to the whole of the inland desert as distinct from the more or less settled coastal belt. The King had no desire to encroach on the settled, or even the nomadic, coastal areas, and had always maintained the friendliest relations with the coastal rulers. But the frontier which he proposed, i.e., the limit of the desert as distinct from the coastal belt, had always been the de facto boundary, had always been accepted by all the parties directly concerned and had never in fact been questioned. All the nomadic tribes in the desert area had always owed him allegiance and accepted his sovereignty, as was evidenced by the fact that they regularly paid him zikat tax. Their allegiance to him had never been disputed. On being asked whether this meant that King Ibn Saud claimed the whole of the Rubai Khali, the Minister explained that King Ibn Saud’s claim was not specifically to the Rubai Khali, but to the “desert” generally as distinct from the coastal belt. 4. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba was warned that many of these statements could hardly be accepted by His Majesty’s Government. Moreover, a claim of this general nature was likely to lead to a number of special difficulties. So far as the information at present available went, there appeared to be very little in South-Eastern Arabia that was not desert, and indeed barren and uncultivated areas often extended to the coast. It would be necessary, therefore, m the first place to arrive at a satisfactory definition of the term desert, in the sense^ in which it was now being used, and this might be a matter of very consideraole difficulty. . , 5. During the general discussion which followed, the Minister emphasised that King Ibn Saud was anxious to settle this question on a reasonable basis. It proved impossible, however, to obtain from him a closer definition of the King s claims It was suggested to him that King Ibn Saud might at least have given some further indication of the particular tribes over which he claimed over lordship Mention had, for instance, been made by Fuad Bey Hamza o± the Murra tribe, about which it was possible that there might be no very serious difficulty. On the other hand, the Manasir had also been mentioned and this tribe it was understood, had long owed a certain allegiance to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The Minister admitted that certain tribes, whose wanderings took them over the desert, might properly belong to the coastal belt, but he did not puisue Wahba was told that his communication would have to be betore Sir ixnarew xyyaii icxi, xyi. : : u -u ^ i reaching an early agreement—or, indeed, perhaps any agreement at all by local negotiation were likely to be very greatly increased.

South-Eastern Frontiers of Saudi Arabia.—(Record of Conversation with with Saudi Ministry on October 3, 1934.) FOLLOWING on the arrangements made at the second meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza on the 20th September, the Saudi-Arabian Minister and Mr. Zada called on Mr. Rendel on the 3rd October ostensibly to inform him of King Ibn Sand’s views in regard to the possible revision of the 4 ‘blue-line” frontier. Sir A. Ryan and Mr. Johnstone were also present. 2. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba began by explaining that he had now heard from Ibn Sand, and that the King considered that the frontier should follow existing de facto line which had been tacitly, though not formally, agreed upon between himself and the Sheikh of Qatar as the southern limit of the latter’s authority. This boundary, though never actually defined, had long been tacitly accepted and had never given rise to any trouble, and the King would be prepared to reach an agreement either with the Sheikh of Qatar direct or with His Majesty’s Government on this basis. 3. Mr. Rendel said that this was, of course, only a small portion of the frontier, but that it seemed to him that what the sheikh had just said was really begging the question. His Majesty’s Government could not admit any line other than the ct blue line,” on the ground that it had been tacitly agreed to or accepted and had not given rise to difficulty. It was precisely because no agree ment had been reached about the frontier and because difficulties had arisen that the question was now under discussion. Moreover, His Majesty’s Government were responsible for the foreign relations of Qatar; there could, therefore, be no question of a direct agreement between the Sheikh of Qatar and Ibn Baud in regard to the frontier. The position was that His Majesty’s Government regarded the “blue line” as the legal south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia. They were prepared as part of a general settlement not to take their stand on the strict letter of the law, but to agree to some modification of the line by mutual agreement. 4. What the Minister had said gave a fairly clear indication of what King Ibn Saud’s desiderata might be in regard to the Qatar sector of the line. But it was even more important to know Ibn Saud’s ideas in regard to the remainder of the “ blue line.” Fuad Bey, at the meeting on the 20th September, had spoken of claims to the areas inhabited by the Murra and Manasir tribes, and extending as far south as the Qara mountains. The claim to the Manasir might give rise to difficulties, and His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be prepared to consider any claims extending as far south as the Qara mountains. What His Majesty’s Government wanted to know was how far King Ibn Saud’s claims really did extend. It would, for instance, obviously be useless to pursue the discussion if King Ibn Sand were putting forward claims extending right into the territory of Muscat. Before negotiations could be embarked upon, it was really important to know what the King was asking for. 5. The Saudi Minister said that he had received no instructions in regard to anything but the Qatar sector of the frontier. He understood that the King proposed to communicate his views to Sir A. Ryan on the latter’s return to Jedda in December, when negotiations would be opened. 6 . Sir A. Ryan pointed out that this carried us no further at all than the Saudi Government’s last note on the subject. 7. Mr. Rendel said that His Majesty’s Government considered it most important to have some indications of King Ibn Saud’s claims and desiderata before Sir A. Ryan’s departure. He repeated that the present position was that [231 c—1]- &gt;0 I h l : hi r • r-f * i i-r 2 His Maiesty’s Government took their stand on the k blue line, but that they would be prepared to make some concession m this area as part of a general settlement. But before deciding whether any such settlement were possible, it was essential that they should know what King Ibn baud wns asking or. If King Ibn baud was claiming virtually the whole of South-Bastern Arabia, it might be useless to pursue the matter. In any case, it was necessary to issue detailed instructions to Sir A. Ryan for his guidance in carrying on any negotiations. These instructions would have to be elaboiated in consultation with several other Departments of His Majesty’s Government, and it would not be possible to consider them until His Majesty’s Government knew what King Ibn baud wanted in this matter of the south-eastern frontier. He therefore suggested that the Saudi Minister should telegraph to his Government and ask for telegraphic information on this question. 8 . Sheikh Hafiz Wahba agreed to telegraph his Government forthwith, but said that the King would probably require time to make enquiries from the tribes, &amp;c., in the area in question. 9. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the King was apparently claiming an extension of his dominions to the east and south-east of the “ blue line,” on the ground that certain tribes inhabiting certain areas in this part of Arabia had always owed him allegiance. Surely the King must know which tribes owed him allegiance and which did not, and must already have the necessary information as to the areas which were inhabited by the former. King Ibn Saud could hardly claim the allegiance of tribes which he did not know or sovereignty over areas regarding the limits of which he was ignorant. 10. Sir A. Ryan added that King Ibn Saud knew more about this part of Arabia than anyone else, and must certainly already possess all the information required in order to enable him to formulate his claims. 11 . It was agreed that the Saudi Minister should put these points to King Ibn Saud by telegraph, and communicate with Mr. Rendel again as soon as he received a reply.

The Sa’ud family came into prominence by espousing the cause of ’Abdul Wahhabj who instituted the reformation of Islam known popularly as Wahhabism* ’Abdul Wahhab was born in 1691 in Najd, but his reform movement dates from about 1742. 2. ’Abdul Wahhab was at first looked at askance by his fellow people and in 1741 fled to Dar’iyah, the seat of the Sa’udi Family. * In 1744 Muhammad ibn Sa’ud of the Misalikh section of the Wald ’Ali (originally of 'Anizah stock) became the first convert to the reformed religion and married a daughter of 'Abdul Wahhab. 3.

After quoting Niebuhr’s description of the unifying influence of ’Abdul Wahhab among the warring Shaikhs of those times, Mr. Philby writes »It would be impossible to summarise more concisely the character and methods of a militant policy whose goal was peace. The chosen instrument of that policy was a petty baron of the noble clan of ’Anaza, who held his court after the Badawin fashion in a castle built by his ancestors on the rock of Dara’iyya amid the torrent strands of Wadi Hanifa. Like his contemporary in the Scottish Highlands, Hob Roy of Clan MacGregor, whose struggles with the Dukes of Argyll and Montrose on either side oi . him were but the death throes of the tribal system in our own islands, Muhammad the third or fourth chieftain in the direct line of descent from Sa f ud I., the eponymous ancestor of the dynasty of Ibn^Sa ud,found himself in the middle of the eighteenth century surrounded by powerful and ambitious neighbours, of whom the most formidable were the principalities of ’Ayaina and Manfuha, ever contending with each other over the ruins created by their perpetual warfare for supremacy in Central Arabia. 9. These passages tend to dispose of Bin Sa’ud’s ’’ancestral claims” outside i ajd prior to the Wahhabi Reformation. It is, however, just to quote also Lady Anne Blunt, who wrote in 31881. ; Ci. /_ t-j 'Mohammed Ibn Saoud, the first Wahhabi ximir, belonged to the Mesalikh tribe of Anazeh, itself an offshoot of the belled All ox I western Nejd (deriving, according to the { account of the Ibn Saouds themselves, from * I the Beni Bekr Wail, through Maane Ibn * Rabiia^king of Kejd, Hasa, and Oman i* the ( 15th century.)

Under 'Mbhan 1 * and f, Ya’ari- bah M . tl and the neighbouring districts, who at last so swelled the number of Ibn Saoud f s adherents, that he became the head of the reformed religion, and according to the Wahhabi pretensions the head of all Islam. Guided by the counsels of Ibn Abd-el-Wahhab, and carried forward on the wave ©f the new teaching, he gradually established his authority over all Aared and eventually over the greater part of Nejd. His hardest contests there were with the people of Biad, who, under their Sheykh, Mohammed Ibn Daus, long held out, and with the Ibn Ghureyr (Areyr or Aruk), Sheykhs of the Beni Khaled. These latter, who owned the districts of Hasa and Katif, though forced to tribute, have always been hostile to the Ibn Saouds, and are so at the present day.” Even if a claim based on such grounds could be admitted, it is very doubtful whether this contention (sidelined at a) of the Ibn Sa*uds can be maintained. After the fall of the Abbas ide Caliphate and the C&amp;rmathian revolt with its centre round Bahrain and Qatar, about the beginning of the 11th century, Arabia fell into chaos for some two centuries. * 00313 x 15 Qatar and Has a were organised for a time into a kind of monarchy under the habhan, and later * Ya*aribah tribes (both ^nan tribes). Najd and Shammar were abandoned to clannish alliances or feuds. The Turkish overlord- ship dated from 1517 when they conquered Bgypt, but from the beginning of the 17th century their claims in Najd, ’Qnan, kahrah and the Hadramaut were absolutely ignored, and no collision was possible, because no point of contact existed. This state ol things was, however, at last modified by the/the Wahhabi movement# 10. It is perhaps of some significance that “Lord of Arabia” contains no reference to Bin Sa’uds 1 remote ancestors as rulers, and “The Heart of Arabia' only to three or four generations prior to Muhammed ibn Sa’ud (see paragraph 8 above). sd.

CONFIDENTIAL Z L J ’V/ 3 ^ September 19, 1934. Section 1. [E 5874/2429/25 No. 1. Record of First Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza (De r puty Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs), held at the Foreign Office on September 19, 1934. FUAD BEY HAMZA called on Mr. Rendel this morning accompanied by the Saudi Arabian Minister in London, Sheikh Hafiz Wahba. Sir A. Ryan was also present, except at the beginning of the conversation. 2. Mr. Rendel drew Fuad Bey out on the subjects he wished to discuss, and I elicited the fact that he regarded the question of the south-eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia as being of special importance. 3. Fuad Bey dealt first, however, with the question of the relations between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. He wished to know how His Majesty's Government would view a tightening up of those relations in the common interest of two Arab countries, both of which were on specially friendly terms with His Majesty’s Government. His Government had not made any definite approach to the Iraqi Government, but they had the possibility in view, always provided that His Majesty’s Government saw no objection. They did not wish to do anything contrary to His Majesty’s Government’s policy. 4. Mr. Rendel said that he would like to have a clearer view of what Fuad Bey had in mind. Speaking generally, and subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, he said that His Majesty’s Government would welcome any thing tending to promote concord and prosperity between the Arab States, and would therefore view with sympathy any rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq which had for its object the promotion of peace in Arabia. It would be necessary to consider carefully the nature of any proposed understanding, to ensure that it was consonant with the existing obligations of the parties, notably those of Iraq under her Treaty of Alliance with us and as a member of the League of Nations. He did not think, however, that such obligations would be a barrier to a closer understanding between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, and considered that any points which might arise could be covered by suitable drafting^ 1 ) 5. Sir A. Ryan concurred, adding, however, that he thought King Abdul Aziz had rather more in view and sought some sort of a British guarantee of the proposed Saudi-Iraq understanding. 6 . Fuad Bey said that this was a misconception. The King did not seek a guarantee, but wished merely to ascertain the attitude of His Majesty’s Govern ment. He went on to ask what kind of understanding would be suitable, whether, for instance, His Majesty’s Government would be a party to it or whether their position would be merely that of a third Power, which would be kept informed at intervals of what was passing and would take a sympathetic interest. 7. Mr. Rendel explained, on the one hand, the objections of His Majesty’s Government to assuming any new obligations, and, on the other, the undesirability of the indefinite multiplication of instruments having no real meaning. He repeated, again reminding Fuad Bey that he was speaking subject to the approval of the Secretary of State, that His Majesty’s Government would view with sympathy a rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, subject to what he had said about the need for harmonising it with existing obligations, but that, while they would be glad to receive such information as the parties directly concerned might give them, they would prefer not to be themselves parties to the understanding arrived at. (i) This question has already been fully considered by the Foreign Office legal advisers in connexion with an earlier proposal for a Perso-lraqi non-aggression pact. [206 t— 1 ]2 8 Sir A Ryan observed that it was all the more impoi tant to have a clear view as express reference had been made in all the earher discussions to two other Powers, non-Arab, with whom His Majesty's Government were also on terms of friendship, and who were neighbours of Iraq though not of Saudi Arabia. 9 Fuad Bey said that he had nothing to conceal. The two Powers justh mentioned were Turkey and Persia. His Government were at present on quite friendly 6 terms with both, and there was no aggressive motive behind their wish for cZr relations with Iraq. Nevertheless, the recent rapprochement between Turkey and Persia had inspired anxiety m all Arab countries H was all the greater as a secular racial animosity existed between Arabs and both Turks and Persians However correct relations might now be his Government feaied the ulterior designs of Turkey and Persia, about which they had a good deal of information. favoured the maintenance of the French position in Syria, subiect to her wish for a readjustment in her favour in the Alexandretta region Mustafa Kemal Pasha had stated to a reliable informant that Turkey preferred to have two separate Powers on her southern border.(-) There was no secret about Persian aspirations in the Persian Gulf, witness the claims she was asserting to Bahrein, &amp;c. Persia was growing more powerful, ^ she now had six warships in the Gulf, where previously there had been none but British ships. Speaking as an Arab, Fuad Bey would like to see Bahrein develop into an independent Arab unit; in the meanwhile, he certainly did not wish to see Persia establish a claim, as against His Majesty's Government. 11 Mr. Rend el said he did not think Persian claims to Bahrein need worry Fuad Bey, but that he understood the general anxiety of which he had spoken At the same time such information as His Majesty’s Government possessed did not suggest that there was much danger in the rapprochement between Turkey and Persia, or that either Power had aggressive designs. Turkey had pursued a remarkably peaceful and non-aggressive policy for the last ten years. 12. Fuad Bey was impressed by the quick changes that came over the relations of States. In Europe he found a very different grouping from that of two years ago. He cited as one example the present closeness of the relations between France, Russia and Turkey. It had looked some months ago as though there were even more material for war than in 1914. Happily this danger had been averted, but there might again be quick changes; and similarly in the East, whatever the present position, Turkey and Persia might become hostile to the Arabs. Any blow aimed by them at Iraq would, as the King had told Sir A. Ryan, menace Saudi Arabia indirectly. 13. This digression was not further pursued. Fuad Bey said he under stood what Mr. Rendel had said regarding His Majesty’s Government’s attitude in regard to the proposed rapprochement between Saudi and Iraq. He went on to ask what view would be taken of similar rapprochements with other Arab States. 14. Mr. Rendel emphasised the importance which His Majesty’s Govern ment attach to a settlement between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. As regards the smaller States on the Persian Gulf, however, he said that it would be of great importance to know clearly what sort of arrangements Fuad Bey had in mind. Was not the situation already sufficiently provided for under article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda. His Majesty’s Government gave a very free hand to the rulers of those States in matters of local concern, but they were responsible for their foreign affairs. Saudi Arabia was a great and powerful State compared with these minor sheikhdoms. Might not closer relations with Ibn Saud end by making these States into something like satellites of the greater Power ? His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be able to acquiesce in any such development. 15. It was agreed to resume this discussion later. Asked what other subjects he wished to raise, Fuad Bey again referred to the question of the south- ( 2 ) I took this to imply that he thought that Turkey would oppose any Arab combination in northern .Arabia, e.g.. between Syria and Iraq.—(Initialed) G.W.R.easstem frontier and mentioned in a general way what had passed between him and oir A. Kyan about the position in regard to the Treaty of Jedda. was agreed to discuss the frontier question to-morrow morning, and Tuad Bey undertook to produce, after this had been done, a further list of subjects. 16. Sheikh Hafiz Wahba made no contribution to the discussion. Foreign Office, September 19, 1934. A. R.[206 u—1] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOYERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia).

THE meeting was attended by-— Mr. Rendel. Fuad Bey Hamza (Deputy Saudi Arabian Minister for Foreign Affairs). Sheikh Hafiz Wahba (Saudi Arabian Minister in London). Sir Andrew Ryan (His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda). Mr. Johnstone. Mr. Rendel recalled that, at Fuad Bey’s request, it had been agreed on the previous day to begin the present discussion by examining the problem of the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. As the Saudi Government were aware, His Majesty’s Government were satisfied as to the continued legal validity of the position established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914. They saw nothing to be gained, however, by pursuing the discussion on purely legal lines if there were any other means of reaching a satisfactory settlement; they realised that King Ibn Saud felt strongly on the subject; and they considered that a friendly adjustment of the matter should be possible. They were anxious for a friendly settlement of all outstanding questions with King Ibn Saud, but, in the first place, they would like to know more about King Ibn Baud’s own views on the frontier problem. His Majesty’s Government had certain important responsibilities east of the ££ blue line,” which King Ibn Saud had recognised. It was desirable to establish some agreed boundary in the region in question; but, before going any further, it was necessary to have some idea of King Ibn Saud’s desiderata. Fuad Bey expressed his satisfaction at hearing that His Majesty’s Govern ment did not intend to take their stand rigidly on what- they considered their legal rights. King Ibn Saud, he said, was not aiming at expansion, nor did he desire to hold anything which he had not held before. The appeal of His Majesty’s Government to the kv^crAnglo-Turkish Conventions had, however, come as a great shock to him. Those conventions had not been referred to on past occasions, either at the time of the conclusion of the treaty of 1915, under which the question of King Ibn Saud’s eastern frontiers was left open to further discussion, or at the time of the negotiation of the Treaty of Jedda in 1927, when King Ibn Saud had enquired about the relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Arab chiefs of the Persian Gulf, and had been furnished with copies &lt;|f a number of agreements, but not of these. Meanwhile, Fuad Bey was awaiting details regarding the boundary line which King Ibn Saud wished to propose, and he expected to receive these by Monday, the 24th September. Speaking generally, he considered that King Ibn Saud would claim that those tribes who had long been considered his subjects should continue under his rule, and that their territories should be included in his dominions; he cited particularly the Murra and Manasir tribes. To the south, he suggested that the Qara Mountains beyond the Ruba-al-Khali might be a suitable boundary. Mr. Rendel pointed out to him that the latter claim was a very far-reaching one, as the Qara Mountains were close to the south coast of Arabia. It was clear from Mr. Bertram Thomas’s journeys and maps that there was an extensive area between these mountains and the Ruba-al-Khali, which appeared always to have been part of the territory of Muscat. Fuad Bey then mentioned another line of hills further north, and implied that Ibn Saud did not wish to claim any territory to the south beyond the Ruba-al- Khali; but the point was not pursued.Mr. Rendel repeated that, if His Majesty’s Government should find it possible to reach a satisfactory friendly agreement, they would not insist on the legal aspect of the matter; but, in saying this, what they had in inmd was something more than an agreement on this one question , they desned, in act, a general agreement which should cover a number of questions outstanding between the two Governments, for instance, the Koweit blockade. In regard to some wv these questions, His Majesty’s Government would have certain desiderata, King Jbn Saud would no doubt have his own desiderata in other directions. If the frontier question could be satisfactorily settled as part of such a general agree ment, the legal position of His Majesty’s Government could be left on one side. His Majesty’s Government must, however, reserve their right to return to their leo'al claims if for any reason a general settlement were not found possible. The legal position, even if left in abeyance, remained unchanged, and His Majesty’s Government were still prepared, if necessary, to uphold the legal validity of the “ blue line.” Sir A . Ryan concurred in this view. He added that, in pressing for a general settlement, His Majesty’s Government were following the lead given by King Ibn Saud himself, when he had suggested conversations with a view to clearing up his whole position vis-d-vis of His Majesty’s Government. Mr. Rendel suggested that the further examination of the frontier problem might be allowed to wait until Fuad Bey received the instructions which he was shortly expecting. Meanwhile, he felt bound to make it clear that there was, in fact, a good reason why copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 had not been given to Ibn Saud after the Treaty of Jedda. King Ibn Saud had at that time merely asked for copies of the agreements between His Majesty’s Government and other Arab rulers. There had, therefore, been no question of supplying him with copies of agreements between His Majesty’s Government and the Ottoman Government. In any case, the “blue line ” was generally known and appeared on several published maps. Fuad Bey expressed himself as hopeful of reaching a settlement of out standing questions. He added, however, that, although King Ibn Saud might be willing to settle any present differences between himself and His Majesty’s Government, he was anxious that there should not be any suspicion of what Fuad Bey termed “ marchandage.” As regards the frontier problem, His Majesty’s Government’s reservation of their legal rights might perhaps raise difficulties. Would it not be better to leave the legal aspect out altogether, confine the discussion to the actual facts of the present position, and treat each question separately on its individual merits, as His Majesty’s Government had always insisted on doing in the past ? Mr. Rendel pointed out that in any general settlement, while problems were naturally considered on their merits, they also had to be considered as inter connected parts of a whole. So long as there was hope of a satisfactory general settlement it would be possible to leave the question of strict legal rights in abeyance, but it must always be understood that, if finally a general settlement proved unattainable, a return could be made to the separate examination of each particular case on its own merits. There was no question of what Fuad Bey had called “marchandage.” The position was simply that the merits of any particular question would have to be considered in the light of the overriding merits of the settlement as a whole. It was a case of give and take and of taking the long rather than the short view. Sir Andrew Ryan emphasised his earlier remark that Flis Majesty’s Govern ment were following King Ibn Saud’s lead. It was in accordance with King Ibn Saud’s own wishes that His Majesty’s Government were in this case departing from their more usual practice of considering each question in isolation, and were agreeing to consider the various outstanding questions together. They realised that if an attempt were made to deal with the frontier difficulty by itself, the King’s strong feelings would make a settlement on a strictly legal basis difficult and contentious; he gave as an instance the known reluctance of King Ibn Saud to admit that he could be held to be bound by transactions with the former Turkish Government.Mr. Rendel again urged that it would be much easier to merge the frontier question in a general settlement. He informed Fuad Bey that it was contem plated that bir Andrew Ryan should embark on general negotiations on his return to Jedda, provided that it was possible to agree in principle to such negotiations now. J Fuad 'Bey finally expressed willingness in principle to deal with the various outstanding problems on general lines, but explained that King Ibn Sand, who had made so many sacrifices in the past for the sake of good relations with His Majesty s Government, could not be expected to make many further concessions now. Sir Andrew Ryan demurred to Fuad Bey’s suggestion that Ibn Baud had done nothing but make sacrifices to His Majesty’s Government. He had indeed accommodated his policy to theirs, but he had derived much benefit from their support. Mr. Rendel pointed out that the only sacrifices which both sides would be required to make in the projected general settlement would be such as might, on a long view, be expected to bring them compensating advantages in the end. It was not a case of altruism on either side. But in any general settlement between two Governments both sides usually had to give way over certain points. Meanwhile, he would be grateful if Fuad Bey could, on his part, outline the principal questions which King Ibn Baud might like to see included in a general settlement. So far as His Majesty’s Government were concerned, he had already mentioned their chief preoccupation, namely, the question of the Koweit blockade. It was their earnest wish to see relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit put on a really satisfactory basis, as had been done successively in the case of Saudi relations with Iraq and later with Transjordan. Fuad Bey stated that King Ibn Saud fully realised the desire of His Majesty’s Government for a settlement of the blockade question, which had indeed formed the subject of intermittent discussion between the two Governments for the past four years. His Majesty’s Government should, however, understand that King Ibn Sand’s measures against Koweit were taken not from hostility but purely in order to safeguard his interests. King Ibn Saud had made his position clear and it was for His Majesty’s Government to propose the lines of a settlement. Fuad Bey then raised the question of the future of the Treaty of Jedda, which was now subject to denunciation on short notice by either side—a position which Ibn Saud regarded as unsatisfactory. After some discussion it was agreed that there were three possible alternatives, namely, to denounce the treaty without replacing it by any new instrument, to give it a greater degree of permanence by a supplementary agreement, or to negotiate an entirely new treaty which could if necessary replace it. The first of these alternatives was mutually agreed to be undesirable. The choice between the other two would depend on the nature of the general settlement. It was possible that, if the new general settlement of outstanding questions between the two Governments grew in scope as the negotiations proceeded, it might eventually be found desirable to conclude an entirely new Anglo-Saudi treaty. In the meanwhile, no decision need be taken on this point Sir Andrew Ryan alluded to previous conversations with Fuad Hamza, in which Fuad Hamza had mentioned the following points in regard to which the Treaty of Jedda seemed to need amendment: Slavery, the Akaba-Maan question (though Fuad Hamza had then said that the King did not wish to go back on the present arrangements) and the present form of article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda regarding the relations between Ibn Saud and the Arab rulers of the Persian Gulf. Fuad Bey said that he wished to add a fourth point, namely, that of the prevailing language of the treaty text. As His Majesty’s Government were aware, it had been stipulated in the Treaty of Jedda that the English text should prevail. In the recent Anglo-Yemeni Treaty, on the other hand, the Arabic text had been allowed to prevail. [206 u— 1 ] B 24 Mr. Rendel drew attention to the fact that the first two points which had been mentioned, i.e., the question of slavery and that of the Akaba—Maan frontier, were not, in fact, dealt with in the text of the Treaty of Jedda, but in exchanges of notes signed at the time of the conclusion of the treaty, but, in fact, quite independent of it. These two questions, whate\er might be decided about them, need not therefore affect the future of the treaty. As regards the question of ^ the relations between Ibn Baud and the Arab rulers of the Gulf, which was dealt with in a general way in article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda, he considered that any more elaborate arrangements, which it might be necessary or desirable to make to govern future relations between Ibn Baud and the rulers of South-Eastern Arabia, would normally fall to be discussed in connexion with any arrangements that might be made regarding the south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. He thought he ought perhaps to mention at this point that the Sultan of Muscat was more completely independent than the Trucial sheikhs, and that it might therefore be necessary for him to be brought in as a separate party to any eventual settlement. He repeated, however, that the whole of this question seemed to him to fall to be dealt with together with that of the frontier. As regards the question of the prevailing language of any new agreement, he said that this seemed to him to be a point of form which should not be allowed to interfere with the political issues involved. In point of fact, the departure from precedent which had been agreed to in the case of the recent treaty with the Yemen was due to the unique circumstance that the Yemen was so out of touch with civilisation elsewhere that no one could be found in that country with any adequate knowledge of any European language. Unique conditions required unique treatment. Saudi Arabia was in a very different position. The point, however, involved rather complicated questions of precedent, &amp;c., and had better be dealt with quite independently of the political issues. Mr. Rendel then proceeded to deal with the question of slavery. He explained that this question was one of great importance, on which public sentiment in this country was extremely strong. England had played a very remarkable part in the abolition of the institution of slavery, and public opinion here would never tolerate any step which might be regarded as a step in the wrong direction. If any new arrangements were to be made on this point, therefore, it must be quite clear that their effect would be to hasten and not to retard the inevitable and ultimate abolition of slavery as an institution. He felt sure that Fuad Bey, and indeed King Ibn Saud himself, were sufficiently enlightened to realise that slavery an an institution was fundamentally wrong, and was doomed to extinction in any country that hoped to make true progress and to play a worthy part among the nations of the world. He could say categorically, therefore, that His Majesty’s Government would not be able to agree to any new arrangement which did not fit in with these principles. The question was of such importance that he could not in any case do more than hear and take note of any proposals which Fuad Bey might wish to make. If, however. King Ibn Saud should wish to propose some arrangement the effect of which would be not to retard but to accelerate the abolition or at any rate the reduction of slavery, he felt sure it would be examined with all possible consideration for the King’s position in the matter. Fuad Bey stated that in his view slavery would sooner or later cease when slaves ceased to be imported. King Ibn Saud could, however, proceed no further than the social and economic state of his kingdom would allow. Further, he had to make allowances for the fact that Islamic law permitted slavery. Steps might, nevertheless, be taken to limit the number of slaves in such a way that an annual decline in their number would eventually lead to the total extinction of slavery. He alluded once again to the recent Anglo-Yemeni treaty settlement, under which the Imam had undertaken not to allow the importation of slaves into his territory. It might be possible for King Ibn Saud to give some under taking of that nature and simultaneously to take steps to alleviate the lot of those slaves who were already in Saudi Arabia. Mr. Rendel said that it would, of course, make a great difference if King Ibn Saud could take any such steps within his own dominions. Fuad Bey explained that there were great difficulties attending such action. Apart from King Ibn Sand’s difficulties with his own public opinion, it was•I $ pfrfihu 1 if he Were maintain his Prestige, his action should not be capable ot being represented as dictated by external pressure. He suggested of interna^policv t0 Vmg t0 takG a PP ro P riate act i° n as a matter R e ndel replied that His Majesty’s Government fully realised these y oimculties, but that they did not seem to him insuperable. A prohibition of e importation of slaves would, of course, be a great step forward. But this would not really affect the question of the institution of slavery, since the existing slave population was large enough, he understood, to maintain the supply of slaves for an indefinite period. If, therefore, Ibn Saud could take some steps with a view to the gradual reduction of the number of born slaves, it would be more usetui still Some concession, such as that which Fuad Bey had himself suggested, providing for the emancipation of slaves who were maltreated or discontented with their lot, would be an enormous step forward. Such a measure would, of course for the reasons which had just been discussed, have to be taken by ibn baud on his own initiative. But if it were actually taken, it might make it much easier for His Majesty s Government to make some concession in return. He suggested, as a personal and unofficial suggestion of his own, that by far the best solution would be for Ibn Saud spontaneously to take some action in the sense proposed, in advance of any concession by His Majesty’s Government. Any concession which His Majesty’s Government might agree to make could then be made subsequently, in specific recognition of the fact that Ibn Saud had taken the measures in question. This might create an excellent impression mi&amp;hf justify some modification of the present arrangements Mr. Rendel repeated, however, that he could give no undertaking at this stage as to what the attitude of His Majesty’s Government would be. Fuad Bey thought that something on these lines might be possible, but that Ibn Saud would certainly' require some guarantee from His Majesty’s Govern ment in advance that, if he took the action proposed, His Majesty’s Government would subsequently make the desired concession. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that His Majesty’s Government were being asked to abandon an existing right. It would be necessary to justify any such abandonment to opinion in this country, which, on this subject, was very strong to a wider British opinion, including that of many Moslems, and to international opinion. It would not suffice for such justification to rely merely on an assurance of Ibn baud s good intentions. It would be necessary to know what definite action he contemplated to prevent the slave trade and to mitigate the lot of slaves actually suffering from hardship. Although the lot of slaves generally in Saudi Arabia might be fortunate, there were, in fact, instances of oppressive slavery. He cited as an example the facility with which slave husbands and wives could be separated. It was decided to pursue this matter at a later meeting. Before leaving, Fuad Bey Hamza mentioned four points which he would wish to pursue with His Majesty’s Government during the following discussions. These were : ( 1 ) The Hejaz Railway. (2) The cable line between Jedda and Port Sudan. (3) The Koweit Neutral Zone oil concession. (4) Bahrein transit dues. Eastern Department, Foreign Office, September 20, 1934.t *!) THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTEEN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. September 24, 1934. Section 1. [E 5997/2429/25] No. 1 . Summary of Discussion at Fifth Meeting with Fuad Bey Hamza, held at the Foreign Office on September 24, 1934. IT had originally been arranged to continue at this meeting the discussion begun at the second meeting (E 5908) regarding the eastern and south-eastern frontiers of Saudi Arabia. The instructions which Euad Bey had been expecting in regard to this question had not, however, arrived, and it was not possible to make any further progress with it. It was arranged that, if these instructions did not arrive before Fuad Bey’s departure from England, Sheikh Hafiz would, on their receipt, acquaint the Foreign Office with their tenor. 2. Mr. Rendel asked that the Foreign Office might be given as full an account as possible of King Ibn Saud’s views on the frontier problem well in advance of the opening of the proposed negotiations at Jedda. This would save a good deal of delay and reference home when the negotiations began. He added that he did not wish to begin by seeming over-optimistic with regard to the negotiations over this particular question. There were certain to be many points in regard to which the two sides would not see eye to eye. For instance, Fuad Bey had at the second meeting mentioned the Murra and Manasir as tribes which King Ibn Saud was likely to claim as his subjects. So far as the Murra were concerned, there Avas perhaps some reason to consider that they were closely connected Avith Saudi Arabia. The Manasir, on the other hand, seemed to be of more doubtful allegiance, and were stated to be largely dependent on the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Again, Euad Bey had mentioned a claim as far south as the Qara Mountains. His Majesty’s Government would certainly not be able to agree to anything so extensive. He mentioned these points to show that all would not necessarily be plain sailing. He was confident, however, that a friendly and reasonable settlement could be reached, and Sir A. Ryan would certainly make every effort to reach one, though he would necessarily be bound on many points by his instructions from home. Fuad Bey stated that Sheikh Hafiz Wahba Avould also be available to help in the negotiations in Jedda, since he was proceeding on leave to Saudi Arabia at the end of the year. 3 . In the discussion which followed, an opportunity was taken to remind Fuad Bey that the chief desideratum on the side of His Majesty’s Government in any general settlement would be a satisfactory settlement as regards commercial relations between Saudi Arabia and Koweit. Fuad Bey suggested at one point that it might be better to balance this question against the problem of the oil concession in the KoAveit Neutral Zone, rather than against that of the south-eastern frontier. He was, however, given no encouragement to pursue this line of thought. Sir Andrew Ryan observed that a general settlement should be of the greatest advantage to King Ibn Saud in pursuit of his policy of consolidating his regime in Arabia. 4 . The question of slavery was again touched upon, but it was clear that Fuad Bey was not in a position to add anything more precise to what he had previously said regarding the possibility of such action by Ibn Saud as would justify His Majesty’s Government in renouncing their present right of manumission. 5 . At the close of the meeting Fuad Bey mentioned that his Government might perhaps feel inclined, during the forthcoming negotiations, to raise once more the question of the possible entry of Saudi Arabia into the League of Nations. The proposed general settlement would remove one of the factors which had in the past been considered a possible obstacle to the admission of Saudi Arabia to the League, namely, that country’s lack of fixed frontiers. Mr. Rendel reminded Fuad Bey that the existence of slavery in Saudi Arabia had also in the past been mentioned as a possible obstacle. Fuad Bey replied that this question also Avas to be discussed during the negotiations, and if, as [206 aa— 1 ]was to be hoped, some progress were made with it, it might be possible for Saudi Arabia to follow the precedent of Ethiopia and apply for admission o the League even in advance of the total abolition 01 siavei). r v;* 6 Fuad Bey also mentioned the subject of the indebtedness of h s Government to His Majesty’s Government, and adverted to the personal suggestion he had made to Sir A. Ryan earlier in the day. He emphasised,, however, the entirely unofficial character of this suggestion, and the matter was not further pursued.

We might perhaps write on the lines of the draft oy the air mail to Bushire and India? A reference to the memorandum could then, as suggested yesterday, he added to the telegram. I should think that we might take the risk of sending this memorandum through tne ordinary post to Bushire. it is ior consideration whether with it ^here should not go copies ol Mr •Beckett s note on the legal position as between us and Ihn Baud. In connection with Ton Baud's un $. •ancestral claims' and desiderata X ) to^the east of the Blue Line we have thought it well to investigate the previous history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Baud himself with £astern Arabia and with the British Government since the rise of the Wahabi power late in the 18th century, and I enclose five copies of a historical memorandum on the question which has been drawn up here. The memorandum sets out in some detail the history of the relations of the Wahabis with fastern Arabia and the Trucial Sheikhdoms generally, and will, it u ZK ^ is hoped, throw some light on the basis for tte Saudi claims and the nature of the influence which, in the past, the Wahabis and the Saudi Government have exercised to the east of the Blue Line.

The Appendix to the same memorandum summarises information, chiefly drawn from Lorimer, in regard to the boundaries of Qatar and Abu Dhabi, and gives extracts from philby's ,,f Empty Quarter'' which have a direct bearing on the question of Saudi influence in Central Arabia (though they must, no doubt, be accepted with some reserve in view of Philby's special relations with Ibn Saud). 3. I am sending five copies of the memorandum and a copy of' this letter to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.

The Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud : their Relations with Eastern Arabia and with the British Government, 1800 to 1934. The difficulties which have recently arisen in connection with the eastern boundary of the Saudi Kingdom, the claims advanced by Ibn Saud to ancestral rights east of the Blue Line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and the suggestions put forward by him that at some period in the past arrange ments were entered into with his ancestors, the Wahabi Amirs, by the representatives of H.M. Government, which afforded some recognition of those claims, have made it desirable to examine in some detail the history since 1800 of the connection of the Wahabi power with the Trucial Sheikhdoms and their hinterland and with Muscat; the relations between H.M. Government and the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud himself; and finally the extent to which either the Wahabi Amirs or Ibn Saud in the pre-war period can properly be regarded as Turkish vassals or have admitted or claimed Ottoman nationality. 2 . The period to be covered falls into the following sections :— ( 1 ) 1745 to 1800.—First development of the Wahabi sect, (2) 1800 to 1870-71.—From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the fall of Baraimi and the Turkish occupation of Hasa. (3) 1871 to 1901. — From the Turkish occupation of Hasa to the capture of Riyadh by Ibn Sand. (4) 1901 to 1914.—From the capture of Riyadh to the outbreak of the Great War. (5) 1914 to 1934.—From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue lane discussions. I.—Rise and Development of the Wahabi Power, 1745 to 1800. Origin of the Wahabi Sect. 3 . It is unnecessary to examine in detail the sources and early history of the Wahabi movement. The sect appears to have been founded by Abdul Wahab and his son, Mohamed Ibn Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the eighteenth century in Nejd, and to have advocated a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed among the early followers of Islam in the lifetime of the Prophet. The founders of the sect connected themselves with the Sheikhs of the Saudi family, who then ruled at Deriyah in Nejd ; and the movement, originally religious in character, rapidly assumed a political complexion. The Saudi Sheikhs, with the assistance of the impetus given them by the Wahabi movement, rapidly extended their local influence under the Amir Mohamed, who ruled from 1745 to 1765, at the expense first of the neighbouring rulers of Riyadh and then of the Beni Khalid, who had, since the middle of the seventeenth century, been the principal tribe in Hasa. 4. The first Wahabi Amir died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son, Abdul Aziz, who ruled till his assassination in October or November of 1803. Riyadh was captured in 1772 and the whole of Nejd came under Wahabi rule. The Lor. I, province of Hasa was subdued for the first time in 1792 and finally in 1795, and 1053-6. the power of the Beni Khalid broken. Attempts by the Ottoman Government to re-establish its control failed, and a truce for six years, under which the Wahabis PP' ^ remained in possession of Hasa, was concluded in 1799. The Political Situation in Arabia in 1800. 5. With the conquest of Hasa the Saudis commenced to turn their attention to the east and south. The occasion is a convenient one briefly to review the political situation in Arabia in the year 1800. It was as follows: 6 . Turkey held Iraq; exercised what appears to have been a controlling influence in Koweit, and maintained a claim to Hasa and its ports. The Hejaz was also held by a Turkish vassal, the Sherif of Mecca.7. The Wahabi Amirs held Hasa and Nejd. 8 Bahrein was in the possession of the Uttabi Sheikhs, who, originally settled on the mainland of Arabia at Zubarah in Qatar, had expelled the Persians from Bahrein in 1783. The Bahreini Sheikhs, apprehensive of attack by Muscat, had in 1799 made overtures to Persia and paid her tribute. In 1800 they were temporarily subdued by Muscat. Lor. I, 789- 9. Qatar.—The Uttabi Sheikhs of Bahrein had hereditary possessions in Qatar, 90. ’ an d took refuge there on their expulsion from the islands by Muscat in 1800. 10. The present-day Trucial Coast, then known as the Pirate Coast, was ruled by Arab Sheikhs, the ancestors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. Of these Sheikhs, only tw T o were of real importance, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the rival Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose capital was later removed to Shargah. These rulers were separated by a secular enmity, and belonged to the opposing religious factions of the Hinawi and the Ghafari. The fact that the Rulers of Muscat also belonged to the Hinawi faction formed a link between Muscat and Abu Dhabi. The Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast held a fringe of varying depth along the coast, but do not appear to have exercised any real influence in the remoter hinterland, which was in the possession of Bedouin tribes. 11. At the eastern end of Arabia was the independent Sultanate of Muscat, at Lor I 421 this time ruled by the able and vigorous Saiyid Sultan, who succeeded in 1/92, and who had in 1791 extorted a lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies from Persia. The Sultan had in 1798 entered into an alliance with the British Govern- Lor. l, 429. ment ^ had in jgQQ a g ree( } to re ceive a British Political Representative. In the same year he succeeded in establishing his dominion over Bahrein. 12. The British Government, represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were closely associated with Gulf affairs for commercial reasons, but their policy in 1800 and until late in the nineteenth century was essentially to restrict their activities on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf to the minimum necessary to secure the security of the seas and freedom for British and Indian commerce. They were consistently extremely reluctant to involve themselves in any way in the affairs of the hinterland, save to the extent necessary to secure these objects. As will be seen from the statement which follows, they wmre anxious in these circumstances to observe strict neutrality towards the Wahabis and to abstain from involving themselves in difficulties with this new and considerable mainland Power. II.—1800--1871. From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the Conquest of Hasa by the Turks. Lor. I, 842. Bombay Selections XXIV, 303, 429. 1800 to the Death of Amir Abdul Aziz in October-November 1803. First Wahabi Encroachment in Eastern Arabia. 13. In 1800 the Wahabis for the first time turned their attention to Eastern Arabia. In that year a Wahabi expedition invaded Oman and occupied the oasis of Baraimi—a strategic point of the first importance commanding the approaches to Muscat. In 1801 the Sultan of Muscat was forced by the Uttabi Sheikhs to abandon Bahrein. In 1802 a fresh attack on Bahrein by Muscat was repulsed with Wahabi assistance, but thereafter with brief intervals Bahrein remained under Wahabi influence till 1811, tendered tribute to the W’ahabis in 1803, and afforded naval assistance to them against Muscat in 1805. By 1802 the wRole coast from Basra to the boundary between Muscat and Shargah at Diba had been reduced to nominal submission, and in 1803 the Sultan of Muscat was forced to conclude a truce with the Wahabis, under which Muscat agreed to pay zakat to them, and to allow a Wahabi representative to reside at Muscat. The Wahabis in Western Arabia, 1800-1804. 14. In Western Arabia in the meantime the Wahabis had captured and destroyed Kerbela, and had in 1802 decisively defeated a punitive expedition sent against them by the Turks. Their control of Hasa and Nejd was now complete. During 1803 they overran the Hejaz and completed the conquest of the Turkish districts 1067 1054 ’ 011 t ^ le ® ea Idtoral. The Wahabi Amir was murdered at the end of 1803, and was succeeded by his son, Sand bin Abdul Aziz, who ruled till 1814.1804-1818. From the Accession of Saud bin Abdul Aziz to the Egyptian Conquest of the Wahabis. Amir Saud Ibn Abdul Aziz (November 1803-1814). ^ Amir Abdulla Bin Saud (1814-1818). 15. Between 1804 and 1814 the Wahabis consolidated their influence in Trucial Oman, delivered repeated attacks on the Sultan of Muscat, and for the first time carne into contact with the British Government. Between 1814 and 1818 they succumbed to the attacks of the Egyptians and their power temporarily ended. It will be most convenient to deal with their relations with the various sections of the Arab littoral seriatim. Muscat and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 16. Saiyid Sultan died in 1804, and the Wahabis took an active share in the disputes which followed about the succession. Saiyid Badr, to whom they lent their support, was finally elected Sultan in 1805. The new Sultan, who in 1806 co-operated Lor. 1,1076. with the British expedition against the Jowasimi pirates (paragraph 24 below), ruled the Sultanate till his assassination by Said bin Sultan in 1807. Said bin Sultan who was to rule till 1856, was hostile to Wahabi influence, although he continued Lor. I, 1075, to allow a Wahabi Political Agent to reside at Muscat, and in 1809 he conducted 442.’ an abortive expedition against the new Wahabi Sheikh of the Jowasimis. In the same year the Wahabis delivered a successful attack upon the Sultan from Baraimi, and the punitive expedition sent in 1809 by the Government of India against the Jowasimi pirates (paragraph 25 below) had as an incidental object the'easing of the pressure on the Sultan. In 1810-11, on the withdrawal of the British expedition, further successful attacks were made from Baraimi by Syed bin Mutlak, the Wahabi lieutenant there, in. face of which the Sultan appealed, but unsuccessfully, to the Government of India for assistance. These attacks in 1812-13 penetrated to the south-east of Muscat at Sur and Jaalan; and in the latter place the Beni bu Ali tribe were permanently converted to Wahabism. In 1811 Bahrein was freed from Wahabi rule by the Sultan of Muscat, who inflicted a severe defeat on the Wahabis in Qatar in 1812. In 1813 the Sultan endeavoured to co-operate with the Lor . 1,445. Egyptians, who were now massing for their attack upon Nejd. A Wahabi attack from Baraimi again, however, led to his temporary submission and to the payment of a large fine. The increasing pressure of the Egyptians on the Wahabis appears now to have led to a diminution of Wahabi activity in eastern Arabia ; with the death of the Amir Saud in 1814 all further danger ceased by land, and from that date to the fall of the Wahabi power in 1818 little is heard of them in connection with Muscat, although in 1816 the Wahabis assisted the Sheikh of Bahrein to repel an attempt by the Sultan to re-establish his control over Bahrein. Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 17. During most of the period from 1800 to 1814 the Wahabis appear to have held a dominating position in Trucial Oman and its hinterland. Their Agent established himself in 1800 in the oasis of Baraimi, which he fortified and used as a base for attacks on Muscat or for bringing pressure on the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1803 the Jowasimi of Ras-al-Khaimah were compelled to co-operate in a Wahabi attack on Muscat; but in 1806 a British punitive expedition sent against the Lor. I, 1057, Jowasimis ignored the Wahabi connection with them, and a convention concluded 1074. with the Jowasimis in that year was concluded without reference to the Wahabi Amir and without protest from him. In 1808 Sultan bin Suggar, the hereditary chief of the Jowasimi Arabs at Ras-al-Khaimah, was deposed by the Wahabis, and in the following year a Wahabi nominee, the Sheikh of Rams, was substituted for him. The fallen Jowasimi chief was subsequently lured to Nejd and there imprisoned, but he escaped and returned through the Yemen to Muscat bearing overtures to the Sultan from the Pasha of Egypt for co-operation against the Wahabis. In Lor. 1,1075, 1809 the Jowasimi responded to a Wahabi request for co-operation against Koweit, 44 5. though nothing seems to have come of this. 18. Piracy broke out in an aggravated form after the deposition of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and a further British expedition, with which Muscat co-operated, was sent in 1809-10 which reduced the pirates to submission. The Wahabi Agent at Baraimi is alleged to have proceeded to the assistance of Ras-al-Khaimah ; but, if he did so, he did not arrive until after the departure of theLor. I, 1076. Lor.

The Government of India, anxious to avoid involving them selves in any way with the Wahabis, turned a blind eye so far as possible to Wahabi responsibility (as to the degree of which there is room for difference of opinion) for the activities of the pirates and gave stringent instructions to the Political Resident^ to avoid involving himself in any way with the Wahabi power. 19. The Wahabi Lieutenant in Baraimi, Syed bin Mutlak, proceeded to Nejd in 1813, whereupon his successor, Ibn Azdakah, was murdered by the Beni Yas of Dhafrah. On Syed bin Mutlak’s return later in the same year, he was himself killed in action against the Hajriyin of Oman, and was succeeded by Ibn Mazru. In 1813, and again in 1814, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who appears to have been more independent of Wahabi influence than the Jowasimis, on two occasions combined with Muscat against the Wahabis. In the autumn of 1814 the Wahabi Amir associated himself with explanations and assurances furnished by the de facto Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaima to the Resident in regard to the piracies of the Jowasimis, consequent on which a preliminary agreement, immediately violated by the Jowasimis, was reached in October 1814. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 20. The Wahabis assisted the Sheikhs to regain possession of Bahrein from Muscat in 1801, but the islands thereupon came under the influence of the Wahabi Amir, to whom they offered tribute in 1803, and with whom they co-operated in that year and again in 1805 against Muscat. The Government of Bombay in 1805 gave no encouragement to suggestions from, the Sheikhs for material assistance to enable Bahrein to withhold her support from the Wahabis, under whose control they remained until 1811, when, with the assistance of Muscat, they again regained their independence. The Sultan of Muscat subsequently claimed that Bahrein had then accepted a liability to pay tribute to bin), and in 1816 he made an attack upon the islands which, thanks to the assistance of the Wahabis, with whom and with the Jowasimis the Sheikhs now again allied themselves, was, however, unsuccessful. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 21. In 1803 Koweit, like the rest of the coast, was under Wahabi control, and in that year it assisted the Wahabi Amir in an expedition against Muscat. In 1805 the Sheikh described himself as subject to the Wahabis. But by 1808 Koweit was strong enough to decline to respond to a further appeal for assistance ; a Wahabi attack was driven off in 1809, and the Sheikh of Koweit appears thenceforward to have remained relatively free of Wahabi influence. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 22. Wahabism was dominant in Qatar between 1809-11, but the Wahabis were expelled by Muscat in the latter year and the authority of Bahrein re-established. In 1816, however, Sheikh Rahmah bin Jabir of Khor Hassan and Damrnan sided with Muscat against the Wahabis and the Sheikh of Bahrein. Turkey and the Wahabis; 1804 to the Destruction of the Wahabi Power in 1818. 23. In 1804 Mehemet Ali was appointed Viceroy of Egypt, chiefly in order that he might recover the Hejaz for Turkey. From 1804 to 1810 he concerted his plans for achieving this object. Between 1810 and 1815 he reconquered the Hejaz and drove the Wahabi Amirs back into Hejd. In 1815 his lieutenants advanced into Qasim, and later in the year the Wahabis were severely defeated, submitted to Tusun Pasha, and sent hostages to Egypt, But the Egyptian Viceroy refused to ratify the understanding reached, and was content with nothing less than the complete subjection of the Wahabi Amirs. An offer to accept an Egyptian Governor of Nejd and to pay tribute was rejected ; Deriyah was invested, reduced and destroyed in September 1818 ; and the Wahabi Amir was taken prisoner, sent to Cairo, and executed at Constantinople. His four brothers were sent to Cairo as prisoners. The Wahabi power was, for the time being, completely destroyed, and Turkish (or rather Egyptian) control re-established over Nejd, Hasa, and the Hasa coastal area in the Persian Gulf.Wahabi Relations with H.M. Government, 1800-1818. 24. The first relations of H M. Government (as represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay) with the Wahabi Amirs date from 1805. The Wahabis had reached the sea coast with the conquest of Hasa in 1795, and liad subsequently extended their control along the Trucial Coast between 1800 and 1803. The piratical activities of the Trucial Sheikhs (responsibility for which was in some quarters ascribed to the Wahabis) led in 1806 to a British punitive expedition against them. The expedition subdued the Jowasimis and concluded a treaty with their chief. Despite the fact that the W T ahabis were suspected of being the moving force behind the activities of the Jowasimis, the instructions given to the Resident were to refrain from proceedings which might be displeasing to the Wahabi Amir. But it is noteworthy that the treaty concluded with the Jowasimis in 1806 was concluded with them as independent Sheikhs and without reference to, or the interference of, the Amir. Punitive Expedition against the Jowasimis of 1809-1810. 25. Further outbreaks of piracy, both before and after the removal of the Jowasimi chief by the Wahabis and the substitution of a Wahabi vicegerent, led to a combined expedition against the Jowasimis by Great Britain and Muscat in 1808-10. The expedition succeeded in its objects, but it was conducted with a Nejd Precis, degree of caution and forbearance towards the Wahabis, probably now, as § 2 , 3- previously, the real motive force behind the pirates, which rendered its results of little permanent value. The instructions given to the Resident were that he should “ be careful to make it in due time fully known to the Wahabi and all the officers of his Government that it was our sincere wish to continue at all times on terms of friendship with him and the other States of Arabia, desiring only to provide for the security of the general commerce of the seas, and of the Gulf of Persia in particular, so long and so unjustifiably interrupted by the Jowasimis, in breach also of a positive treaty concluded with their Chief in 1806. . . . The just support of our ally, the Imam of Muscat, cannot reasonably give offence to any other State or Government.” Correspondence with the Wahabi Amir, 1810. 26. The Wahabi Amir having in 1810 entered into correspondence with the Political Resident at Bushire, in regard to the punitive operations which had. been undertaken against the Jowasimis, in which he expressed his desire to. maintain Nejd Precis, relations of amity and concord with H.M. Government, the Government of Bombay, § 2 - 5 - addressed him in the following terms (letter from the Honourable Mr. Duncan dated 9th August 1810;:—“ The British Government receives with satisfaction the expression of your desire to maintain with it the relations of amity and concord a desire in which it cordially participates and has uniformly manifested. It is there fore proper that I should assure you that the late expedition to the Persian Gulf did not originate in hostility towards you, but was, as above noticed, directed solely to the destruction of the pirates who had, in direct breach of their own positive engagements and with an entire forgetfulness of the former instances of condescending lenity manifested towards them, long infested the seas in that quarter, plundering vessels and murdering subjects of all nations indiscriminately, for the British Government does not concern itself with the hostilities earned on by you against the members of the Mussulman faith, on account of their alleged deviation from the ordinances of the Koran, and its power will alone be diiected against those who, exercising the detestable profession of piracy, aie the common enemies of all nations. _ “ The channel of communication between us being now open. 1 request } ou will eontinue to afford me the pleasure of hearing of your prosperity and success.

Government had involved him in perpetual and implacable war with them, m which he trusted that the British Government would not remain neutral, the Government of India replied that the British Government had always considered itself to be at peace with the Wahabis, their late co-operation with the Sultan not having been m prosecution of war against the Wahabis generally, but merely for the extirpation of• ' - ** *•:.

In the course of 1813, on a Wahabi envoy to Muscat announcing his arrival at that place to the Government of Bombay with the object of restoring “the relations of amity between the two powers,” the Governor of Bombay wrote in reply : “ Entertaining, as I have always done, the most friendly disposition towards your master, I conceived it my duty even previously to the receipt of your letter to instruct Mr. Bruce, the British Resident at Bushire, to communicate with His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and to establish such an amicable intercourse with him as cannot fail to he equally advantageous to both countries as well as for the general benefit of their respective neighbours, and it is with feelings of particular satisfaction I observe Your Excellency has stated that a corresponding desire is sincerely entertained by His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and I shall therefore look forward with confidence to the speedy attainment of our reciprocal wishes.” Wahabi Overtures, 1813-1814. 29. The Wahabi Amir had in 1810, in reply to British representations, intimated that he had interdicted his followers from molesting British vessels. Late in 1813, threatened by the advance of the Egyptians, he made overtures to the Political Resident indicating his desire to form a connection with the British Government of mutual amity and friendship which might be beneficial to both States and, acknowledging the superiority of ihe British over every other nation at sea, proposed that the ports of each State should be open to each other and a free and unmolested trade carried on by their subjects. 30. 'Ihe Government of India, however, while considering it politic “ to maintain a friendly intercourse with the Wahabi Chief and to endeavour by cordial and conciliatory conduct to confirm the amicable disposition wdiieh he appeared to entertain towards the British Government,” thought it undesirable at this moment to enter into any regular engagement with him, even of a commercial character. British Proposal for Anglo-Eyptian Co-operation against Jowasimis rejected by Egyptians, 1819. ol. In 1819, on hearing of the successes of the Viceroy of Egypt against the Wahabis and of the arrival of the Egyptian expedition on the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the Government of India endeavoured to arrange with Ibrahim Pasha for joint operations against the J owasimis, with which Muscat should be associated, on the understanding that in return Ras al Khaima would be made over to the Egyptians. Ihe British officer (Captain Sadleir) deputed for this purpose arrived only after the subjugation of the Wahabis and the withdrawal of the Egyptians. Mehemet Ali ultimately, however, replied that neither he nor the Porte desired or needed foreign help in dealing with the Wahabis of Nejd. it The Chief Secretary, Bombay, writing in 1820, recorded that a letter had ately been leceived from Hussein bin Rahmah [formerly Wahabi vicegerent in liucial Oman and Chief of Ras al Khaimah] referring to a treaty of peace concluded between his Imauin and us, and professing a desire of continuing on terms of i lend snip with the English Government, which has of course been positively declined. r General Summary, 1808-1818. 33-. ^heW\ ahabis in the early part of this period consolidated their position in Qrf u mid Trucial Oman. In the latter area their control of the feneikhs, exercised from the oasis of Baraimi, appears to have varied with the e ec ive oice at their disposal; but to have been particularly close in the caseof the Jowasimis, and less so in that of A bn Dhabi. Up to 1814 they bore heavily on the Sultan of Muscat, who, however, retained his independence, although he paid through much of the period a tribute to the Wahabi Amir. Relations with Rie British Government, as represented by the Government of India and the Ifeovernment of Bombay, were polite and even friendly ; but the Indian authorities, while avoiding any cause of quarrel with the Wahabis and closing their eyes to the responsibility of the Wahabis for the piracies of the Jowasimis, declined also to involve themselves in any engagements with the Amirs. Between 1814 and 1818 the power of the Wahabis, who lost the Hejaz between 1810 and 1815, was completely destroyed by the Egyptian forces of Mehemet Ali, and, save to the extent that it survived as a purely religious movement, Wahabism temporarily entirely disappeared.

In 1819-20 the Government of India effectively subdued the pirates of the Trucial Coast, destroyed their forts, and burnt their warships. The Sheikhs in Aitch. XII, May 1820 entered into a general treaty with H.M. Government to preserve the No. xix, maritime peace, H.M. Government on their side undertaking certain reciprocal PP- 245 ~ 9 - obligations of protection by sea. The treaties were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent rulers. In November 1820 H.M. Government took steps to subdue the Beni bu Ali of Jaalan in Muscat, who had been converted to Wahabism by the Wahabi expedition of 1813. Situation in Trucial Oman in 1822-1823. 35. In 1822, Abu Dhabi, now in control also of Debai, is stated to have been the firm ally of Muscat. The Jowasimi Sheikhdom of Shargah was peopled by strict Mohammedans, partly Sunni, partly Wahabi ; Umm al Qaiwain was strictly Wahabi, Bo gel as was for the most part the Sheikhdom of Ajman. In 1823 the Jowasimi Sheikhs xxiv, 315, (as distinct from the Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi and Debai) all appear to have 541-3. acknowledged the general authority of Shargah. While, however, “ in 1823 a large proportion of the people were still Wahabi in sympathy ... of the secular Lor.

In 1824 Sheikh Turki bin Abdulla, a descendant of the first Wahabi Amir, collected a force and marched against the Egyptians. At first defeated, he was BaSel subsequently successful. Between 1824 and 1830 he endeavoured to re-establish ’ 1 ^ 9 7 4 ; the Wahabi power. In 1830 he completely defeated the Beni Ivhalid and leconqueied Hasa ; in the following year Bahrein and Muscat both temporarily became tributary to him ■, and by 1833 he had fully re-established Wahabi influence on the Trucial Coast and in its hinterland and had reoccupied Baraimi. In the same year, however, Bahrein repudiated the agreement of 1831 and maintained itself against tlie Amir, whose coast it blockaded, until 1836, when peace was made. It is recorded m 1830 Bo.

After two years of fighting, the Egyptians accomplished their object in 1839. The Wahabi Amir surrendered in 1838, and was sent a prisoner to Egypt. In 1840 the Egyptians again withdrew f from Hasa, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid as its tributary Governor. 39. The principal events in the relations between the Wahabi Amirs and H.M. Government and the rulers of Eastern Arabia during this period are described below. Wahabi Relations with Muscat, 1824-1840. 40. Between 1824 and 1830 the Sultan of xMuscat was principally busied with unsuccessful endeavours to reduce the Sheikhs of Bahrein. In 1829 he suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Bahreinis and made peace with them. In 1831, in the hope of forwarding his designs in Bahrein, he sent an embassy with presents to the Wahabi Amir. 41. In 1833 the Sultan, with the encouragement of the Government of India, made a general agreement with the Wahabis, by which he undertook to pay a zakat of 5,000 dollars a year. A condition of the agreement was that each should hold possession of his coast according to the limits then existing ; the Muscat coast extending to Jaalan, and the coast of the Amir to Qatif. Reciprocal assistance was also promised in putting down rebellion. There is nothing to show for how long the tribute continued to be paid. 42. No other events of importance affecting Muscat took place until 1839. In face of the Egyptian invasion and the threat which is constituted to Eastern Arabia, the Sultan of Muscat, with a view to promoting his designs in Bahrein, which he had never abandoned, was then at first disposed to co-operate with the Egyptians, but on becoming aware of the hostility to Egyptian advance of the British Government, he associated himself with the views of the latter and refused a demand for assistance made upon him by the Egyptian Commander in Nejd. Wahabi Relations with Trucial Oman, 1824-1840. Wahabi Overtures, 1824. 43. Immediately on the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824, the Wahabi Amir opened correspondence with all the Sheikhs of the coast, inviting them to renew the relations which had existed prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Pasha. The Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah appears forthwith to have opened negotiations with the Wahabis. “ This measure he did not attempt to conceal, but assigned self-preservation as his only motive for adopting it.” Matters do not, however, appear to have proceeded far, and in November 1825 the Sheikh enquired of the Political Resident wdiether Great Britain w T ould help him to maintain his independence against the Wahabis. He was informed in reply (see paragraph 52 below) that he was the best judge of his own interests, but that no connection or authority would be accepted in excuse of predatory proceedings, while action against Muscat would be considered unfriendly by H.M. Government. Disputes between Muscat, Abu Dhabi, and Shargah over Baraimi, 1824-1826. 44. It may be recorded that in 1824-25 considerable difficulties arose locally between the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikh of Shargah and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, over the occupation of the towers of Baraimi, which had apparently been re-occupied by the Trucial Sheikhs on or shortly after the downfall of the Wahabis in 1818.' :i: ’ By a solemn treaty the towers in question had previously been declared neutral, and on their occupation by Shargah the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whether in concert with or independently of the Sultan of Muscat is not clear, had taken up the matter. In December 1824 a reconciliation was negotiated by the Resident, under which the Sheikh of Shargah was to destroy the towers, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi * * It should, however, be noted that Lorimer (I, 450) records a successful raid “ at some time, apparently, between 1821 and 1828 ... by Saad bin Mutlaq, Wahabi, from Baraimi on the Hajriyin tribe ” to avenge their slaying of his father Syed bin Mutlaq (paragraph 19 above).V 9 on his side destroying' a fort which had been built at Derah. In February 1825 the Kesident addressed a strong remonstrance to the Sheikh of Shargah for his delays in destroying the towers and received an evasive answer. In May 1825 the resident sent his Native Agent, armed with authority from the Sheikh to elfect the •nmediate destruction of the towers, to accompany a Muscat force. Hostilities owevei, bioke out between Shargah and Muscat, and the towers remained. In (Jetobei I8^o a reconciliation was finally mediated between the two States by the Kesident, in which no word was said about Baraimi, which appears to have remained m the possession of one or other of the Trucial Chiefs until about 1833. Wahabi reascendency established. _ ^ 5 : lr l Ma y 1830, consequent on the defeat of the Beni Khalid of Hasa, the \V ah a hi Amir and his policy became a matter of acute importance in Trucial Oman. Ihe bulk of the Jowasimis, and especially the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Bo. Sel., Qaiwam, appear to have welcomed the prospect of Wahabi reascendency “the XXIV,324, lower orders anticipating a return to their former piratical habits and the’above two chiefs expecting te emancipate themselves from their dependence upon ” the 81095 Sheikh ol Shargah. Ihe Sheikh of Shargah, who had in 1821 abjured Wahabi tenets, now, while outwardly professing sympathy with the Wahabis, wrote to the Resident in July 1830, expressing his earnest desire to co-operate with the British Government in checking their further progress, and went so far as to declare that he was determined to oppose them even in the event of his not receiving any support,” In reply he was informed that the British Government were solely interested in the suppression of piracy and could not interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab States. But the W T ahabi Amir soon made it clear that he was not prepared to encourage any levival of piracy, and that he proposed to look upon the Sheikh of Shargah and the Sultan of Muscat as the heads of all the Arabian - tribes in Oman. The Sheikh of Ajman, who had asked for a body of troops to Lor - X ’ 68a enable him to throw off his dependence on Shargah, or even to attain the ascendancy in Shargah territories, and who had also suggested that he should cruise against the enemies of the Wahabis in the Gulf, met with a refusal on the ground inter alia that the English being the masters of the sea, the Wahabi Amir ' was not able to contend with so powerful a nation. In 1831 the Sheikh of Ajman was, how x ever, used by the Amir as his intermediary with the Governor of Bombay (paragraph 53 below). Wahabi Claim to Suzerainty over Trucial Oman, 1833. 46. By 1833 the Wahabi ruler had established his influence throughout the Trucial Coast, and in that year a direct demand by the Resident on the Sheikh of Shargah for redress for a piracy led to an intemperate letter from the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi to the Residency Agent at Shargah. As the Wahabi representative had written without authority, no direct notice was taken of his ■communication, but the Residency Agent was instructed to point out the long delays and great forbearance shown before coercive measures had been resorted to by H.M. Government, “ and further to use other arguments importing the evident Bo. Sel. existence of our right to demand redress.” The Wahabi representative replied XXIV, 442. that Amir Turk! “ was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that both citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all acknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, including Hajar, Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Qatif, and that, therefore, on the occurrence of any piracy it should be reported to the Wahabi Chief, or, in the ■event of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Baraimi.” ATu Dhabi submits to the Wahabis, 1833. 47. Later in the same year the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was murdered by his brother, wdio, anxious to consolidate his position, tendered his allegiance and an annual payment of tribute to the Wahabi Amir. The Amir in return informed ■Shargah that Abu Dhabi was under his protection and that he would permit of no Bo - SeL aggression upon them. Despite this, and the very categorical assertion of suzerainty ^f IV ’ 161, referred to in paragraph 46 above, the threats of the Wahabi representative at Baraimi proved insufficient to overawe Shargah, and in 1834 peace was concluded between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, one condition of which was that Debai should Lor. I, 693. .henceforth be under Shargah.Bo. Sel. XXIV, 442-4. Lor. I, 856-8. Decline of Wahabi Influence, 1834 : Loss of Baraimi. 48 The Wahabis about this time were still blockaded by the Sheikh of Bahrein and called in the assistance of Shargah against the Sheikhs of that island. On the murder in 1834 of Amir Turki this question, however, dropped, and the effect of'* the murder is stated to have introduced such confusion and discord into Wahabi affairs “as to counteract the operation of any ambitious views of late entertained by the murdered chief, and for a time, at least, to leave the maritime tribes in the same relative position as before.” In 1836 the preponderating influence of Mehemet Ali in the west began to afford a salutary check on Wahabi encroachments towards the coast of the Persian Gulf. In that year the Wahabi agent at Baraimi failed to secure the maritime assistance of Muscat and the coastal tribes against Bahrein, and by 1838 the Wahabis had lost Baraimi to the local tribe of the Beni Naim, though in what circumstances is not clear. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 49. In 1830-31 Bahrein, apprehensive of a coalition between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat, who had made overtures to the Wahabis with a view to securing Wahabi support in the reduction of Bahrein, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir, acknowledged his supremacy and undertook to pay tribute. By 1833, however, the Sheikhs of Bahrein felt sufficiently strong to defy the Amir and between 1834 and 1836 they blockaded the coast of Hasa and caused sufficient inconvenience to the Wahabis to lead the latter to call in the assistance (which was not, in fact, accorded) of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah. In 1836, however, alarmed by indications of an active assertion oi tne Persian claim and by the possibility 'of a coalition between Muscat and Persia, Bahrein reached a friendly agreement with the Amir, under which the Sheikh was to pay a nominal tribute of 2,000 dollars, while the Amir undertook to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks, and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. In 1839 the Wahabi Lor. 1,1098. general, Umr bin Ufeysan, took refuge at Bahrein on the fall of the Amir Feisul. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 50. Little of moment happened in Qatar between 1824 and 1840. During much of this period the authority of the Sheikh of Bahrein was paramount. In 1835 Lor. I, 857. fhe people of Huwailah rebelled against Bahrein and entered into correspondence with the Wahabis. A settlement was, however, reached by the mediation of the son of the Sultan of Muscat. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 5L The solidarity of the Uttabi rulers of Koweit with those of Bahrein and Qatar was apparently maintained throughout this period. Koweit continued to resist, on the whole successfully, and latterly under the protection of the Turks, the efforts of the Wahabi Amirs to incorporate it with their dominions. During the Egyptian occupation of Hasa in 1838-40 an Egyptian agent was appointed to Koweit and appears to have remained there during the period of Egyptian ascendancy. Lor. I, 1006-10 4 H.M. Government and the Wahabis, 1824-1839. 52. In 1825 on the revival of the Wahabi power in Nejd, the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah enquired whether he might look to the British Government for assistance should he endeavour to maintain his independence against Wahabi intrigue. He was informed in reply that he was the best judge of his own interests, “ but that no connection or authority would be received by the British Government as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory character.” He was further warned against co-operating with the Wahabis against the territories of Muscat Nejd Precis, “ The language held on this occasion was confirmed by the Governor [of Bombay] in § 31. Council, with a further intimation, that, however improbable it might be that we should act against the Wahabis so long as they confined their conquests to the shore, it was still not desirable ihat we should bind ourselves to abstain from interposition or hold out so great an encouragement to the invasion of the Imam’s territories as our avowed indifference would be likely to afford.”11 Wahabi Overtures, 1831. 53. About the middle of 1831 the Wahabi Amir, through the intermediacy of Precis, § 37. the Sheikh of Ajman, wrote to the Governor of Bombay expressing his desire to he upon the same intimate footing as that formerly existing between the British government and his ancestor, Saud, and “ to have the treaty renewed which was made between you the British and Imam Saud.” 54. Search among the records of the Government of Bombay with reference to the alleged treaty showed that two documents only could be found bearing on British intercourse with the Wahabis, viz. those quoted in paragraphs 26 arid 28 above. The Government of Bombay, in reply to the Amir, wrote as follows “Your communication dated 25th Jumadyooluwul, informing me that by the appointment of the Ruler of Events you had arrived at the dignity of Chief of the Wahabi sect, has reached my hands, and given me the gratification which friends feel when they receive intelligence from friends. “ Your disposition to a friendly understanding is met with reciprocal feeling, and the terms of amity which existed between this Government and your great ancestor, Imam Saud, will still remain in force, and, I cherish hopes, will never be broken or infringed. I send this letter by the hands of your faithful dependent Esa bin Hassan to express the same.” Mr. Lorimer remarks that the relative ignorance existing in Bombay at this Lor. I, 1096. time of the position in Central Arabia is evidenced by the use of the phrase “ ancestor ” of the Imam Saud, who belonged to the same generation as the then Amir, and had died only in 1814. British Attitude, 1833-1840. 55. The question of the attitude to be adopted in the event of the Wahabi Amir absorbing Muscat was considered by the Government of India and the Government q. 0 f j to of Bombay in 1833-34. The Government of India intimated that they were not Bo., 1.2.34. prepared to send an expedition to maintain the continental possessions of Muscat and instructed the British authorities in the Gulf “ to observe a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between him [the Sultan of Muscat] and any of his neighbours on the continent of Arabia.” 1837-1839. 56. On the second Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1837 to 1839, the Government of India (see paragraphs 59-62 below), moved by considerations of European Nejd Precis, policy, spared no efforts to counteract the progress of the Egyptians and to persuade § 45. the Trucial Chiefs and the Beni Naim of Baraimi to co-operate against them. 1839-1840. The Egyptians and Eastern Arabia. Fall of the Wahabi Amir. 57. The Amir Feisul surrendered and was sent to Egypt as a prisoner in December 1838, and by the beginning of 1839 the Egyptians were in complete control of Nejd and Hasa. Hitherto they had supported a puppet Amir of the Whhabi family, the Amir Khalid. They now threw off the pretence of supporting Khalid, and declared that Nejd was a possession of Mehemet Ali, and that he would improve and extend his conquests. Khalid thereupon called upon the Sheikhs of Bahrein for payment of tribute, and advances were made by the Egyptians towards Eastern Arabia. Byyptian Overtures to Muscat and Trucial Oman, 1839. 58. For this purpose they employed Sa’ad bin Mutlak, who, during the lifetime Bo g el of the Amir Turki, had been the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, but who had XXIV, 156, been removed by his son, Feisul, and who possessed great personal influence among 209, 336, the Arab tribes “ as well as a perfect knowledge of their various and conflicting interests.” Sa’ad was despatched by the Egyptians to Ras-al-Khaimah to persuade ^ or&gt; { the chiefs of the Oman coast to acknowledge the authority of the puppet Amir 1100-3. 3076 D12 Khalid. A letter addressed b.y him to the Sultan of Muscat, directing Muscat to assist or he considered an enemy, was returned, but the Jowasimi Chief of Shargah at his instigation, summoned the Beni Naim, “ who had lately got possession of Baraimi,” to surrender it to the Nejdis. The Beni Naim refused and appealed to Abu Dhabi and the Chief of Sohar in Muscat for aid against the common enemy Bepresentatious were also made to the Political Resident. British Countermeasures and Support for Beni Naim of Baraimi. 59. H.M. Government were at this time principally concerned to reduce Mehemet Ali to his proper position as a Turkish vassal and to prevent any further Egyptian advance in Eastern Arabia. The application of the Beni Naim chiefs was therefore well received ; the Resident held out hopes that a British agent would be sent to Baraimi (Captain Hamerton subsequently visited the oasis in January-February of 1840); and he undertook, if necessary, to supply ammunition to the Chiefs. The Lor I 457 Multan of Muscat, who had at first shown a disposition to take the side of the ’ ’ ’ Egyptians, in the hope of re-establishing his ascendancy over Bahrein, was informed of the attitude of H.M. Government, and was called upon to support the Beni Naim chiefs, a request to which he acceded. The Resident, after a formal protest against the proceedings and intrigues, of the Egyptian Commander as being in direct opposition to the assurances which had been given by Mehemet Ali to H.M. Govern ment, obtained a written agreement from the maritime chiefs of Oman to cultivate close relations with the British Government, to abide by its wishes and instructions, and to lesist to the last extremity all attempts by the Egyptian Commander to subdue them. Withdrawal of Egyptian Agent under British pressure. 60.. The Sheikh oi Shargah, at his own request, was furnished with a document requiring him to demand the immediate departure of the Egyptian Agent. This was communicated to the Agent, who*was also informed that, the British Govern ment having taken the chiefs and tribes of Naim in Baraimi under their protection, he would be held responsible for any injury to them; and he was required, in accordance with the assurances given by Mehemet Ali, to withdraw from Trucial Oman. After lepeated remonstrances he quitted the Trucial Coast and, embarking at Shargah (where he is alleged to have been assured by the Sheikh that if he returned to Oman in force Shargah would join him and place all its resources at his disposal), proceeded to Ojair. The withdrawal of Sa’ad Bin Mutlak was a severe blow to Egyptian influence and is stated to have broken up the combination rapidly forming in favour of Mehemet.Ali. The Government of India approved the action taken by the Resident, but intimated to him that they would not be prepared to extend protection to Baraimi.

This modification of their attitude was directed by onc^the Eur0 P eai ! ratl ' er th f. n of Arabian policy.

Between 1824 and 18ol the Wahabi Amirs re-established their control over Hasa. By 1833 the}^ had established themselves at Baraimi, and in general control of drucial Oman.^ Between 1836 and 1839 they were for the second time decisively defeated by the Egyptians, the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner and the Wahabi power temporarily destroyed. Baraimi was recaptured by the Beni Naim about 1838. 1 hanks to Butish pressure, efforts by the Egyptians through a former Wahabi agent to establish themselves in Trucial Oman in 1839-40 were defeated. 1840-1870-71.

Amir Feisal bin Turki {second reign), 1842-1865. Amir Abdulla bin Feisal, 1865-1871. 64. For a year at the beginning of this period the Egyptian nominee Khalid remained m control. He was overthrown in September 1841 by Abdulla bin Soneyan, likewise a member of the ruling Wahabi family. Abdulla was himself overthrown m May-June of 1842 by the ex-Amir Feisul bin Turki, who had now been released by the Egyptians and who thus regained the Wahabi Amirate, which he held until his death in 1865. During this period the Wahabis re-established themselves m Nejd and Hasa and to a considerable extent regained their influence m Trucial Oman, though from 1853 to 1865 it was less marked than it had been in the past. They repeatedly conducted aggressions against the Sultan of Muscat, but their relations with H.M. Government were on the whole good, although HAL Government found it necessary to prevent them from aggression against Bahrein m 1851 and 1859, against the Trucial States in 1855, and against Muscat in 1852 and 1865-66. The following are the main features in the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with their neighbours in Eastern Arabia and with the British Government during the period in question. Muscat and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 65. Sa’ad bin Mntlak, the Wahabi Lieutenant, established himself at Baraimi in 1845 and gave indications of an intention of taking active steps against the Lor. I 1113- Sultan of Muscat. A protest was received from the Resident, who supported his 14. representations by a British naval demonstration. Towards the end of 1845 an agreement was reached under which Muscat was to pay a tribute of 5,000 dollars and the Wahabi forces were withdrawn. In 1849 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who Bo. Sel. had had hopes of support from the Sultan of Muscat in his campaign against the XXIV, 218, Wahabis, finding that it was unlikely that his hopes would be realised, made peace with the Wahabis. In March 1850, however, Muscat, in concert with Abu Dhabi, 460, 493 ' organised an expedition against the Wahabis. In 1852 the Wahabi Amir sent his son Abdulla on a mission to Trucial Oman with a view to redressing the grievances alleged to be entertained by the Oman Sheikhs against Muscat. Hostilities broke out shortly thereafter between the Wahabis and Muscat, which were concluded at the end of 1853 by an offensive and defensive alliance by which Muscat undertook to pay tribute of 12,000 dollars (with arrears of 60,000 dollars and certain provisions and stores), the Wahabi Amir on his part undertaking to assist the Sultan in every hour of emergency. It was agreed that the boundaries of both parries should remain unchanged. In December of the same year the Wahabis responded to a demand by Muscat under the terms of the treaty that they should bring the Batineh tribes, who had refused to pay tribute, back to their allegiance. The Disputes of 1864-66. 66 . Towards the end of 1864 the Chief of Rostack in Muscat, whose family had been dispossessed of Sohar in 1840, informed the Sultan of Muscat that he proposed to transfer his allegiance to the Wahabis and to pay them tribute. The Sultan suggested that the differences which had arisen should be decided by the Political14 P.R. to Bo. 21.1.65, Nejd Precis, §§ 77-117. Lor. I, 473- 4. S. of S. to G. of L, ? 8.11.65. Bo.

Resident but Colonel Pelly reached the conclusion that it was open to ques ion whether the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, in the support he had given to the Clue rf Rostack was acting under instructions from the Wahabi Amir. It transpired that the differences which had arisen had a two-fold aspect: the first the rebellion of the Chief of Rostack ; the second and more important a demand on he part .. of the Wahabi Amir for an increased annual tribute from the Sultan, coupled with a threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. 67 In August 1865 the Beni bu Ali and the Jenabah tribes of south-east Muscat, both of them Wahabi by religion, captured bur, inflicting considerable damage on British Indian subjects. A protest was at once made to the Wahabi A“r 0 an d to his deputy at Baraimi on behalf of the British Government and the Resident was authorised to take, in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer, such measures as they might think likely to promote an arrangement between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan. “He is not, however, to undertake anything on land.” Undertakings secured from Wahabis, 18bb. 68 The Amir defended the action of his Lieutenant on the ground of an agreement alleged to exist between the Wahabi State and the British Govern,nent a statement for which there proved to be no foundation. The discussions which subsequently took place were unfruitful It proved necessary to bombard and destroy the‘forts of Sur, and to destroy a Wahabi tower at Ajman and certain Wahabi warships which were lying at Qatif; and the Wanabi Amir, faced with th e &lt;, e evidences of a positive British intention to support the Sultan of Muscat and to secure reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted sent an envoy to Bushire early in 1866, who requested the Resident, on behalf of the Amir, to mediate between the Amir and the British Government, and gave undertakings that no attack would be made upon British subjects residing in territories under the authority of the Amir or upon the territories “ of the Arab tribes m alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than m receiving the zakat that has been customary of old. The overtures made by the Amir were accepted by the Government of India and friendly relations were restored. Watiit&gt;TQ TXT TT/^tT 4 T O AT A xr 1 RAO—1 S70 The Amir Khalid and the Trucial Sheikhs, 1841. 69. In October 1841, on the Amir Khalid threatening to send a force into Oman, a British officer was deputed to inform him, both orally and in writing, that II.M. Government would disapprove of such a measure. The Amir disavowed any intention of adopting it and would apparently in any event have lacked t e force to give effect to it. This was perhaps as well, as the maritime Arab cniets, though outwardly professing their determination to maintain theii independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him. Overtures of the Amir Abdulla, to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1842. 70. In February 1842 the Amir Abdulla addressed letters to the Sheikhs of Oman intimating his intention of sending Sa’ad bin Mutlak as his deputy to them and requesting them to afford him every aid and assistance. 4he originals of these letters (save in the case of Abu Dhabi, where the Sheikh refused to surrender the letter addressed to him) were obtained by the Political Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereupon formally protested to the Wahabi Amir against his attempt to bring the Trucial Sheikhdoms under Wahabi influence, on the ground of the ill-effects which had hitherto resulted “from the establishment of Wahabi interests among the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government The Amir, in reply, declared his intention of co-operating with the Biitisb Government to stamp out piracy and added that he had promulgated this to the people of Oman, whom he referred to as his subjects. 4he correspondence dropped with the overthrow of the Amir Abdulla in May-June of 1842, but it may be noted that in their published reply to the letters received from the Amir, the Sheikhs of Baraimi claimed a species of connection with the British Government (no doubt based on the encouragement given them in 1839—paragraph 59 above), although there was reason to believe that secret letters of a different tenour had also been despatched to the Amir by the Wahabi partisans among them.Overtures of the Amir Feisul to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1843. 71. In 1843 the Resident concluded a Maritime Truce for a period of 10 years Aitch. XII, with the Trucial Sheikhs. Following the example of his predecessor, the new Amir, Feisul, in July 1843 wrote to the maritime and inland Sheikhs of Oman, gkitimating his intention shortly to send an army under Sa’ad Bin Mutlak to bring *ie Province under his authority. Abu Dhabi and Shargah in the same month made a composition of their differences, and on receipt of the Amir’s letrer Debai alone of the maritime Chiefs appears to have been disinclined to submit to Wahabi authority. Inland, however, the Beni Naim chiefs of Baraimi asked for the support and assistance of the British Government against the Wahabi Amir, but in vain (cp. paragraph 97). Xo. xxii, pp. 250-1. Lor. I, 706. Ai^rival in Oman of Saad bin Mutlak (1845) and reoccupation of Baraimi. 72. No marked advance appears to have been made by the Wahabis until 1845, when Sa’ad bin Mutlak arrived in the vicinity of Baraimi. The Beni Naim, in the absence of any support or reassurance from Great Britain, at once submitted, while the Resident, in reply to enquiries by the Regent, in the absence (in Zanzibar) of the Sultan of Muscat, as to the course to be adopted in face of the Wahabi Bo - ^ el - requests for submission, advised that, provided the terms proposed by the Wahabis were not extravagant, they should be accepted. If they proved excessive, the Regent should reply that he could not accede to them without first consulting the British Government, wdiose ally he was. Opposition to Wahabis. 73. Sa’ad bin Mutlak’s course proved less smooth than may have been expected. On his arrival Wahabi influence was so great in Trucial Oman as to endanger the security of Muscat. But it was soon severely shaken by a refusal on the part of the Beni Said tribe to pay tribute, and by the punishment administered by them to the envoy of the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was unable to persuade the maritime Sheikhs to assist him against them, Protests against Wahabi aggressions on Muscat were also received from the Resident. By the end of the year a reaction against the Wahabis had taken place in Trucial Oman. Umm al Qaiwain alone of the Trucial Sheikhs now supported the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was isolated at Bo. Sel. Baraimi. Of the other tribes the Beni Said were joined in opposition to him by the xx I\ r , 218- A1 Said and the Abu Rashid, while the Muttawas, the Beni Naim and the Chief 9 ’ of Sohar formed a separate alliance with the same object. “ The effect of these two separate confederacies, both composed of powerful and numerous followers,” must “ have been highly beneficial and tended greatly to prevent the inordinate aggrandise ment of the Wahabi power in the Province of Oman.” 74. The next few years show in a conspicuous degree the volatile and uncertain nature of the relations of the Trucial Sheikhs (who in 1847 entered into an anti slavery treaty with H.M. Government) both with one another and with the Wahabis. In 1845 Abu Dhabi united with his hereditary enemy Shargah to crush Ajaman, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain. In 1847 Debai joined Shargah. In January 1848 Shargah found himself isolated and opposed by a combination of the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. Later in 1848 hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi and the Wahabi Lieutenant in Oman. Capture of Baraimi by Abu Dhabi (1848) and its Restoration to Wahabis (1849). 75. On 16th June the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi captured Baraimi, the garrison surrendering; defeated a Nejdi expedition sent to restore the position, and h compelled the Wahabi Agent to take refuge with the Sheikh of Shargah. But the successes of Abu Dhabi aroused the apprehensions of the other Trucial Sheikhs, who now combined against him, and the Sheikh, support from Muscat seeming improbable, in February 1849 made peace with the Wahabis and agreed to restore the Baraimi forts to the Wahabi Agent. Muscat and Abu Dhabi attack the Wahabis, 1850. 76. In March 1850 Muscat and Abu Dhabi concerted a joint expedition against ^ the Nejdis of Baraimi, who w r ere supported by all the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. XXIY, ’ But Shargah and his allies directed their operations against the Batineh coast of 493-4, 505.16 Muscat, which they had conquered by May of 1850, and a truce was then concluded with Muscat. In November 1850, however, Shargah, Abu Dhabi, and the Beni Naim of Baraimi were again allied against the Wahabis. In 1851, Abu Dhabi and Shargah having reached an understanding (one result of which was to make Debai draw closer to the Wahabis), Abu Dhabi assisted Bahrein against the Wahabi Amir^ Expedition of Abdulla bin Feisal to Oman, 1852. 77. Towards the end of 1852 the Wahabi Amir despatched his son, Abdulla, to Trucial Oman. Abdulla is stated to have come “ in the character of arbiter and redresser of wrongs suffered by his people (the Sheikhs) in Oman at the hands of Muscat.” He established himself at Baraimi, supported by an imposing force, and called upon all the maritime and inland Sheikhs to attend him. All the maritime Sheikhs responded to this summons with the exception of Debai, who sent Bo Set. bis uncle to represent him, but explained to the Resident that he was opposed to XXIV.232, the presence of Wahabis in Oman. Shargah, anxious to injure Muscat, lent his 359, 496, fullest support to the Wahabis and urged an attack on the Batineh. Abu Dhabi 507, 520. thereupon adopted an opposite course, intimated that he would not be prepared to co-operate personally in such a policy, and disbanded most of his forces. The Resident and the Wahabis, 1852—1853. 78. Meanwhile, the Resident was anxious to renew the maritime truce concluded for 10 years in 1843 and? called upon the Trucial Sheikhs to attend him for this purpose. The Trucial Sheikhs other than Debai were all at Baraimi, and Umm al Qaiwain, in particular, “ in seeking permission to return to his port for the purpose of meeting the Resident, had some degree of restraint imposed on his actions.” Shargah also alleged that he was detained at Baraimi. He was instructed in reply to proceed forthwith to the coast. The Resident informed the Wahabi Commander of his extreme surprise that any circumstances whatever should induce him to prevent the Sheikhs from obeying his call, and a warship was sent to patrol the Trucial Coast. These measures proved effective, the Sheikhs repaired to the Resident, and on the 4th May 1853 signed as independent rulers the Perpetual Maritime Truce at Shargah. Aitch. XII, Xo. xxiv, pp. 252-3. Bo. Sel. XXIY, 292. Trucial Oman in 1854. 79. A report from the Resident in 1854 remarks that the Trucial Sheikhs “ are independent, but acknowledge the feudal supremacy of the Wahabi ruler whenever his own power, or their dissensions, may place him in a position to exercise it. Their chiefs are expected to afford military aid in his expeditions and to furnish supplies to his troops when present, as in the case of the garrison at Baraimi in Oman. The territorial possessions of the maritime chiefs are confined to the inhabited spots on the sea coast and may be said to be bounded by the walls of their towns and the date gardens in their immediate vicinity. . . . The maritime tribes are closely related to the nomad tribes in the interior, over whom the chiefs of the former exercise a limited control.” Shargah, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain are described at this time as belonging to the Wahabi sect.

But despite the imposing character of the Wahabi mission to Oman in 1853, the power of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi had by 1854 fallen to a low point. “ Having no longer any material force at his command he was reduced to maintaining his position by petty intrigue and playing off one Sheikh against another.” In 1854 he was reported to be exercising a restraining influence on the Wahabi Amirs. But in the following year he was involved in intrigues against Shargah, and in that year the Naim of Baraimi suggested to the Resident that British influence should be used for the expulsion of the Wahabis. The Resident, however, explained “ that the policy of Government was now one of non-intervention in internal affairs, and himself merely continued to avoid, as his predecessors had done since 1840, direct communication with or recognition of the Wahabi representative.” 81 81. In 1855-56 the Chief of Abu Dhabi was expelled from his State, and appealed to the Amir to instruct his Agent in Oman to assist him. With the assistance of the Agent the ex-Sheikh re-established himself in Abu Dhabi.Wahabi Influence in Trucial Oman in 1865. 82. The Political Resident in 1865 prepared a map, of which a copy is attached as P.R. to Appendix C, showing the positions of the Wahabi power and the minor Chieftains Bo-, ^o. n, friendly to it, and of the Sultanate of Muscat and the minor Chieftains friendly to it. 14 - 2 - 6 °- pis covering despatch drew attention to the extent to which in the east of the peninsula the interests of Muscat and the Wahabis were interlaced. It will be observed that Abu Dhabi and Debai are classed as supporters of Muscat, and that Qatar and a fairly deep fringe along the Trucial sea coast are shown as falliug outside the Wahabi sphere. Fall of Baraimi and Destruction of Wahabi Power in Trucial Oman, 1869. 83. Little of moment appears to have occurred in the Trucial area between 1856 and 1870. In 1864-66 the Trucial Sheikhs appear to have stood aside from the struggles between Muscat and the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabis undertook not “ to injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the Lor. T, 727. British Government . . . further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.” In 1867 the ex-Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah unsuccessfully sought for Wahabi intervention. In April 1869 the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, having- involved himself in the affairs of Shargah, was murdered there. In June 1869 the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi and formed an alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, originally directed against the other Sheikhs of Oman, whom the Sultan suspected of favouring the Wahabis. But on the Sheikh of Shargah joining this alliance all danger from the Wahabis came to an end, and, with the reassertion of Turkish influence farther west in 1870-71 and the gradual collapse of the Saudi dynasty, Wahabi influence ceased to be of importance in Trucial Oman, save in a purely religious sense, for half a century. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 84. Bahrein assumed a dominating influence in Qatar throughout most of this period. In 1851 there was risk of the establishment of Wahabi influence in it, but a peace arranged in July of that year removed any risk of the dispossession of the Sheikhs of Bahrein by the Wahabis. Bahrein tributary to Wahabis in respect of Qatar, 1866. 85. In 1866 the Political Resident, after a careful investigation, expressed the view, which was accepted by the Government of India in 1867, that the Sheikh of Bahrein probably owed fealty to the Wahabi Government on account of his Lor. 1, 892. possessions in Qatar and that the tribute of 4,000 dollars a year which he at that time paid to the Wahabi Amir tc was regarded as a payment made to secure his subjects in Qatar from aggression by other tribes of the mainland.” The Amir appears at one time (between 1852 and 1856) to have had a representative of his Lor. I, 800. own at Dohah. But Lorimer expresses the opinion that it is probable that this agent was only the local Sheikh. 86. By 1868 the El Thani family had obtained a dominant influence in Qatar. Lor.

From 1843 to 1847 the Wahabi Amirs from time to time lent a considerable degree of support to the dispossessed Sheikh Abdulla of Bahrein, and in 1845 the ex-Sheikh unsuccessfully attempted to capture the islands with their assistance. Lor. I, 880. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein, a corresponding request by the Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to enlist the Sheikh of Debai against the Wahabis Being equally refused in November of the same year. In August 1847 a treaty of peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh, under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed to abandon his support of the ex-Sheikh. 88. In 1850-51 the Amir was prevented from taking and possibly subduing Bahrein by the intervention of H.M. Government, and a peace by which Bahrein Lor. I, 1112 agreed to pay tribute w r as concluded between the Sheikh, and the Wahabis in July of that year. In the following year, the Sheikh proposing to withhold his tributemm Nejd Precis, § 67. r r 18 from the Wahabi Amir, on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In 1853 the Government of Bombay were authorised to afford every obstacle to an attack on Bahrein by the Wahabis (who were now nominally subject to the Turkish Government). In 1859 a Wahabi attack was again averted by British intervention, but the Amir formally asserted his authority over Bahrein, declaring that he wa^ himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey (see paragraphs 91 and 105 below) ; iiT 1801 it proved necessary to bring pressure to bear on the Sheikh to discontinue a blockade of the Wahabi ports which he had instituted, and, later in the same year, to take forcible action for the removal of the Bahreini pretender from Qatar, despite the support accorded to him by the Wahabis. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 89. In 1841 the ex-Amir Khalid took refuge in Koweit. In 1863 relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and the then Wahabi Amir were friendly, but no tribute was paid to the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir, “ who maintained an agent at Koweit for political purposes, as his father too had done even so early as 1851,” was prepared to assist the Sheikh in a quarrel between the latter and the Turks. The Wahabis and Turkey, 1840-1870. Wahabi Tribute to Turkey. 90. In 1862 the Consul-General at Bagdad stated that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40 “Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities at Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion.” Amir 'professes to be a Turkish Dependent, 1855. Turkish Claim to Suzerainty, 1862. 91. In 1841 the Porte, having received presents from the puppet Amir Khalid, advanced claims to authority over Nejd and appointed him Wali of Nejd on their behalf. In 185! the Amir was understood to pay tribute to the Porte, despite the fact that “ accredited envoys of the Pasha of Egypt were present in his camp and the Wahabi agent at Koweit professedly supported Egyptian interests.” In 1855 (see paragraph 105 below) the Amir stated in terms, in writing, that he was a dependent of the Turkish Government and that the dependence of Nejd on Turkey had been made clear to Mehemet Ali in 1839. In 1859, again in writing, he referred to treaties between Nejd and the Porte (paragraph 106 below). In°1862 a 1 urkish protest against the bombardment of Damman in Qatar, on the ground that, as lying within the territories of “ Feisul Beg the Kaimakam of Nejd,” it was “ part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan,” was rejected (paragraph 108 below). Wahabi Appeal to Turkey, 1866. Bagdad ]r. 92. In 1866 the Amir sent an envoy to Bagdad complaining of English aggression id’ ’ U P°P' coas f 01 Nejd and its dependencies, and soliciting Turkish intervention against its recurrence, and the Turkish Wali raised the matter officially with the British Consul-General, and “loudly asserted the suzerainty of the Sultan over ^ ^ ie iollowing month the envoy was abruptly dismissed; and the Consul-General conjectured, in the light of further discussion with the Wall, that the explanation was that the Amir, “ when urged by the authorities of Bussorah to be more explicit in his communications, not only evaded compliance, but signified us lepudiation of I urkish supremacy by despatching envoys to Bushire to treat with the Resident, while on the other hand the Ottoman Ministry at Constantinople . . . probably pointed out the inexpediency of extending to more iemote tribes and principalities in Arabia that condition of quasi dependence which is tound only too onerous and embarrassing in the case of the Bedouin tribes. . . A rr Nothing further of importance emerges in regard to the relations between turkey and the Wahabi Amirs between 1865 and 1870, but thereafter the Turks took immediate advantage of the dissensions which had broken out in the ruling ami y conquered Hasa in 1871, and re-established themselves in that Province and m Nejd. Lor. I, 1110 - 1 .The Wahabis and H.M. Government, 1840-1870. Overtures of Amir Khalid, 1841. 94. On the Amir Khalid being appointed by the Turkish Government in 1840-41 S Wali of Nejd, he addressed a friendly letter to the British native agent at Bahrein pressing an earnest desire to renew 44 tne amicable and cordial relations which formerly subsisted between his late father, Saud, and the British Government, and Bo. Sel. hinting that he had wished to open the correspondence at an earlier date but that ^ 1 ’ n0 ^ he had been prevented by Mehemet Ali Pasha. British Warning to Khalid against Aggression on Oman, October 1841. 95. In October 1841 the Government of Bombay deputed a British officer to visit Khalid at his camp in Hasa, consequent on rumours that he contemplated the invasion of Oman. He gave satisfactory guarantees that he had no such intention. 96. In 1842 overtures made to the Trucial Sheikhs by the Amir Abdulla, who Lor. 1,1108. had overthrown Khalid in February 1842, drew a formal protest from the Resident. In 1843 the Amir Feisul, having overthrown the Amir Abdulla, intimated to the Trucial and inland Sheikhs of Oman that he proposed to bring that area under his authority. British Assistance refused to Beni Naim of Baraimi, 1843. 97. The Chiefs of Baraimi thereupon in November 1843 applied for the aid of Bo. Sel., the British Government. They were informed in reply that “the communications XXIV, 454. formerly entered into with them by the British Government had reference solely to the advance of the Egyptian troops and the connection subsisting between H.H. Muhammad Ali Pasha with Nejd, but that these circumstances being now altogether changed and the impending danger removed by the departure of the troops under Khurshid Pasha from that province, it was now the intention of the British Government to withdraw from all interference in the internal affairs of Arabia.” Overtures by Amir Neisal, 1843. 98. At about the same time the Wahabi Amir on his side informed the Resident Bo. Sel., of his anxiety for the renewal of the amicable relations which bad formerly existed between his father, Turki, and the British Government. An appropriate response D ’ * was made to this communication, and the Amir was also informed that the sole object of the British Government in this quarter was the suppression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gulf. Policy of Government of India and Government of Bombay, 1843-1845. 99, The Government of Bombay, having at about this time suggested doubts as Nejd Precis, to whether the Wahabi Amir should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence § 50-2. at Bahrein and over the Arab chiefs who were in treaty relations with H.M. Government, were informed by the Government of India that it was “not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings of the Chief.” 100. The Government of Bombay reverted to the subject on 26th August 1844, and pointed out that in the 44 now certain event of the Amir Feisal, the legitimate Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to effect this object by sea,” British relations with Oman and the maritime Arab Chiefs might be affected and the resumption of piracy facilitated. They suggested the possibility of an arrangement with the Amir ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea; 44 In other words, that as the price of forbearance on the part of the British Government this chief should become a party to its maritime engagements, whereby commerciaHnterests may be secured.” The Government of India took no action on this suggestion. 101. Early in 1845, consequent on the re-establishment of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi and his inroads into Muscat, the Bombay Government again consulted the Government of India as to the action to be taken if Muscat asked for British help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied that if 44 the niere “ of establishment of the \Vahabi power in Oman and the reception ot the willing ’ allegiance of the maritime chiefs, whom, on a former occasion, we took under our protection and encouraged to resistance, were to be the only result of the present expedition . . . the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify ^ recis, the opinion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our 3076 FLor. I, 881. Lor. 1,1112. Il § i m&amp;y,- Ml Nejd Precis, §61. r interference is not called for.” If, however, the Amir’s purposes appeared to be to encroach on Muscat, or if “ the result of these proceedings is found detrimental to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppression of piracy,” a case for interference would arise, and in such an event it might be desirable that the Government of Bombay should warn the Amir that oup forbearance would be extended no further. Such an expression of the vie\l&gt; of the British Government would probably be sufficient to cause him to desist from active operation against Muscat. At any rate, a demonstration by sea by the British naval forces would produce the desired effect. If the Government of Bombay considered “ that the mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone would in all probability effect what is desired ” they were given discretion to proceed accordingly. Otherwise, they should refer for further instructions to the Government of India. A strong naval demonstration was subsequently made, and forcible remonstrances addressed by the Political Resident both to the Amir, and to his Lieutenant at Baraimi resulted in the conclusion of an understanding between Muscat and the Amir. 102. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Government of India to borrow aid against Bahrein from Trucial Oman, a corresponding request from Bahrein being likewise refused. Bahrein supported against Wahabis, 1851. 103. In 1851 the Amir, consequent on British naval intervention, found himself obliged to come to terms with the Sheikh of Bahrein. Muscat supported in Negotiations with Wahabis, 1852. 104. In 1852 the Resident, on Abdulla, son of the Amir, entering Oman, remonstrated sharply with him for detaining at Baraimi the maritime Chiefs at a time when he (the Resident) desired their presence to discuss a renewal of the maritime truce, and negotiations between Muscat and the Wahabis were facilitated by a British naval demonstration along the Arabian coast. Correspondence with Amir, 1855. 105. In January 1855 the Resident pointed out to the Imam that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent Powers. The Amir’s reply is of some importance. He stated that “ being a dependant of the Exalted Turkish Government I hold the confirmation of the Sultan to my con tinuance in authority over all the Arabs. To exemplify this, when Mehemet Ali Pasha . . . deputed his envoy to me, professing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his interests in respect of the coast of Oman and elsewhere within the peninsula of Arabia and to offer no hindrance or opposition ... I replied ‘ You know that I am a dependant of tbe Sultan of the Faithful, from whom, if you possess orders to that effect, let me be informed of them. Otherwise this thing is impossible.’ Thereupon war broke out between me and him wdiich lasted two years, and intelligence thereof duly reached the Sublime Porte and they (the Sultan’s Government) greatly rejoiced and were much pleased with me and my influence and consideration wdth them increased exceedingly. May God perpetuate their rule and the glory of their state.” “ With regard to what you observe, that engagements have existed between the chiefs of the coast of Oman and the Resident for a period of 30 years, this is well known to me, their object being to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of wdiich I quite approve on the part of Residents—both those who have gone before and those who come after—for there is an understanding between us and the British Government of 100 years’ duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas. The coasts of Oman, howmver, and the territories thereof appertain to the peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority. Further, the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes are more powerful than, and have the command over, the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained from preying upon and slaughtering them, but that I maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds them back from the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection ; otherwise, w r ere they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when, owing to their negligence, disagreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed havearisen between some of the Chiefs of the coasts aforesaid, there was none could check them aud restore order and goodwill among them except the Lieutenant in L or j charge of Oman, whose office is among the things pleasing to God and his Prophet, Nejd Precis’ as also to the Sultan of the Faithful.” § 61. Further Correspondence with Amir, 1859. 106. In 1859, the Wahabi Amir threatening to support the Bahreini pretender, Muhammad bin Abdulla, against the de facto chief, the Persian Gulf Squadron was despatched to Bahrein, with the result that the Wahabi Governor of Qatif abandoned his designs and begged for pardon. The Amir, however, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of Bahrein was one of his feudatories Lor x 887 . whom he had a perfect right to chastise for various misdeeds, strongly protested JSTejd Precis against British interference and added that “ between the Wahabi Amir and the § 63. British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority, and, in accordance with treaties between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan Abdul Mejid, there are matters which everyone is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.” The Resident replied that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Sheikhdom and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of H.H. the Amir, by every means in its power. Ide added that the Amir’s claim to be a dependant of Turkey was inconsistent with the piracies which were at the same time being committed by his Lieutenant at Qatif on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Bombardment of Damman, 1861. 107. In June 1861 the Amir was required to eject the Bahreini pretender from Damman in Qatar, and was advised to enter into a peaceful convention with the ruling Sheikh. No answer having been returned, the Persian Gulf Squadron forcibly compelled the Pretender to flee from Damman in November 1861. The Wahabi garrisons took no steps to molest the Squadron. Turkish Protest and British Reply, 1862. 108. A Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman—a place which, '\ t 'i p ' ‘ as lying within the territory of “ Feisul Beg, the Kaimakham of Nejd,” “ was part of § 67 leC ' S, the hereditary dominions of the Sultan was received from the Turkish Wali of Bagdad at the end of 1861. The British Consul-General at Bagdad replied that H.M. Government had hitherto “ always maintained direct relations with Amir Feisul as well as with all the chiefs and principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf.” In the prosecution of our pacific policy in the Gulf, which was well known, we 41 have never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State an authority and jurisdiction, moreover, which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.” The Consul-General, in reporting the correspondence to the Ambassador at Constantinople, remarked : B :1 d , “ Although it may not be denied that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in Const!,' ° 1839-40 Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, 1.1.62.’ his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is •certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction or attempted to extend its authority over that country. ... In point of fact the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country, and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, I feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty’s Indian Government in that quarter.” Resident authorised to mediate between Muscat and the Wahabis, 1864, 109. Towards the end of 1864, serious difficulties having arisen between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabi Amir consequent on the endeavours of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi to secure a substantial increase in the amount of zakat Ne - d Pr g cis paid by Muscat to the W ahabis, Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, was § 72. requested to report fully and to employ his good offices if mediation were of any use,, but “ to Jet the Sultan clearly understand that the British Government had no intention of interfering in the differences between the powers on the shores -of the Persian Gulf by aiding one party to coerce the other.”P.R. to Bo., 14.2.65.

This visit is of some importance, as Ibn Sand has tended to suggest (both recently, in 1911 (paragraph 148 below) and in 1913 (paragraph 152 below) r that an agreement (in 1911 alleged to have been oral) was reached between Colonel Felly and his ancestor on this occasion. It may, therefore, be recorded that the Resident’s visit, though subsequently formally approved by both the Government of Bombay and the Government of India, was undertaken on his own initiative and without any previous reference to or sanction of either Government; and that the Resident had no instructions on the basis of which he could have conducted negotiations. The Despatch reporting that he was proceeding to Riyadh remarks : “ I hope that I shall leave the Wahabi Provinces on polite terms with the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi Government. It is possible, also, I may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towards smoothing the present differences between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabis.” No Agreement concluded with the Amir. 111. Colonel Felly’s report on his visit makes it clear that there was no discussion with the Amir regarding the conclusion of any treaty or understanding. Towards the end of the visit, however, the Amir’s Secretary (elsewhere described as a “ frivolous and vindictive mongrel”) intimated that he (the Secretary) “was very desirous that I should enter into some treaty whereby the Arabs of Oman, Soor and the Persian Gulf should be exempted from our slave piracy (sic) ; and receive from ns the same consideration which we had accorded to the Sultan of Zanzibar in entering into a treaty with His Highness confirmatory of the slave trade. The Secretary added that he was empowered by the Amir to offer an exchange treaty binding him to prevent the Arabs of Oman and the Gulf from committing depredations or injuring our telegraph establishments. The manner of the Secretary became somewhat familiar and he stated that, as I was in their capital it would be a convenient time to have a draft of the agreement made. I rebuked his manner ; absolutely refused his request; and gave him his congA” There is no further reference in the report to the conclusion of any agreement, and no reference was made to the point in the Resident’s farewell interview with the Amir, at which, however, the latter “ expressed a wish that in regard to Qatif and Oqair 1 w T ould refer to him if piracy or wrecking happened and that he would punish the aggressor to the utmost . . . begged me in like manner to protect his maritime interest on the Persian coast . . . concluded by expressing a wish that I should write to him . . . and said that his curtness had been owing to his previous relations with the Residency, but that now he would turn over a new leaf and had given instructions accordingly to his Governors on the coasts.” There is nothing to suggest that the Resident concluded any agreement with the Amir, verbally or otherwise, that any understanding or agreement w r as reached during his visit, or that the visit aimed at, or achieved, any object other than the establishment of friendly personal relations, the dissipation of the view previously apparently held that it was difficult if not impossible for a European to penetrate to Riyadh, and some preliminary exploration of the ground in regard to the differences which had arisen between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat. Suggestions that Great Britain might assist the Amir in fighting the Turks or other tribes were not encouraged by the Resident. 112 112. It may be added that among Sir Lewis Felly’s private papers in the India Office there exists a rough private journal of a fragmentary character, which contains inter alia some notes of his conversations with the Wahabi Amir. Here likewise there is no reference to or suggestion of any agreement, but the following- notes are of interest : “ Assurance to my interpreter after my departure that he [the Amir] was very pleased with the visit, that for the future he would open a new book of relations with me, and keep all his proceedings (? unveiled) from and in direct communication with me ” . . . “ Imam’s remark that if more cut off from the world than other States, he was still an independent sovereign and feared; no one.”Colonel Felly on the Felation between the Wahabi Amirs and the Gulf Sheikhdoms. 113. In the general conversations that took place between Colonel Felly and the Amir, the latter claimed sovereignty over all Eastern Arabia, from Koweit to Ras al Hadd. “ Ihis land of Arabia,” he remarked, u from Koweit through Qatif, Ras j^d Khaimah, Oman, Ras al Hud and beyond, which God has given unto us.” He w stated that in previous years the Turks had seized some of his territories, but that he did not fear them. The Resident in the course of his report remarks that the “ quasi-independent chieftains ” along the Arab littoral “ were in fact more or less the puppets of the great inland power of Nejd ” ; and elsewhere that the Wahabi Government “ dominates the western seaboard of the Persian Gulf and that of Oman. It receives tribute, whether in kind or money, from the chieftains of Bahrein, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Umm al Qaiwain, Ajman, Shargah and Ras al Khaimah. It holds an advanced military post at Baraimi, astride between these chieftains and the Sultanate of Muscat, which is also its tributary. . .” He further observed that if the Amir Abdullah, who succeeded Feisul in 1865, were “ enabled to consolidate his power at home and to be assured against our intervention abroad, the result would probably be that the Wahabi confederacy would directly dominate the chiefs of the Pirate Coast; and that all Eastern Arabia, from Koweit to Ras al Hadd, would ultimately, whether willingly or unwillingly, fall under Wahabi influences.” 114. Later in 1865 the Resident, with the approval of the Government of India, offered to mediate between the Amir and Muscat, and British intervention proved necessary owing to the Wahabi activities at Sur referred to in paragraphs 67 and 68 above. Claim by Wahabi Amir that Proceedings of his Agent at Baraimi were justified by an Agreement with Ld.XL. Government, 1865. 115. Meanwhile, the Amir, in reply to the remonstrances addressed to him in regard to the Sur incident, endeavoured to justify his action and defended the proceedings of his Lieutenant at Baraimi on the ground that there existed between the Wahabi Amirs and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Amir Saud, and again ratified in the time of the present rider, Turki. 116. No trace of any such treaty as that mentioned by the Wahabi Amir could be found in the Residency at Bushire or in the records of the Government of India. The Government of India stated that it would be advisable “ for the Bombay Government to inform the Wahabi Amir that the British Government is not aware of the existence of any formal agreement between itself and the Amir, but that if any such document does exist, a copy of it, no doubt, must be in the Amir’s possession, and the Amir will do well to produce it for verification,,” The Amir should likewise be given to understand that any encroachment on the territory of Muscat would be viewed with grave concern. British Punitive Action against Wahabis, 1866. 117. Considerable subsequent discussion and correspondence took place in regard to the affairs of Muscat during 1866, and on the 6th January in that year a formal warning was addressed to the Amir Abdulla, who had succeeded his father Feisul bin Turki on the latter’s death at the end of 1865, with a request for fall and written apologies for the Sur incident. During the month, Wahabi towers and ships were destroyed by the Persian Gulf Squadron, and in February the forts at Sur were equally destroyed by gunfire and a severe punishment inflicted on the local Wahabi tribes. Towards the end of the month letters dated 28th January were received from the Wahabi Amir, which were followed by the despatch of an envoy to Bushire with definite proposals of peace. Wahabi Undertaking of 21st April 1866. 118. The Resident arrived at Bushire on 21st April 1866 and interviewed the Wahabi representative, whose assurances and wishes appeared to be in all respects satisfactory. The envoy gave the following written declaration to Colonel Pelly :—• “I, Mohamed bin Abdulla bin Maneh, am certain on the following points; “lam authorised by Imam Abdulla bin Feisul to request the Sahib, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to become the medium of friendship between Imam Abdulla bin Feisul and the British Government ; Para. 74.

Its acceptance was approved by the Government of India, and the Resident thereupon wrote to the Whhabi Amir a letter from which the following is an extract : — “I have received Your Highness’ friendly letter by the hand of your confidential servant, Md. bin Abdulla bin Mana and suite. “ You state that you are desirous for peace, and your envoy has handed to me a paper, copy of which I enclose and which has been approved by HAL Government. “ If difficulties should hereafter arise as to the payment to be made to you by Muscat, the English Government do not wish to interfere or become guarantee in a matter which concerns you and the Sultan. But the English Government would not object to my using my good offices in arranging the details of an agreement, and your Envoy informs me that in the contingency of such question arising, you will write and request my good offices. . . . “ I hope this may find you in health, and if you have any difficulty send to me a confidential Agent, and I shall always be happy to meet him on friendly terms as I have Md. bin Abdulla bin Manad Basis of a Wahabi Claim that EM. Government had entered into previous Agreements with Wahabi Amirs, 1866. 120. The Resident, in reporting the result of his final interview with the envoy, wrote : “ I asked the Wahabi envoys what the Amir meant by stating in his letters that agreements had existed of old between his (government and the British. Phe envoys replied that the Wahabi Amirs had, from time to time, received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a Treaty Agreement. ...” Government of India and Turkish Claims to Suzerainty, 1866. 121. In connection with the Sur disturbances Sir Lewis Pelly appears to have suggested that Turkish interference should be invoked against the Wahabi Amir. The Government of India, on 11th June 1866, recorded the following comments G of I to 011 this proposal. “ . . . The Government of India entirely concurs with the Bo., No. 602, Government of Bombay in discountenancing Lt.-Col. Felly’s suggestion that the 11.6.66. interference of the Turkish Government should be invoked. Ho good, but much harm, would result from the question of Turkish supremacy over the W T ahabi territory being imported into our relations with the latter power. It has always been, our policy (see letter from H.B.M. Consul-General at Bagdad to our Ambassador at Constantinople, dated 1st January 1862) [paragraph 108 above], to repudiate the Porte’s claim to authority in that quarter; and the Governor-General in Council is satisfied that any deviation from the principle will give rise to complications much to be deprecated.” 122. There were no further developments of importance between 1866 and the fall of Baraimi in 1869. Summary, 1840-1870. 123. At the beginning of this period the Wahabis were subject to the Egyptians. Between 1843 and 1865 they reasserted themselves, re-established themselves (though not apparently on the same scale or with the same influence as in the past) in Trucial Oman, were deterred from annexing Bahrein only by British interference, and conducted operations against Muscat. The Government of India found it necessary to remind them of the independence of the Trucial Sheikhs, and of the special relations between H.M. Government and those Sheikhs (1853, 1855) to defend Bahrein against them (1850-51, 1859), to intervene to prevent them from aggression on Muscat, and to conduct effective expeditions against them or their proteges in 1861 Political A, June 1866, Nos. 64-5.and 1865-66. During the whole of period they appear to have paid tribute to Turkey ; notably in 1855, but also in 1859, they formally claimed to be Turkish dependants, and in 1866 they appealed to Turkey. On the death of the Amir Feisal in 1865 dissensions in the ruling house prepared the way for the invasion £&gt;f the Turks in 1870 and the fall of the Saudi dynasty. Throughout this period Hie Trucial Sheikhs remain to a not inconsiderable extent under Wahabi influence, but retain their independence, and from 1845 to 1869 the Wahabis are in possession of Baraimi and use it as their base in Trucial Oman. The independence of Bahrein (and with it the relative independence of Qatar) is consistently maintained; Koweit falls outside the Wahabi sphere, and Muscat remains, as in the past, an independent State. III.—1870—1901. From the Fall of Baraimi and the Turkish Occupation of Hasa to the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud. Abortive Wahabi Plans to recover Baraimi, 1870-1871. 124. It is unnecessary for the purpose of the matters now specially under consideration to examine the history of this period in any very great detail. Suffice it to say that in 1870-71 active steps were in contemplation by the Wahabi Amirs for the restoration of Baraimi, which at one time caused some apprehension to the Government of India and to the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs, having been approached by the Wahabi Amir with a view to an attack on the fort, returned conciliatory answers, with the exception of Abu Dhabi. The internecine quarrels of the Wahabi ruling family, closely followed by a Turkish expedition into Nejd in 1870 to assist the Amir Abdulla against his brother Saud, led to the abandonment of the prosecution of the war against Oman. Baraimi remained under the control of Abu Dhabi; the Trucial Sheikhs emerged from any form of Wahabi control or influence ; Wahabi influence outside Nejd and Hasa disappeared, and matters remained in this state throughout the whole of the period now under consideration. Turkish Occupation of Hasa, 1871. 125. It may, however, be recorded that in 1870 the Amir Abdulla, having been defeated by his brother, himself appealed to the Turks, with the result that a Turkish expedition occupied Hasa in 1871. In the same year the Turks ceased, •even in appearance, to act on behalf of the Amir Abdulla, and a notification was issued that the “ El Saud has ceased to reign ” and that a Turkish official was appointed Governor of Nejd, and the Amir Abdulla fled to Riyadh. Wahabi Appeals to Great Britain, 1871-1873. 126. In September of 1871, Saud bin Feisal protested to the Political Resident against the activities of the Turks in the Gulf waters. He urged that the peace of those waters was under British protection and begged for British arbitration, a request which was refused. Between 1871 and 187 3 no fewer than four letters were received by the Resident from Saud, in which he represented that he had been “ easy as regards the sea coast in reliance to your answer, the sea being in your charge and protection. . . . The sea is under charge of the Resident, and I was careless about the sea owing to his word.” ... “ The Sircar ”... is “bound to keep peace.” The Government of India informed the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, with reference to these letters, that unless Saud “ w T as a party to the so-called maritime truce or had otherwise received assurances from the British Government he was mistaken in supposing that the British Government had undertaken to protect his territories from attack by sea.” The Resident was instructed to report whether anything had been said or done at any time to commit the British Government, directly or indirectly, to defend him or to use their influence to prevent attacks being made upon him by sea. I he report when received showed that Saud was not a party to the maritime truce and that the British Government had in no way been committed to protecting him by sea. Later communications from Saud showed that he now understood the position and merely hoped for the good wishes and friendship of the British Government, and it was left to the Resident in these circumstances to answer Saud’s latest letter, either then or afterwards, in general terms, expressive of goodwill. “Should he again P.R. to Bo., 10.2.70.

Pol. A. Sept. 1875, 53-8. Amir Sand and the Turks, 1872-1873. 127. A brief reference may be made to the relations between Sand and thF Turks as bearing on the question of the relation of the Saudi dynasty to the Turkish power. In 1872 it was reported that the terms of the understanding contemplated were to be his recognition as the Chief of Nejd on condition of his paying the Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tribute as had been paid by the Amir Feisul. There were certain supplementary conditions which are immaterial. Both he and the Turks professed their anxiety for a settlement on this basis, but no conclusion was reached. In 1872 a letter from Saud offered to invest the Resident with full power of mediation with the Turks, but the negotiations which succeeded again came to no conclusion. In 1873 Saud, now in a stronger position in Nejd, sent Abdul Rahman, the father of the present Saudi King, to Bagdad, with a view to the reaching of an agreement. Abdul Rahman was treated as a hostage and detained until 1874, but negotiations proved unfruitful. In 1875 Saud died and Abdul Rahman was elected Amir of the kingdom of Riyadh “ by the general consent of the people.” Internecine quarrels between members of the Saudi family continued from 1875 to 1880, but in the latter year it was reported that Abdulla and his nephews (including Abdul Rahman) were living in peace and friendship. The nephews possessed Kharj, Hotah, Harik, Aflaj, &amp;c., and had followers of the Ajman, Murra and Dowasir tribes. Rise of the Ibn Rashid Family. 128. In 1881, however, the Ibn Rashid dynasty, assisted by the divisions among the Saudis, gradually established themselves in control in Nejd, and the Saudis, who in 1879 had been reported to exercise control only in Riyadh and the district round it, sank into obscurity for 20 years. The Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail had from 1832 occupied the Jebel Shammar and its Sheikhs had paid homage to the Ne'd Precis Sa'dis. The homage to the Saudis was gradually abandoned with the decay of § 201. k ’ the Wahabi State, and in 1876 Ibn Rashid is described as the greatest prince in Nejd.” In 1888 Ibn Rashid decisively defeated the Saudis and captured Riyadh, and his dynasty remained in complete control in Nejd until 1901. It may be recorded, however, that in 1890-91, on the Saudis regaining Riyadh, both parties Nejd Precis wrote to the Mutasarrif of Hasa, Ibn Rashid to denounce Abdul Rahman as § 217. ’ meditating an attack on Hasa ; Abdul Rahman complaining of Ibn Rashid “ and Extl. A : professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen 40° V 9 18 peb f av0lirab ly to hi m -” The Ibn Rashid family throughout professed allegiance to the 1891 63-4 Turkish Government, though Turkish influence in their dominions appears to have been of the smallest; and even on the occasion of his capture of Riyadh in 1888- Ibn Rashid posed as the officer or lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. Consolidation of British Position on the Arab Littoral of the Gulf, 1870-1901. 129. Between 1870 and 1901 H.M. Government had substantially strengthened their position on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. In 1880 they had entered into an exclusive agreement with the Sheikhs of Bahrein ; in 1887 corresponding agreements were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1892 the agreements both wdth Bahrein and with the Trucial Sheikhdoms were confirmed and strengthened and control of the foreign relations of all the rulers in question passed into the hands of the British Government. Muscat, which had entered into a revised Commercial Treaty with Great Britain in 1891, in 1899 agreed never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwdse give for occupation, save to the British Govern ment, any portion of its territories —an understanding which had at an earlier stage been secured from the Trucial Sheikhs and Bahrein. In 1899 the British Government for the first time established relations on the basis of a positive written engagement with the Sheikh of Koweit and laid the foundations of the situation which emerged 14 years later in the acknowledgment by Turkey under the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 of the autonomy of the Sheikhs of that principality. Turkey established herself in Qatar in 1871 and remained in control throughout the period 1871-1901. Her claim to the principality was never recognised by H.M. Government, and considerable correspondence with the Turkish Government, took place during this period in connection with it.IV.—1901-1914. From the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud to the outbreak of the Great War. 130. Between 1901 and 191o Ibn Saud considerably reduced the importance of the Ibn Rashid family and established himself in Nejd. In 1913 he drove the ■ff’urkish garrisons out of Hasa. During almost the whole of this period he was in frequent contact with H.M. Government, his object being to secure their protection against the Turks. It may perhaps be well, in the interests both of illustrating the terms which he was prepared to offer in return for British protection and of placing on record the various statements made by him during this period as to his maximum ambitions, his attitude towards the area to the east of the Nejd-Hasa border, and to the States of the Arab littoral, and his view of his position vis-d-vis the Turks, to record in greater detail than would otherwise be justifiable the sequence of events and the more important correspondence which passed. 131. In January 1901 Ibn Saud took Ibn Rashid by surprise and conquered Riyadh. He appears to have made overtures to the Political Resident late in 1903 with a view to ascertaining whether he could look for British protection in the event of his conquering Hasa. The Government of India thereupon took up the question of sending a European officer to Riyadh for the purpose of collecting intelligence. They were instructed by H.M. Government that no steps should be taken to enter into closer relations with Nejd or to send an Agent there without prior sanction, and in the light of the Resident’s views, which were also hostile, they did not proceed with the proposal. Ibn Saud appeals for British Protection, 1904. 132. In May 1904, on the Turks taking active steps to support Ibn Rashid, a protest against the Turkish invasion was received from Ibn Saud, who solicited the protection of Great Britain for his country and himself. No answer seems to have been given to these overtures, which were made through the Political Resident. Influence of Abu Dhabi in the Hinterland of the Trucial Coast, 1904. 133. The Political Resident in June 1904 drew attention to the preponderating influence which the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi had recently been exercising in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and referred to the fact that the Sheikh had concluded agreements with the inland Bedouin tribes such as the Beni Khatab, Ghofleh, Khavater, &amp;c. Policy of H.M. Government, 1904. 134. In September 1904 Ibn Rashid and the Turkish troops accompanying him were completely routed by Ibn Saud. The Political Agent, Koweit, asked by the Sheikh what advice he should give Ibn Saud, wdio had enquired whether or not to write to the Turks on the matter, replied that Ibn Saud must consult his own interests and act as he thought best, and that in the absence of instructions from H.M. Government neither the Political Agent nor the Sheikh could give him any advice. 135. On 30th December 1904 the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy that “ H.M. Government desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with the warfare now in progress in the interior.” Saudi Agreement with the Turks, 1905. 136. In February 1905 a meeting took place at Kow r eit between the Sheikh, the Turkish Wali of Basra and Ibn Saud’s father. The latter is stated to have made a humble submission to the Sultan in his own name and that of his son, Abdul Aziz, professing loyalty and devotion io his sovereign and his readiness to obey his commands, and stating that he was prepared to do all he could to assist the Turkish expedition to Qasim. He protested that Ibn Rashid was his enemy and was inciting the Turkish Government against him. After preliminary discussions the Turkish representative produced an order from Constantinople, addressed to Ibn Saud, appointing him ruler of Nejd on behalf of the Turkish 3076 H Vic. tel. 20.5.04.

Government and concluding with the following words: “ The Government will put soldiers in El Kasim, and there will be official relations between you (i.e. Ibn Sand) and them, and all of you will be in the service of the Sultan. As for Ibn Rashid, he shall have nothing to do with affairs in Nejd.” In the following month, how ever, the Turks were still apparently supporting Ibn Rashid against Ibn Saud. ^ Abdur Rahman takes Oath of Allegiance to Turkey, 1905. 137. In May 1905 it was reported that Riyadh, Washem, Sedayr and their dependencies had been formed into a caza of which the centre was to be Riyadh, and that Ibn Sand’s father had been made Kaimakan of the new caza on solemnly taking an oath of allegiance to the Sultan. Projected Visit by Ibn Saud to Trucial Coast, 1905-1906. 138. Towards the end of 1905 information was received that Ibn Saud had visited Katr (still nominally under Turkish rule) and composed certain tribal disputes there, and that he was meditating a visit to the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This news had seriously disturbed the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who had himself been instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabi influence from Baraimi and the Trucial Coast in 1870, and the Sultan of Muscat, both of whom (with the Sheikh of Dabai) belonged to the Hinawi tribe and feared that the arrival of Ibn Saud would be the signal for a combination against them of the remaining Trucial Chiefs who belonged to the Ghafari tribe. Ibn Saud, moreover, was reported to have remarked “ By God, I will explore the country belonging to my father and grandfather from Muscat to Ja.alan.” Views of Government of India and II.M. Government. 139. The Government of India were seriously disturbed as to the possible effect on our position on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat of a visit by Ibn Saud. H.M. Government in the light of their views decided after consultation with the Ambassador at Constantinople that if Ibn Saud appeared on the coast and failed to give satisfactory assurances as to his intentions, he should be warned that any attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or along the Arab coast, either with the Chiefs or with their subjects, would be regarded as an unfriendly act and that steps would be taken to frustrate it. Before these instructions were received, Sir Percy Cox had conveyed a hint in this sense to Ibn Saud through the Sheikh of Koweit (who regarded the proposed visit as a mere attempt to blackmail the coastal Chiefs). The visit, probably owing to the unsettled situation in Nejd, was abandoned. It should be recorded that, on the instructions of H.M. Government, the Trucial Sheikhs were in the same connection warned by the Resident that, on the ground that general unrest prejudicial to British commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result, the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Ibn Saud. Defeat of Ibn Rashid, May 1906. 140. In May 1906 Ibn Rashid and his immediate following of 250 were surprised and annihilated in Qasim by Ibn Saud, and Ibn Saud was reported from Jedda in June of that year to have declared himself, consequent on his victory, ruler of the whole Shark (East) and to have sent letters to Constantinople, Basrah, Bagdad, the Hedjaz, and the Shenf of Mecca. Sir Nicholas O’Conor doubted, however, whether Ibn Saud would be able to cope with the Turks, “ should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan.” Turkish Allowances to Ibn Saud. 141. In August 1906 the Consul at Basrah reported that the allowance granted by the Turks to Ibn Saud was by a recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of Koweit, who deducted it from the land tax on his Eao property. The Sheikh stated that the allowances paid by the Turks were 90 liras a month to Ibn Sand’s father and 200 liras and about 300 tons of rice to Ibn Rashid. In October 1906 the Resident at Bagdad reported a statement that Ibn Saud had m the past received TT.30 a month from .Turkey, with 100 suits of clothes and some grain—an allowance now alleged to have been discontinued.Withdrawal of Turks from Qasim, September 1906. } 42 ' T “ September 1906 inconclusive negotiations took place between the T r U1 i 1S m C ° m “ ander of Qasim and Ibn Sand, and at the end of that year most of the lurkish troops were reported to have been withdrawn from Qasim, a step ■'hick was regarded as a definite success for Ibn Saud. 1 Const, to F.O., 824, 27.12.06. Further Overtures by Ibn Saud to H.M. Government, 1906. 143. As stated above, no reply was sent to the overtures made to H M Government on behalf of Ibn Sand in 1904. Further indirect approaches haviim been made through various channels during 1906 with a view to ascertaining whether H.M. Government would be prepared to give him protection at any rate bv sea to the same extent as it was accorded to the Sheikh of Koweit and other Arab Rulers of the Gulf in the event of his driving the Turks out of Hasa and Nejd', the Political Resident in September raised the general question of policy. Major ’(lox said that he was aware that “ it has been a recognised principle of their (H.M Government s) policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous politics of Central Arabia,” but expressed the view that it might be unwise to carrv aloofness too far. He suggested that an understanding with 'ibn Saud would be of advantage in various ways, and that if we had any intention “ of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems tcTbe the time for us to do so.” Bre. to Gr. of I. 2181 16.9.06, P. 1817/06. Attitude of H.M. Government, 1906. 144. Lord Morley, then Secretary of State for India, replied, however, that H.M. Government maintained the view that their interests and influence should be TeL to vic - 3 confined to the coast, and that no steps should be taken to enter into relations with 9 - 1L06 - Nejd or to send agents into the interior without his previous sanction. Further Overtures to H.M. Government, 1906. 145. Towards the end of 1906 further indirect overtures on behalf of Ibn Saud were received through the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Qatar. The Resident reported that from the statements made by the latter it appeared that the Saud “ considers . that the. oases of Hasa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabi ancestors. He is anxious to recover the two districts and he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the P R. to G. British Government and himself under which he should be granted British of L ’ protection from Turkish assaults by sea in the event of his ever driving the Turks, | 4 unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir 2.12.06, is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the P- 2799/06. Trucial Chiefs) and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. . . . Ibn Saud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hasa and Katif. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasariflik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable, after establishing himself. If his application is refused he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them will appeal openly to the British Government for protection.” Murder of Mutaad ibn Rashid, January 1907. 146. In January 1907 Muta’ad ibn Rashid, the young Amir of Hail, who had p. 2660/07. succeeded his father in the Principality of Jabel Shammar at Hail in September 1906, was murdered by his kinsman Sultan ibn Rashid. Further Consideration of Policy towards Ibn Saud, 1907. 147. On 21st February 1907 the Government of India, in the light of the Resident’s reports, again raised the question of the policy to be adopted towards Ibn Saud. They suggested that if the Turks were really likely to disappear from the stage and Ibn Saud to be a power in the land, “ it seemed desirable that this Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to a friendly understanding wdth us.” But on a review of the various factors in the situation, they expressed the opinion that no immediate response to the advances reported by the Resident was necessary and that the answer to Ibn Sand’s reiterated enquiries might be that Desp.Xo.28, 21.2.07.30 HM Government, “while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long fs he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with the Arab Sheikhs on the coast see no necessity under present conditions for making him any formal prom.ses of protection, which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of h^ authority.” 148. The Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir. Nicholas O’Conor, thought that our rmht policy was “ to intervene as little as possible m the internal affairs of these 7 tribes and let them work out their own destiny as best they can, to wait on events and to modify our policy if subsequently a closer understanding with Ibn Sand seemed desirable. With this view H.M. Government agreed, and they instructed the Government of India that they saw no reason to modify their earlier policy that British interests and influence in this region should be strictly conhned to the coast If it was quite inevitable to give an answer to Ibn band s enquiries, the answer should be that as Ibn Sand’s proposals involved considerations which it was impossible for H.M. Government to entertain, no reply was to be expected to them. Ibn Rashid is defeated and abandons Qasim, 1907-1908. 149 In October 1907 Ibn Rashid was decisively defeated by Ibn Sand and besieged by him in Boreida; and in February 1908 Ibn Rashid entered into negotiations with Ibn Sand and abandoned Qasim to bim.

In May 1908 Ibn Sand was asked by the Turkish Wali of Basra to settle certain tribal differences in Hasa in the Arab way. ^ In July of the same year Sultan Ibn Rashid, himself the murderer in April 1906 of Mita’ad Ibn Rashid, was murdered by his brother Sand, who succeeded as Amir and matte overtures to Ibn Sand. But by September of that year the Consul at Damascus reported that to “ Abdul Aziz Ibn Sand has become practically the undisputed Amir of Nejd, with his ascendancy recognised in Riyadh, Qasim and by all the Bedonin tribes of Nejd. Even Sand Ibn Rashid himself admits that his Amirate of Hail is only a vassalage under the suzerainty of Ibn Sand.” In the same month Sand Ibn Rashid was overthrown, and the Amirate reverted to a minor under a Regency. But by January 1909 the Ibn Rashid faction had to some extent consolidated themselves. \ Const, to P.O., No. 585, 22.7.09. Ibn Saud and the Turks, Jidy 1909. 151. In July 1909 Ibn Sand’s agent at Bagdad, in the course of a discussion with the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, remarked that “Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with the suggestion that he should fly the Turkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Government, and he recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia,” and had actually sent an emissary to take soundings, who had reached Basra, but had returned to Nejd on the news of the Young Turk coup d'etat of April 1909. Ibn Sand’s object and that of many Arabs was Arab independence. If they could not secure this they would prefer the supremacy of a foreign Power to that of the Turks, and the emissary clearly indicated that the Power they had in view was the British Government. i First Conversations between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, 1911. 152. In the spring of 1911 conversations of much importance, though of a Bre. to G. of wholly informal character, took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, I., 20.4.11. then Political Agent, Koweit. Captain Shakespear was the first European whom Ibn Saud had met, and close personal relations appear at once to have been established between them. The Amir described his position and his ambitions in great detail. The following extracts from Captain Shakespear’s Report of the conversation are of interest as illustrating Ibn Sand’s view as to the previous relations of the Wahabi rulers with the British Government, his own relations with Turkey and his attitude to the Trucial Sheikhs :— “ . . . After the Egyptians had been expelled from Nejd, his ancestor^ Turki-Bin-Abdulla, had re-created most of the original Wahabi dominion^ including Hasa, Katif and most of the Oman coast from Qatar to near Muscat,, . . . and had then made a treaty with the British Government . . .”■ '^ le Aniir Feisal bin Turki, on obtaining a pardon from the Egyptians and returning to Nejd in 1842, was at once acclaimed as Imam. He also renewed the old treaty with the British Government.” v ' 1 e British Government showed how close were their relations with -Nejd by sending one of their officers, Colonel Lewis Belly, to Riyadh and he document ” 6 treat ’ eS and friendshi P&gt; thou S h not “ actual’ written ... Since the evacuation of Qasim by the Turks in 1906 there have im ?°, r? 118 ° f r ' rk '? 1 } aut hority in Nejd and Abdul Aziz has so con solidated his power that his word is law over the whole of Nejd from within two days inarch of Hail to the Persian Gulf coast line excepting only the actual towns of Hofuf Katif, and where the Turks maintained garrisons', and as far south as the W adi Dowasir. ... He asserts that he had made no professions [at the time of an expedition against him in 1910 by the Sherif of Meeca] of being the vassal of the Sultan, and being a Wahabi does not admit the Sultan s Khalifate m Islam. . . . The As Sand . . . above all desired to be m relations with the British Government so that the Turkish Govern ment would hesitate to oppress them or to interfere in their affairs in Nejd The new regime in Constantinople had already shown their aggressive polic’v’ and he feared that before very many years there would be another attempt to subjugate Nejd. Though the Wahabis had formerly fought us in regard to the coastal Chiefs’ affairs, they saw the benefit of our rule amongst them and had no wish to alter the present position, though Abdul Aziz mentioned having received a letter from Dibai, whose Sheikhs had written after the Hyacinth gun-running incident, asking to be taken under his protection On enqumng how he reconciled the regular receipt of a Turkish annuity with the claim to absolute independence, Abdul Aziz said that the annuity dated from the. time of his father’s incarceration in Bagdad, was given tlie “ ior 1118 llvm g expenses, aud^has continued ever since as’personal to Abdul Rahman ; it amounts to only £1160 per mensem. The As Saud have never received anything else from the Turks in the way of subsidies, and on ms father’s death Abdul Aziz proposes to allow his subsidy to lapse ’ All the correspondence they had had with the Turkish officials has been of a diplomatic nature, either to effect the removal of troops on the pretext of a show of submission, or to settle any other difficulties as they arose.” 153. The question of policy was again considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office on the receipt of Captain Shakespear’s report. It was agreed however, that it seemed preferable to hold to the existing policy unless the Govern ment of India should piopose a departure from it, when the question could be again considered. British Negotiations with Turkey, 1911-1913. .154. Between 1911 and 1913 H.M. Government were engaged in negotiations with the Turkish Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Peisian Gulf area, which culminated in the Anglo-4 urkish Conventions of July 1913 (paragraph 165) and March 1911 (paragraph 179). Further meeting between Captain Shakespear and Ibn Saud, May 1913. 155. On 15th May 1913 Captain Shakespear, then Political Agent, Koweit, Bre - t 3 , G - of reported that he had met Ibn Saud in the course of a recent tour, in the Koweit og 5 ^ 13 ^’ hinterland, and had spent four days with him. In the course of the visit p. 2448/13. Ibn Saud had discussed his future policy with great frankness with Captain Shakespear, who was in close personal relations with him. Captain Shakespear submitted a detailed report of his discussions, from which the following extracts, bearing on the matters now under discussion, are relevant :— 156. He, Ibn Saud, according to Captain Shakespear, stated that cc his power in Central Arabia had increased till he no longer feared any of its Sheikhs or rulers; he was, moreover, in alliance with all of them, excepting only one, viz. : Capt. the Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz, had Shakespear therefore allied himself with the Turks. The As Saud were prepared to hold Nc/c' io 68 ’’ what they had recovered during the last 15 years of their ancient dominion in is^is. Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the''•vT 32 menace of Turkish aggression only possible from the East by way of Hasa and from the West by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength and to render secure their eastern borders thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the Turks from Hasa and Katif Another most important one was that possession of these ncr districts with their ports, and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue. Moreover, the As Saud had other grounds and just ones for their claim to Hasa and Katif. One was that these districts formerly belonged to their house- another was that the Turks themselves, m a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha s expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession, and on his return to Riyadh he would send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard, but so far had not succeeded in tracing, was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Pelly guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As Saud family would be recognised as the Sheikhs of the Katif District. This document, he said, was the result of negotiations after the naval action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865), when four men named Muhammad bin Ma’ana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh A1 Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisal As Saud as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives with which to test the accuracy of the Amir’s assertions, but I find a declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison’s Treaties, Vol. XII, as No. XXVIII, which seems to bear on this transaction. 157. Captain Shakespear in his report stated that while for want of early records he was unaware of the earlier relations of H.M. Government with the As Saud family, “ I am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures against the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein, but in this connection now I am convinced that ‘ Bin Saud ’ would be only too glad to furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the ‘ Status quo ’ in the future.” 158. Sir Percy Cox, in forwarding this report, remarked: “As regards Captain Shakespear’s references to past history and to certain putative agreements between the British Government and the Wahabi Amir, I think one of the letters to which he refers is probably that addressed by Colonel Pelly to the Amir on 6th January, 1866, in which he alluded to c Your Highness’s Governor of Katif,. . . My own records have not so far produced anything of utility.” Capture of Hasa by Ibn Saud: May 1913. P.R. to Gr. of I., 866, 13.5.13, P. 1921/13. P. 2025/13. P. 2182/13. 159. On 13th May 1913 the Political Resident reported that Ibn Saud had captured Hasa without opposition. On 31st May the Viceroy reported that Sir P. Cox had pointed out that the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which had been under consideration since 1911 with a view to regulating relations between Turkey and H.M. Government in the Gulf Area, and which inter alia dealt with Nejd as a Turkish Sanjak, and the expulsion of the Turks from Nejd and Hasa, were somewhat irreconcilable phenomena, and had suggested the possibility of getting the Turks to look the facts in the face and “ with our help to arrange to include in the Convention a satisfactory solution of the problem, the basis being that Ibn Saud should be recognised as autonomous ruler of Nejd under the suzerainty of the Porte, and that we should be accorded the right to accredit an agent to him as one of the maritime rulers and make agreements with him, with the knowledge of the Porte, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, slave trade and piracy, and our mission in the Gulf generally.” F.O. to I.O., 7.6.13, P. 2286/13.

On 1st August the Government of India reported the death on 17th July of the* Sheikh of Qatar, and stated that the Political Agent, Bahrein, had informed the Resident that while at Katif Ibn Saud had addressed the Sheikh of Qatar and demanded the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from A1 Bidaa. “ Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, reports that Sheikhs of Debai and Abu Dhabi, who are of the. same tribe, have had a conference, and latter, who since the Wahabi evacuation has achieved a paramount position in Baraimi and neighbourhood, is convinced that Ibn Saud will now turn his activities in that direction. In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakhat el Matti {vide page 1200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer) and take the initiative against Ibn Saud. There having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Ibn Saud, I [Sir P. Cox] should not imagine that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by such action, but of course the state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable oppor tunity, if he be so disposed. I am warning Sheikhs of the improbability of such a development, and deterring them from provoking hostilities, but I should be glad to give them, if possible, something reassuring as to the attitude of the British Government towards a possible enterprise of this kind on the part of Ibn Saud.” British Guarantees to Qatar, 1913. 167. The Resident was instructed in reply that the new Sheikh of Qatar “ and, if necessary, Ibn Saud, should be informed that ELM. Government would allow no outside interference in the peninsula. Latter should clearly understand that if he attempts it, he will be forcibly resisted. Former may be told that he has nothing to fear from Turks.” H.M. Government and Ibn Saud as a Potential Danger in the Trucial Area, 1913. 168. On 7th August the Political Resident telegraphed to the Government inter alia that— “ At any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Ibn Saud and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial Coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged if necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in the politics of Central Arabia. Ibn Saud is now at the coast, and for us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protect ourselves against,” Views of Government of India, August 1913. 169. The Viceroy on 10th August in a telegram commenting on the general situation, and urging a modification in the policy hitherto adopted by H.M. Government, said that— “ It is clear from his [Ibn Sand’s] relations with the Sheikh of Katr and the recent reports as to the apprehensions of the Trucial Chiefs that Ibn Saud is becoming a more and more prominent factor in the politics of the Persian Gulf littoral, and has thus brought himself within the sphere of our interests and influence. As long as Ibn Saud confined himself to AI Hasa he could be ignored with impunity. Such a policy, however, cannot in our opinion safely be pursued now that there is a possibility of his inter ference in El Katr, with the Trucial Chiefs, and possibly in Oman, where the rebellion may give him an opportunity for encroachment on Muscat territory Unless we come to some mutual and amicable under-standing with the Amir, who has hitherto been friendly disposed to ns, the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility, which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral. We therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir, but H a friendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him that we expect him not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom w T e have treaty or other relations on the Gulf littoral. We see no reason why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte, to whom our intentions could be clearly explained, there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn the Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him, which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him, we might tell them that our relations with the Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless.” Vieivs of H.M. Government, August 1913. 170. H.M. Government on consideration agreed generally with the Govern ment of India, and on the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, Hakki Pasha was also informally told that H.M. Government owing to the death of the Sheikh of Qatar and subsequent events must in order to carry out their obligations make Ibn Saud either their friend or their enemy; that they could not afford to make him their enemy; and that they therefore proposed to enter into a friendly exchange of views with him in order to regularise the position—a communication which the Pasha received in a friendly spirit and promised to communicate to his Government. 171. In September 1913 Ibn Saud, in reply to the Resident’s letter of 9th July (paragraph 163 above), asked for a clearer explanation of the British attitude. Sir Percy Cox intimated on 11th September 1913 that it was somewhat difficult to give the explanations desired without fuller information as to Ibn Sand’s wishes. He suggested a meeting, and added :— Meanwhile, I have my Government’s authority to assure you that, pro vided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo, or to create unrest, among the Arab Principalities whose rulers are in relation with the British Government, including the Principality of Katr, the independence of which under the Government of the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani family has been recently recognised by the British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain the friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.” Attitude of Turkey: Octoker-December 1913. 172. On 2nd October the Foreign Office intimated that a reply had been received from Hakki Pasha to the communication referred to in paragraph 170 above, in which the Porte expressed their thanks for the friendly offer of H.M. Government stated that they were actually in negotiation with Ibn Saud, and added that if the necessity should arise for recourse to the good offices of H.M. Government the Porte would not fail to avail itself of them. 173. On 15th December the Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Turkish Government had intimated that they proposed to recognise the recent fait accompli in Nejd by nominating Ibn Saud A1 Mutasarif of the district. Discussion between Acting Political Resident, Captain Shakespear, and Ibn Saud: KSth December 1913. 174. Endeavours were made to arrange a meeting between the Political Resident and Ibn Saud towards the end of 1913, and on 16th December Major Trevor and Captain Shakespear met Ibn Saud and had an exhaustive discussion with him. The following points are taken from a memorandum of the interview which was read over to Ibn Saud and in the terms of which he concurred :— “His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for generations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself I.O. to F.O., 13.8.13. F.O. to I.O., 16.8.13. 37510/13. S. of S. to Vic.. 21.8.13. Vic. to S. of S., 5.9.13, P. 3666/13 Bre. to Gr. of I., 2796, 14.9.13, P. 4184/13.

Bedouin tribes are not concerned m weighing the merits of different governments, as they live as nomads w en oppressed move off to another locality In recent years he had been able to consolidate his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Oatif All he wants is to be left in peace and he sees that the Bntisr Government keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf except in this small section of the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the maritime peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as de facto ruler he would be satisfied. If not, he would have to trust in his own sword In the discussion which followed Ibn Baud said he would be glad to co-operate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the maritime truce and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast and to admit British subjects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurances mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. In the course of his remarks Ibn Baud pointed out that though he claimed Trucial Oman and Qatar as part of his ancestral dominions and could make his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of the British Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Qatar and possibly Trucial Oman after he had occupied Hasa and Qatif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Government.” 175. In a separate memorandum the negotiators recorded that Ibn Baud, after the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi had been con cluded, enquired the policy of the British Government “ in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Oman States. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the maritime truce, the slave trade and arms traffic, to which we held the Sheikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Qatar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo- Turkish Convention and said that we assumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference It proved that Ibn Baud’s enquiry was due to the possibility that enemies of his might take refuge in some of these States, and plot against him, and he enquired what the attitude of Government would be in regard to such cases.” The negotiators were unable to state definitely, but promised to refer the matter to higher authority. 4 4 He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people, it might be necessary for him to take reprisals, and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid.” The nego tiators recorded that Ibn Baud had also said 4 4 in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States.” Views of Political Resident. 176 Mr. Lorimer, in forwarding this report, suggested the desirability, in the event of a mutual arrangement being reached between H.M. Government and Ibn Baud, of disposing of the question of his relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settled under their protection. 44 These questions arise from Ibn Baud’s own position as an Arab chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Ibn Baud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Sheikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to prevent or restrain refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence is shown to be injurious to Ibn Baud’s legitimate interests.”1^7- Endeavours were meanwhile proceeding in London to assist in the reaching or an understanding between the Turks and Ibn Saud. A memorandum Sir Percy Cox and communicated to Hakki Pasha on 9th March 1914 remarked that our requirements of Ibn Saud for the maintenance ^and protection of our interests included inter alia “that he should not meddle in wtlie territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including the Trucial Coast and Qatar. ’ Hakki Pasha replied that he must refer the matter to his Government, and the Resident was instructed to inform Ibn Saud that H.M. Government were endeavouring to effect an arrangement with the Turkish Government and to warn him not to act independently. The Ambassador in Constantinople on 2 nd April 1914 urged the desirability of watching the situation and awaiting further developments, the Turkish Government having intimated that they had a strong hope of coming to a settlement themselves. Treaty of 15th May 1914 between Ibn Saud and Turkey. 178. On 15th May 1914 a treaty (the original of which was found during the war among Turkish records at Basra) was concluded between Ibn Saud and the Turkish Government. The text of the treaty is reproduced in Appendix A. It will be seen that it proceeds on the basis that Ibn Saud is a Turkish subject and vassal. Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914. 179. On 9th March 1914 H.M. Government concluded a further Convention (ratified on 3rd June 1914) with Turkey, which provided that the line separating British and Turkish Spheres in South-Western Arabia should rejoin “dans le Ruba-al-Khali, sur le parallele 20°, la ligne droite et directe vers le sud qui part d’un point sur la rive meridionale du golfe d’Oudjeir et qui separe le territoire Ottoman du sandjak de Nedjd du territoire d’El Katr, en conformite de 1’article 11 de la Convention anglo-ottomane du 29 juillet 1913 relatif au Golfe Persique et aux territoires environnants.” 180. On 4th June 1914 the Foreign Office, the news of the conclusion of Ibn Sand’s treaty with Turkey not yet having been made public, strongly urged the importance of avoiding any action which might lend colour to suspicions that H.M. Government were supporting Ibn Saud’s policy of “making himself independent,” and in the same connection referred to him as “ a Turkish subject and specifically recognised as such by the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913. Sir E. Grey is, in fact, convinced that it would not be compatible with our engagements that Ibn Saud should be treated otherwise, or that independent communications with him should be held except in cases where they cannot be avoided.” Summary, 1901 to 1914. 181. From the above it will be seen that Ibn Saud, emerging as the repre sentative of the Saudi family and capturing Riyadh from Ibn Rashid in 1901, by 1913 had consolidated his position in Nejd, and in the same year drove the Turks out of Hasa. His repeated overtures to H.M. Government between 1901 and 1913 with a view to securing their protection against the Turks had no result. In May 1914 he accepted the position of Turkish Wali of Nejd and ■concluded an understanding with a duly authorised Turkish representative, the basis of which was that he was an Ottoman subject and lieutenant of the Ottoman Porte in this area. V.— From the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue Line Discussions, 1914-1934. British Offers to Ibn Saud in return for his Co-operation against Turkey. 182. The importance of securing the support of Ibn Saud and the Arab Rulers of the Gulf (or, at any rate, of preventing them from giving active support to the Turks) in the event of war with Turkey was patent; and H.M. Government decided that Ibn Saud should be informed that, in return for his co-operation P.Z. 4569/16 Aitch. XII, JSTo. i, pp. 42-3. F.O. to I.O., 4.6.14. P. 3683/14, 3848/14.P. 4902/14.

Government would be prepared to recognise him as independent Ruler of Nejd and Hasa and enter into treaty relations with him, and to guarantee him against attack by sea. Ibn Sand's Response. f 183 Ibn Saud on the outbreak of war took the field against his rival, Ibn Rashid, and used his preoccupations in this quarter as an excuse for not responding: to the Turkish request for active military support against the Allies. It proved impossible to pursue discussions with him as to an understanding on the lines referred to in the preceding paragraph until the end of 1914, when Captain Shakespear, on the instructions of H.M. Government, met and discussed the position with him. Ibn Saud intimated that he was entirely on the British side and that he would commence verbal negotiations on the subject of the oilers made him by H.M. Government in the near future. In a letter to the -Political Resident of 28tli November 1914 he referred to the British promise of recognition of his independence as “ Her recognition of the independence of my Chielship oi all the parts of Nejd, El Hasa and Katif.” Ibn Sand’s terms, January 1915. 184 In January 1915 further discussions took place between Ibn Saud and Cant a in Shakespear. The Amir’s attitude was that being ultimately dis appointed of British intervention on his behalf in April 1914 he was obliged to come to an understanding with the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their aggression. He was now anxious for a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the segis of Great Britain. If the treaty was no soon concluded, force of circumstances might drive him to give some overt demon stration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand once it was concluded he would use all his resources and influence on our side. He proposed a draft. 185 The following are the portions of the draft submitted by Ibn Saud, which bear on the question of his boundaries and of his abstention from inter ference with the territories of the Arab proteges of H.M. Government “ (1) That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa, Katif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers; that I am the independent ruler of them and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) inter ference'by any Foreign Power; ^ , \ “ (2) That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory s) boundaries north, south, east and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, it there should arise differences between me and the Chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided accoidmg to the ownership of fathers and ancestors ” 186. Captain Shakespear, in his letter forwarding this draft, remarked that the addition to our responsibility did not appear heavy. The Turkish menace from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Ibn Saud, need give us no anxiety; and while we should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Ibn Saud, this was a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. 187. Sir Percy Cox saw no special difficulty as regards the clauses referred to in paragraph 185 above, but remarked, as regards protection against external aggression by land, that, “ apart from the Turks, Central Arabia is practically inaccessible by land to any power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to the reservation that aggression be unprovoked.” Vieivs of Government of India. 188. The Government of India pointed out that Ibn Sand’s proposals involved many matters of detail which would require lengthy consideration, andsuggested that we should aim at concluding a treaty on broad lines for the moment, accompanied by an undertaking to conclude, as soon as this could conveniently be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters outstanding s ugg? ste d that the guarantee of independence should be to the effect that .^the British Government recognises Ibn Baud as independent ruler of Neid, Wlasa and Qatif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty ’’ H.M. Government approved, but (on the proposal of the India Office) suggested that the new treaty should also cc contain a clause binding Ibn Baud, subiect to eventual definition of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, El Katr and the Trucial Chiefs.” There is nothing on record to show the precise obiect of the reference to a subsequent delimitation. 189. Discussions were pursued on this basis between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Baud in April 1915. The British draft and the draft submitted by Ibn Baud on the points now under consideration were then as follows : British Draft. Ibn Sand's Draft. Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa and Qatif, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the territory of Ibn Baud and his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Baud as the independent Ruler thereof, and after him his sons and descen dants, etc Article VI. Ibn Baud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, Qatar and the Oman coast, or other tribes and Chiefs who are under the protection of the British Government, and the limits of whose territories shall be hereafter deter mined. 190. H.M. Government gave Sir alternatives suggested by Ibn Baud. Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Ilasa, Qatif, Jubail, their dependencies and territories, vjhich will be discussed and determined here after, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Ibn Baud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Baud as indepen dent Ruler thereof and as absolute chief of their tribes, and after him his sons, etc Article VI. Ibn Baud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman coast who are under the protection of the Exalted Government and have treaty relations, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter deter mined. Percy Cox a discretion as regards the Agreement between Ibn Rashid and Ibn Saud, KEA June 1915. 191. On the 10 tljL June 1915 Ibn Saud reached an agreement with Saud bin Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashid. Its terms are of some interest as showing the extent at the time of Ibn Baud’s tribal claims. The agreement provided “ that Nejd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories of Ibn Saud and the encampments of Matair, Ataiba, Harb, Bani Abdulla, Ajman, A1 Morra, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajer, Sabia, A1 Sahul, Qahtauf, and A1 Duwasir, and everybody included among them, are subjects of Ibn Saud. I, Ibn Rashid, have nothing to do with them ” Treaty of 26th December 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Baud. 192. After further discussions between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud, a treaty was finally signed on 26th December 1915. The Saudi draft of Article I, as set out in paragraph 189 above, was accepted. It appeared that the reason for the Saudi version was that Jubail was the locality where Ibn Baud’s limits on the coast approached those claimed by Koweit, and that for that reason he wished to have it specified. As it was well outside the boundary accepted by H.M. Govern ment for Koweit in their negotiations with the Turks, Sir Percy Cox saw no objection to its acceptance. 3076 I.O. to F.O., 30.1.15. P. 350/15. F.O. to I.O., 2.2.15. Tel. to Vic., 1.2.15. P.R. to Gr. of I., 1318 B., 26.6.15, P. 2832/15. P. 2966/15. P. 772/16. P. 668/16. P.R. to Gr. of L, No. 35 C., 3.1.16. Aitch. XII, No. ii, pp. 206-8. L40 J-v., _ 193. In the case of Article VI, the Saudi draft, with a very slight verbal modification, was accepted. In its final form it ran as follows . “ Ibn Sand undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, and of the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protectioiw of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the saicF Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.” The words “ other chiefs and tribes ” proposed in the original British draft quoted in paragraph 189 above were omitted in deference to Ibn Sand’s state ment that the several chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary. 194. In Article VII, the British draft of which provided that a further detailed treaty should be concluded “ in regard to other matters jointly concerning ’ ’ the British Government and Ibn Saud, Ibn Saud successfully pressed for the omission of the word “ other.” He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so that there seemed no need to say “ other.” 195 From the above it will be seen that it was H.M. Government who them selves suggested the inclusion in the treaty of a provision for the subsequent determination and definition of the boundaries of the Persian Gulf States, our special relations with which Ibn Saud undertook to respect. Construction of Articles I and II of Treaty of 1915. 196. During 1916 Sharif Husain of Mecca wrote to Ibn Saud asking for an alliance and assistance. This overture was reported to Sir Percy Cox by the Amir of Nejd, who expressed mistrust of the Sharif s intentions. As a lesult, Sir Percy Cox recommended on 8 th September 1916 that Ibn Saud should be “ informed definitely that no present or future understanding between us and the Sharif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles I and II of our treaty with him of 26th December 1915.” He was instructed in reply that “as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,’ and that reference to the treaty should be confined to Article I, as we could not admit that Article II was binding on u&amp; against other Arabs.” A verbal assurance on the lines indicated appears to have been given to Ibn Saud by Sir Percy Cox at Koweit on 21st November 1916. 197. The Foreign Office in a memorandum drawn up about this time remarked that the wording of Article I of the treaty in effect “ commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Ibn Saud and King Husain, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award. Agreement of 1922 with Ibn Saud on Koweit Boundaries. Aitch XII 198. In 1922 an agreement was reached with Ibn Saud, who in that year No. ill, ’ overthrew the Rashid, in regard to the boundaries of Koweit. The agreement pp.213-4. referred in terms to the boundaries accepted by H.M. Government for that principality in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, but, by agree ment between the two parties, and with the subsequent concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit, it varied those boundaries in favour of the Saudi ruler. Summary, 1914 to 1922. 199; During this period Ibn Saud in 1915 concluded a treaty with H.M. Government, in which the latter recognised him as the independent ruler of Nejd, and he undertook not to interfere with the territories of their Arab proteges. By 1922 he had finally defeated and captured the representative of the Ibn Rashidi family. In the same year he entered into agreements under which he received certain concessions in the Koweiti hinterland, and by which the boundaries of Koweit, Nejd and Iraq were delimited.1922-1934. Representations by the Sheikh of Qatar, 1921-22. j Ibn Saud warned to respect Qatar, 1922. 200. In 1921 the Sheikh of Qatar represented that he was alarmed lest some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and join Ibn Saud, and enquired whether H.M. Government would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He was informed that H.M. Government were not prepared to promise p g 13 more than diplomatic assistance should Ibn Saud attack him. Late in 1922 he ' intimated that, while he did not fear an open attack by Ibn Saud so long as the latter remained on good terms with H.M. Government, he was seriously concerned by the more subtle methods employed, he alleged, by the Nejd authorities to undermine his position. The Resident suggested that a hint might be given to Ibn Saud to keep his people in order, but no action was taken on this proposal. In November-December 1922 Sir Percy Cox, finding that Ibn Saud proposed to include the whole of the peninsula of Qatar in a concession for oil in the Hasa district which was then under consideration, intimated to him that this could not be accepted and that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it under the terms of his Treaty with us, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to country west of the longitude of Salwa Bay. Sir P. Cox is stated by Lt.-Colonel H. R. P. Hickson, who was present, to have drawn on a map a line running from Hjau-ed-Hukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the Eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. The Sultan accepted this injunction without argument. The line in h.C. question, it may be remarked, cuts across the Blue Line, which was never men- Bagdad, to tioned in the discussions. Sir Percy Cox has spnce stated that, to the best of his G - of L &gt; recollection, nothing took place in his discussion with Ibn Saud which would Jo 1 prevent His Majesty’s Government from claiming the Blue Line as the eastern Deot Memo boundary of Saudi Arabia. B. 430/P.z. 614/34. Reassertion of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman and at Baraimi, 1922-34. 201. In 1922, when Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid murdered and succeeded his brother, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, he found that the authority of his family in Baraimi, where it had been predominant since 1870, had fallen to a low ebb; and Pol. Res. the Beni Naim of Baraimi were engaged in conflicts with Abu Dhabi. In June to c o -’ 1925 it was reported that the Awamir and the Darn had appealed to the Wahabi 9 - 6 - 26 - Amir of Hasa to protect them from Abu Dhabi, and in the same month it was reported that the Amir had sent an official to collect zakat in the Baraimi oasis, who was generally, but not invariably successful. This official also arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Baraimi and notified the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Daru tribes, who were fundamentally Muscat subjects, under the protection of the Sultan of Nejd. Anti-Wahabi combinations in Oman, 1925. 202. In July 1925 it appeared that the Sheikhs of the Beni Naim, Beni Khatib and the Beni Kaab had been negotiating with Shargah for mutual assist ance in the event of aggression by the Wahabis, and in August 1925, after a conference between Debai and the Imam of the fanatical Ibadhi tribes of the hinterland of Muscat, it was agreed that the two should support one another against the Wahabis. Further Wahabi activity, 1925-26. 203. In December 1925 a letter received by the Sheikh of Debai from the Amir of Hasa contained a serious threat against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In February 1926 the Amir of Hasa appears to have sent police to Shargah in pursuit of a Nejdi criminal. He was not found there and the police proceeded to Ajman and Ras al Khaimah. The man escaped detection. It was reported at the same time that Nejdi slavetraders were bringing negroes and war captives to the coastal towns for sale, and that the Trucial Sheikhs were afraid to interfere with them.In March 1926 the Amir of Hasa sent two officials to collect zakat in Dhafra and Baraimi, and in two iudicial cases about this time he is stated to ha,ve written first to the Kazi of Shargah and secondly to the Sheikh of Debai chiding them for not satisfying Nejdi complainants. The Kazi sent his son to Motuf to express regret.” ^ Views of Political Resident, 1926. 204. The Political Resident expressed the view in 1926 that the region of Dhafra, some 14,000 miles square, which stretches 175 miles from west to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south by the Rub al Khali, belonged, with three smaller coastal tiacts to its west, historically and de jure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The first business of the Wahabis if they were to establish themselves in Eastern Arabia, must be to absorb this region. East of it they would have little difficulty in procuring the adherence of the people of Baraimi, Haffit ano Dhahii ah, on account of the antipathy of some for Abu Dhabi and of others for the Ibadhi fanatics of the Muscat hinterland. He added that the kazis in all the chiefships except Abu Dhabi and Debai were actually Nejdis. 205. The Resident stated that the tribal situation was that Abu Dhabi and Debai were wholeheartedly opposed to Ibn Sand, and were followed by the Beni Yas and Manasir of Dhafra, Mijan, Akal, and the Dhawahir of Baraimi. Umm al Qaiwain, the Beni Khatib tribe and the Beni Kaab were inclined to be neutral. Shargah and Ras al Khaimah had a century earlier been bigoted Wahabis. Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, April 1927. 206. A further report by Sir Lionel Haworth in the spring of 1927 confirmed that Debai and Abu Dhabi were opposed to Wahabism and had no desire to come under the sway of Ibn Saud, and stated that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah were closely sympathetic to the Wahabis, and that with them there might be bracketed the lesser chiefs of Ajman and Ummal Qaiwain. “ The latter four chiefs were actually Wahabis some hundred years ago, and are already in private communication with the Wahabi leaders.” Pol. Res. to Gr. of I., 137 S, 30.4.27, P. 3996/27. Position at Baraimi 1927—34. 207. The oasis of Baraimi was, the Resident reported, occupied by three different sections of Arabs, the Naim, in close touch with Muscat and with no desire to be absorbed by the Wahabis; the villages belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, partly occupied by the Dhawahir, and equally anti-Wahabi; and the El Shamis, a branch of the Naimi, in close touch with the chiefs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah and strongly Wahabi in tone. “ The Baraimi section of this tribe have recently paid willing tribute to the Wahabi agent of the Governor of Hasa, who came to Baraimi, and they would encourage the extension of Wahabi power.” Of these sections, the first were the strongest and their chief occupied the fort at Baraimi. It will be seen that the pro-Wahabi element was in a minority and did not in 1927 occupy the fort, and this is of importance in estimating the weight to be attached to the payment of zakat to the Wahabis by Baraimi. P.R. to G. of L, 181 S., 29.5.27, P. 3404/27. P.G. Ad. Reports, 1928-33. 208. Later in the same year, however, the Baraimi Sheikhs, apparently acting under the influence of Ibn Sand’s agent, and possibly apprehensive that the presence of the Wazir of Muscat, Mr. Bertram Thomas, portended aggressions by the Sultan, or that the establishment of a landing ground was likely to be a threat to their independence, refused to allow an R.A.F. party to reconnoitre the oasis. For convenience it may be recorded at this stage that despite this incident, however, no interference with the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs by Ibn Saud’s agent for Baraimi was reported in 1928-1931. In 1932, a cousin of the Sheikh of Baraimi having been ambushed by Bedouin consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi, Baraimi and Dibai. Peace was restored after three months’ fighting. It may be noted that there appears to have been no interference in this dispute by any representative of Ibn Saud and that the parties fought it out among themselves without any outside interference. There is no record since that date of Saudiinterference; and in July 1934 that Ibn Baud had no agent at Baraimi, although his zakat gatherers sometimes went as far East as this point, £ c where, however, they do not press for fixed rates, but take what is given to them.” The Resident stated that the Awamir and Manasir had for the last four ^or five years paid zakat to Ibn Baud (having at an earlier stage paid it to •Abu Dhabi). No zakat was paid him by the Trucial Sheikhs. 209. The supplementary treaty envisaged by Article VII of the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (para. 194 above) was never, in fact, concluded, nor 'was any supplementary agreement entered into with Ibn Baud on the matters then under discussion, with the exception of the agreement regarding the boundaries of Koweit referred to in paragraph 198. The treaty of 1915 held the field until 1927. The Treaty of Jedda, 1927. 210. In that year, after lengthy negotiations, a fresh treaty was concluded with Ibn Baud at Jedda on 20th May. II.M. Government, concerned by the activities of the Amir of Hasa, to which reference is made in paras. 201-207, decided to aim at the embodiment in any new treaty of the provisions of Article VI of the Treaty of 1915, binding Ibn Baud to respect the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in alliance with H.M. Government, despite the fact that Ibn Baud had since the date of that treaty grown greatly both in strength and in international stature. They accordingly included that Article as Article VI in a new draft treaty, acceptance of which by Ibn Baud their negotiators were to endeavour to secure. 211. The instructions to the negotiators remarked that the draft reproduced “the provisions of Article VI of the treaty of 1916 save that no reference is made to the question of determining the limits of the territory mentioned. H.M. Government have given careful consideration to the question whether Ibn Baud should be invited to refrain from aggression on the Rulers of the Persian Gulf Coast. It appeared to them doubtful whether in practice such an engagement would effectively deter Ibn Baud if he were determined to absorb some petty neighbouring Arab State. Moreover, H.M. Government did not wish to commit themselves to recognise the extent of Ibn Baud’s domains or to protect territories outside those domains, but would have preferred to remain free to take what action they considered necessary in each particular case, having regard to the precise nature of their relations with the principality concerned and to other relevant circumstances.” In view, however, of the recent instances of interference by the Amir of Hasa, referred to in paragraphs 201-207 above, H.M. Government “ came to the conclusion that if Ibn Baud were not asked to reassume the obligation imposed upon him by Article VI of the treaty of 1916, he might infer that they would not oppose any interference by him with the integrity of the Rulers in question and would thus be encouraged to extend his influence in South-East Arabia. ... If, however, Ibn Baud should finally prove unwilling to agree to reassume the obligation in the new treaty, you should inform him that H.M. Government hold themselves free to take what action they consider necessary in particular cases.” 212. Ibn Baud raised no objection to the draft Article, subject to the substitution of the words “ maintain friendly relations with ” for the words &lt;c to refrain from all aggression or interference with,” and the omission of the words £C or under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.” His grounds were that the earlier wording was not compatible with his dignity as an independent Ruler, and more particularly that the term ££ interference ” seemed to him to be capable of too wide an interpretation. The terms of the Article as finally agreed were as follows — “ His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Bushire Desp., 671 S., 15.7.34, P.Z. 4860/ 34.

It may be recorded in this connection, as a point of some importance, that Ibn Sand in connection with the discussions which culminated in the Treaty of Jedda, asked for a statement of the treaty engagements of H.M. Government with the rulers whose special treaty relations with them he undertook unde* Article VI of that treaty to respect. The list of engagements with which he was furnished did not contain the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913—14. Ibn Saud informed that HM. Government continue to regard the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as binding on him*, 1934. 214 It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the events between the Treaty of Jedda and 1934. Towards the end of 1933 the question of the continental boundaries of Saudi Arabia was raised in an active form by the application of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be allowed to negotiate for an oil concession in Qatar on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and by uncertainties as to the Eastern boundary which had been set by Ibn Saud to the oil concession he had granted in respect of Hasa. In connection with this, the Sheikh of Qatar and the United States Government were officially informed in the spring of 1934 that H.M. Government regarded the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention (para. 165 (c) above) as the eastern boundary of Nejd, and as a matter of courtesy the Saudi Government were informed that, enquiry as to the boundary position having been made by the United States Embassy at Angora, a communication in this sense had been made to them. Ibn Saud subsequently intimated that he did not accept the Blue Line as binding upon him, and that he preferred ancestral claims to the territory to the east of it. It is now accepted that the question of his eastern continental boundary is one on which further discussion will be necessary in the near future between him and H.M. Government. VI. —Conclusion. 215. The history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with Trucial Oman, Muscat and with the British Government is given in detail above. It may be convenient, in conclusion, briefly to summarise the position and to touch upon certain of the more important general questions bearing on the difficulties which have arisen in connection with the Blue Line and the claims made in that eonnection by Ibn Saud. I.—General Historical Survey. 216. It will be seen that the Wahabi sect originated in Nejd in the early part of the eighteenth century; that by the end of the eighteenth century it had conquered Nejd and Hasa; and that between 1800 and 1818 it established a commanding influence in the hinterland of Trucial Oman, the headquarters of Its agent being in forts built by the Wahabis at the oasis of Baraimi—a strategical point of the first importance on the borders of Trucial Oman and the Muscat Sultanate. The Wahabi influence came to an end, and Baraimi was lost, with the defeat of the Wahabis of Nejd and Hasa by the Egyptians and the capture and execution of the Wahabi Amir in 1818. 217. On the revival of Wahabi power in 1824 overtures were again made by the Wahabis to the Trucial authorities. By 1831 those overtures had produced a considerable effect. By 1833 Baraimi had been reoccupied, and Wahabi influence appears to have been as powerful in Trucial Oman and its hinterland as it had been in the period prior to the defeat of the Wahabis by the Egyptians. The Wahabi agent at Baraimi appears to have been maintained there until he was driven out by the local tribes about 1838. Between 1837 and 1839, the Egyptians again overcame and destroyed the Wahabi power. They made endeavours, with the assistance of a former Wahabi agent at Baraimi to secure the allegiance of the Trucial Sheikhs. These, and the Beni Naim chiefs of Baraimi who now held the oasis, which they had recaptured from the Wahabis m 1837-38, were encouraged to resist by H.M. Government, and the efforts of the Egyptians ended in failure.Wabiw nnwr he JH lthdraWal 0f the .

In 1869 the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi was murdered at Shargah, and m the same year the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi, m alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the Wahabi ruling family, which had since 1865 been internally divided by disputes regarding the succession, were expelled from Hasa by the Turks. They were unable to take steps to re-establish themselves in Trucial Oman, and by 1879 their influence was reduced to Riyadh. Baraimi came under the influence of the Sheikh of Abu JJiiabi and so remained for the next 50 years. • n nr?pnp Fr0I r r° the are of merely local political importance. Cut off from the coast and confined to the centre of Arabia their mnuence is of the smallest and does not extend to Trucial Oman or its hinterland. Ihe principal power m Nejd at this period is the Amir Ibn Rashid of the Jebel bhammar, a Turkish vassal. _ 2 ^- The Saudis, under the present Saudi King, in 1901 attacked Ibn Rashid. Ihe history of Central Arabia for the next 15 years is that of the struggles for supremacy between the Rashidi and Saudi families, culminating in the victory tu ^ a ^ e r m 1922. Between 1901 and 1914 repeated overtures were made by k * 311 baud to H.M. Government with a view to securing their protection against the lurks. Ihese were invariably declined. In May 1914 he reached an under standing with Turkey under which, as a Turkish subject and a Turkish vassal he was appointed Wall and Commandant of Nejd. 222. On the outbreak of the war Ibn Saud was approached both by the Turks and by H.M. Government. He alleged his preoccupations with Ibn Rashid as an excuse for not co-operating actively with the Turks but did not repudiate his allegiance to them. In 1915 he concluded a treaty with H.M. Government under which he undertook to respect their special relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and the Trucial Coast, whose boundaries should thereafter be delimited, and thereafter he co-operated with them. The treaty of 1915 regulated relations between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud until 1927. 223. Throughout this time there were no signs of any importance of Wahabi advances in Trucial Oman or its hinterland. In 1925—26 emissaries from the Wahabi Viceroy of Hasa were reported to have been moving in the hinterland to have approached the Trucial Sheikhs, to have reached Baraimi and to have collected zakcLt from the tribes (paragraphs 201 to 207 above). The matter was not regarded as of great moment and no special steps were taken to deal with it, the affairs of the hinterland being at that stage of no concern to HM Government. But when the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 replaced the Treaty of 1915, steps were taken to include in it a provision that Ibn Saud would respect the territories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast which were in special treaty relations with H.M. Government. 224. Information accumulating since 1927 goes to suggest that Ibn Saud, as the result of the general prestige which he has achieved, and his authority with the Bedouin of Central Arabia, is becoming increasingly a power in the Trucial hinterland and even as far east as Baraimi. H.M. Government have adopted the attitude, both in the Persian Gulf and in dealing with the King, that the eastern boundary of Nejd is the eastern boundary represented by the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they cannot acknowledge any Saudi authority to the east of that line. This contention is vigorously con tested by Ibn Saud, partly on the basis of what he describes as c ‘his ancestral claims.”II.—Points of Special Interest. 225. The following are certain of the main points of interest in this connection :— (A) Policy of H.M. Government 1800-1934. ^ (B) Extent to which H.M. Government are committed by Treaty engagements with the Wahabis : 1800-1934. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs and their relation to the Wahabis : 1800 to 1934. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd : 1800 to 1934. (E) History and position of Baraimi : 1800 to 1934. (F) Extent to which Ibn Sand and the Wahabi Amirs in the pre-War period were Turkish subjects or vassals. (G) The legal position. (A) Policy of H.M. Government, 1800-1934. 22fi. It will be seen that from 1800 to 1920 the policy of H.M. Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf was consistently to avoid any interference in the affairs of the hinterland. In the early part of this period they were solely concerned to make the seas safe for commerce; to put down piracy; and at a slightly later stage to suppress the slave trade. As time went on and the strategic importance of the Gulf area, particularly from the Indian stand point, became greater, they consolidated their relations with the rulers of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and Muscat, and with the Trucial Sheikhs. 227. Their relations with the Wahabi Amirs in the period 1800 to 1870 were on all fours with their relations with the other rulers of this area. Once the Wahabi Amirs established themselves on the sea coast they became a matter of concern to H.M. Government, who were, however, content to abstain from all interference with their activities in the hinterland save to the extent that these might react on the position of the other maritime rulers of the Trucial area and so lead to piratical outbreaks, the revival of slavery, or the absorption of Muscat or Bahrein. They had no treaty relations with the Wahabi Amirs, and their com munications with them (apart from formal representations or demands for reparation for injuries committed at their instigation or by their subjects or vassals) were confined to polite exchanges of letters. The one formal engagement given in the period 1800 to 1870 is a unilateral undertaking given on behalf of the Wahabi Amir in 1866 (paragraph 118 above). 228. From 1870 to 1901 H.M. Government pursued their policy of con solidating their position on the littoral. In the period 1901 to 1.913 they repeatedly refused to involve themselves in liabilities towards Ibn Saud. In 1913 they reached an agreement with Turkey in which the eastern boundaries of Turkish influence in Arabia were delimited. Their endeavours at the outbreak of the Great War to secure the co-operation of Ibn Saud against the Turks were successful, and in 1915 they concluded a treaty with him as an independent ruler, under which he undertook to respect the territories of their Arab allies. 229. Supplementary agreements were concluded with Ibn Saud after the war to regulate the boundaries of Koweit and Iraq, and the treaty of 1915 was replaced in 1927 by one less favourable to H.M. Government. Since 1925 the growing power of Ibn Saud and the reassertion of Persian influence by sea, the development of air communications, the transfer of the air route to India and the East to the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the discovery of oil on that littoral, and the fact that international oil agreements make it difficult to exclude foreign exploitation, have combined to make it necessary to take a more active interest in the affairs of the Trucial Coast, and more difficult to ignore the position in its hinterland ; in the case of Qatar it has been necessary in the interests of securing that any oil concession granted shall be under British influence to offer the Sheikh guarantees of protection by land; and the importance of setting a limit to Wahabi expansion in the hinterland has been held to justify the positive challenge to the position of Ibn Saud represented by the intimation to him that the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention is his Eastern boundary.(B) Engagements of HM. Government with the Wahabis between 1800 and 1930. 230. The Treaty of 1915 was the first formal engagement concluded by H.M. Government with the Wahabis. In 1810 friendly letters were exchanged between the Wahabi Amir and the Government of Bombay (paragraph 26 above). In 0813, similar letters were exchanged, and again in 1814 (paragraphs 28-30). In 1820 (paragraph 32) reference was made to the existence of an earlier Anglo- Wahabi Treaty. In 1831 the Wahabis (paragraph 53) expressed a desire for the renewal of ‘ £ the treaty .... which was made between you, the British and Imam Saud.” No such treaty could be traced, but a friendly letter was sent in reply to the Wahabis (paragraph 54). In 1843 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 98) expressed a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father and the British Government, and a suitable reply was sent. In 1855 (paragraph 105) on the Amir being warned that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, the Amir referred to an understanding “between us and the British Government of 100 years’ duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.” No reference was made in reply to the contention that such an understanding existed. In 1850 the Amir (paragraph 106), endeavouring to justify himself for his attacks on the Sheikh of Bahrein, alleged that “between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority,” and referred to his treaties with the Turks. The reply sent to him took no notice of this point. 231. In 1865 Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, visited the Wahabi Amir at Riyadh. It was repeatedly subsequently alleged that some undertaking was then entered into by the Resident with the Wahabi Amir. There is nothing to support this (paragraphs 110-112). Subsequent to the visit, the Amir (paragraph 115), in reply to a protest against the activities of his Lieutenant at Baraimi, alleged that there existed between the Wahabi power and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Saud and again ratified in the time of the then ruler. No trace of any such document or agreement could be found, and on the point being raised with the Wahabi envoys by Colonel Pelly they replied (paragraph 120 ) “ that the Wahabi Amirs had from time to time received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a treaty agreement” (1866). On 21st April 1866 a Wahabi representative volunteered the declaration recorded in paragraph 118 above. This was a unilateral declaration. 232. It will be seen that, if the Wahabi declaration of 1866 is left out of account, there is no foundation for any suggestion that any treaty or agreement, whether affecting the Trucial Sheikhdoms or the hinterland, was concluded between the Wahabis and H.M. Government between 1800 and 1870. Nor was any engagement subsequently entered into until the formal treaty of 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, now superseded by the later Treaty of Jedda of 1927. No Saudi argument in regard to the Blue Line or the territorial limits of Saudi Arabia can thus be based on any engagement concluded prior to 1915 by H.M. Government. It is, on the other hand, a legitimate argument on the Saudi side, and one which they have not neglected, that no reference was made to the Blue Line in the lengthy discussions which preceded the conclusion of the Treaties of 1915 or 1927, and that the Anglo-Turkish Conventions were not communicated to them on the occasion of the latter treaty; though it is no doubt open to H.M. Government to argue, on the other side, that while as the result of their breach with Turkey they were prepared to ignore the Blue Line, and, as proposed on the initiative of H.M. Government, to agree to a subsequent territorial delimitation, the Blue Line, which was internationally legally binding, must be the starting point of any discussions designed to bring about a modification. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs, and their relation to the Wahabis: 1800 to 1934. 233. H.M. Government, without consultation with or any protest by the Wahabi Amir, in 1806 entered into an agreement with the Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al Khaimah-Shargah for the suppression of piracy (paragraph 24 above). In1820 (paragraph 34 ) they entered into a general maritime treaty with the predecessors of the present Trncial Sheikhs. They have maintained those treaty relations since that date and have supplemented them by engagements, either with individual rulers, or with the Trucial Sheikhs generally, regarding slavery and piracy in 1838 (Ajman, Debai, Abu Dhabi, Shargah); 1839 (Eas al Khaimah); 1843 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1847 (all.Trucial Sheikhs); 1853 (all Trucial Sheikhs),^ 1864 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Umm al Qaiwain); 1868 (Abu Dhabi and Qatar); 1873 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi). In 1887 they secured “exclusive agreements ’ ’ from the Trucial Sheikhs, which were confirmed and strengthened in 1892, since when control of the foreign relations of these sheikhdoms has rested with H.M. Government. Further undertakings were obtained from the Trucial area in 1902; 1911-12 (pearling and sponge-fishing concessions); 1912 (Shargah- Tamb light-house); 1922 (oil). The treaty of 1820 and all subsequent treaties were entered into with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent States, and H.M. Govern ment, in so far as they have found it necessary to apply forcible pressure to the Sheikhs to ensure their compliance with the engagements accepted under those treaties, have done so without reference to, protest by (save in 1833—paragraph 46 above), or the prior sanction of, any other power. 234. Since 1823 H.M. Government have (paragraph 36) been locally repre sented by a native Agent, with headquarters at Shargah, of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since 1932 the Trucial Coast has informally been placed under the supervision of the British Political Agent at Bahrein. The history of the period since 1800, as recorded above, illustrates the close contact consistently maintained with the Trucial Coast by the Resident, which inevitably arose from the obligations assumed by the Sheikhs and by H.M. Government under the Maritime Truce of 1820 (paragraph 34), and the subsequent engagements by which it was supplemented. 235. The historical survey above goes to suggest that between 1800 and 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs (but Abu Dhabi to a much less extent than the Jowasimis of Shargah), were for considerable periods under a large, though not consistently an effective, degree of Wahabi influence, if not control. But the important division in the area seems to have been that between the religious factions of the Hinawis (represented by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat) and the Ghafaris (represented by the Jowasimi Sheikh); the minor Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, who normally co-operated with Shargah-Ras al Khaimah, and of Dibai, who normally co-operated with Abu Dhabi, changing sides according as one or other of the two major Sheikhs seemed likely to assume a dominating influence. Wahabi influence declined in this area after 1853 and disappeared altogether, save as a purely religious movement, after 1870. It appears to have revived only in the period subsequent to 1920. The long breaks in the continuity of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman apart, it can fairly be maintained that the Trucial Sheikhs have throughout, in continental as well as in maritime affairs, been independent political entities, even if some of them were negligible in size, and if most, if not all, were by land responsive to or entirely under the influence at various times of the strongest neighbouring power, whether that power was Muscat or the Wahabi Amirs. It seems difficult in any event for Ibn Sand to base any substantial claim to suzerainty over these sheikhdoms or their immediate hinterland at this stage, merely on the broken record of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman during the period between 1800 and 1870, or on its revival in the period subsequent to 1920, at a date when he had by formal treaty engagements undertaken to respect the independence of these States. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd from 1800 to 1934. 236. From the historical statement above it will be seen that this has varied very greatly, both in degree and in area, and that there are considerable gaps in its continuity. From 1800 to about 1815 it appears to have been a fairly substantial control, less marked in the case of Abu Dhabi, extending as far east as the boundaries of Muscat and largely exercised from Baraimi. The same is true of the period 1831-33 until 1836, or possibly as late as 1838. From 1845 to 1853 Wahabi influence is again marked over the same area as before. From 1853 to 1869 it underwent a steady decline, and from 1869 until 1923 it is practically non-existent, though the Sheikhs react quickly to the fortunes of theruler of Nejd (up. paragraphs 138-9, 152, &amp;c.). At that point there are definite signs of revival, though, even so, the Trucial Sheikhs are divided among themselves, Abu Dnabi and Debai being opposed, like Muscat, to any such revival; lias al Khaimah and Shargah inclined to sympathise; and the remainder neutral. ^11 the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhs Wahabi influence appears to extend informal fashion as far east as the oasis of Baraimi, a minority of the tribes occupying it having paid zakat\ while Mr. Bertram Thomas and other travellers report that the Al Murra tribe of the Central Arabian Desert also deter to it. 237. The main test of the existence of this influence is the payment of zakat by tribes or rulers. No payments are now made by the Trucial Sheikhs who how ever, exchange presents with the Amir of Hasa. The local political authorities positively state that this payment is, in fact, a form of danegeld or blackmail and does not connote any political subjection. &lt;c The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear aggression from Ibn Sand and try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy, and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing, and merely indicate that for the moment Ibn Saud is sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance.” (E) History and position of Baraimi. 238. Baraimi was in the past the only important Wahabi settlement in the Trucial area. The oasis of which it is the centre is well watered, fertile and strategically of great importance, since it commands the approaches into the Sultanate of Muscat. It was captured by the Wahabis in 1800, and from that date to 1869 was the headquarters of their representative in Eastern Arabia, with intervals during which it passed out of Wahabi control from 1818 or slightly earlier, to about 1833; from 1838 to 1845; and in 1848-9. In 1869 it was captured by the Sultan of Muscat, and appears never since to have been reoccupied by the Wahabis. Its forts are at present held by the Beni Naim, who appear to be hostile to the Wahabis, though a minority of the tribes who occupy the oasis were reported in 1924 to have paid zakat to the Wahabi tax collectors. It will be seen that there is thus no history of continuous Wahabi occupation, and that the oasis has not been under effective Wffhabi control since 1869. (F) Extent to which the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud have in the past professed allegiance to Turkey. 239. The Wahabi Amirs were decisively defeated in 1818 by the Egyptians, and the Wahabi Amir himself executed at Constantinople. On the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824 and for some years afterwards, the then Amir Turki appears to have paid tribute to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to have endeavoured to represent himself to the Viceroy (though not locally in Arabia) as the Viceroy’s agent (paragraph 37). They were again decisively defeated by the Egyptians in 1837-39, and the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner to Cairo. He was released by the Egyptians and returned to Nejd in 1842. From 1839 to his death in 1865, it would appear (paragraph 90) that the Wahabi Amir paid tribute to Turkey, though, at any rate in the latter part of this period, through the Turkish authorities at Mecca. 240. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir professed (paragraph 91), in writing, to be a Turkish dependant, and stated that he had made it clear to Mehemet Ali, when the latter approached him in 1837 with a view to securing his co-operation against the tribes of eastern Arabia, that he could do nothing without the approval of the Sultan. In 1859 the Wahabi Amir, again in writing, referred to treaties concluded in the past between him and the Sultan of Turkey. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 92) made overtures, apparently almost simultaneously, to Great Britain and the Turks. But the overtures of his envoy were ultimately rejected by the Turkish Wali of Baghdad.50 (cp. paras. 145, 152, 164.) 241 In 1871 the Turks were called in by the Amir Sand, who subsequently became the head of the Wahabis. The negotiations between the Saudis and the Turks in the 10 years which followed appear consistently to have proceeded on the basis that the Wahabi Amirs, in return for Turkish support to enable them to re-establish themselves in Nejd and possibly Hasa, were prepared to accept Turkish suzerainty. In 1890 they professed their obedience to the Turkish^ authorities (paragraphs 125, 127, 128). Ibn Rashid by whom they were finally defeated in 1888 and who, from 1876 to 1901, was the leading ruler m Central Arabia consistently professed allegiance to Turkey. Between 1901 and 1913 Ibn Baud, while continually endeavouring to secure British protection and British assistance against the Turks, on various occasions appears to have submitted to TuS authority (see in particular paragraphs 136, 137, 150, 151), to have drawn allowances from them for his father or himself (paragraph 141, but see paragraph 152), and to have settled tribal disputes on behalf of lurkey (paragraph 150). In May 1914, abandoning hope of the active assistance of H M Government, he concluded a treaty as 1 £ Wali and Commandant of Neid” with the Wali of Basra, 'who was specially empowered by imperial iradeh,” the text of which will be found in Appendix A, and which is only consistent with Ibn Baud’s full acceptance of the status of a Turkish subject and official It may be noted, too, that on the outbreak of the War, Ibn Baud did not repudiate allegiance to Turkey, but gave as an excuse for his failure to lend armed assistance to the Turks that he was engaged m hostilities with Ibn Rashid, while at the beginning of 1915 he hinted to H.M. Government that, failing a satisfactory written understanding with them, it would be necessary for him to make overtures to the Turks. 242. The true position is no doubt that, throughout the whole of this period, the Wahabi Amirs, solely concerned with their own interests, were prepared to give a formal acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or to pay a nominal tribute to Turkey if by doing so they could be assured of non-interference by Turkey in their concerns. From one standpoint it would be unreasonable therefore to attach undue importance to the acknowledgments of suzerainty constituted by the series of incidents referred to above. But it is on the other hand open to H.M. Govern ment in any dispute in which they may be concerned with Ibn Baud in which that ruler claims that he and his ancestors have for the last century been the indepen dent rulers of Nejd and Hasa, and that he is not the successor in title of the Turks in those areas, to take advantage of the very frequent and consistent reiterations of Wahabi allegiance to Turkey over almost the whole of the period. (G) The legal position. 243. On the limited issue of the continued validity of the provisions affecting the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 (paragraph 165) and 1914 (paragraph 179 above), the Foreign Office, at an earlier stage, expressed the view that the Blue Line remained internationally legally binding as against Ibn Baud. On the wider question of what precisely H.M. Government are legally F.O. to I.O., entitled to maintain as against the King in regard to the Blue Line, they have 31.8.34. ’ since expressed the interesting and important opinions : — {a) That there is reason to believe that the territory immediately east of the Blue Line, on the assumption that neither IT.M. Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there, is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Baud. (5) That ' while we are perfectly justified to use the Blue Line and the position of Ibn Baud as the successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Baud in order to secure the most accept able frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal deciding the matter on legal principles if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the Blue Line was a part of the territory of the Bheikh of Qatar, a British protected principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Baud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescription if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.” J.

Boundaries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms (Lorimer, 1905). 1 . Trucial Oman, being the area at present occupied by the Trucial Sheikh doms (excluding Qatar), runs in the Persian Gulf from the Khor al Odeid in the West to Sha’am in the East and in the Gulf of Oman from Khor Kalba to Dibah, the places named all being included in it. Inland on one side, it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai’ah on the East coast to Ras Shaam on the West coast, and so divides it from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate to the North; on another by a line even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and after partially crossing the promontory in such a way as to exclude the Madadhah and Jau districts to the South, is eventually lost in South Khatam; West of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba al Khali and the Jafarah deserts. 2. The existing Trucial Sheikhdoms are Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ti mm al Qaiwain, and Ras al Khaimah. The rulers of those principalities in 1820 signed the Trucial Treaty with His Majesty’s Government. 3. The boundaries (omitting mention of insular possessions) of the Trucial Sheikhdoms as laid down in Lorimer’s Gazetteer (1905) are as follows :— Lor. II, 405. A bu Dhabi. 4. From Khor al Ghanadhah on the East to the Khor-al-Odeid (the northern shore of which inlet should in Lorimer’s view, perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories) on the West—a distance of over 200 miles. “ Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined : it is asserted that on the East they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in; and on the South they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba’ al Lor. II, 264. Khali.” A regular tribute was paid to Abu Dhabi by the Dhawahir, “ who are numerically a majority in Baraimi, though Baraimi was itself independent” (see paragraph 12 below). Lor. II, 454. D e b a i. 5. West boundary, the Khor al Ghanadhah. East boundary, Abu Hail. Lor. II, Shargah. 1757-8. 0 . “With the exception of the small Shaikhdoms of Ajman and Umm- Lor. II, 1757. al-Qaiwain on the West coast, and of a part of the interior which is virtually independent, it may be considered to embrace everything between a line joining Sha’am to Dibah on the North, and another connecting Sharjah Town and Khor Kalba on the South. On the East it is bounded by the Gulf of Oman, and on the West by the Persian Gulf.” 7. Its boundary with Ajman is at a place called Dabdabah, 2^ miles from the North end of the date groves of Sharjah Town; and with Debai at Abu Hail. Lor n, 8 . Inland, Sharjah proper tc does not, it is stated, extend beyond Wasit, a 1757-8! locality 5 miles East of Sharjah Town, the tract between this and Dhaid not being under the Sheikh’s control.” The detached oasis of Dhaid is administered through a Wali.Ajman. 9. “The authority of the Sheikh only extends 2 miles inland, and, upon the sea, miles South-West and 2 ^ miles North-East, embracing on the last-mentioned side part of the tract called Zora : his dominions are thus an T ^nclave in Sharjah territory. There is no dependent village, and no Bedouin tribe Lor. 11,53-4. owes allegiance to the Sheikh, who is of the Qaratisah section of the Na’im : a political alliance and friendly relations, however, generally subsist between the inhabitants of Ajman and the people of Baraimi.” U mm-al-Qaiwain. 10 . The Sheikhdom “has no clearly defined boundaries, but it forms an enclave in Sharjah territory. On the coast it reaches North-East to Jazirat-al- Hamra and South-West part of the way to Hamriyah : the Siniyah island formed Lor II by Khor-al-Baidhah is thus included in it.” Fa’laj A1 Ali (or Falai), about 16 1474-6.’ miles South-East of Umm-al-Qaiwain town and perhaps 8 miles North-West of Dhaid village, is the only place of importance not on the coast which belongs to Umm-al-Qaiwain. Ras-al-Khaimah. 11 . At the date of compilation of Lorimer’s Gazetteer Ras-al-Khaimah was under the control of Sharjah and constituted the Northernmost district in that principality. It has since again become an independent State. Lor. II It is described by Lorimer as “ divided from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the 1004-5.’ Oman Sultanate on the North-East by a line which runs obliquely from Ras-ash- Sha’am on the West coast of the promontory to a point between the village of Dibah proper and Bai’ah on the East coast. On the West, from Ras-ash-Sha’am on the North to the South end of Jazirat-al-Hamra on the South, it is bounded by the sea; and thence by a line, of which the course is indefinite, drawn across the desert to the Southern extremity of the Jiri Plain. The South-East limit is an imaginary line connecting the South end of Jiri with the East coast at a point immediately south of DibahT The town of Dibah and village of Wamm were at the date of Lorimer’s Gazetteer exempt from the jurisdiction of the Deputy Governor (on behalf of Sharjah) and held in fief by a Wali who was first cousin Lor ' n ’ 1007 - of the Sheikh of Sharjah. Independent Oman.' 1 ^ r “' ccmsisted in 1905 of a small tract lying between the Oman Sultanate Lor II 1368 and I racial Oman, consisting chiefly of the districts of Jau and Mahadhah “ which is not subject to any recognised ruler and may therefore be styled Independent Oman.” It includes the important oasis of Baraimi. . 13 - Tlle . boundaries of Jau are indefinite, but the tract embraces Jabul Hafit T with the villages near the southern end of that range. It includes, at its north- 931-3 ’ western and most important part, the oasis of Baraimi, which lies a little south of 260-5. a straight line drawn between the towns of Sohar and Abu Dhabi, about 65 miles west by south of the former and 85 miles east by south of the latter. The oasis is nearly ciicular and its diameter is about 6 miles. Its political position in 1905 was as follows : “ Baraimi is independent, but the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in the district is strong and increasing. The ruins of the fort at Muraijib bear witness to the hereditary connection of his family with Baraimi, and he has recently acquired and is now engaged in developing an estate at Jahali, while Masudi is being formed into a village by his eldest son. Moreover, a regular tribute ... is paid him by the Dhawahir, who are numerically a majority in the oasis. At the present time the Sheikh could probably seize Baraimi if he wished to do so, but his policy appears to be one of pacific penetration. The Naim are the original owners of the oasis and possession of the fort in Baraimi village still gives them prestige and a local superiority over the Dhawahir. A few Manasir of the Abu Khail section frequent the Baraimi oasis or its neighbourhood in summer.” II. Mahadhah is described as a plain in the heart of the Oman promontory, the II, headquarters of the Beni Ehab tribe, which, together with Jau, forms the greater m^ - 2 L part of Independent Oman. _ Mahadhah is probably situated 15-20 miles north-east of the Baraimi oasis, but its exact position is uncertain. Its level is said to be somewhat higher than that of Baraimi and its extent is described as about 6 miles in any direction.54 APPENDIX C. Map showing the extent of Wahabi and of Muscat Power, 1865 (enclosure in Bushire Despatch to Bombay No. 11 of 14th February 1865). ^ APPENDIX D. Lor. II, 1162-4. The Manasir and the A1 Murra. The Manasir. Lorimer (1905) describes the Manasir as “ a bedouin tribe of Trucial Oman whose headquarters are in Dhafrah. Their general range is from Qatar on the north-east to the Baraimi oasis on the east, and they are found all over Dhafrah, but especially in Dhafrah proper and Limah and also in Khatam. A few frequent the neighbourhood of Abu Dhabi town and visit the Baraimi oasis and some are settled in the coast villages of Khan and Jumairah. On the north the tribe are in contact with the Beni Hajir in the neighbourhood of Qatar, and further inland on the west with the A1 Murra ; their raiding parties sometimes reach Wadi Faruq. On the east their territory marches with that of the Beni Yas, with whom, moreover, they are intermingled in Dhafrah, and to the south of them the country is uninhabited, being part of the Rub’ al Khali. The Manasir, except those at Khan and Jumairah, are altogether nomadic. Most of them winter in Qatar or its neighbourhood and spend the summer in Liwah, where they have temporary villages of huts and some date groves possessed as tribal joint property. . . . The total number of the tribe is about 1,400 souls. . . . The Manasir w r ere formerly subject to the Wahabi Government, and in 1865 were understood to pay a contri bution worth 2,000 dollars a year, chiefly in kind, into the Wahabi treasury. Now they are independent of all control, but maintain some degree of intercourse with the town of Abu Dhabi and its Sheikh.” Vol. I, p. 89. The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the Manasir as “a small independent tribe in the ill-known Dhafrah district, bordering on the domain of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, to whom, if to anyone, they owe a vague allegiance, having for a generation or so been free of tribute to Ibn Sand. They are the last predominantly nomadic tribe towards the south, the Great Desert and the Jafurah Desert enclosing their dira south and west, and the mainly settled and friendly Beni Yas of the Trucial Coast lying east. North lies the dira of the Al Murra, with whom the Manasir seem to be on better terms than anyone else. In winter the whole tribe moves into or near El Qatar. In summer part of it may be found as far south as the Baraimi oasis in north-west Oman. Mainly pastoral, the Manasir possess arable land and summer settlements in Dhafrah (Liwah district) and are much m advance of the Al Murra in civilisation. Both m religious tenets and political connections they pertain to Oman. There seems to be no paramount Mansuri chief. The tribe numbers about 1,500 souls.” The Al Murra. Lor. II, Ihe A1 Murra are described by Lorimer (1905) as “a considerable Arab tribe 1239-42. of Eastern Arabia, very notorious for their misdeeds, but otherwise less is known ; ~ ./ . c VAX VC JLJ..LJL LC* 11X UJLJ.O DCiLilO ^ Arabia.. The Al Murra inhabit the country in the south of the Hasa Sanjak and that adjoining it, but lying beyond its border on the same side. Some are generally to be found in Kharma, near the wells of Zarnuqah. They visit Barr adh Dhahran and their raiders sometimes invest Wadi Faruq. They are the only inhabitants of the Jafurah Desert. Jabrin is their property. They sometimes visit Qatar in their peregrinations and they frequent the district of Aqal to a certain extent. A few Al Murra are among the bedouins who resort annually to Anik in the Qatif oasis and. who are regarded as having a permanent connection with the place . . .” Lorimer estimates the total number of the tribe at approximately 7,000 and the total lighting strength at 2,000. He adds that “ the Al Murra, when pressed by enemies more powerful than themselves ordinarily take refuge in the impenetrable55 Jafurab Desert. But in 1902 the Turks, alter the Oqair outrage [when the A 1 Murra cut up a Turkish force near Oqair Port], succeeded in surprising a large body of them at the wells of Zarnuqah in Kharma and inflicted on them ^a sanguinary defeat. The Amirs of the Wahabis sent frequent expeditions against ^the At Murra, but one only, led by the Amir Feisal, was partially successful. His force, however, reached the scene of action in such a feeble state owing to want of water, that he was obliged to be satisfied with a nominal arrangement and returned to Nejd vanquished rather than victorious. In connection with the postal m the Hasa Sanjak the Turks pay small subsidies to the chief Sheikh of the A1 Murra. But these do not avail to secure the good behaviour of the tribe nor can any revenue be realised from them by the Ottoman Government. About 1865 the A1 Murra were paying the value of 3,000 dollars as revenue to the ahabi Amir, and duung the recent conflict in Central Arabia they supported the Wahabi cause, but they are not at present tributaries of Ibn Saud.” The Admiralty Handbook of Arabia (May 1916) describes the A1 Murra as Vol. I, pp. ‘‘ a savage and ill-known tribe, wholly nomadic, who range from the south of Hasa 88-89.’ 1 into the Jafurah Desert and down to the wild oasis of Jabrin. ... On the north they come up to near Oqair, while inland they lie south of the Hofuf-Riyadh routes, which they harry, as far as the borders of Kharj. In most of this inhospitable tract they wander alone and neither the Turks nor the Ibn Sands, whose feudatories they nominally are, have ever been able to follow them far enough to subdue them. . . . They are said to number about 7,000 souls and to turn out 2,000 fighting- men. . . . The whole tribe . . . maintains perpetual feud with the Ai'man and the Beni Khalid.” J VRegister No. SECRET.

The conclusions oi the meeting are flagged 1 ). There was general agreement that Sir A. Ryan, on his return to Jedda, should aim at a general settlement of outstanding questions with Ibn Saud, which might be embodied in a new treaty, and that as part of such settlement we should be prepared to meet Ibn Saud on the question of his eastern boundary, so far as this can be done consistently with our own political and strategic interestsy and the legitimate claims of our clients. After making all allowance for these interests and claims, there is probably a noman’s land m the interior of Eastern Arabia over which we could be prepared to acknowledge Ibn Baud’s authority. Before any concrete and detailed proposals can be discussed with him, however, it is necessary to determine our own limiting requirements m the immediate hinterland of the coast. The Defence Depts. will of course be taken into consultation regarding the strategic requirements. Meanwhile, the most convenient procedure will be to obtain, as a first step, from the Political Resident the information asked for m the draft empre r . s j nt kec which is submitted. Reference is also invited to the note which Col. Fowle has recorded since the meeting, and which is flagged E. In this he suggests that it may eventually be found best to aim at a tribal rather than a strictly geographical basis of settlement. Col. Fowle, with whom eooo 3/34 i have discussed the matter, is of course aware of the various/various difficulties in the way of this otherwise of his suggestion with the Depts. concerned before the general egotiations reach a stage at which concrete proposals have to be embodied in a draft treaty or/agreement wiuh Ibn Saud. Meanwhile, m obtaining information from hie Gulf we may ask that particular attention should be given to the location and allegiances of the txibes in the hinterland. j it was agreed at the meeting that in their preliminary conversations with Fuad Hamza in London It would Mr. Rendel and Sir a. Ryan would go slow. obviously be premature to say too much m these preliminary talks, both because we do not wish to give away our most important bargaining-asset m advance, and because it will necessarily take time before we can decide on the limits and nature of the concession to be offereci. It was therefore agreed that the blue line should still be referred to as the only frontier that r^sts on a definite legal basis. At the same time, it was agreed that we need not take up so stiff an attitude in regard to it as we have hitherto done, especially as Sir A. Ryan was certain nat to do so would nip the negotiations in the buu. hue formula devised at 0 b)of the conclusions seems to steer adequately between the opposite difficulties.Draft Paper. Department.

One desiderat um of Ibn Saud to which he attaches utmost importance is to secure modification of attitude ^— hitherto adopted 6 y fl.HuCh that the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913' and 1914 necessarily constitutes the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. F.U. are now advised that, while these conventions and Ibn Baud's position as successor to Turkey give us^bargaining asset^ of some value, nevertheless territory to east of blue line, so far as/ 2531 5000 2.34I (1)/ Id sd |) - , / y ^ as it cannot be claimed for Truciai J3heik.is av Muscat, is a res nullim, in^which Ibn Saad is entitled to acquire rights by occupation or prescription, fin any case, it is a matter of great political importance not to allow prospects of a general settlement which would be ox advantage to ^ r s */ ^ ' H.M.G. to break down over question of blue line. It has therefore been decided that m ^ * Ryan’s negotiations the whole question oi y ' 4&gt; ^ v (,&lt;• # the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia shou be discussed without pre-conditions, a ,, that, as part of a'n&lt;5w general settlement rivinp: H.M.G. their main desi^iS^.aaa, in other directions, H.M.G. should be prepar to mahe concessions in regard to the eastern limrbs of Saudi Arabia, as generous as is consistent with their own strategic and other requirements in Eastern Arabia, and the legitimate claims of the Truciai Sheikhs and the Sultan of Muscat. 4.

Rendel, Esq., C.M.G., F.O. With reference to the meeting of the I iddle East Committee on 13th September on the subject of relations / with Saudi Arabia, I enclose copy of an / interesting note by Fowie, m which he / suggests that in making any concession to Ibn Saud regarding the eastern limits of his dominions and dependencies, we should aim at a settlement on a tribal rather than a strictly geographical basis - that is, that, instead of / agreeing with him on a fixed frontier dram on the map, we should agree with him as to the tribes over which we acknowledge his authority. This suggestion seems m many ways attractive, though it also involves certain difficulties. Fowie only puts lkclosure in weekly '.El ter n-7 or-n '107/1 it forward at this stage as a suggestion which it is worth while to explore. It will m any case take time to arrive at any precise conclusion as to the limits of the concessions (tribal or territorial) which we are m a position to offer to Ibn Saud, ana we are taking steps to obtain from the aulf all possible information which may be relevant to the various aspects of the matter. No doubt, before the negotiations j at Jedda reach the stage at y/hich concrete and detailed proposals regarding Easternlastern Arabia have bo oe embodied in a draft treaty or agreement, there will be opportunity for considering Fowle’s suggestion, together with any other possible basis for a settlement. I am sending copy of this letter anc Fowle’s note to Hind and to the Depts. represented on the Committee. Yours sincerely (SiJ J, C. WALTON. rt nith reference to the C.I.D. meeting of 13 th instant on the subject of the Blue Line at which it was agreed that, provided Ibn Saud was ready to grant H.M.G. their desiderata, H.M.G. on their side were prepared to negotiate generously with him with regard to the Line, i*e, give him substantial concessions east of it. It ' as 0*120 agreed that a corollary of this policy might be that the large area of indefinite no man’s land which at present lies between the territories of our clients (the Arab Sheikhs of the Persian Gulf including the Sultan of Muscat) and the Saudi Empire might have to disappear; that the frontiers ofthe Arab Sheikhdoms might have to be defined and drawn on the map (it would be impossible to do so on the ground); and that these frontiers and those of the Saudi Empire v^ould have to be coterminous. 2 . Since the meeting I have been giving this question of frontiers some further consideration, and have come to the conclusion that though these frontier lines will look very nice and neat on the map, off the map and in actual working practice they may be a considerable nuisance/- 2 - nuisance, if not a danger. Frontiers, while necessary elsewhere, in Arabia are merely necessary evils only to be drawn when unavoidable. The population ofthe country is nomadic - the tribes wandering considerable distances according to the season in search of water and pasture, ilhe average Arab Sheikh has a very vague idea as to where his texritory begins and ends^ and often there are no well- defined physical features along which a boundary could conveniently be placed. In the eyes of the average Arab - and when one is considering the creation of frontiers one must consider local public opinion however unorthodox this may appear - a frontier is not so much geographical as tribal and political. A Sheikh in answer to a question as to how fai his authority extends will rarely answer from A to B; he will say over such and such a tribe. 3. The advantages of 1he present situation^under which there are no fixed frontiers between the territories of our clients and Ibn Saud 1 s empire^are obvious. Where there are no j.rontiers there can be no encroachments. If, for instance, there is raiding and counter-raiding in the Arabian hinterland of the Trucial Coast, neither our clients nor Ibn Saud can apply to us. The matter is/is settled somehow or other beti/veen the two parties. Once however we draw definite frontiers - in itself a matter of great difficulty and involving amongst other features the consent of our clients (including the Sultan of Muscat, juridically an independent sovereign) - the question will assume quite a different aspect. A raid or an encroachment across a frontier (which however clear on a map will he totally unintelligible to the tribes on the spot) by Ibn Saud f s bedouin will be followed by an appeal from our injured client; while a similar raid or encroachment by one of our clients will be followed by a note from Ibn Saud. In these (Circumstances it seems probable that we may be engulfed in a morass of complaints and counter-complaints, the net result of which will be not an entente with Ibn Saud, which is our object, but the reverse. 4 . Further - the drawing of fixed frontiers might well involve H.M.G. in a measure of responsibility for protecting their clients by land as well as by sea . (except 101 KuwaiL^our defensive commitments'to the other Sheikhs are limited to the sea only). Do H.M.G. want to commit themselves to maintaining the authority 3 j with/■-wi'feli' the Crucial Coast Sheikhs up to a line drawn in the interior far away from the ..coast? Lastly - Ibn Saud, like the rest of us ? must die some day. Nobody, I think, knows exactly what will happen when he is gathered to his fathers. To meet this eventuality would not a more or less fluid situation be preferable to a static one? 5 . I certainly do not suggest that the difficulties noted above should in any way hold up whatever steps can now be taken to negotiate an understanding with Ibn Saud, but I think they should be borne in mind. I think also that it might be possible to overcome them. While fixed frontiers are unavoidable between the Saudi Empire and countries such as Iraq and Transjordan I doubt whether they are essential between the Trucial Coast and the Saudi Empire. It might be possible once in a way to adopt the Arabian point of view, and make the frontiers tribal instead of geographical N and to say to Ibn Saud: A not that we agree that your territory extends up to such and such imaginary line, but: we agree that your authority extends over such and such tribes. 6. The idea in itself (though on this point Sir Andrew Ryan is naturally the best authority) might appeal to Ibn/f o Ibn Saad himself as falling in with Arab^ideas as giving him - ostensibly at any rate - plenty of elbow room, and as avoiding fixed frontiers 'which arouse in most Arab rulers a feeling of pronounced claustrophobia, 7 , I see one difficulty in connection with this tribal frontier suggestion and doubtless there are more. The tribes which Ibn Saud raises claim to may come much nearer to the coast than suits us. However I think the suggestion is worth exploring and one step in this direction would be - at some stage in the proceedings - to^ obtain from Ibn Saud a list of the tribes in the|Trucial Coast and Oman territories which he claims to be under his suzerainty. When this list is available we will try and work out what are the rough geographical limits of these tribes.38200 / 34 * v^. i q .•&lt; ..i ■ i ? w ' • V J CYPSSR TiSUgORAH from tb« S 90 ratary of State for the Ooloniee to the Reeident at Men.

I enclose a draft telegram to Reilly and should be glad to know whether you concur in it. Though I do not think that you are directly concerned, the position in the Hadramaut, so far as we know, closely follows that in the Persian Gulf area: also the eastern end of the Hadramaut joins up with the territories of the Sultan of Muscat. We have, therefore, thought it best to let you see the telegram so as to be sure that it does not conflict in c - -'/ALTON, ESQ., C.B., M.C.DRAFT TELEGRAM theQesident , ADEN. Secret. No. Tt is probable that in near fixture negotiations may be opened with Ibn Saud in an endeavour to settle with him all outstanding questions of major importance. As you are aware boundaries of Ottoman territory in eastern and south east em Arabia were laid down in convention between United Kingdom and Turkey of March 9th 19114 -. His Majesty^ Government are now of opinion that Ibn Saud may have a reasonable claim to certain areas east and south-east of blue and violet lines (see Annex C of convention). In view of possible claims of Ibn Saud it may be desirable to know for purpose of coming negotiations what are hinterland boundaries of sultans of Hadramaut with whom His Majesty’s Government are in treaty relations. These boundaries must presumably be settled primarily by limits of tribal areas over which sultans concernede?) \ O concerned exercise jurisdiction, 'but there may be certain physical features in boundary areas which it would be desirable toretain if possible within territories of sultans concerned though they may not strictly be within their territories.

THE CHAIRMAN explained that the meeting had been called at the request of the Foreign Office in view of the fact that Fuad Bey Hamza* the acting Saudi Minister for Foreign Affairs* was shortly arriving in London with the intention of discussing various political questions* in cluding that of the south-eastern boundary of Saudi -Arabia, no 1 i t th erefore se erne d des Arable t o ible the main i ines of policy to all t he more ne cess ary since * a s iderat ion of th e questi on of the ,audi- Arabia * in the light of the avail able* cert a in important new-2- which materially modified the situation. It was also desirahle to take advantage of the presence of Sir Andrew Ryan and Lieutenant Colonel Fowle in England on leave to obtain their views orally on the various questions involved. The new factors in the situation were (a) legal, and (b) political. The legal position was discussed in the note by Mr. Beckett which had already been circulated (M.S.(o) 136). It could 'be summarised as follows:- Since the decision reached last March, that His Majesty s Government should take their stand firmly on the 'blue line ? laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 - 1914 ao boundary of Ibn Saud’s dominions (30th meeting, conclusion l(a) &gt;, the legal position had been re-examined, and it now seemed clear that it would be most difficult for His Majesty's Government to establish an unassailable legal case. The reason of this was that the 'blue line' did not, as had at first been supposed, mark a division between two areas under clearly defined sovereignties but that the area immediately to the east of it was not demonstrably under any effective sovereignty and might fall to be regarded as a political vacuum. Wiile therefore it would have been legally possible to hold Ibn Saul to the 'blue line' had the area to the east of it been under either our own sovereignty or that of any of our Arab proUgSs, the fact that the boundary was, so to speak, a purely negative one, and that Ton Saud was now known to have established settlements to the east of it many years ago, greatly complicated position, The new political factor, however, was even more important. . + thnt TbP Saud attached very great importance It was now evident that ion o.-ut „ Tp we were to continue to take our indeed to this question. we weio i pi o-vee inP' at most uo o^ui stand rigidly on the 'blue line , agreeing - minor adjustments in it, as had at first been contemplated, it seeirted clear that a first class dispute with Ibn Saud would develop. Was it really worth while embarking on such a disputeovsp an area unlikely lo 'be of any real value and. over which neither His Majesty’s Government nor their Arab protege! in fact claimed any rights of sovereignty? On the other hand ? to make any large concession to Ibn Sand in this area after the firm line we had taken at the beginning of these discussions might well, if the matter were handled in isolation, be regarded as a complete surrender to Saudi pressure and do considerable injury to our prestige. Meanwhile, Sir A. Ryan in his memorandum of July 30th (M.E*(0) 137) had nut forward certain tentative suggestions for a new general settlement with Ibn Saul of all outstanding questionsc These suggestions seemed to offer a possible solution of the difficulty; for if a generous territorial concession were made to Ibn Saud in South Eastern Arabia as part of a general settlement from which we ourselves obtained important advantages elsewhere, the concession would no longer be regarded as a surrender, but merely as a part of a bargain satisfactory to both sides, and it might become a very useful counter in our hands in enabling us to secure certain concessions from Ibn Saud over, e,g. the Eoweit blockade, the Transjordan frontiers, and the Hasa air route, which we badly needed. Before proceeding to further discussion of this political aspect of the question, however, Mr, Rendel suggested that it would be well if Mr. Fitzmaurice would explain the legal position, MR. FITZ Ml URICS said that the legal position was briefly as follows. The territory between the ’’blue line” and the inland limits of the Sheikhdoms under the protection of His Majesty’s Government was in actual fact not British protected territory, as had been assumed when the matter was first con sidered, but a no-man’s-land, and, therefore, what was termed in law res nulling. While such territory was not occupied either by us or by Rulers under our protection, it was open to acquisition or occupation on the part of Ibn Saud* Theposition was in fact that we could not legally hold the 191*3/14 Conventions to he hinding on Ihn Sand in a purely negative sense, and if Ihn Baud could, In fact, establish any authority over any part of this area and had not acknowledged any other sovereignty over it, the 1913/14 Conventions would, not help us* SIR ANDREW RYAN said that from his recent interview with King Ihn Baud at Taif (see M*E«(o) 138) he was completely satisfied that Ihn Baud attached the greatest importance to this question# Ion Baud had maintained that his ancestral claims to the hinterland of South-eastern Arabia had been recognised by us at the time of the Felly mission In 1865 and again in our relations with him during the war. King Ion Baud was deeply perturbed. Sir A, Ryan had never heard him so emphatic; and he was convinced that neither legal arguments nor diplomatic negotiations would induce Ibn Baud to give in to His Majesty f s Government on this point. If he were compelled to do so by force majeur e, as Sir A. Ryan had explained in his note circulated as Paper M„E # (o) 141, this would utterljr destroy Ibn Baud’s confidence In His Majesty’s Government and would certainly have the worst possible effect on Anglo-Ssudi relations. THE CHAIRMAN said that it was now clear that none of the Rulers under our protection claimed any territory as far inland as the ’’blue line”. We were under no obligation, therefore, to our proteges to keep Ibn Baud out of this empty area, provided, of course, we did not allow him to encroach on their territorial rights. In the case of Qatar, the Sheikh had made it clear that he did not claim up to the 'blue line' and we had specifically limited our offer of protection to the so-called 'protection line' across the base of the peninsula. We should be making no sacrifice, therefore, in recognising Ibn Baud’s claims to the empty area, to the east of the 'blue line', and should lose no 55 (cf * Paper No. M*E#(o) 139 p*p SI &amp; 22) •-5- prestige by such a concession, provided it were made in return for such important and tangible advantages as those he had already alluded to. • LIEUT. COLONEL FOWLS and MR. WALTON- considered that it would be very desirable in the first place to obtain an authoritative opinion from the Law Officers of the Crown as to the legal position. No harm could be done by this, and some unexpected fact might still emerge which might influence our policy. THE CHAIRMAN, while not wishing to oppose a reference of the matter to the Law Officers, pointed out that the Law Officers’ opinion was unlikely, in fact, to affect the issue, which was fundamentally a political one. Even if the Law Officers were to decide that His Majesty’s G-overnment were on unassailable ground in trying to hold Ibn Saud to the ’’blue line”, the new political factors now under discussion would be unaltered, and it would be no less desirable to make a generous concession to Ibn Saud in this area as part of a general settlement if we could do so. Moreover, Fuad Hamza, was arriving In the near future, and it would be impossible to obtain a Law Officers’ opinion before discussions with him began, and it was desirable to decide before then on the main lines of our policy* A long discussion then followed on the Question whether the matter should be referred to the Law Officers or not. MR. FIT3MAURICE said that, while he saw no objection to a reference to the Law Officers, he thought that it would not greatly advance matters* If the question were to be referred to the Law Officers, it would be desirable to frame a reference as simply as possible, preferably on general grounds and on the assumption that the area, to the east of. the ’’blue line was, in fact, res nulljus . The Law Officers might then be asked for an opinion whether Ibn Saud could, in faco, legally-6 claim any sovereignty over this empty area, notwithstanding the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913/14o It was pointed out, however, that it would he necessary, in order to frame this question, to establish a great number of facts to the Law Officers’ satisfaction, and it was suggested that the question was indeed more one of fact than of lawa In any case it would be necessary to submit a great mass of material to the Law Officers and the Chairman doubted whether the labour involved would be justified. MR. BARLOW asked whether there was any likelihood of Ibn Saud referring the question to any international court. THE CHAIRMAN thought this most improbable. Ibn Baud was unlikely to be influenced by legal considerations ana. mistrusted non-British or international instituticu±s. preferred to deal with His Majesty’s Government direct. Saudi Arabia was not a member of the League. SIR ANDREW RYAN agreed and explained that Ibn Saud would draw no distinction between tne legal and political aspects of the matter. No final conclusion was reached on the subject Ox an eventual reference to the Law Officers, but it was agreed that a decision on this point could oe postponed until after Fuad Hamza’s visit. Meanwhile the question could be pursued on its political side. tub CHAIRMAN said that it was clear that we could not recognise Ibn Sand’s sovereignty over any territory to which any of our Arab proteges had a reasonable claim. On the. other hand it would be difficult, if there was to be any hope of reaching an agreement with him, to r^lUoC his claim over any part of the empty area. He suggestedthat it would ’be well in the first place to establish exactly what were the maximum territorial limits which we could claim for our proteges in the hinterland* hearing in mind their rights over nomadic tribes* and strategic and geographical factors. It would clearly be necessary to know these limits* which would establish the maximum limits of any concession which could he made to Ibn Saud. LIEUT 0 COLONEL FOWLS and MR. WALTON agreed to collect information as to the landward frontiers of the Trucial Sheikhdoms, as soon as possible. LIEUT. COLONEL FOWLS pointed out 9 however* that His Majesty’s Government had assumed no responsibility to protect the Trucial Sheikhdoms from aggression hy land* hut if fixed frontiers were drawn it might possibly involve His Majesty’s Government in some measure of protection 0 Meanwhile it was agreed that the opportunity should be taken of Fuad Hamza’s visit to try to ascertain Ibn Saud Vs minimum desiderata. SIR ANDREW RYAN expressed the view in this connection that Ibn Saud had no designs on the territory actually administered hy the Trucial Sheikhs and admitted his treaty obligation to respect them. There was more reason for anxiety lest he should occupy portions of the coast between the Sheikhdoms. His claims east of the blue line rested not merely on the existence of some Ikhwan settlements jubt beyond it but on the acceptance of his authority by tribes, notably the Murra and the Manasir. On the other hand Ibn Saud bun been perturbed by the attitude of His Majesty’s Government and might agree to a compromise* if His Majesty s Government on their side were generous. Sir Andrew Ryan recalled thatin one of the conversations Fuad Hamza had suggested in a non committal manner the possiDility of a boundary running due south from a point about midway across the base of tne Qatar peninsula to the north-eastern extremity of the Hadramaut. MR. WALTON said that in the India Office view an entente cordiale and a general settlement with Ibn Baud, as envisaged by Sir Andrew Ryan ? would be of great advantage. If this v&gt;?ere embodied in a treaty, so much the better. The chief value would be from the point of view of publicity and prestige* esuedaily if it were made clear that we had come oo an agree ment with Ibn Baud and were united in a common policy. He tnought that the India Office would be prepared to agree to an eventual concession of territory to Ibn Baud on the east of the 'blue line”. The extent of such concession should be governed by the limits which we thought it desirable to claim for the protect ed sheikhdoms and Muscat on account either of our own strategic or other requirements or of such claims as could be established on behalf of the sheikhs and the Sultan of Muscat. ihcse requirements and claims would need careful examination which wou1d t ake time. COLONEL FOWLS also agreed that a general settlement with Ibn Laud which provided for the solution of various Persian Gulf problems such as the raising of the Koweit blockade would be an excellent thing. CAPTAIN KING said that the Admiralty, on general grounds, were in favour of the proposal for a settlement. COLONEL ISHAY said that the War Office also agreed, as •p^ n, ft r\ T‘ i'a i -jti ons to bo ostab 1 isiicd with they were anxious for good relations ou Ibn Baud. Some further discussion then took place as to the nature of Ibn Sand’s rights to the east of the 'blue line . u-omo difference of opinion was expressed as to whether the levy of tribute (zikat) ctfuld be regarded as a proof of sovereigntyor not ? Lieutenant'Colonel Fowle taking the view that such tribute was in the nature of blackmail or banegeld , (cf. Paper MeSL (0)140) and Sir Andrew Ryan taking the view that it could equally be regarded as taxation and adduced as evidence of suzerainty. It Yv r as eventually unanimously agreed that it would be most undesirable to risk a major quarrel with Ibn Baud on this question and that by far the best solution would be to be prepared., so far as compatible with our own requirements and the just claims of the other Arab states?to make to Ibn Saud generous territorial concessions in south-eastern Arabia in return for a satisfactory general settlement of other important out standing questions 5 e.g. the Koweit blockade? the Transjordan frontier? etc. THE CHAIEMM said that he thought the possibility of un suspected mineral wealth being found in the empty area ought to be borne in mind. He personally thought that the risk of such wealth being found must be accepted and not be allowed to in fluence our policy? but the possibility ought nevertheless not to be overlooked^ THE CHAIRMAN then raised the question of the so-called violet line' ? as established by the Anglo-Turki sh Convention of 1914 2 running from the intersection or the r olue line' witn parallel 520 North to the Aden Pro tec borate. ±r impoitanu con cessions were to be made to Ibn baud over the bmie j. i n e ? (i.e. to the North of parallel 20) and his sovereignty was to be recognised up to the inland frontiers of the sultanates of i-mscat and Oman? this frontier would be taken much further east along the 20th parallel than the present point of departure of Lie 'violet line'. Presumably also the line dividing Ibn baud s Dominions from the Hadramaut wound in any case run well to the south or south-east of the present north-eastern end of the 'violet line'. It was desirable to obtain the fullest possible information as to the position in the northern Hadramaut in order - 9 -that we might not give away any potentially important area merely through ignorance. A further question which arose was where the frontier between the Hadramaut and Saudi Arabia would end and that between the Hadramaut and the Yemen begin. These points were not of immediate importance^ and as far as he knew there was no agreed frontier between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen in the Rub a-a1-Kah1i. But it was desirable to obtain all possible information at an early date, as the question would certainly arise if any general redefinition of the frontiers of Saudi Arabia on the lines suggested by Sir A. Ryan were to be attempted. MR. WALTON undertook to take the necessary action to collect material regarding the inland limits to be claimed for the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman. But it was pointed out that it might be necessary to consult the Sultan of Muscat, and also that he might have to be made a party to any final settlement, as, unlike the Trucial Sheikhs, he was an independent Sovereign. It was agreed, however, that this point could be left over for the present, and could perhaps in any case be got over by some formula or by some supplementary treaty instrument. MR. BLAXTER and the AIR MINISTRY REPRESENTATIVES under took to collect further information regarding the inland limits of the Hadramaut. THE CHAIRMAN then raised the question of the particular advantages which His Majesty's Government should seek to obtain in any general treaty settlement. Sir A. Ryan had suggested a redefinition of xrentiers, ano this would be11- &lt;£&amp;&gt; ^ particularly desirable in Transjordan where a most difficult frontier problem was developing* Owing to the inaccuracy of the maps used when the frontiers were defined ? and the loose definitions contained in the relevant instruments, it was uncertain whether the frontiers should be regarded as defined in the light of the geographical co-ordinates or of the physical features as shewn in the early maps. The point was important as it affected, among other areas, certain hey positions for the Royal Air Force in the Jebel Tubeik area, etc. It would be most satisfactory to get this frontier properly defined and also to get the present unsatisfactory d e facto southern frontier of Transjordan redefined and regularised. SIR A. RYAIi considered it unlikely that Ibn Baud would agreed formally to abandon all claim to Akaba and Maan. He might, however, be induced to redefine the de f acto line or possibly to agree to a delimitation on the spot. It was agreed that there would be no objection to this provided, of course, that the High Commissioner agreed. MR. BLAXTER said that it might be difficult for the Colonial Office to put forward their desiderata pending the preparation of certain new naps which would not be ready for five months, but it was thought possible that the war Office and Air Ministry could produce the necessary data from their recent aerial survey. The question of the Iraqi frontier then being raised, it was agreed that it would be preferable not to attempt to bring Iraq into the proposed settlement, more especially as the Saudi—Iraq frontier was not in such urgent need of redefinition.-12 i-Yiiii CHAIRMAN suggested that our main desideratum in any new settlement should be the removal of* the K owe it Blockade, This was becoming most urgent ? particularly in view of the growing importance of Koweit as a key position from the point oi view of British Imperial strategy. This, however, and such other matters as the possible concession to Ibn Baud over the Bahrein transit dues and direct shipments to Hasa (a concession which he thought would have to be made in any case) could perhaps be most suitably discussed in detail separately la ter on. The question was then discussed of the line to be followed in the forthcoming discussions with Fuad Hamza on the subject of the ’'blue line'. The Chairman explained that it would be most difficult to adopt a purely non committal attitude on this question, and that if a favourable atmosphere was to be created for the negotiations to be initinted by S1r A . Ryan on his return in November, it would be necessary to give Fuad Hamza some ground for hope that Ibn Baud’s desiderata on this question would be met- in a gene rou s spirit. SIR A. RYAN agreed, and felt that, if there was to be any prospect of bringing off a satisfactory new general settlement on his return in November, it would be essential to give Fuad Bey Hamza now some definite- hope that we would meet Ibn Baud’s desiderata generously over the question of the 'blue line' in the proposed settlement. He felt sure that this would make all the difference both to the prospects of getting a general settlement and to his own task in negotiating it.After much further disucssion, agreement was eventually reached on this point on the lines of conclusion (a) below. THE CHAIRMAN also agreed to ask Fuad Bey Hamza to define Ibn Baud’s minimum requirements in regard to his south-eastern frontier, since, if confirmation could be obtained from Fuad Bey Hamza of the line which he had suggested in his conversation with Sir A. Ryan alluded to above, the problem would be considerably simplified, while it would in any case be useful to know how far Ibn Baud’s present claims extended. GROUP CAPTAIN McCLAUGHRY pointed out that the Air- Ministry had undertaken to protect Qatar,, on the understanding that aircraft would operate up to the ’’blue line’*. If the radius of action for aircraft was limited to the southern base of the Qatar peninsula, its protection would be all the more difficult, unless aircraft are allowed to cross the frontier in pursuit of any raiders who may carry out tip and run raids. The position is very similar in the case of any other protectorate to which we might promise security from landward aggression. It was essential for the Air Force to have depth and an area ’to turn round in’ if they were to operate effectively in pursuit of raiders. The weakness from a strafetical point of view of a frontier for Qatar across the base of tno peninsula, (the protection frontier) is that owing to the short distances involved it would enable raids to be carried out from Saudi Arabia across the frontier to any oil or other establishments which might be set up and the culprits could escape back across the frontier under cover of darkness.(Bt, \ If ? as would probably be the case? the Royal Air Force were then precluded by political considerations from crossing the frontier in pursuit it would be most difficult to imple ment our guarantee of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar* What the Air Ministry require is not necessarily a neutral zone? but a frontier with Saudi far forward as possible from any oil or which may be set up in Qatar* Arabia which is as other establishments In that event if raids occur there should then be opportunities for locating and intercepting the raiders both on the way in and on the way out before they reach the frontier and our agents can work in the area for the purpose of collect ing intelligence * The closer the frontier Is to any establishments in Qatar the more difficult It would be to intercept raiders before they escaped back across the frontier, and the more likely it is that the Royal Air Force would hav r e to ask for permission to pursue them across the frontier imo Saudi Arabia* That being so? the Air Ministry hoped that in any con cession to be made to Ibn Saud the new frontier would not be brought too close to the present protection limit either in Qatar or elsewhere*. MR. WALTON suggested that the Royal Air Force require- merits south of the Qatar protection limit would he one of the factors to he taken into account in deciding the limits of the concession to be made to Ibn Saud* THE CHAIRMAN pointed out that it had been contemplated from the first that it might be necessary to shift the 'blue line' eastwards up to the head of the Dohat-es-Salwa, and that it would probably be necessary oo make tne .-or,- stories -13A-1 Q -14- of Ibn Baud and of the Trucial Sheikhs including the Sheikh of A &lt;■ atar co-terminous. In such an event, if the Air Ministry still needed a margin, it might perhaps be necessary to shift the protection line further north. This question, however, did not affect the main issue of principle, except in so far as it showed the necessity of establishing really sound strategic a.' frontiers for the 'Trucial Sheikhdoms and the hinterland of Muscat. It would be better to draw these frontiers on this principle and to leave a stretch of territory on their seaward side virtually unprotected rather than to attempt to establish any regular 'neutral zones'. Neutral zones in Arabia had proved nothing but an unmitigated nuisance, and the system of neutral zones as adopted at Koweit could certainly be pronounced a failure. CONCnJ SIGNS: THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed: (a) That the Foreign Office should, in the_ impending conversations with mad Bey Hamza, exolain to him that His Majesty’s Government regard the 'blue line' as the only^frontier that rests on a definite legal basis but that they would be prepared to discuss the whole question of the eastern frontier of Saudi Arabia, without pre-conditions and in a gen erous spirit as part of a new general settle ment giving His Majesty’s Government their main desiderata in o txier directions. (b) That the India Office, in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gu 1 f and the competent Befence 1*epartments, should take urgent steps to collect ail available information as to the inland bound aries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms and of fcne sultanates of Muscat and Oman, and to consider what would constitute a suitable political, tribal, geographical, and strategical inland frontier, between those territories and the dominions of Ibn Baud.

This was part of our policy of using the Arab desire for liberation from the Turkish yoke as an Allied weapon against the Turks. endorsed by implication the thesis that the Turks had been holding,the Arab countries in duress. 2. It ensues from 1. that Ibn baud's ancestral claims must oe considered with reference to the period between the first period of Saudi expansion and the re-establishment of Turkish rule in Arabia in and about the eighteen seventies. It is therefore material,to know what was the position of the house of baud in the country east and south-east of Nejd during that period, which may perhaps be narrowed to the period from 1809, when we went for the Trucial Sheykhs, and 1865, the year of the Pelly mission. 3. European criteria of sovereignty cannot be applied to the Arabia of a hundred years ago. The limits of what we call sovereignty were the limits of effective authority at any given moment. Its basis was not the holding of specific territories, a word then without meaning in seas jf desert, but....but religious and tribal influence. The Iimmate of Muscat would appear to have maintained its religious and political independence during the material period. The Trucial Sheykhs on the other hand had embraced Wahhabism before 1809 and seem to have been regarded by us in and after that year as the advanced posts of a militant political power founded on Wahhabismc It is a matter for further historical inquiry, whether they, and more especially their hinterland with which we are now concerned, were subject to or merely under the influence of the Beni Baud at crucial moments, Bog, at the moment of the Belly mission. 4. By the agreements 0 f 1913 and 1914, we recognised Turkish sovereignty, without reference to the claims of any local Arabs, up to the blue and violet lines. The Turks renounced any claims to sovereignty east and south** east of those lines and recognised implicitly that the country beyond them constituted a British sphere of influence. This influence was dependent on the position we had built up during the nineteenth century as quasi- protectors of Muscat and the Trucial Sheykhdoms,5* As regards the Trucial SheykMoms, we re- aftirmed our special position hy our agreement with Ihn Saud in 1915 but we took no steps to dotermino ■boundaries and we allowed Ibn Baud to extend his iir* flue nee well into the hinterland of the Sh e y kh d o rns» We made no attempt between 1915 and 1933 to assert that he was limited by the blue and violet lines as such 3 though we maintained the principle that he must not encroach on the Trucial Sheykhdomso 6 e Whatever may be the must in my view be regarded with Ibn Baud’s dominions. boundaries, the Sheykhdoms as being conterminous We cannot reasonably claim that any past transactions have created a British sphere of influence independent of both. If we asserted such a clairp on technical legal grounds un intelligible to the Arab mind, we should be regarded by all Arabs alike as imperialist invaders worse than the Turks and we should be undertaking commitments impossible of fulfilment s if the intervening area should become important, e 0 g a as a theatre of economic enterprise* 7 0 It would be merely absurd to claim that the disputed area is a sphere of influence of any of the coastal rulers* If we are determined to exclude Ibn Saud from it at all costs, we must go the whole hog and claim that it is the actual territory, as yet undivided and undelimited, of the Sultan of Muscat and/or the Trucial Sheykhs* 8 C I conclude that our objective should be an entirely new settlement with Ibn Baud, taking into account (a) his invincible hostility to any recognition4. of past Turkish rights or pretensions; (b) the absolute necessity 5 in my view, of regarding the coastal states as being conterminous with Saudi Arabia; (c) the fact that, if we or the coastal rulers had valid claims to the disputed area in 1915, we have allowed them to go by default by our tolerance of Ibn Saud ? s extension of his influence in the hinterland of the Trucial Sheykhdoms; and (d) the desirability of using such technical legal rights as we can claim, less to confine Ibn Baud territorially than to ensure adequate British partici pation in future economic enterprises in the disputed area and a free run for our aircraft along the Persian Gulf coast, 9* As regards technical legal rights we may well bear in mind what the future Duke of Wellington said in 1804:- 'I would rather sacrifice Gwalior, or every frontier of India, ten times over, in order to preserve our credit for scrupulous good faith, and the advantages and honor we gained by the late war and the peace; and we must not fritter them away in arguments, drawn from over-strained principles of the law or nations, which are not understood in this country'. There is no doubt that the attempt to impose on Ibn Baud the blue and violet lines after twenty years of silence regarding them can only strike Ibn Baud as an attempt to trick him by legal subtleties today out of what we led him to expect when we wished to enlist his support in downing the Turks, then our enemies and always the enemies of his race* He is never likely to give us an unreserved friendship but our policy isto keep him our friend as far as we can do so ty affording him moral hut not material support.

August 3, 1934. Section 1. [E 5063/2429/25] No. 1. Record of Conversations during. Sir A. Ryan's Visit to Taif, July 12-14, 1934.— (Received in Foreign Office, August 3.) WHEN Sheikh Yussuf Yasin met me outside the town on the 12th July, he spoke to me briefly about the King’s reasons for wishing to see me. In the first place, the King had received other foreign representatives in Taif, and he wished to see also the British representative. Indeed, he hoped for an opportunity of receiving me at Riadh as well, where he had seen no British representatives for a long time, although he had met them elsewhere. The King also wished to take this opportunity of explaining his views on certain matters, notably the position to the north of his country, with special reference to Iraq, and the question of his frontiers. I expressed my gratitude to His Majesty for having enabled me to see him at Taif, and said that I had taken the instructions of my Government immediately on receiving his invitation, and had been directed to ascertain the King’s views on the matters that interested him, in order to be able to report on them at home. My Government had drawn my special attention to two matters, one of which Sheikh Yussuf had mentioned, viz., frontiers, the other that of Saudi relations with Koweit. 2. My audience with the King in the evening of the 12th July was almost entirely formal. On my thanking the King for his invitation and all the kindness I had been shown, he referred very pointedly to his hope of seeing me in Riadh also, perhaps after next Ramadan, if the rains were good. The only other matter of interest mentioned was the fact that the return of the heir apparent was delayed, as Seyfal Islam Ahmed had been prevented from completing the return of hostages by trouble with rebellious Yemeni tribes. I gathered from Mr. Philby later in the evening that the news of trouble inland in the Yemen had created some stir in high Saudi circles. Incidentally, Mr. Philby spoke as an unrepentant critic of the recent peace settlement and a non-believer in its permanence. He believed still that the King had got some money payment and an assurance that the administration of the Yemen Tihama would be left in the hands of Abdullah-al-Wazir for not less than a year. 3. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin called on me at 8 a.m. on the 13th July, in accordance with my suggestion that we should have a talk before I discussed serious affairs with the King. I gave him a general outline of my instructions, emphasising the readiness of His Majesty’s Government to cement their relations with Ibn Sand, their belief that a closer relationship could best be attained by the friendly settlement of outstanding questions, of which the most important were those mentioned above; their willingness to engage in conversations about these questions; and their wish to be informed as to the King’s desiderata. I tried to sound Sheikh Yussuf as to whether Fuad Bey could be empowered to hold conversations in London, saying that, if so, His Majesty’s Government had expressed readiness to hear him, or whether the Saudi Government would prefer that the questions should be discussed on my return, after preparation in the interval. Sheikh Yussuf thanked me for my statement and my assurances of the friendly dispositions of His Majesty’s Government, but said that, as the King wished to see me early and could not keep me after 10 a.m., he preferred not to comment on what I had said. He delivered a message from the King, asking me to convey to His Majesty’s Government and the naval authorities an expression of his appreciation of the helpful attitude of the commanders of the Red Sea sloops during the occupation of Hodeida. I responded suitably, saying that the reports of the officers in question had contained constant references to the gracious kindness of the Amir Feisal and the excellence of their relations with Sheikh Abdullah Suleiman, &amp;c. [181 c—1] B B/O I ? Ilii I i ti I J '?i tt : * t n i*i 4. The King received me at 9 a.m. I was accompanied as before by Mr. Furlonge and Ismail Effendi, who interpreted. Sheikh Yussuf Yasin was in attendance. 5. After compliments, I said that my Government had wished me to take the first opportunity of expressing to the King in person the great pleasure with which they had heard of the Saudi-Yemen settlement and their sense of the wisdom which His Majesty had shown in dealing with that matter. The King observed that he desired peace with all his neighbours, firstly, because they were Arabs, and secondly, because there was nothing to divide them. Relying, as he always did, on the friendship of His Majesty’s Government, he had sought their advice. It accorded with his own views, and he had acted on it. I said that His Majesty’s Government believed the settlement to be in the best interest of Arabia and gave the credit for it to the King, who had shown firmness, and had known how to show moderation as well in the last phase. 6. The King’s repeated affirmation of his friendship for His Majesty’s Government gave me the opportunity of saying that it was a primary point in my instructions that I was to reaffirm their friendly dispositions, which were unchanged and unchangeable, towards him and his country. I referred to the importance of removing all possible obstacles to complete friendship by settling certain questions, and to the wish of His Majesty’s Government to be informed as to the desiderata of the King. 7. The King started with the subject of Iraq. His statements were long and involved, but his drift was clear. He thought that all the Arab States needed some outside Power to rely on, and, though there were other friends, that Power should be Great Britain, who was in close relations with all of the States concerned. He was worried lest Iraq, the strongest of the Arab States, should be attacked by Turkey and/or Persia, and lest he should be menaced through Iraq as a result. He observed that he was currently supposed to be hostile to the ruling family of Iraq, but the truth was that he had nothing against them. He desired their interest as well as his own. If the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq were such as to secure Iraq against the attacks he feared, he would be easy in his mind. When Fuad Bey had spoken of an Arab alliance, he had had in mind some arrangement between Iraq and Saudi Arabia to ensure their mutual safety. The King intimated that he would like to see some such arrangement arrived at under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government, the friend of both. 8. I explained that my conversations with Fuad Bey, which had not been completed owing to his illness, had not carried us quite as far as the King suggested, e.g., he had not used the word “alliance” in connexion with Iraq. I was all the more anxious to ascertain the King’s exact meaning, in order that I might convey his ideas in a definite form to my Government. I gathered from his statement that he had in mind three possible things in connexion with the dangers he feared : (a) He had said that he would be easy in his mind, if assured that the arrangements between His Majesty’s Government and Iraq sufficed to safeguard the latter; (b) he had spoken of the possibility of some sort of alliance or defensive treaty between him and Iraq; (c) he had spoken as though he contemplated some sort of an alliance to which His Majesty’s Government could be a party. 9. The King did not demur to my analysis. After some further exchanges, I observed that point (c) was the only one on which I could speak. His Majesty’s Government were animated in regard to the Arab States by a desire to see them prosper and by the friendly sentiments of which we had spoken, but it was contrary to their general policy to enter into alliances except in very special cases Their treaty with Iraq was defined as a “ Treaty of Alliance,” but that alliance was the lesultant of a process by which Iraq had evolved from her Turkish provincial status, through British occupation and subsequent dependence on His Majesty s Government, to her present position. This was a special case, and that of Saudi Arabia presented no analogy, for the simple reason that Ibn Saud had never been dependent on Great Britain. Great Britain had created Irao The King had created himself. ^ • ^ King said that he was not insisting on an alliance with His Majesty s Government. Their firm friendship was as good as any alliance He redefined his ideas m terms which amounted to this : that he would like to come to an arrangement with Iraq, under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government3 \ * by which they would stand together, and which would be supported by an under taking, to be subscribed to by both the parties, that they would not stand against -v Great Britain or support any Power who went against her. He considered that such an arrangement would achieve his own object and would serve the interests of His Majesty’s Government. 11. At 3-30 I called on the Amir Khalid, as Acting President of the Council. This visit was purely formal. The Prince was shy but self-possessed, and made mild efforts at conversation. 12. The King received me again at 4 p.m. After compliments, I said that I hoped for a further expression of his views. He replied that he had nothing more to say. In view of what Sheikh Yussuf had told me, this was obviously merely a device for throwing on us the onus of initiating the discussion of the frontier question. I therefore said that one of the outstanding questions which His Majesty’s Government desired to see settled was that of his eastern boundaries. I explained how convinced His Majesty’s Government were that the only legal basis was that resulting from the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. The King, I said, now ruled what had been a part of the Ottoman Empire, and had succeeded to the position of the former Turkish Government. If this thesis, to which His Majesty’s Government held strongly, was admitted, they would be prepared to consider modifications of the legal frontier. I must, however, make it clear that what they had in view was minor modifications, a qualification rendered necessary by the comprehensiveness of the claims put forward in the last Saudi note in regard to Qatar and the country towards Muscat and Oman. 13. This started the King in a most vehement statement. Catching on to the mention of Qatar, Muscat and Oman, he said that he might well claim all these places as really his. He scouted the idea that the coastal principalities represented true sovereignties. They owed their existence to people who came from over the sea for trading purposes. He was not, however, he explained care fully, claiming them now, as he had entered into an agreement with His Majesty’s Government regarding them. He was not going back on that agreement, even though his rule would be welcomed in the coastal areas themselves. He merely cited the more extensive claims, which would be justified but for that agreement, in support of what he did claim, viz., authority over tribes like the Murra, an authority extending from Hhafra all the way, I gathered, to the hinterland of Oman. He denied the justice of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, even though they should insist on it, and he should be compelled to yield. 14. I cannot reproduce in an exact form what the King said, but the foregoing paragraph gives the main lines of his thesis, which, as regards his ancestral claims, he supported by the following arguments, interspersed in his discourse :— (a) His historical claim to Qatar, Muscat and Oman, which he had renounced, was borne out by what had passed between one of his predecessors and Colonel Felly. He spoke of a treaty or agreement as having been reached at that time. He was obviously speaking from general recollection, and was not even certain of Colonel Felly’s exact name, but he was quite positive that Colonel Felly had recognised a very extensive Saudi authority. (&amp;) When Jasim and Ahmed-bin-Thani of Qatar had quarrelled (perhaps some forty years ago, but no exact date was mentioned), one of them had appealed to the then Ibn Saud for assistance, and the then Ibn Saud had composed the quarrel. (c) He admitted that in his early days, Ibn Rashid had held Riadh and the Turks, Hasa. Even then Turkish authority did not extend further They had never ruled the Murra, &amp;c., and had at one moment requested him to use his authority over the tribes, whereupon he had sent persons, whom he named, to control them. He denied absolutely the right of the Turks to alienate his ancestral rights. 15. I observed that the King had himself come to an agreement with the Turks, by which he recognised their sovereignty. He did not deny this, but said that what he had done had been done under British advice given by Captain Shakespear, presumably under instructions. [181 c—1] b 2o 16. Towards the end the King expressed his surprise on learning that the Turks had agreed to alienate rights, which were not in their lawful disposal. He denied all knowledge until recently of the Anglo-Turkish conventions. I said that surely the Saudi Government had been aware of the Anglo-Turkish Con vention of 1913, which, if I remembered rightly, was referred to specifically in the Koweit-Nejd Boundary Convention of 1922. Both the King and Sheikh Yussuf were positive that they had no previous knowledge of the con ventions of 1913-14, and made the point that they were not among the treaties communicated to Ibn Saud after the conclusion of the Treaty of Jedda. Sheikh Yussuf recalled a reference to the old Koweit boundary in the Koweit- Nejd Boundary Agreement of 1922, but did not think that the Anglo-Turkish Convention as such was referred to (I subsequently verified my own recollection, which was correct). 17. I did not feel that I could invite the King to make a further com munication to His Majesty’s Government during my absence on leave, as suggested in my instructions, having regard to the fact that the last official note of the Saudi Government remains unanswered, and to the extreme vigour of the King’s personal reaction. I promised to report all that he had said. The audience ended at 5-30 p.m. 18. Shortly after 6 Sheikh Yussuf called on me to break the news that the King wished to give us presents. I am dealing separately with this. 19. We dined with the King at 6 • 30. He was in the best of form before and during dinner; chaffed Mr. Philby over his unwillingness to adopt the Royal suggestion that he should take a wife; expounded his own views as to the excellence of matrimony up to the extreme limits allowed by the holy law; and spoke freely of the way in which he was served by the sons of his former enemies. He laughed at reports in the press that one of the Beni Rashid was raising the Shammer against him, when the person named and others of that family were with his sons at the front. All the sons of Dawish, he said, were also at the front. 20. He started on business again about 7-30. I broached the question of the King’s relations with Koweit, the adjustment of which was strongly desired by His Majesty’s Government with special reference to the desirability of ending the present restriction on trade between Koweit and Nejd. A proposal, I observed, had been made quite a long time ago to seek a basis of settlement, but it had been held up by the question of the claims of the Sheikh of Koweit, a matter which also required settlement. The King expressed eagerness for a settlement of the blockade question on a basis of reciprocity. I asked what he meant; whereupon he developed, not very clearly, various views as to the effect of different prices for commodities in Nejd and Koweit and of smuggling. He said that he could not agree to customs posts on the frontier, as they would cost more than they would produce in the way of revenue, and smuggling would still go on. I suggested that the control exercised by his blockade officer, A1 Bagawi, seemed to be pretty effective, and that A1 Bagawi might be better employed in collecting revenue than in stopping trade. The King was not impressed by this, but, finally, said that he would welcome a meeting of representatives of himself and the sheikh to devise a settlement. He did not revert to the question of the sheikh’s claims. I preferred not to carry the discussion further in view of the sheikh’s attitude since the meeting of commissioners was first proposed. 21. I asked the King generally how he wished our discussion to be followed up. I was not very clear, I said, as to the plans of Fuad Bey Hamza. If Fuad Bey was coming to London and was authorised to express His Majesty’s views; he would have an opportunity of doing so, while I was at home. Alternatively’ the ground might be prepared during my absence for the final handling of the questions on my return from leave. The King said that Fuad Bey was to spend a month m Pciiis cind would bo nblo to spofik for him in London. Ho suggested thnt I should report our discussions at Taif and that any expression of His Majesty’s Government’s views should be conveyed to his Government, whereupon Fuad Bey would be instructed. I pointed out that this would take time and the Kino 1 presently agreed to my counter-suggestion that Fuad Bey should be acquainted with what had passed at Taif, and should be instructed at once as to the line on which he should pursue the discussion in London. 22. At this point I said that, althougn there were other outstanding questions, I did not wish to trouble His Majesty personally with them, and I5 s proceeded to make a suitable little speech of farewell. After hearing it, the King said he had something further to speak about. His Majesty’s Government were worried about restrictions on trade with Koweit. What of restrictions on trade with Nejd ? I asked what he meant and found that he referred to the action taken at Bahrein in regard to direct shipments to the Hasa Coast, and was under the impression that “the Government” had prohibited such shipments. On my asking whether he meant His Majesty’s Government or the Bahrein Government he laughed scornfully at the mention of the latter. I said that I knew of only one incident, in which the Bahrein Government had taken action to prevent an abuse of the facilities afforded by Bahrein, by a ship which had tried to take advantage of these facilities to land cargo at Bahrein and so lighten herself sufficiently to be able to land cargo on the Hasa coast, where the ports were not equipped to receive cargoes in the ordinary way. I observed that the ship had proceeded before the matter could be referred to higher authority, but that His Majesty’s Government had subsequently proposed a discussion of the whole subject of transit, including that of direct shipments to the mainland. The Saudi Govern ment had rejected this proposal, and, on receipt of a further communication from the Legation, had transferred the negotiations to London, with the result that I had not been concerned in them for nearly two years. 23. The King was insistent that no obstacles should be placed in the way of direct shipment to his ports. If it was a question of port equipment, he said, he could complete the equipment in two months, but what would be the good, if ships were prevented from taking cargo to Ras Tanura? And why should that port be treated differently from Debai, Basra or any other port ? He asked for an assurance that, if he did equip Ras Tanura, ships should not be prevented from going there. Indeed, at one moment he asked that they should be told to go there, to which I replied that His Majesty’s Government could not in normal times direct the movements of ships. I pressed him on the subject of the alleged prohibition and at last elicited the admission that he could not substantiate the allegation, though he still evidently thought that an adverse attitude was being taken up. I promised to report what he said, but adhered to my own view that the Saudi Government would have done better to fall in with the proposal of His Majesty’s Government for a general discussion with the object of reconciling the interest of Bahrein and the mainland by an agreement, which could, if necessary, be made operative for a fixed time. • ^ i j p 24. The chief interest of this discussion was the revelation it attorded o± the King’s bitter personal resentment. He threw out references which I did not understand, to other countries like Japan, &amp;c., and their attitude towaids similai problems. He clung to his grievance long after the latest hour at which he told me he could say his prayers. It was well after 9 when I was able to leave him. 25 Shortly before 10, Sheikh Yussuf called again to deliver the Arab clothes, which I had consented to receive. At 4 a.m. next day he was on the spot once more to see me off. I delayed my departure a short time for a final word about the Bahrein question. I said I had been impressed by the King’s anxiety to treat the question of direct shipments as a separate issue. I did not wish His Majesty to think that I had been difficult the previous evening, and assured him that on my return to London I would go into the whole matter. 26 The foregoing account of my conversation at I ait is accurate on ail main points, but is not an exact record of all that passed, e.g., as regards the seauence of the individual discussions. For one thing my interpreter was far from well, and the King tried him very high, by delivering long speeches^ impossible to render in all their details after he had let himself go. I have omitted various non-essentials e.^., the King when ^^^IhakespeT ^ ^ Northern Arabia, referred to conversations with Captain bhakespear m which he had similarly foreshadowed the Great War, and, m professing his friendship for His Majesty’s Governm 7V h t de a od lb o e thers%hTt fl HTs C Mriesty“ as being unaffected by the suggestion of Turks and others that His Maj y Government^wMe^in reality, ^hostde^to^him.^^ the King is genuinely desirous of consolidating Ms position ins-MMs o H^ Maiest^s Government but is extremelv bitter over certain recent. aspects of their policy, notably tne attempt To impose on him the “blue line.” He is almost equally bitter over the Bahrein question, because all that he has grasped of it is the appearance in Ms eyes of aO attempt to boycott his endeavours to develop Ras Tanura and to keephim in a sort of dependence. I gathered from conversations with Mr. Philby on my return journey the next day that the King had sat up rather later than usual with his intimates after my departure, and had spoken at large, in a tone of excited indignation, about those two questions. Mr. Philby, himself rather excited, said that the King had expressed his firm determination not to give way on the “ blue line ” question. He emphasised the unfortunateness of the moment at which the £ £ blue line ’' doctrine had been propounded and begged me to avert a further war. Foreign Office, July 30, 1934.

It is premature to consider at this stage whether a compromise should be offered to Ibn Baud when the substantive negotiations take place and, if so, what form such compromise should take. But a possible basis of compromise would be:- (i) A line going due south from the head of Salwa Bay, or possibly a line going due south from a point on the ^tar protection limit somewhere to the south of Karaana. (ii) ^/venation by Ibn Baud of all claims to interfere in the territories of the Trucial Sheikhs and Muscat; (iii) a bulge eastward from the line suggested in (i) above so as to give Ibn Saua a salient of desert, . the exact limits of which would be governed by thd ! dll extent of hinterland which we thought it expedient y 3 to/ ij 2621 6000 3 34 * i im m ofCONFIDENTIAL -rrgi- — INDIA OFFICE - B. 437 P Z. 5620/1934 Historical Memorandum on the Relations of the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud with Eastern Arabia and the British Government, 1800—1934X ' i Ill &gt;1 INDEX.

India Office. 9 The Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud: their Relations with Eastern Arabia and with the British Government, 1800 to 1934. I he difficulties which have recently arisen in connection with the eastern boundary of the feandi Kingdom, the claims advanced by Ibn Saud to ancestral rights east of the Blue Line laid down in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and the suggestions jmt forward by him that at some period in the past arrange ments were entered into with his ancestors, the Wahabi Amirs, by the representatives of H.M. Government,, which afforded some recognition of those claims, have made it desirable to examine in some detail the history since 1800 of the connection of the Wahabi power with the Trucial Sheikhdoms and their hinterland and with Muscat; the relations between H.M. Government and the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Sand himself; and finally the extent to which either the Wahabi Amirs or Ibn Saud in the pre-war period can properly be regarded as Turkish vassals or have admitted or claimed Ottoman nationality. 2. The period to be covered falls into the following sections :— (1) 1745 to 1800.—First development of the Wahabi sect. (2) 1800 to 187 3. From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Fastern Arabia to the conquest of Hasa by the Turks. (3) 1871 to 1901.—From the Turkish conquest of Hasa to the capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud. (4) 1901 to 1914.—From the capture of Riyadh to the outbreak of the war. (5) 1914 to 1934.—From the outbreak of the war to the opening of the Blue Line discussions. I.—Rise and Development of the Wahabi Power, 1745 to 1800. Origin of the Wahabi Sect. 3. It is unnecessary to examine in detail the sources and early history of the Wahabi movement. The sect appears to have been founded by Abdul Wahab and his son, Mohamed Ibn Abdul Wahab, in the early part of the eighteenth century in Nejd, and to have advocated a return to the primitive simplicity which prevailed among the early followers of Islam in the lifetime of the Prophet. The founders of the sect connected themselves with the Sheikhs of the Saudi family, who then ruled at Deriyah in Nejd ; and the movement, originally religious in character, rapidly assumed a political complexion. The Saudi Sheikhs, with the assistance of the impetus given them by the Wahabi movement, rapidly extended their local influence under the Amir Mohamed, who ruled from 1745 to 1765, at the expense first of the neighbouring rulers of Riyadh and then of the Beni Khaiid, who had, since the middle of the seventeenth century, been the principal tribe in Hasa. 4. The first Wahabi Amir died in 1765 and was succeeded by his son, Abdul Aziz, who ruled till his assassination in 1804. Riyadh was captured in 1772 and the whole of Nejd came under Wahabi rule. The province of Hasa was Lor. 1,1056. subdued for the first time in 1792 and finally in 1795, and the power of the Beni Ross-Nejd, Khaiid broken. Attempts by the Ottoman Government to re-establish its control pp- 38-9. failed, and a truce for six years, under which the Wahabis remained in possession Lor. 1,1059. of Hasa, was concluded in 1799. The Political Situation in Arabia in 1800. 5. With the conquest of Hasa the Saudis commenced to turn their attention to the east and south. The occasion is a convenient one briefly to review the political situation in Arabia in the year 1800. It was as follows 6. Turkey held Iraq; exercised what appears to have been a controlling influence in Koweit, and maintained a claim to iiasa and its ports. The Hejaz was also held by a Turkish vassal, the Sherif of Mecca. 3076 3,20 9.34 ALor. I, 1789- 90. Lor. I, 421. Lor. I, 429. Lor. I, 842. Bombay Selections XXIV, 303, 429. Lor. I, 1067. 7. The Wahabi Amirs held Hasa and Nejd. 8. Bahrein was in the possession of the Uttabi Sheikhs, who, originally settled on the mainland of Arabia at Zubarah in Qatar, had expelled the Persians frorck Bahrein in 1783. The Bahreini Sheikhs, apprehensive of attack by Muscat, had in 1799 made overtures to Persia and paid her tribute. In 1800 they were temporarily subdued by Muscat. 9. Qatar .—The Uttabi Sheikhs of Bahrein had hereditary possessions in Qatar, and took refuge there on their expulsion from the islands by Muscat in 1800. 10. The present-day Tracial Coast, then known as the Pirate Coast, was ruled by Arab Sheikhs, the ancestors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. Of these Sheikhs, only two were of real importance, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the rival Jowasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, whose capital was later removed to Shargah. These rulers were separated by a secular enmity, and belonged to the opposing religious factions of the Hinawi and the Ghafari. The fact that the Rulers of Muscat also belonged to the Hinawi faction formed a link between Muscat and Abu Dhabi. The Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast held a fringe of varying depth along the coast, but do not appear to have exercised any real influence in the remoter hinterland, which was in the possession of Bedouin tribes. IP At the eastern end of Arabia was the independent Sultanate of Muscat, at this time ruled by the able and vigorous Saiyid Sultan, who succeeded in 1792, and who had in 1794 extorted a lease of Bunder Abbas and its dependencies from Persia. The Sultan had in 1798 entered into an alliance with the British Govern ment and had in 1800 agreed to receive a British Political Representative. In the same year he succeeded in establishing his dominion over Bahrein. 12. The British Government, represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were closely associated with Gulf affairs for commercial reasons, but their policy in 1800 and until late in the nineteenth century was essentially to restrict their activities on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf to the minimum necessary to secure the security of the seas and freedom for British and Indian commerce. They were consistently extremely reluctant to involve themselves in any way in the affairs of the hinterland, save to the extent necessary to secure these objects. As will be seen from the statement which follows, they were anxious in these circumstances to observe strict neutrality towards the Wahabis and to abstain from involving themselves in difficulties with this new and considerable mainland Power. II.—1800-1871. From the first expansion of the Wahabis in Eastern Arabia to the Conquest of Hasa by the Turks. 1800 to the Death of Amir Abdul Aziz in 1804. First Wahabi Encroachment in Eastern Arabia. 13. In 1800 the Wahabis for the first time turned their attention to Eastern Arabia.. In that year.a Wahabi expedition invaded Oman and occupied the oasis of Baraimi a strategic point of the first importance commanding the approaches to Muscat. In 1801 the Sultan of Muscat was forced by the Uttabi Sheikhs to abandon Bahrein. In 1802 a fresh attack was repulsed with Wahabi assistance, out thereafter with brief intervals Bahrein remained under Wahabi influence till 181s, and. tendered tribute to the Wahabis in 1803, and afforded naval assistance to tnem against Muscat in 1805. By 1802 the whole coast from Basra to the boundary between Muscat and Shargah at Diba had been reduced to nominal submission, and m 1803 the Sultan of Muscat was forced to conclude a truce with the Wahabis, under which Muscat agreed to pay zakat to them, and to allow a Wahabi representative to reside at Muscat. The Wahabis in Western Arabia, 1800-1804. IP In U estern Arabia in the meantime the Wahabis had captured and destroyed ^ er 3e J a &gt; and had in 1802 decisively defeated a punitive expedition sent against i qao 1 ^ ie P ur ^ s ‘ JPeh control of Hasa and Nejd was now complete. During 180o they overran the Hejaz and completed the conquest of the Turkish districts on the Red Sea littoral I he Wahabi Amir was murdered at the end of 1803 and v as succeeded by his son, Saud bin Abdul Aziz, who ruled till 1814.3 1804-1818. ^ Reign oe the Amirs Saud Ibn Abdul Aziz (1804-1814) and Abdulla Bin Saud * (1814-1818). 15. Between 1804 and 1814 the Wahabis consolidated their influence in Trucial Oman, deliveied repeated attacks on tne Sultan of Muscat, and for the first time came into contact with the British Government. Between 1814 and 1818 they succumbed to the attacks of the Egyptians and their power temporarily ended. It will be most convenient to deal with their relations with the various sections of the Arab littoral seriatim. Muscat and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 16. Saiyid Sultan died in 1804, and the Wahabis took an active share in the disputes which followed about the succession. Saiyid Badr, to whom they lent their support, was finally elected Sultan in 1805. The new Sultan, who iu Lor j 1076 1806 co-operated with the British expedition against the Jowasimi pirates, ruled the Sultanate till his assassination by Said bin Sultan m 1807. Said bin Sultan, who was to rule till 1856, was hostile to Wahabi influence, although he continued r . t -1075 to allow a Wahabi Political Agent to reside at Muscat, and in 1809 he conducted 442 . ' 5 an abortive expedition against the new Wahabi Sheikh of the Jowasimis. In the same year the Wahabis delivered a successful attack upon the Sultan from Baraimi, and the punitive expedition sent in 1809 by the Government of India against the Jowasimi pirates had as an incidental object the easing of the pressure on the Sultan. In 1810—11, on the withdrawal of the British expedition, further successful attacks were made from Baraimi by Syed bin Mutlak, the Wahabi lieutenant there, in face of which the Sultan appealed, but unsuccessfully, to the Government of India for assistance. These attacks in 1812-13 penetrated to the south-east of Muscat at Sur and Jaalan; and in the latter place the Beni bu Ali tribe were permanently converted to Wahabism. In 1811 Bahrein was freed from Wahabi rule by the Sultan of Muscat, who inflicted a severe defeat on the Wahabis in Qatar, in 1812. In 1813 the Sultan endeavoured to co-operate with the Lor. 1, 445. Egyptians, who were now massing for their attack upon Nejd. A Wahabi attack from Baraimi again, however, led to his temporary submission and to the payment of a large fine. The increasing pressure of the Egyptians on the Wahabis appears now to have led to a diminution of Wahabi activity in eastern Arabia ; with the death of the Amir Saud in 1814 all further danger ceased by land, and from that date to the fall of the Wahabi power in 1818 little is heard of them, in connection with Muscat, although in 1816 the Wahabis assisted the Sheikh of Bahrein to repel an attempt by the Sultan to re-establish his control over Bahrein. Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 17. During most of the period from 1800 to 1814 the Wahabis appear to have held a dominating position in Trucial Oman and its hinterland. Their Agent established himself in 1800 in the oasis of Baraimi, which he fortified and used as a base for attacks on Muscat or for bringing pressure on the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1803 the Jowasimi of Ras-al-Khaimah were compelled to co-operate in a Wahabi attack on Muscat; but in 1806 a British punitive expedition sent against the Lor. 1,1057, Jowasimis ignored the Wahabi connection with them, and a convention concluded 1074. with the Jowasimis in that year was concluded without reference to the Wahabi Amir and without protest from him. In 1808 Sultan bin Suggar, the hereditary chief of the Jowasimi Arabs at Ras-al-Khaimah, was deposed by the Wahabis, and in the following year a Wahabi nominee, the Sheikh of Rams, was substituted for him. The fallen Jowasimi chief was subsequently lured to Nejd and there imprisoned, but he escaped and returned through the Yemen to Muscat bearing overtures to the Sultan from the Pasha of Egypt for co-operation against the Wahabis. In Lor. 1, 1073, 1809 the Jowasimi responded to a Wahabi request for co-operation against Koweit, 445 - though nothing seems to have come of this. 18. Piracy broke out in an aggravated form after the deposition of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Eas-al-Khaimah and a further British expedition, with which Muscat co-operated, was sent in 1809-10 which reduced the pirates to submission. The Wahabi Agent at Baraimi is alleged to have proceeded to the assistance of Ras-al-Khaimah ; but, if he did so, he did not arrive until after the departure of the4 ♦ Lor. I, 1076. punitive expedition. Shiras, which was held by a Wahabi Governor, was also forced to surrender. The Government of India, anxious to avoid involving them selves in any way with the Wahabis, turned a blind eye so far as possible to Wahabi ^ responsibility (as to the degree of which there is room for difference of opinion) for the activities of the pirates and gave stringent instructions to the Political Resident to avoid involving himself in any way with the Wahabi power. 19. The Wahabi Lieutenant in Baraimi, Syed bin Mutlak, proceeded to Nejd in 1813, w r hereupon his successor, Ibn Azdakah, was murdered by the Beni Yas of Dhafrah. On Syed bin Mutlak’s return later in the same year, he was himself Lor 1 650-1 killed in action against the Hajrigin of Oman, and was succeeded by Ibn Mazru. In 1813, and again in 1814, the Beni Yas Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who appears to have been more independent of Wahabi influence than the Jowasimis, on two occasions combined with Muscat against the Wahabis. Bahrein and the Wahabi*, 1804-1818. Lor, 1,842-3 Lor. I, 1007-8. 20. The Wahabis assisted the Sheikhs to regain possession of Bahrein from Muscat in 1801, but the islands thereupon came under the influence of the Wahabi Amir, to whom they offered tribute in 1803, and with whom they co-operated in that year against Muscat. The Government of Bombay in 1805 gave no encourage ment to suggestions from the Sheikhs for material assistance to enable Bahrein to withhold her support from the Wahabis, under whose control they remained until 1811, when, with the assistance of Muscat, they again regained their independence. The Sultan of Muscat subsequently claimed that Bahrein had- then accepted a liability to pay tribute to him, and in 1816 he made an attack upon the islands which, thanks to the assistance of the Wahabis, with whom and with the Jowasimis the Sheikhs now again allied themselves, was, however, unsuccessful. Koioeit and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 21 . In 1803 Koweit, like the rest of the coast, was under Wahabi control, and in that year it assisted the Wahabi Amir in an expedition against Muscat. In 1805 the Sheikh described himself as subject to the Wahabis. But by 1808 Koweit was strong enough to decline to respond to a further appeal for assistance ; a Wahabi attack was driven off in 1809, and the Sheikh of Koweit appears thenceforward to have remained relatively free of Wahabi influence. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1804-1818. 22 . Wahabism was dominant in Qatar between 1809-11, but the Wahabis were expelled by Muscat in the latter year and the authority of Bahrein re-established. In 1816, however, Sheikh Rahmah bin Jabir sided with Muscat against the Wahabis and the Sheikh of Bahrein. Turkey and the Wahabis, 1804 to the Destruction of the Wahabi Power in 1818. 23. In 1804 Mehemet All was appointed Viceroy of Egypt, chiefly in order that he might recover the Ilejaz for lurkey. From 1804 to 1810 he concerted his plans for achieving this object. Between 1810 and 1815 he reconquered the Hejaz and drove the Wahabi Amirs back into Nejd. In 1815 his lieutenants advanced mto Qasim, and later in the year the Wahabis were severely defeated, submitted to 1 usun Pasha, and sent hostages to Egypt. But the Egyptian Viceroy refused to iatify the undeistanding leached, and was content with nothing less than the complete suejection of the Wahabi Amirs. x\n offer to accept an Egyptian Governor of Nejd and pay tribute was rejected ; Deriyah was invested, reduced and destroyed m Septembei 1818 5 and the Wahabi Amir was taken prisoner, sent to Cairo, and executed at Constantinople. His four brothers were sent to Cairo as prisoners. The W ahabi power was, for the time being, completely destroyed, and lurkisn v or rathei Egyptian) control re-established over Nejd, Hasa and the Hasa coastal area in the Persian Gulf.Wahabi Relations with H.M Government, 1800-1818. , 24. The first relations of H M. Government (as represented by the Government bf India and the Government of Bombay) with the Wahabi Amirs date from 1805. The Wahabis had reached the sea coast with the conquest of Hasa in 1795, and had subsequently extended their control along the Trucial Coast between 1800 and 1803. The piratical activities of the Trucial Sheikhs (responsibility for which was in some quarters ascribed to the Wahabis) led in 1806 to a British punitive expedition against them. The expedition subdued the Jowasimis and concluded a treaty with their chief. Despite the fact that the Wahabis were suspected of being the moving force behind the activities of the Jowasimis, the instructions given to the Resident were to refrain from proceedings which might be displeasing to the Wahabi Amir. But it is noteworthy that the treaty concluded with the Jowasimis in 1806 was concluded with them as independent Sheikhs and without reference to, or the interference of, the Amir. Punitive Expedition of 1809-1810. 25. Further outbreaks of piracy, both before and after the removal of the Jowasimi chief by the Wahabis and the substitution of a Wahabi vicegerent, led to a combined expedition against the Jowasimis by Great Britain and Muscat in 1808-10. The expedition succeeded in its objects, but it was conducted with a degree of caution and forbearance towards the Wahabis, probably now, as § 23. previously, the real motive force behind the pirates, which rendered its results of little permanent value. The instructions given to the Resident were that he should “ be careful to make it in due time fully known to the Wahabi and all the officers of his Government that it was our sincere wish to continue at all times on terms of friendship with him and the other States of Arabia, desiring only to provide for the security of the general commerce of the seas, and of the Gulf of Persia in particular, so long and so unjustifiably interrupted by the Jowasimis, in breach also of a positive treaty concluded with their Chief in 1806. . . . The just support of our ally, the Imam of Muscat, cannot reasonably give offence to any other State or Government.” Correspondence with the Wahabi Amir, 1810. 26. The Wahabi Amir having in 1810 entered into correspondence with the Political Resident at Bushire, in regard to the punitive operations which had been undertaken against the Jowasimis, in wdiich he expressed his desire to maintain Nejd relations of amity and concord with H.M. Government, the Government of Bombay, § 25 addressed him in the following terms (letter from the Honourable Mr, Duncan dated 9th August 1810):—“ The British Government receives with satisfaction the expression of your desire to maintain with it the relations of amity and concord — a desire in which it cordially participates and has uniformly manifested. It is there fore proper that I should assure you that the late expedition to the Persian Gulf did not originate in hostility towards you, but was, as above noticed, directed solely to the destruction of the pirates who had, in direct breach of their own positive engagements and with an entire forgetfulness of the former instances of condescending lenity manifested towards them, long infested the seas in that quarter, plundering vessels and murdering subjects of all nations indiscriminately, for the British Government does not concern itself with the hostilities carried on by you against the members of the Mussulman faith, on account ^of their alleged deviation from the ordinances of the Koran, and its power will aione be directed against those who, exercising the detestable profession ol piracy, are. the common enemies of all nations. The channel of communication between us being now open, I request you will continue to afford me the pleasure of hearing of your prosperity and success.” 27. In 1810, and again in 1811, on the Sultan of Muscat appealing for assistance against the Wahabis and representing that his recent co-operation with the Bntjsh Government held, involved hiin in perpetu&amp;l cino impl&amp;c&amp;hle wai with them, m whic he trusted that the British Government would not remain neutial, tne Government of India replied that the British Government had always considered itself to be at peace with the Wahabis, their late Co-operation with the Sultan not having been m prosecution of war against the Wahabis generally, but meiely foi the extnpation ofOH Lor.

In the course of 1813, on a Wahabi envoy to Muscat announcing his arrival at that place to the Government of Bombay with the object of restoring “the relations of amity between the two powers,” the Governor of Bombay wrote in reply : “ Entertaining, as I have always done, the most friendly disposition towards your master, I conceived it my duty even previously to the receipt of your letter to instruct Mr. Bruce, the British Resident at Bushire, to communicate with His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and to establish such an amicable intercourse with him as cannot fail to be equally advantageous to both countries as well as for the general benefit of their respective neighbours, and it is with feelings of particular satisfaction I observe Your Excellency has stated that a corresponding desire is sincerely entertained by His Highness Saud bin Abdul Aziz, and I shall therefore look forward with confidence to the speedy attainment of our reciprocal wishes.” Wahabi Overtures, 1813-1814. 29. The Wahabi Amir had in 1810, in reply to British representations, intimated that he had interdicted his followers from molesting British vessels. Late in 1813, threatened by the advance of the Egyptians, he made overtures to the Political Resident indicating his desire to form a connection with the British Government of mutual amity and friendship which might be beneficial to both States and, acknowledging the superiority of the British over every other nation at sea, proposed that the ports of each State should be open to each other and a free and unmolested trade carried on by their subjects. 30. The Government of India, however, while considering it politic to maintain a friendly intercourse with the Wahabi Chief and to endeavour by cordial and conciliatory conduct to conform to the amicable disposition which he appeared to entertain towards the British Government, thought it undesirable at this moment to enter into any regular engagement with him, even of a commercial character. British Proposal for Anglo-JEyptian Go-operation against Jowasimis rejected by Egyptians, 1819. 31. .In 1819, on hearing of the successes of the Viceroy of Egypt against the Wahabis and of the arrival of the Egyptian expedition on the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the Government of India endeavoured to arrange with Ibrahim Pasha, with which Muscat should be associated, for joint operations against the Jowasimis, on the understanding that in return Ras al Khaima would be made over to the The British officer (Captain Sadleir) deputed for this purpose arrived only after the subjugation of the Wahabis and the withdrawal of the Egyptians. Mehemet Ah ultimately, however, replied that neither he nor the Porte desired or needed foreign help in dealing with the Wahabis of Nejd. 32. The Chief Secretary, Bombay, writing in 1820, recorded that a letter has lately been received from Hussein bin Rahmah [formerly Wahabi vicegerent in Irucial Oman and Chief of Ras al Khaimah] referring to a treaty of peace concluded between, his. Imaum and us, and professing a desire of continuing on terms of friendship with the English Government, which has of course been positively declined. r J General Summary, 1804-1818. 33. The Wahabis in the early part of this period consolidated their position in qu -i f^ aZ ’ Nejd and Trucial Oman. In the latter area their control of the Sheikhs, exercised from the oasis of Baraimi, appears to have varied with the enective force at their disposal ; but to have been particularly close in the caseof the Jowasimis, and less so in that of Abu Dhabi. Up to 1814 they bore heavily on the Sultan of Muscat, who, however, retained his independence, although he f paid through much of the period a tribute to the Wahabi Amir. Relations with the British Government, as represented by the Government of India and the Government of Bombay, were polite and even friendly ; but the Indian authorities, while avoiding any cause of quarrel with the Wahabis and closing their eyes to the responsibility of the Wahabis for the piracies of the Jowasimis, declined also to involve themselves in any engagements with the Amirs. Between 1814 and 1818 the power of the Wahabis, who lost the Hejaz between 1810 and 1815, was completely destroyed by the Egyptian forces of Mehemet Ali, and, save to the extent that it survived as a purely religious movement, Wahabism temporarily entirely disappeared. 1818-1824. From the Egyptian Conquest of the Wahabis to the Rise of Amir Turki. 34. In 1819-20 the Government of India effectively subdued the pirates of the Trucial Coast, destroyed their forts, and burnt their warships. The Sheikhs in May 1820 entered into a general treaty with H.M. Government to preserve the maritime peace, H.M. Government on their side undertaking certain reciprocal obligations of protection hj sea. The treaties were concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent rulers. In November 1820 H.M. Government took steps to subdue the Beni bu Ali of Jaalan in Muscat, who had been converted to Wahabism by the Wahabi expedition of 1813. Situation in Trucial Oman in 1822-1823. 35. In 1822, Abu Dhabi, now in control also of Dibai, is stated to have been the firm ally of Muscat. The Jowasimi Sheikhdom of Shargah was peopled by strict Mohammedans, partly Sunni, partly Wahabi ; Umm al Qaiwain was strictly Wahabi, Bo g e i as was for the most part the Sheikhdom of Ajman. In 1823 the Jowasimi Sheikha XXIV, 315, -(as distinct from the Beni Yas of Abu Dhabi and Dibai) all appear to have 541 -3. acknowledged the general authority of Shargah. While, however, “ in 1823 a large proportion of the people were still Wahabi in sympathy ... of the secular Lor.

In 1823 a Native Agent of the British Residency at Bush ire was appointed at Shargah. The post has been maintained since that date. 1824-1840. From the Revival of the Wahabi Power to its Second Overthrow by Egypt. Sheikh Turki bin Abdulla, 1824-1834. Sheikh Faisal bin Turki (first reign), 1834-1838. 37. In 1824 Sheikh Tnrki bin Abdulla collected a force and marched against the Egyptians. At first defeated, he was subsequently successful. Between 1824 Bo. Set. and 1830 he endeavoured to re-establish the Wahabi power. In 1830 he completely defeated the Beni Khalid and reconquered Hasa; in the following year Bahrein or ' ’ and Muscat both temporarily became tributary to him ; and by 1833 he had fully re-established Wahabi influence on the Trucial Coast and in its hinterland and had reoccupied Baraimi. In the same year, however, Bahrein repudiated the agreement of 1831 and maintained itself against the Amir, whose coast it blockaded, until 1836, when peace was made. It is recorded in 1830 that, while pretending to be Bo. Sel. free and independent, “ Turki had agreed, and continued, to pay a small annual XXIV, 439. tribute to Mehemet Ali Pasha, who approved of his proceedings which he took care to represent in a favourable light.”Lor.

He was succeeded by his son, Feisal bin Turki. In 1837 Mehemet Ali sent an expedition into Nejd to reduce the Wahabi Amir and replace him by the pretender Khalid. After two years of fighting, the Egyptians accomplished their object in 1839. The Wahabi Amir Feisul who had' succeeded his father, Turki, on the latter’s murder in 1834, surrendered in, 1838, and was sent a prisoner to Egypt. In 1840 the Egyptians again withdrew from Hasa, leaving the puppet Amir Khalid as its tributary Governor. 39. The principal events in the relations between the Wahabi Amirs and H.M. Government and the rulers of Eastern Arabia during this period are described below. Wahabi Relations with Muscat, 1824-1840. 40. Between 1824 and 1830 the Sultan of Muscat was principally busied with unsuccessful endeavours to reduce the Sheikhs of Bahrein. In 1829 he suffered a severe defeat at the hands of the Bahreinis and made peace with them. In 1831, in the hope of forwarding his designs in Bahrein, he sent an embassy with presents to the Wahabi Amir. 41. In 1833 the Sultan, with the encouragement of the Government of India, made a general agreement with the Wahabis, by which he undertook to pay a zakat of 5,000 dollars a year. A condition of the agreement was that each should hold possession of his coast according to the limits then existing ; the Muscat coast extending to Jaalan, and the coast of the Amir to Qatif. Reciprocal assistance was also promised in putting down rebellion. There is nothing to show for how long the tribute continued to be paid. 42. No other events of importance affecting Muscat took place until 1839. In face of the Egyptian invasion and the threat which is constituted to Eastern Arabia, the Sultan of Muscat, with a view to promoting his designs in Bahrein, which he had never abandoned, was at first disposed to co-operate with the Egyptians, but on becoming aware of the hostility to Egyptian advance of the British Government, he associated himself with their views and refused a demand for assistance made upon him by the Egyptian Commander in Nejd. Wahabi Relations with Trucial Oman, 1824—1840. Wahabi Overtures, 1824. 43. Immediately on the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824, the Wahabi Amir opened correspondence with all the Sheikhs of the coast, inviting them to renew the relations which had existed prior to the overthrow of the Wahabis by Ibrahim Pasha. The Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah appears forthwith to have opened negotiations with the Wahabis. “This measure he did not attempt to conceal, but assigned self-preservation as his only motive for adopting it.” Matters do not, however, appear to have proceeded far, and in November 1825 the Sheikh enquired of the Political Resident whether Great Britain would help him to maintain his independence against the Wahabis. He was informed in reply (see paragraph 52 below) that he was the best judge of his own interests, but that no connection or authority would be accepted in excuse of predatory proceedings, while action against Muscat would be considered unfriendly by H.M. Government. Disputes over Baraimi, 1824-1826. 44. It may be recorded that in 1824-25 considerable difficulties arose locally between the Sultan of Muscat, the Sheikh of Shargah and the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, over the occupation of the towers of Baraimi, which had apparently been re-occupied by the Trucial Sheikhs on or shortly after the downfall of the Wahabis in 1818. By a solemn treaty the towers in question had previously been declared neutral, and on their occupation by Shargah the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, whether in concert with or independently of the Sultan of Muscat is not clear, had taken up the inattei. In December 1824 a reconciliation was negotiated by the Resident, under which the Sheikh of Shargah was to destroy the towers, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi on his side destroying a fort which had been built at Derah. In February 1825 the Resident addressed a strong remonstrance to the Sheikh of Shargah for his delaysin destroying the fortress and received an evasive answer. In May 1825 the Resident sent his Native Agent, armed with authority from the Sheikh to effect the immediate destruction of the towers, to accompany a Muscat force. Hostilities, however, broke out between Shargah and Muscat, and the towers remained. In October 1825 a reconciliation was finally mediated between the two States by the Resident, m which no word was said about Baraimi, which appears to have remained in the possession of one or other of the Trucial Chiefs until about 1833. Wdhobi reascendency established. 45. In May 1830, consequent on the defeat of the Beni Khalid of Hasa, the Wahabi Amir and his policy became a matter of acute importance in Trucial Oman. The bulk of the Jowasimis, and especially the Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, appear to have welcomed the prospect of Wahabi reascendency, “ the lower orders anticipating a return to their former piratical habits and the above two chiefs expecting to emancipate themselves from their dependence upon ” the Sheikh of Shargah. The Sheikh of Shargah, who had in 1821 abjured Wahabi tenets, now, while outwardly professing sympathy with the Wahabis, wrote to the Resident in July 1830, “expressing his earnest desire to co-operate with the British Government in checking their further progress and went so far as to declare that he was determined to oppose them even in the event of his not receiviug any support.” In reply he was informed that the British Government were solely interested in the suppression of piracy and could not interfere in the internal affairs of the Arab States. But the Wahabi Amir soon made it clear that he was not prepared to encourage any revival of piracy, and that he proposed to look upon the Sheikh of Shargah and the Sultan of Muscat as the heads of all the Arabian tribes in Oman. The Sheikh of Ajman, who had asked for a body of troops to enable him to throw off his dependence on Shargah, or even to attain the ascendancy in Shargah territories, and who had also suggested that he should cruise against the enemies of the Wahabis in the Gulf, met wdth a refusal on the ground inter alia that the English being the masters of the sea, the Wahabi Amir was not able to contend with so powerful a nation. In 1831 the Sheikh of Ajman was, however, used by the Amir as his intermediary with the Governor of Bombay. Wahabi Claim to Suzerainty over Trucial Oman, 1833. 46. By 1833 the Wahabi ruler had established his influence throughout the Trucial Coast, and in that year a direct demand by the Resident on the Sheikh of Shargah for redress for a piracy led to an intemperate letter from the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi to the Residency Agent at Shargah. As the Wahabi representative had written without authority no direct notice was taken of his communication, but the Residency Agent was instructed to point out the long delays and great forbearance shown before coercive measures had been resorted to by H.M. Government, “and further to use other arguments importing the evident existence of our right to demand redress.” The Wahabi representative replied that Amir Turki “ was now the only authority on the continent of Arabia, and that both citizens and Bedouins, maritime as well as inland tribes, having all acknowledged his supremacy, he was in fact the ruler of the country, including Hajar, Oman, and the coast from Jaalan to Qatif, and that, therefore, on the occurrence of any piracy it should be reported to the Wahabi Chief, or, in the event of his being at too great a distance, to his Agent at Baraimi.” Abu Dhabi submits to the Wahabis, 1833. 47. Later in the same year the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi was murdered by his brother, who, anxious to consolidate his position, tendered his allegiance and an annual payment of tribute to the Wahabi Amir. The Amir in return informed Shargah that Abu Dhabi was under his protection and that he would permit of no aggression upon them. Despite this, and the very categorical assertion of suzerainty referred to in paragraph 46 above, the threats of the Wahabi representative at Baraimi proved insufficient to overawe Shargah, and in 1834 peace was concluded between Shargah and Abu Dhabi, one condition of which was that Debai should henceforth be under Shargah. 3076 Bo.

The Wahabis about this time were still blockaded by the Sheikh of Bahrein and called in the assistance of Shargah against the Sheikhs of that island. On the murder in 1834 of Amir Turki this question, however, dropped, and the effect of the murder is stated to have introduced such confusion and discord into Wahabi affairs “as to counteract the operation of any ambitious views of late entertained by the murdered chief and for a time, at least, to leave the maritime tribes in the same relative position as before.” In 1836 the preponderating influence of Mehemet Ali in the west began to afford a salutary check on Wahabi encroachments towards the coast of the Persian Gulf. In that year the Wahabi agent at Baraimi failed to secure the maritime assistance of Muscat and the coastal tribes against Bahrein, and by 1838 the Wahabis had lost Baraimi to the local tribe of the Beni Naim, though in what circumstances is not clear. Bahrein and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 49. In 1830-31 Bahrein, apprehensive of a coalition between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat, who had made overtures to the Wahabis with a view to securing Wahabi support in the reduction of Bahrein, formally submitted to the Wahabi Amir, acknowledged his supremacy and undertook to pay tribute. By 1833, however, the Sheikhs of Bahrein felt sufficiently strong to defy the Amir and between 1834 and 1836 they blockaded the coast of Hasa and caused sufficient inconvenience to the Wahabis to lead the latter to call in the assistance (which was not, in fact, accorded) of the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah. In 1836, however, alarmed by indications of an active assertion of the Persian claim and by the possibility of a coalition between Muscat and Persia, Bahrein reached a friendly agreement with the Amir, under which the Sheikh was to pay a nominal tribute of 2,000 dollars, while the Amir undertook to supply troops for the defence of Bahrein against external attacks, and to refrain from calling on the Sheikh for marine transport in the event of a Wahabi attack on Muscat by sea. In 1839 the Wahabi Lor. I, 1098. general, Umr bin Ufeysan, took refuge at Bahrein on the fall of the Amir Feisul. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1824—1840. 60. Little of moment happened in Qatar between 1824 and 1840. During much of this period the authority of the Sheikh of Bahrein was paramount. In 1835 Lor I 857. the people of Huwailah rebelled against Bahrein and entered into correspondence with the Wahabis. A settlement was, however, reached by the mediation of the son of the Sultan of Muscat. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1824-1840. 51. The solidarity of the Uttabi rulers of Koweit with those of Bahrein and Qatar was apparently maintained throughout this period. Koweit continued to resist, on the whole successfully, and latterly under the protection of the Turks, the efforts of the Wahabi Amirs to incorporate it with their dominions. During the Egyptian occupation of Hasa in 1838-40 an Egyptian agent was appointed to Koweit and appears to have remained there during the period of Egyptian ascendancy. H.M. Government and the Wahabis, 1824-1839. 52. In 1825 on the revival of the Wahabi power in Nejd, the Jowasimi Sheikh of Shargah enquired whether he might look to the British Government for assistance should he endeavour to maintain his independence against Wahabi intrigue. He was informed in reply that he was the best judge of his own interests, “ but that no action or authority would be received by the British Government as an excuse for any proceedings bearing a predatory character.” He was further- warned against co-operating with the Wahabis against the territories of Muscat. Nejd Precis, “ The language held on this occasion was confirmed by the Governor [of Bombay] in § Council, with a further intimation that, however improbable it might be that we should act against the Wahabis so long as they confined their conquests to the- shoie, it was still not desirable that we should bind ourselves to abstain from interposition or hold out so great an encouragement to the invasion of the Imam’s, territories as our avowed indifference would be likely to afford.”11 Wahabi Overtures, 1831. 4 cru .^ 0U ^ ^. e °f 1831 the W ahabi Amir, through the intermediacy of Precis, § 37. the Sheikh of Ajman, wrote to the Government of Bombay expressing his desire to be upon the same intimate footing as that formerly existing between the British Government and his ancestor, Saud, and t£ to have the treaty renewed which was made between you, the British and Imam Saud.” 54. Search among the records of the Government of Bombay with reference to the alleged treaty showed that two documents only could be found bearing on British intercourse with the Wahabis, viz. those quoted in paragraphs 26 and 28 Lor I ’ 1096 - above. The Government of Bombay, in reply to the Amir, wrote as follows Your communication dated 25th Jumadyooluwul, informing me that by the appointment of the Ruler of Events you had arrived at the dignity of Chief of the Wahabi sect, has reached my hands, and given me the gratification which friends feel when they receive intelligence from friends. “ Your disposition to a friendly understanding is met with reciprocal feeling, and the terms of amity which existed between this Government and your great ancestor, Imam Saud, will still remain in force, and, I cherish hopes, will never be broken or infringed. I send this letter by the hands of your faithful dependent Isa bin Hassan to express the same.” Mr. Lorimer remarks that the relative ignorance existing in Bombay at this Lor. 1,1096. time of the position in Central Arabia is evidenced by the use of the phrase “ ancestor ” of the Imam Saud, who belonged to the same generation as the then Amir, and had died only in 1814. British Attitude, 1833-1840. 55. The question of the attitude to be adopted in the event of the Wahabi Amir absorbing Muscat was considered by the Government of India and the Government G of T to of Bombay in 1833-34. The Government of India intimated that they were not Bo., 1.2.34. prepared to send an expedition to maintain the continental possessions of Muscat and instructed the British authorities in the Gulf “ to observe a strict neutrality in any disputes that may arise between him [the Sultan of Muscat] and any of his neighbours on the continent of Arabia.” 1837-1839. 56. On the second Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1837 to 1839, the Government of India (see paragraphs 59-62 below), moved by considerations of European Nejd Precis, policy, spared no efforts to counteract the progress of the Egyptians and to persuade § 445. the Trucial Chiefs and the Beni Naim of Baraimi to co-operate against them. 1839-1840. Fall of the Wahabi Amir. The Egyptians and Eastern Arabia. 57. The Amir Feisul surrendered and was sent to Egypt as a prisoner in December 1838, and by the beginning of 1839 the Egyptians were in complete control of Nejd and Hasa. Hitherto they had supported a puppet Amir of the AYahabi family, the Amir Khalid. They now threw off the pretence of supporting Khalid, and declared that Nejd was a possession of Mehemet Ali, and that he would improve and extend his conquests. Khalid thereupon called upon the Sheikhs of Bahrein for payment of tribute, and advances were made by the Egyptians towards Eastern Arabia. Egyptian Overtures to Muscat and Trucial Oman, 1839. 58. For this purpose they employed Syed bin Mutlak, who, during the lifetime Bo. Sel. of the Amir Turki, had been the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, but who had XXIY, 156, been removed by his son, Feisul, and who possessed great personal influence among the Arab tribes “ as well as a perfect knowledge of their various and conflicting 7 q 2 _ 6 ] interests.” Syed was despatched by the Egyptians to Ras-al-Khaimah to persuade Lor. 1, the chiefs of the Oman coast to acknowledge the authority of the puppet Amir 1100-3.gWWWMU 12 Khalid. A letter addressed by him to the Sultan of Muscat, directing Muscat to assist or be considered an enemy, was returned, but the Jowasimi Chief of Shargah, at his instigation, summoned the Beni Naim, “who had lately got possession ofi* Baraimi,” to surrender it to the Nejdis. The Beni Naim refused and appealed to Abu Dhabi and the Chief of Sohar for aid against the common enemy. Represen tations were also made to the Political Resident. British Countermeasures and Support for Beni Naim of Baraimi. 59. H.M. Government were at this time principally concerned to reduce Mehemet Ali to his proper position as a Turkish vassal and to prevent any further Egyptian advance in Eastern Arabia. The application of the Beni Naim Chiefs was therefore well received ; the Resident held out hopes that a British agent would be sent to Baraimi (Captain Hamerton subsequently visited the oasis in January-February of 1840); and he undertook, if necessary, to supply ammunition to the Chiefs. The Lor. I, 457. Sultan of Muscat, who had at first shown a disposition to take the side of the the hope of re-establishing his ascendancy over Bahrein, was informed of the attitude of H.M. Government, and was called upon to support the Beni Naim chiefs, a request to which he acceded. The Resident, after a formal protest against the proceedings and intrigues of the Egyptian Commander as being in direct opposition to the assurances which had been given by Mehemet Ali to H.M. Govern ment, obtained a written agreement from the maritime chiefs of Oman to cultivate close relations with the British Government, to abide by its wishes and instructions, and to resist to the last extremity all attempts by the Egyptian Commander to subdue them. Withdrawal of Egyptian Agent under British pressure^ 6R The Sheikh of Shargah, at his own request, was furnished with a document requiring him to demand the immediate departure of the Egyptian Agent. This was communicated to the Agent, who was also informed that, the British Govern ment having taken the chiefs and tribes of Naim in Baraimi under their protection he would be held responsible for any injury to them ; and he was required, in accordance with the assurances given by Mehemet Ali, to withdraw from Trucial Oman. After repeated remonstrances he quitted the Trucial Coast and, embarkincr at Shargah (where he is alleged to have been assured by the Sheikh that if he returned to Oman in force Shargah would join him and place all its resources at his disposal), proceeded to Ojair. The withdrawal of Syed Bin Mutlak was a severe blow to Egyptian influence and is stated to have broken up the combination rapidly forming in favour of Mehemet Ali. The Government of India approved tue action taken by the Resident, but intimated to him that they would not be prepared to extend protection to Baraimi. Egyptian Evacuation of Nejd, 1840. 61 After the departure of the Wahabi Agent an attack was made on the Beni Naim at Baraimi by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who was called to account by the r ^ ir / d n ^./ na k e r ep ar ation to the Beni Naim.

Between 1824 and 1831 the Wahabi Amirs re-established their control over Hasa. By 1833 they had established themselves at Baraimi, and in general control of Trucial Oman. Between 1836 and 1839 they were for the second time decisively defeated by the Egyptians, the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner and the Wahabi power temporarily destroyed. Baraimi was recaptured by the Beni Naim about 1838. Thanks to British pressure, efforts by the Egyptians through a former Wahabi agent to establish themselves in Trucial Oman in 1839-40 were defeated. 1840-1871. From the withdrawal of the Egyptians from Hasa to the Death of the Amir Feisul bin Turki. 64. For a year at the beginning of this period the Egyptian nominee Khalid remained in control. He was overthrown in September 1841 by Abdulla bin Soneyan, likewise a member of the ruling Wahabi family. Abdulla was himself overthrown in May-June of 1842 by the ex-Amir Feisul bin Turki, who had now been released by the Egyptians and who thus regained the Wahabi Amirate, which he held until his. death in 1865. During this period the Wahabis re-established themselves in Nejd and Hasa and to a considerable extent regained their influence in Trucial Oman, though from 1853 to 1865 it was less marked than it had been in the past. They repeatedly conducted aggressions against the Sultan of Muscat, but their relations with H.M. Government were on the whole good, although H.M. Government found it necessary to prevent them from aggression against Bahrein in 1851 and 1859, against the Trucial States in 1855, and against Muscat in 1852 and 1865-66. The following are the main features in the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with their neighbours in Eastern Arabia and with the British Government during the period in question. Muscat and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 65. Syed bin Mutlak, the Wahabi Lieutenant, established himself at Baraimi in 1845 and gave indications of an intention of taking active steps against the Sultan of Muscat. A protest was received from the Besident, who supported his representations by a British naval demonstration. Towards the end of 1845 an agreement was reached under which Muscat was to pay a tribute of 5,000 dollars and the Wahabi forces were withdrawn. In 1849 the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who had had hopes of support from the Sultan of Muscat in his campaign against the Wahabis, finding that it was unlikely that his hopes would be realised, made peace with the Wahabis. In March 1850, however, Muscat, in concert with Abu Dhabi, organised an expedition against the Wahabis. In 1852 the Wahabi Amir sent his son AMdulla on a mission to Trucial Oman with a view to redressing the grievances alleged to be entertained by the Oman Sheikhs against Muscat. Hostilities broke out shortly thereafter between the Wahabis and Muscat, which were concluded at the end of 1853 by an offensive and defensive alliance by which Muscat undertook to pay tribute of 12,000 dollars (with arrears of 60,000 dollars and certain provisions and stores), the Wahabi Amir on his part undertaking to assist the Sultan in every hour of emergency. It w 7 as agreed that the boundaries of both parties should remain unchanged. In December of the same year the Wahabis responded to a demand by Muscat under the terms of the treaty that they should bring the Batineh tribes, who had refused to pay tribute, back to their allegiance. The Disputes of 1864-66. 66. Towards the end of 1864 the Chief of Bostack in Muscat, whose family had been dispossessed of Sohar in 1810, informed the Sultan of Muscat that he proposed to transfer his allegiance to the Wahabis and to pay them tribute. The Sultan suggested that the differences which had arisen should be decided by the Political p ^ to Bo Besident, but Colonel Felly reached the conclusion that it was open to question 21.1.65, whether the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, in the support he had given to the Chief Nejd Precis 3076 D §§Lor. I, 473- 4. S. of S. to G\ of L, ? 8.11,65. Bo. Bel., XXIV, 450-4. Lor. I, 705. of Rostack, was acting under instructions from the Wahabi Amir. It transpired that the differences which had arisen had a two-fold aspect: the first the rebellion of the Chief of Rostack ; the second and more important, the demand on the parL of the Wahabi Amir for an increased annual tribute from the Sultan, coupled with a threat of invasion in the event of non-compliance. 67. In August 1865 the Beni bu Ali and the Jenabah tribes of south-east Muscat, both of them Wahabi by religion, captured Sur, inflicting considerable damage on British Indian subjects. A protest was at once made to the Wahabi Amir and to his deputy at Baraimi on behalf of the British Government and the Resident was authorised to take, in consultation with the Senior Naval Officer, such measures as they might think likely to promote an arrangement between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan. “ He is not, however, to undertake anything on land.” Undertakings secured from Wahabis, 1866. 68. The Amir defended the action of his Lieutenant on the ground of an agreement alleged to exist between the Wahabi State and the British Government, a statement for which there proved to be no foundation. The discussions which subsequently took place were unfruitful It proved necessary to bombard and destroy the forts of Sur, and to destroy a Wahabi tower at Ajman and certain Wahabi warships which were lying at Qatif; and the Wahabi Amir, faced with these evidences of a positive British intention to support the Sultan of Muscat and to secure reparation for the injuries which had been inflicted, sent an envoy to Bushire early in 1866, who requested the Resident, on behalf of the Amir, to mediate between the Amir and the British Government, and gave undertakings that no attack would be made upon British subjects residing in territories under the authority of the Amir or upon the territories “ of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.” The overtures made by the Amir were accepted by the Government of India and friendly relations were restored. The Wahabis in Truoial Oman, 1840-1870. The Amir Khalid and the Trucial Sheikhs, 1841. 69. In October 1841, on the Amir Khalid threatening to send a force into Oman, a British officer was deputed to inform him, both orally and in writing, that H.M. Government would disapprove of such a measure. The Amir disavowed any intention of adopting it and would apparently in any event have lacked the force to give effect to it. This was perhaps as well, “ as the maritime Arab chiefs, though outwardly professing their determination to maintain their independence, were known to be secretly carrying on intrigues and correspondence with him.” Overtures of the Amir Abdulla to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1842. 70. In February 1842 the Amir Abdulla addressed letters to the Sheikhs of Oman intimating his intention of sending Syed bin Mutlak as his deputy to them and requesting them to afford him every aid and assistance. The originals of these letters (save in the case of Abu Dhabi, where the Sheikh refused to surrender the letter addressed to him) were obtained by the Political Resident, Colonel Robertson, who thereupon formally protested to the Wahabi Amir against his attempt to bring the Trucial Sheikhdoms under Wahabi influence, on the ground of the ill-effects which had hitherto resulted “from the establishment of Wahabi interests among the pirate chieftains, which had led to their chastisement by the British Government.” The Amir, in reply, declared his intention of co-operating with the British Government to stamp out piracy and added that he had promulgated this to the people of Oman, whom he referred to as his subjects. The correspondence dropped with the overthrow of the Amir Abdulla in May-June of 1812, but it may be noted that in their published reply to the letters received from the Amir, the Sheikhs of Baraimi claimed a species of connection with the British Government (no doubt based on the encouragement given them in 1839—paragraph 59 above), although there was reason to believe that secret letters of a different tenour had also been despatched to the Amir by the Wahabi partisans among them.Overtures of the Amir Feisul to the Trucial Sheikhs, 1843. 71. In 1843 the Resident concluded a Maritime Truce for a period of 10 years Aitch. XII, '^with the Trucial Sheikhs. Following the example of his predecessor, the new No - xxii &gt; Amir, Feisul, in July 1843 wrote to the maritime and inland Sheikhs of Oman, PP- 250 “ 1 - intimating his intention shortly to send an army under Syed Bin Mutlak to bring the Province under his authority. Abu Dhabi and Shargah in the same month made a composition of their differences, and on receipt of the Amir’s letter Debai alone of the maritime Chiefs appears to have been disinclined to submit to Wahabi authority. Inland, however, the Beni Naim chiefs of Baraimi asked for the support and assistance of the British Government against the Wahabi Amir, but in vain (cp. paragraph 97). Arrival in Oman of Syed bin Mutlak (1845) and reoccupation of Baraimi. 72. No marked advance appears to have been made by the Wahabis until 1845, when Syed bin Mutlak arrived in the vicinity of Baraimi. The Beni Naim, in the absence of any support or reassurance from Great Britain, at once submitted, while the Resident, in reply to enquiries by the Regent, in the absence (in Zanzibar) of the Sultan of Muscat, as to the course to be adopted in face of the Wahabi Bo. Sel. requests for submission, advised that, provided the terms proposed by the Wahabis were not extravagant, they should be accepted. If they proved excessive, the Regent should reply that he could not accede to them without first consulting the British Government, whose ally he was. Opposition to Wahabis. 73. Syed bin Mutlak’s course proved less smooth than may have been expected. On his arrival Wahabi influence was so great in Trucial Oman as to endanger the security of Muscat. But it was soon severely shaken by a refusal on the part of the Beni Said tribe to pay tribute, and by the punishment administered by them to the envoy of the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was unable to persuade the maritime Sheikhs to assist him against them. Protests against Wahabi aggressions on Muscat were also received from the Resident. By the end of the year a reaction against the Wahabis had taken place in Trucial Oman. Umm al Qaiwain alone of the Trucial Sheikhs now supported the Wahabi Lieutenant, who was isolated at Bo. Sel. Baraimi. Of the other tribes the Beni Said were joined in opposition to him by the Al Said and the Abu Rashid, while the Muttawas, the Beni Naim and the Chief of Sohar formed a separate alliance with the same object. “ The effect of these two separate confederacies, both composed of powerful and numerous followers,” must “ have been highly beneficial and tended greatly to prevent the inordinate aggrandise ment of the Wahabi power in the Province of Oman.” 74. The next few years show in a conspicuous degree the volatile and uncertain nature of the relations of the Trucial Sheikhs (who in 1817 entered into an anti slavery treaty with H.M. Government.) both with one another and with the Wahabis. In 1845 Abu Dhabi united with his hereditary enemy Shargah to crush Ajaman, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain. In 1847 Debai joined Shargah. In January 1848 Shargah found himself isolated and opposed by a combination of the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. Later in 1848 hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi and the Wahabi Lieutenant in Oman. Capture of Baraimi by Abu Dhabi (1848) and its Restoration to Wahabis (1849). 75. On 16th June the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi captured Baraimi, the garrison surrendering; defeated a Nejdi expedition sent to restore the position, and compelled the Wahabi Agent to take refuge with the Sheikh of Shargah. But the successes of Abu Dhabi aroused the apprehensions of the other Irucial Sheikhs, who now combined against him, and the Sheikh, support from Muscat seeming improbable, in February 1849 made peace with the Wahabis and agreed to restoie the Baraimi forts to the Wahabi Agent. Muscat and Abu Dhabi attack the Wahabis, 1850. 76. In March 1850 Muscat and Abu Dhabi concerted a joint expedition against gel , the Nejdis of Baraimi, who were supported by all the remaining Trucial Sheikhs. xilY,’’ But Shargah and his allies directed their operations against the Batineh coast of 493-4, 505.Muscat, which they had conquered by May of 1850, and a truce was then concluded with Muscat. In November 1850, however, Shargah, Abu Dhabi, and the Beni Naim of Baraimi were again allied against the Wahabis. In 1851, Abu Dhabi and. Shargah having reached an understanding (one result of which was to make Dibaf draw closer to the Wahabis), Abu Dhabi assisted Bahrein against the Wahabi Amir. Bo. Sel. XXIV. 232, 359, 496, 507, 520.

Towards the end of 1852 the Wahabi Amir despatched his son, Abdulla, to Trucial Oman. Abdulla is stated to have come “ in the character of arbitrator and redresser of the wrongs suffered by his people (the Sheikh’s) in Oman at the hands of Muscat.” He established himself at Baraimi, supported by an imposing force, and called upon all the maritime and inland Sheikhs to attend hirm All the maritime Sheikhs responded to this summons with the exception of Debai, who sent his uncle to represent him, but explained to the Resident that he was opposed to the presence of Wahabis in Oman. Shargah, anxious to injure Muscat, lent his fullest support to the Wahabis and urged an attack on the Batineh. Abu Dhabi thereupon adopted an opposite course, intimated that he would, not be prepared to co-operate personally in such a policy, and disbanded most of his forces. The Resident and the Wahabis, 1852-1853. 78. Meanwhile, the Resident was anxious to renew the maritime truce concluded for 10 years in 1843 and called upon the Trucial Sheikhs to attend him for this purpose. The Trucial Sheikhs other than Debai were all at Baraimi, and Umm al Qaiwain, in particular, “ in seeking permission to return to his port for the purpose of meeting the Resident, had some degree of restraint imposed on his actions.” Shargah also alleged that he was detained at Baraimi. He was instructed in reply to proceed forthwith to the coast. The Resident informed the Wahabi Commander of his extreme surprise that any circumstances whatever should induce him to prevent the Sheikhs from obeying his call, and a warship was sent to patrol the Trucial Coast. These measures proved effective, the Sheikhs repaired to the Resident, and on the 4th May 1853 signed as independent rulers the Perpetual Maritime Truce at Shargah. Trucial Oman in 1854. 79. A report from the Resident in 1854 remarks that the Trucial Sheikhs “ are independent, but acknowledge the feudal supremacy of the Wahabi ruler whenever his own power or their dissensions may place him in a position to exercise it. Their chiefs are expected to afford military aid in his expeditions and to furnish supplies to his troops when present, as in the case of the garrison at Baraimi, in Oman. The territorial possessions of the maritime chiefs are confined to the inhabited spots on the sea coast and may be said to be bounded by the walls of their towns and the date gardens in their immediate vicinity. . . . The maritime tribes are closely related to the nomad tribes in the interior, over whom the chiefs of the former exercise a limited control.” Shargah, Debai and Umm al Qaiwain are described at this time as belonging to the Wahabi sect. Decline in Wahabi Influence in Oman, 1854. 80. But despite the imposing character of the Wahabi mission to Oman in 1853, the power of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi had by 1854 fallen to a low point. “ Having no longer any material force at his command he was reduced to maintaining his position by petty intrigue and playing off one Sheikh against another.” In 1854 he was reported to be exercising a restraining influence on the Wahabi Amirs. But in the following year he was involved in intrigues against Shargah, and in that year the Naim of Baraimi suggested to the Resident that British influence should be used for the expulsion of the Wahibis. The Resident, however, explained “ that the policy of Government was now one of non-intervention in internal affairs, and himself merely continued to avoid, as his predecessors had done since 1840, direct communication with or recognition of the Wahabi representative.” 81. In 1855-56 the Chief of Abu Dhabi was expelled from his State, and appealed to the Amir to instruct his Agent in Oman to assist him. With the assistance of the Agent the ex-Sheikh re-established himself in Abu Dhabi.Wahabi Influence in Trucial Oman in 1865. 82. The Political Resident in 1865 prepared a map, of which a copy is attached, p.R. to &lt;%howing the positions of the Wahabi power and the minor Chieftains friendly to it, Bo., No. 11, and of the Sultanate of Muscat and the minor Chieftains friendly to it. His c covering despatch drew attention to the extent to which in the east of the peninsula the interests of Muscat and the Wahabis were interlaced. It will be observed that Abu Dhabi and Dibai are classed as supporters of Muscat, and that Qatar and a fairly deep fringe along the Trucial sea coast are shown as falling outside the Wahabi sphere. Fall of Baraimi and Destruction of Wahabi Poioer in Trucial Oman, 1869. 83. Little of moment appears to have occurred in the Trucial area between 1856 and 1870. In 1864-66 the Truciai Sheikhs appear to have stood aside from the struggles between Muscat and the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabis undertook not “ to injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government . . . further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.” In 1867 the ex-Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah unsuccessfully sought for Wahabi intervention. In April 1869 the Wahabi Lieutenant at Baraimi, having- involved himself in the affairs of Shargah, was murdered there. In June 1869 the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi and formed an alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhaibi, originally directed against the other Sheikhs of Oman, whom the Sultan suspected of favouring the Wahabis. But on the Sheikh of Shargah joining this alliance all danger from the Wahabis came to an end, and, with the reassertion of Turkish influence farther west in 1870 -71 and the gradual collapse of the Saudi dynasty, Wahabi influence ceased to be of importance in Trucial Oman, save in a purely religious sense, for half a century. Qatar and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 84. Bahrein assumed a dominating influence in Qatar throughout most of this period. In 1851 there was risk of the establishment of Wahabi influence in it, but a peace arranged in duly of that year removed any risk of the dispossession of the Sheikhs of Bahrein by the Wahabis. Bahrein tributary to Wahabis in respect of Qatar, 1866. 85. In 1866 the Political Resident, after a careful investigation, expressed the view, which was accepted by the Government of India in 1867, that the Sheikh of Bahrein probably owed fealty to the Wahabi Government on account of his Lor. I, 892. possessions in Qatar and that the tribute of 4,000 dollars a year which he at that time paid to the Wahabi Amir “ was regarded as a payment made^to secure his subjects in Qatar from aggression by other tribes of the mainland.” The Amir appears at one time (between 1852 and 1856) to have had a representative of his Lor. I, 800. own at Dohar. But Lorimer expresses the opinion that it is probable that this agent was only the local Sheikh. 86. By 1868 the El Thani family had obtained a dominant influence in Qatar. Lor.

From 1843 to 1847 the Wahabi Amirs from time to time lent a considerable degree of support to the dispossessed Sheikh Abdulla, of Bahrein, and in 1345 the ex-Sheikh unsuccessfullv attempted to capture the islands with then assistance. Lor. I, 880. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Resident to call in the Trucial Sheikhs of the Arab littoral against Bahrein, a corresponding request by the Sheikh of Bahrein to be allowed to enlist the Sheikh of Debai against the W ahabis being equally refused in November of the same year. In August 134/ a treaty of peace was concluded between the Wahabi Amir and the ruling Sheikh under which the ruling Sheikh agreed to pay a tribute of 4,000 dollars a year, while the Wahabi Amir agreed to abandon his support of the ex-Sheikh. 88. In 1850-51 the Amir was prevented from taking and possibly siibdumg Bahrein by the intervention of H.M Government, and a peace bv which Baiiein agreed to pay tribute was concluded between the Sheikh and the Wahabis m Julj'c ‘ t Lor.

In the following year, the Sheikh proposing to withhold his tribute from the Wahabi Amir, on the advice of the Resident decided to pay it. In 1853 the Government of Bombay vrere authorised to afford every obstacle to an attach on Bahrein by the Wahabis (who were now nominally subject to the Turkish Government). In 1859 a Wahabi attack was again averted by British intervention but the Amir formally asserted his authority over Bahrein by declaring that he was himself a vassal of the Sultan of Turkey (see paragraphs 91 and 105 below), and in 1801 it proved necessary to take forcible action for the removal of the Bahreini pretender from Qatar, despite the support accorded to him by the Wahabis. Koweit and the Wahabis, 1840-1870. 89. In 1841 the ex-Amir Khalid took refuge in Koweit. In 1863 relations between the Sheikh of Koweit and the then Wahabi Amir were friendly, but no tribute was paid to the Wahabis. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir, “ who maintained an agent at Koweit for political purposes, as his father too had done even so early as 1851, was prepared to assist the Sheikh in a quarrel between the latter and the Turks. The Wahabis and Turkey, 1840-1870. Wahabi Tribute to Turkey. 90. In 1862 the Consul-General at Bagdad stated that since the Egyntian invasion, of Nejd in 1839—40 “Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities at Mecca.” Amir professes to be a Turkish Dependent, 1855. Turkish Claim to Suzerainty, 1862. 91. In 1841 the Porte, having received presents from the puppet Amir Khalid advanced danns to authority over Nejd and appointed him Wali of Nejd on their behalf. In 1851 the Amir was understood to pay tribute to the Porte, despite the lact that ‘ accredited envoys of the Pasha of Egypt were present in his camp and the Wahabi agent at Koweit professedly supported Egyptian interests.” In 1855 (see paragraph 105 below) the Amir stated in terms, in writing, that he was a dependent of the Turkish Government and that the dependence of Nejd on Turkev had been made clear to Mehemet Ali in 1839. In 1859, again in writing he reierred to treaties between Nejd and the Porte (paragraph 106 below). In°1862 a lurkish protest was received, against the bombardment of Damman in Qatar on the. ground that, as lying within the territories of “Feisul Beg the Kaimakam of jNejd, it was part of the hereditary dominions of the Sultan.” Wahabi Appeal to Turkey, 1866. 92 In 1866 the Amir sent an envoy to Bagdad complaining of English aggression upon the coast of Nejd and its dependencies, and soliciting Turkish intervention P re Tp enCe ’i and T UI t, lsh Wali raised the matter officially with the NeiA ” C rT- Tt ner * al i’i an - d loud i a , sserted the Suzerainty of the Sultan over P? i r • lollow , m g mont , h the envoy was abruptly dismissed; and the Consul-General conjectured, in the light of further discussion with the Wali that the explanation was that the Amir, “when urged by the authorities of Bussomh to hfsTenuZtffin o n f h T Tr mcati0ns ’ n0 u 011 i y eVaC ! ed compliance, but signified treat Wbh tbe Vt P r p h supremacy by despatching envoys to Bushire to treat with the Resident, while on the other hand the Ottoman Ministry at Constantinople . probably pointed out the inexpediency of extending to more remote tribes and principalities in Arabia that condition of quasi dependence which is found only too onerous and embarrassing in the case of the Bedoum tribes. . . 93.

Overtures by Amir Feisal, 1843. 98. At about the same time the Wahabi Amir on his side informed the Resident Bo. Sel., o is anxiety for the renewal of the amicable relations which bad formerly existed XXIV, between his father, Turki, and the British Government. An appropriate ‘response 157 - 8 ’ 454 was made to this, communication, and the Amir was also informed that the sole object of the British Government in this quarter was the suppression of plunder and bloodshed on the seas and the security of all well-disposed inhabitants on the shores of the Gulf. Policy of Government of India and Government of Bombay, 1843-1845. 99. The Government of Bombay, having at about this time suggested doubts as Ne i d Pr e cis , to whether the Wahabi Amir should be allowed to obtain a preponderating influence § 50 ' 2, at Bahrein and over the Arab chiefs who were in treaty relations with H.M. Government, were informed by the Government of India that it was “ not at present necessary or expedient to interfere with the proceedings of the Chief.” 100. The Government of Bombay reverted to the subject on 26th August 1844, and pointed out that in the “ now certain event of the Amir Feisal, the legitimate Wahabi Ruler, extending his authority over the chiefs of Oman, and especially if he endeavoured to effect this object by sea,” British relations with Oman and the maritime Arab Chiefs might be affected and the resumption of piracy facilitated. They suggested the possibility of an arrangement with the Amir ratifying and securing existing engagements at sea; “ In other words, that as the price of forbearance on the part of the British Government this chief should become a party to its maritime engagements, whereby commercial interests may be secured.” The Government of India took no action on this suggestion. 101.. Early in 1845, consequent on the re-establishment of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi and his inroads into Muscat, the Bombay Government again consulted the Government of India as to the action to be taken if Muscat asked for British help against the Wahabis. The Government of India replied that if “ the mere q. 0 f I. to ^establishment of the Wahabi power in Oman and the reception of the willing Bo., 6.5.45.Nejd Precis, §56. Lor. I, 881. Lor. 1,1112 Nejd Precis, § 61. i 20 allegiance of the maritime chiefs, whom, on a former occasion, we took under our protection and encouraged to resistance, were to be the only result of the present PTuedition the Governor-General in Council would see no occasion to modify th e opinion given in the letter from this office of 7th October 1843, that our interference is not called for.” If, however, the Amir’s purposes appeared to be to encroach on Muscat, or if “the result of these proceedings is found detrimental to our relations with the maritime Arabs and our measures for the suppression of piracy ” a case for interference would arise, and in such an event it might be desirable that the Government of Bombay should warn the Amir that our forbearance would be extended no further. Such an expression of the views of the British Government would probabl} 7 be sufficient to cause him to desist from active operation against Muscat. At any rate, a demonstration by sea by the British naval forces would produce the desired effect. If the Government of Bombay considered “ that the mere declaration of our views or naval operations alone would in all probability effect what is desired” they were given discretion to proceed accordingly. Otherwise, they should iefer for further instructions to the Government of India, A strong naval demonstration was subsequently made, and forcible remonstrances addressed by the Political Resident both to the Amir and to his Lieutenant at Baraimi resulted m the conclusion of an understanding between Muscat and the Amir. 102. In 1846 the Wahabi Amir was refused permission by the Government of India to borrow aid against Bahrein from Trucial Oman, a corresponding request from Bahrein being likewise refused. Bahrein supported against Wahabis, 1851. 103. In 1851 the Amir, consequent on British naval intervention, found himself obliged to come to terms with the Sheikh of Bahrein. Muscat supported in Negotiations with Wahabis, 1852. 104. In 1852 the Resident, on Abdulla, son of the Amir, entering Oman, remonstrated sharply wdth him for detaining at Baraimi the maritime Chiefs at a time when he (the Resident) desired their presence to discuss a renewal of the maritime truce, and negotiations between Muscat and the W ahabis were facilitated by a British naval demonstration along the Arabian coast. Correspondence with Amir, 1855. 105. In January 1855 the Resident pointed out to the Imam that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent Powers. The Amir’s reply is of some importance. He stated that he was “ a dependant of the Exalted Turkish Government ” and that he held the “ confirmation of the Sultan to^ my continuance in authority over all the Arabs ”—a statement which he had, he said, previously made to Mehemet Ali when that Pasha had “ deputed his envoy to me, professing to hold me dearer and more cherished than his own sons, to induce me to forward his views with respect to the coast of Oman and elsewhere within the peninsula of Arabia and to offer no hindrance or opposition.” “ With regard to wffiat you observe, that engagements have existed between the chiefs of the coast of Oman and the Resident for a period of 30 years, this is well known to me, their object being to guard against the occurrence of irregularities and the harbouring of disorderly characters, nought else. This is an arrangement of which I quite approve on the part of Residents—both those who have gone before and those wffio come after—for there is an understanding between us and the British Government of 100 years’ duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas. The coasts of Oman, however, and the territories thereof appertain to the peninsula of Arabia under my control, and acknowledging my authority. Further, the people of the districts in the interior of Oman and at the seats of the Bedouin tribes are more powerful than, and have the command over, the inhabitants of the coast and could not be restrained from preying upon and slaughtering them, but that I maintain a Lieutenant with a force in Oman, who holds them back from the people of the coast. These last are well assured of his protection ; otherwise, were they abandoned to their fate, they could not subsist. Moreover, when, owing to their negligence, disagreements, too long to be detailed, and bloodshed have arisen between some of the Chiefs of the coasts aforesaid, there was none could check themand restore order and goodwill among them except the Lieutenant in charge of Lor. I, 1118, Oman, whose office is among the things pleasing to God and his Prophet, as also to Nejd Precis, ^he Sultan of the Faithful.” § 61. Further Correspondence with Amir, 1859. 106. In 1859, the Wahabi Amir threatening to support the Bahreini pretender, Muhammad bin Abdulla, against the de facto chief, the Persian Gulf Squadron was despatched to Bahrein, with the result that the Wahabi Governor of Qatif abandoned his designs and begged for pardon. The Amir, however, after justifying his proceedings on the ground that the Sheikh of Bahrein was one of his feudatories Lor. I, 887. whom he had a perfect right to chastise for various misdeeds, strongly protested Nejd Precis, against British interference and added that “ between the Wahabi Amir and the Butish Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority, and, m accordance with treaties between the W^ahabi Amir and the Sultan Abdul Mejid, there are matters which everyone is precluded from meddling with, unless on special grounds.” The Resident replied that the British Government recognised Bahrein as an independent Sheikhdom and was prepared to oppose all foreign agency, including that of H.H. the Amir, by every means in its power. He added that the Amir s claim to be a dependant of Turkey was inconsistent with the piracies which were at the same time being committed by his Lieutenant at Qatif on vessels bearing the Turkish flag. Bombardment of Damman, 1861. 107. In June 1861 the Amir was required to eject the Bahreini pretender from Damman in Qatar, and was advised to enter into a peaceful convention with the ruling Sheikh. No answer having been returned, the Persian Gulf Squadron forcibly compelled the Pretender to flee from Damman in November 1861. The Wahabi garrisons took no steps to molest the Squadron. Turkish Protest and British Reply, 1862. 108. A Turkish protest against the bombardment of Damman—a place which, as lying within the territory of “ Feisul Beg, the Kaimakham of Nejd,” “ was part of Pr6ciSr the hereditary dominions of the Sultan was received from the Turkish Wali § ' of Bagdad in 1862. I he British Consul-General at Bagdad replied that H.M. Government had hitherto “ always maintained direct relations with Amir Feisul as well^as with all the chiefs and principalities situated on the shores of the Persian Gulf.” In the prosecution of our pacific policy in the Gulf, which was well known, we ‘‘have never acknowledged the authority or jurisdiction of any other State an authority and jurisdiction, however, which assuredly the Porte neither does exercise nor has ever exercised in that quarter.” The Consul-General, in reporting the correspondence to the Ambassador at Constantinople, remarked : “ Although it may not be denied that since the Egyptian invasion of Nejd in 1839-40 Amir Feisul has remained tributary to the Turkish authorities of Mecca, his tribute being regarded probably as an offering to the head of the religion, it is certain that the Porte has never exercised any jurisdiction or attempted to extend its authority over that country. ... In point of fact the Porte has not the power to punish or coerce its tributary; not a single Turkish functionary exists in the country, and to judge from my own experience of the duties of the British Resident in the Persian Gulf, J feel assured that, were the relations of that officer with the Amir of Nejd to be disturbed in a manner to withdraw the Wahabi coast from his immediate supervision, the effect must be highly prejudicial to the policy which has hitherto obtained under the orders and sanction of Her Majesty’s Indian Government in that quarter.” 1864. Resident authorised to mediate between Muscat and the Wahabis. 109. Towards the end of 1864, serious difficulties having arisen between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabi Amir consequent on the endeavours of the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi to secure a substantial increase in the amount of zakat Nejd Precis, paid by Muscat to the Wahabis, Colonel Pelly, the then Political Resident, was § 72. requested to report fully and to employ his good offices if mediation were of any use, but “ to let the Sultan clearly understand that the British Government had no intention of interfering in the differences between the powers on the shores of the Persian Gulf by aiding one party to coerce the other.”22 P.R. to Bo., 14.2.65.

Colonel Felly's Visit to the Wahabi Amir. 110. In February 1865 Colonel Felly decided to visit the Wahabi Amir at his capital. This visit is of some importance, as Ibn Sand has tended to suggest (both' recently and in 1913, see paragraph 152 below) that an agreement (in 1913 alleged to have been oral) was reached between Colonel Felly and his ancestor on this occasion, it may, therefore, be recorded that the Resident’s visit, though subse quently formally approved by both the Government of liombay and the Government of India, was undertaken on his own initiative and without any previous reference to or sanction of either Government; that the Resident had no instructions on the basis of which he could have conducted negotiations. The Despatch reporting that he was proceeding to Riyadh remarks : “ I hope that I shall leave the Wahabi Provinces on polite terms with the people, and with the prospect of more friendly relations with the Wahabi Government. It is possible, also, I may find an opportunity for a casual and friendly office towards smoothing the present differences between the Sultan of Muscat and the Wahabis.” But no report can be traced suggesting that any understanding or agreement was reached during his visit, or that the visit aimed at, or achieved, any object other than the establishment of friendly personal relations, the dissipation of the view previously apparently held that it was difficult if not impossible for a European to penetrate to Riyadh, and some preliminary exploration of the ground in regard to the differences which had arisen between the Wahabi Amir and the Sultan of Muscat. Nothing can be traced in support of the suggestion that the Resident concluded any agreement with the Amir, verbally or otherwise. 111. It may be added that among Sir Lewis Felly’s private papers in the India Office there exists a rough private journal of a fragmentary character, which contains inter alia some notes of his conversations with the Wahabi Amir. Here likewise there is no reference to or suggestion of any agreement, but the following notes are of interest: “ Assurance to my interpreter after my departure that he [the Amir] was very pleased with the visit, that for the future he would open a new book of relations with me, and keep all his proceedings (? unveiled) from and in direct communication with me ” . . . “ Imam’s remark that if more cut off from the world than other States, he was still an independent sovereign and feared no one.” 112. Later in 1865 the Resident, with the approval of the Government of India, offered to mediate between the Amir and Muscat, and British intervention proved necessary owing to Wahabi activities at Sur. Claim by Wahabi Amir that Proceedings of his Agent at Baraimi are justified by an Agreement with H.M. Government^ 1865. 113. Meanwhile, the Amir, in reply to the remonstrances addressed to him, endeavoured to justify his action and defended the proceedings of his Lieutenant at Baraimi on the ground that there existed between the Wahabi Amirs and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Amir Saud, and again ratified in the time of the present ruler, Turki. 114. No trace of any such treaty as that mentioned by the Wahabi Amir could be found in the Residency at Bushire or in the records of the Government of India. The Government of India stated that it would be advisable “ for the Bombay Government to inform the Wahabi Amir that the British Government is not aware of the existence of any formal agreement between itself and the Amir, but that if any such document does exist, a copy of it, no doubt, must be in the Amir’s possession, and the Amir will do well to produce it for verification.’ 5 They proceeded, that any encroachment on the territory of Muscat would be viewed 'with grave concern. British Punitive Action against Wahabis, 1866. 115 Considerable subsequent discussion and correspondence took place in regard to the affairs of Muscat during 1866, and on the 6th January in that year a formal warning was addressed to the Amir, with a request for full and written apologies for the Sur incident. During the month, Wahabi towers and ships were destroyed by the Persian Gulf Squadron, and in February the forts at Sur were equally destroyed by gunfire and a severe punishment inflicted on the local Wahabi23 n a tlii 8 ■ Sulisg.

Towards the end of the month letters dated 28th January were received from the Wahabi Amir, which were followed by the despatch of an envoy to Bushire ^ with definite proposals of peace. Wahabi Undertaking of 2lst April 1866. 116. The Resident arrived at Bushire on 21 st April 1866 and interviewed the Wahabi representative, w T hose assurances and wishes appeared to be in ail respects satisfactory. The envoy gave the following written declaration to Colonel Belly :— “I, Mohamed bin Abdulla bin Maneh, am certain on the following points: “lam authorised by Imam Abdulla bin Feisul to request the Sahib, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, to become the medium of friendship between 0 - ], P ' Imam Abdulla bin Feisul and the British Government; “ Secondly, I assure the Resident in the Persian Gulf on the part of the Imam Abdulla bin Feisul that he will not oppose or injure British subjects residing in territories under the authority of Abdulla bin Feisul ; and “ Thirdly, I assure the Resident in the Persian Gulf, on the part of Imam Abdulla bin Feisul, that he will not injure or attack the territories of the Arab tribes in alliance with the British Government, especially of the Kingdom of Muscat, further than in receiving the zakat that has been customary of old.” 117. It will be observed that this declaration was volunteered by the Wahabi representative and does not in itself constitute a treaty between the two parties. Its acceptance was approved by the Government of India, and the Resident thereupon wrote to the Wahabi Amir a letter from which the following is an extract : — “I have received Your Highness’ friendly letter by the hand of your p r g c i s confidential servant, Md. bin Abdulla bin Mana and suite. § 115 , “ You state that you are desirous for peace, and your envoy has handed to me a paper, copy of which I enclose and which has been approved by H.M. Government. ... &lt; “ I hope this may find you in health, and if you have any difficulty send to me a confidential agent, and I shall always be happ}^ to meet him on friendly terms as I have been Md. bin Abdulla bin Mana.” Basis of a Wahabi Claim that H.M. Government had entered into previous Agreements with Wahabi Amirs, 1866. 118. The Resident, in reporting the result of his final interview with the envoy, wrote : “ I asked the Wahabi envoys what the Amir meant by stating in his letters Political A that agreements had existed of old between his Government and the British. The j une 1866,’ envoys replied that the Wahabi Amirs had, from time to time, received friendly Nos. 64-5. letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a Treaty Agreement. ...” 119. There were no further developments of importance between 1866 and the fall of Baraimi in 1869. Summary, 1840-1870. 120. At the beginning of this period the Wahabis were subject to the Egyptians. Between 1843 and 1865 they reasserted themselves, re-established themselves (though not apparently on the same scale or with the same influence as in the past) in Trucial Oman, were deterred from annexing Bahrein only by British interference, and conducted operations against Muscat. The Government of India found it necessary to remind them of the independence of the Trucial Sheikhs, and of the special relations between H.M. Government and those Sheikhs (1853, 1855) to defend Bahrein against them, to intervene to prevent them from aggression on Muscat, and to conduct effective expeditions against them or their proteges in 1861 nnd 1865-66. During the whole of period they appear to have paid tribute to Turkey and notably in 1855, but also in 1359, they formally claimed to be Turkish dependants, and in 1866 they appealed to Turkey. On the death of the Amir Feisul in 1865 dissensions in the ruling house prepared the way for the invasion of the Turks in 1870 and the fall of the Saudi dynasty. Throughout this period the Trucial Sheikhs remain to a not inconsiderable extent under Wahabi influence, hut retain their independence, and from 1845 to 1869 the Wahabis are in possessionsw. 24 of Baraimi and use it as their base in Trucial Oman. The independence of Bahrein (and with it the relative independence of Qatar) is consistently maintained; Koweit falls outside the Wahabi sphere, and Muscat remains, as in the past, an - independent State.

It is unnecessary for the purpose of the matters now specially under consideration to examine the history of this period in any very great detail. Suffice it to say that in 1870-71 active steps were in contemplation by the Wahabi Amirs for the restoration of Baraimi, which at one time caused some apprehensions to the Government of India and to the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs, having been approached by the Wahabi Amir with a view to an attack on the fort, returned conciliatory answers, with the exception of Abu Dhabi. The internecine quarrels of the Wahabi ruling family, closely followed by a Turkish expedition into Nejd in 1870 to assist the Amir Abdulla against his brother Saud, led to the abandonment of the prosecution of the war against Oman. Barairni remained under the control of Abu Dhabi; the Trucial Sheikhs emerged from any form of Wahabi control or influence ; Wahabi influence outside Nejd and Hasa disappeared, and matters remained in this state throughout the whole of the period now under consideration. Secret Proceedings, Mar. 1872, 249, 252, 257, 259-66. 1 Turkish Occupation of Hasa, 1871. 122. It may, however, be recorded that in 1870 the Amir Abdulla, having been defeated by his brother, himself appealed to' the Turks, with the result that a Turkish expedition occupied Hasa in 1871. In the same year the Turks ceased, even in appearance, to act on behalf of the Amir Abdulla, and a notification was Nejd Precis, issued that the “ El Saud has ceased to reign ” and that a Turkish official was § 140. appointed Governor of Nejd, and the Amir Abdulla fled to Riyadh. Wahabi Appeals to Great Britain, 1871-1873. 123. In September of 1871, Saud bin Feisul protested to the Political Resident against the activities of the Turks in the Gulf waters. He urged that the peace of those waters was under British protection and begged for British arbitration, a request which was refused. Between 1871 and 1873 no fewer than four letters were received by the Resident from Saud, in which he represented that he had been “ easy as regards the sea coast in reliance to your answer, the sea being in your charge and protection. . . . The sea is under charge of the Resident, and I was careless about the sea owing to his word.” ... “ The Sircar ”... is “bound to keep peace.” The uovernment of India informed the acting Resident in the Persian Gulf, with reference to these letters, that unless Saud “ was a party to the so-called maritime truce or had otherwise received assurances from the British Government he was mistaken in supposing that the British Government had undertaken to protect his territories from attack by sea.” The Resident was instructed to report whether anything had been said or done at any time to commit the British Government, directly or indirectly, to defend him or to use their influence to prevent attacks being made upon him by sea. The report when received showed that Saud was not a party to the maritime truce and that the British Government had in no way been committed to protecting him by sea.. Later communications from Saud showed that he now understood the position and merely hoped for the good wishes and friendship of the British Government, and it was left to the Resident in these circumstances to answer Saud’s latest letter, either then or afterwards, in general terms, expressive of goodwill. “ Should he again refer to the existence of any such assurance of security matters were to be explained to him in such a way as to remove any existing misunderstanding which he might display and prevent the possibility of misunderstanding in the future.” Secret Proceedings, Oct. 1873, No. 441. Nejd Precis, § 144-9.Amir Saud and the Turks y 1872-1873. ^ 124. A brief reference may be made to the relations between Sand and the Turks as bearing on the question of the relation of the Saudi dynasty to the Turkish power. In 1872 it was reported that the terms of the understanding contemplated p r ^ cig were to be his recognition as the Chief of Nejd on condition of his paying the §150-6. Turkish war expenses and the same yearly tribute as had been paid by the Amir Feisul. There were certain supplementary conditions which are immaterial. Both he and the Turks professed their anxiety for a settlement on this basis, but no conclusion was reached. In 1872 a letter from Saud offered to invest the Resident with full power of mediation with the Turks, but the negotiations which succeeded again came to no conclusion. In 1873 Saud, now in a stronger position in Nejd, sent Abdul Rahman, the father of the present Saudi King, to Bagdad, with a view to the reaching of an agreement. Abdul Rahman was treated as a hostage and detained until 1874, but negotiations proved unfruitful. In 1875 Saud died and Pol. A. Abdul Rahman was elected Amir of the kingdom of Riyadh “ by the general Sept. 1875, consent of the people.” Internecine quarrels between members of the Saudi family continued from 1875 to 1880, but in the latter year it was reported that Abdulla and his nephews (including Abdul Rahman) were living in peace and friendship. The nephews possessed Kharj, Hotah, Harik, Aflaj, &amp;c., and had followers of the Ajman, Murra and Dowasir tribes. Rise of the Ibn Rashid Family. 125. In 1881, however, the Ibn Rashid dynasty, assisted by the divisions among the Saudis, gradually established themselves in control in Nejd, and the Saudis, who in 1879 had been reported to exercise control only in Riyadh and the district round it, sank into obscurity for 20 years. The Ibn Rashid dynasty of Hail had from 1832 occupied the Jebel Shammar and its Sheikhs had paid homage to the Saudis. The homage to the Saudis was gradually abandoned with the decay of Nejd Precis the Wahabi State, and in 1876 Ibn Rashid is described as the greatest prince in § 201. Nejd.” In 1888 Ibn Rashid decisively defeated the Saudis and captured Riyadh, and his dynasty remained in complete control in Nejd until 1901. It may be recorded, however, that in 1890-91, on the Saudis regaining Riyadh, both parties wrote to the Mutasarrif of Hasa, Ibn Rashid to denounce Abdul Rahman as Nejd Precis meditating an attack on Hasa; Abdul Rahman complaining of Ibn Rashid “and §217. professing his obedience to the Turkish authorities, who were disposed to listen ^g 0 favourably to him.” The Ibn Rashid family throughout professed allegiance to the 4 o °_9 p e b Turkish Government, though Turkish influence in their dominions appears to have 1891, 63-4. been of the smallest; and even on the occasion of his capture of Riyadh in 1888 he posed as the officer or lieutenant of the Ottoman Government. Consolidation of British Position, 1870-1901. 126. Between 1870 and 1901 H.M. Government had substantially strengthened their position on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. In 1880 they had entered into an exclusive agreement with the Sheikhs of Bahrein; in 1887 corresponding agreements wmre concluded with the Trucial Sheikhs. In 1892 the agreements both with Bahrein and with the Trucial Sheikhdoms were confirmed and strengthened and control of the foreign relations of all the rulers in question passed into the hands of the British Government. In 1899 the British Government for the first time established relations on the basis of a positive written engagement with the Sheikh of Koweit and laid the foundations of the situation which emerged 14 years later in the acknowledgment by Turkey under the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 of the autonomy of the Sheikhs of that principality. Turkey established herself in Qatar in 1871 and remained in control throughout the period 1871-1901. Her claim to the principality was never recognised by H.M. Government, and considerable correspondence with the Turkish Government took place during this period in connection with it. IV.—1901-1914. From the Capture of Riyadh by Ibn Saud to the outbreak of the Great War. 127. Between 1901 and 1913 Ibn Saud considerably reduced the importance of the Ibn Rashid family and established himself in Nejd. In 1913 he drove the Turkish garrisons out of Hasa. During almost the whole of this period he was in frequent contact with H.M. Government, his object being to secure their protection 3076 Or26 against the Turks. It may perhaps be well, in the interests both of illustrating the terms which he was prepared to offer in return for British protection and of placing on record the various statements made by him during this period as to his maximum ambitions, his attitude towards the area to the east of the Nejd-Hasa border and the States of the Arab littoral, and his view of his position vis-d-vis the Turks, to record in greater detail than would otherwise be justifiable the sequence of events and the more important correspondence which passed. 128. In January 1901 Ibn Saud took Ibn Rashid by surprise and conquered Riyadh. He appears to have made overtures to the Political Resident late in 1903 with a view to ascertaining whether he could look for British protection in the event of his conquering Plasa. The Government of India thereupon took up the question of sending a Europeon officer to Riyadh for the purpose of collecting intelligence. They were instructed by H.M. Government that no steps should be taken to enter into cioser relations with Nejd or to send an Agent there without prior sanction, and in the light of the Resident’s views, which were also hostile, they did not proceed with the proposal. Ibn Saud appeals for British Protection, 1904. 129. In May 1904, on the Turks taking active steps to support Ibn Rashid, a Vic tel protest against the Turkish invasion was received from Ibn Saud, who solicited the 20.5.04. protection of Great Britain for his country and himself. No answer seems to have been given to these overtures, which were made through the Political Resident. P. 2188a/04. Bre. to Gr.of I. 368,29.10.04 Policy of H.M. Government. 130. In September 1904 Ibn Rashid and the Turkish troops accompanying him were completely routed by Ibn Saud. The Political Agent, Koweit, asked by the Sheikh what advice he should give Ibn Saud, who had enquired whether or not to write to the Turks on the matter, replied that Ibn Saud must consult his own interests and act as he thought best, and that in the absence of instructions from H.M. Government neither the Political Agent nor the Sheikh could give him any advice. P. 3499/04. 131. On SOth December 1904 the Secretary of State for India telegraphed to the Viceroy that “ H.M. Government desire that it should be clearly understood that their interest and influence are to be confined strictly to the coast line of Eastern Arabia, and that nothing should be said or done to connect them even indirectly with the warfare now in progress in the interior.” Const, to F.O., tel. of 12.2.05 and 17.2.05. P.G. Res. Diary, 15.2.05. Const, to F.O., No. 157, 8 3,05 Saudi Agreement with the Turks, 1905. 132. In February 1905 a meeting took place at Kowmit between the Sheikh, the Turkish Wali of Basra and Ibn Saud’s father. The latter is stated to have made a humble submission to the Sultan in his own name and that of his son, Abdul Aziz, professing loyalty and devotion to his sovereign and his readiness to obey his commands, and stating that he was prepared to do all he could to assist the Turkish expedition to Qasim. He protested that Ibn Rashid was his enemy and was inciting the Turkish Government against him. After preliminary discussions the Turkish representative produced an order from Constantinople, addressed to Ibn Saud, appointing him ruler of Nejd on behalf of the Turkish Government and concluding with the following words: “ The Government will put soldiers in El Kasim, and there will be official relations between you (i.e. Ibn Saud) and them, and all of you will be in the service of the Sultan. As for Ibn Rashid, he shall have nothing to do with affairs in Nejd.” In the following month, how ever, the Turks were still apparently supporting Ibn Rashid against Ibn Saud. Abdur Rahman takes Oath of Allegiance to Turkey, 1905. Basra to 133. In May 1905 it was reported that Riyadh, Washem, Sedayr and their 26 11 19Vo5 dependencies had been formed into a caza of which the centre was to be Riyadh, ’ ' ' and that Ibn Saud’s father had been made Kaimakan of the new caza on solemnly taking an oath of allegiance to the Sultan.Projected Visit by Ibn Saud to Trucial Coast, 1905-1906. ^ 134. Towards the end of 1905 information was received that Ibn Saud had visited Katr (still nominally under Turkish rule) and composed certain tribal disputes there, and that he was meditating a visit to the Trucial Coast and to Muscat. This news had seriously disturbed the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who had Bre. lr. 513 himself been instrumental in the final extinction of Wahabi influence from Baraimi ^q? T '’ and the Trucial Coast in 1870, and the Sultan of Muscat, both of whom (with the 285/06. Sheikh of Dabai) belonged to the Hinawi tribe and feared that the arrival of Ibn Saud would be the signal for a combination against them of the remaining Trucial Chiefs who belonged to the Ghafari tribe. Ibn Saud, moreover, was reported to have remarked “ By God, I will explore the country belonging to my lather and grandfather from Muscat to Jaalan.” Views of Government of India and II. Ml. Government. 135. The Government of India were seriously disturbed as to the possible effect on our position on the Trucial Coast and in Muscat of a visit by Ibn Saud. p_ 285/06. H.M. Government in the light of their views decided after consultation with the g.'ofS. Ambassador at Constantinople that if Ibn Saud appeared on the coast and failed to Desp. 15, give satisfactory assurances as to his intentions, he should be warned that any p^g^/og attempt on his part to interfere in Oman or along the Arab coast, either with the Chiefs or with their subjects, would be regarded as an unfriendl} 7 ' act and that steps would be taken to frustrate it. Before these instructions were received, Bre. lr. 51 Sir Percy Cox had conveyed a hint in this sense to Ibn Saud through the Sheikh of 4.2.06 of Koweit (who regarded the proposed visit as a mere attempt to blackmail the 1 • 5,j5 / Ub - coastal Chiefs). The visit, probably owing to the unsettled situation in Nejd, was abandoned. It should be recorded that, on the instructions of H.M. Government, PP 0 Trucial Sheikhs were in the same connection warned by the Resident that, on the ground that general unrest prejudicial to British commercial interests on the Coast would inevitably result, the Government of India would not view with complacency the intrigues of any of them with Ibn Sand. Defeat of Ibn Rashid, May 1906. 136 In May 1906 Ibn Rashid and his immediate following of 250 were Const, to surprised and annihilated in Qasim by Ibn Saud, and Ibn Saud was reported from [ 5 ° 0 ’ 6 292 ’ Jedda in June of that year to have declared himself, consequent on his victory, ruler of the whole “ Shark ” (East) and to have sent letters to Constantinople, Basrah, Bagdad, the Hedjaz, and the Sherif of Mecca. Sir Nicholas O’Conor doubted, however, whether Ibn Saud would be able to cope with the .Turks, “ should he decide to proclaim his independence of the Sultan. Turkish Allowances to Ibn Saud. 137 In August 1906 the Consul at Basrah reported that the allowance granted by the Turks to Ibn Saud was by a recent arrangement paid through the Sheikh of PJL Koweit, who deducted it from the land tax on his Fao property The Sheikh ', to stated that the allowances paid by the lurks were JO liras a month to Ibn Saud s 3 0906 father and 200 liras and about 300 tons of rice to Ibn Rashid. In October 1906 the Resident at Bagdad reported a statement that Ibn Saud had m the past received £T.30 a month from Turkey, with. 100 suits of clothes and some gram—an allowance now alleged to have been discontinued. Withdrawal of Turks from Qasim, September 1906. 138. In September 1906 inconclusive negotiations took place between the Const^to Turkish Commander of Qasim and Ibu Saud and at the end of that year most 271 ’ 06 / of the Turkish troops were reported to have been withdrawn from Qasim, a step which was regarded as a definite success for Ibn Saud. Further Overtures by Ibn Saud to H.M. Government, 1906. 139 As stated above, no reply was sent to the overtures made to H.M. Government on behalf of Ibn Saud in 1904. Further indirect approaches having been ' though various channels during 1906 with a view to ascertaining whether H.M. Government would be prepared to give him protection at any rate by sea to the same extent as it was accorded to the Sheikh ol Koweit and other Arab28 Bre. to Gh of I. 2181, 16.9.06, P. 1817/06.

Rulers of the Gulf in the event of his driving the Turks out of Hasa and Nejd, the Political Resident in September raised the general question of policy. Major Cox said that he was aware that “ it has been a recognised principle of their (H.Mf Government’s) policy not to allow themselves to become involved in the tempestuous politics of Central Arabia,” but expressed the view that it.might be unwise to carry aloofness too far. He suggested that an understanding with Ibn Saud would be of advantage in various ways, and that if we had any intention “ of establishing some measure of friendly intercourse with the Ruler of Nejd, the present seems to be the time for us to do so.” Attitude of H.M. Government, 1906. 140. Lord Morley, then Secretary of State for India, replied, however, that H.M. Government maintained the view that their interests and influence should be confined to the coast, and that no steps should be taken to enter into relations with Nejd or to send agents into the interior without his previous sanction. Further Overtures to H.M. Government, 1906. 141. Towards the end of 1906 further indirect overtures on behalf of Ibn Saud were received through the Sheikh of Koweit and the Sheikh of Qatar. The Resident reported that from the statements made by the latter it appeared that the Saud ‘‘considers that the oases of Hasa and Katif were always the most profitable possessions of his Wahabi ancestors. He is anxious to recover the two districts and he proposes that a secret understanding should be arranged between the British Government and himself under which he should be granted British protection from Turkish assaults by sea in the event of his ever driving the Turks, unaided, out of his ancestral dominions. In return for this protection the Amir is willing to bind himself to certain agreements (probably similar to those of the Trucial Chiefs) and to accept a Political Officer to reside at his Court. . . . Ibn Saud is determined to make an effort to obtain possession of Hasa and Katif. He proposes, therefore, in the first place, to apply to the Sultan for the Mutasariflik (Governorship) of the districts, and to throw off the Turkish yoke as soon as he considers the moment favourable, after establishing himself. If his application is refused he will invade the districts as soon as he is ready and having captured them will appeal openly to the British Government for protection.” Murder of Mutaad ibn Rashid, January 1907. 142. In January 1907 Muta’ad ibn Rashid, the young Amir of Hail, who had succeeded his father in the. Principality of Jabel Shammar at Hail in September 1906, was murdered by his kinsman Sultan ibn Rashid. Further Consideration of Policy towards Ibn Saud, 1907. 143. On 21st February 1907 the Government of India, in the light of the Resident’s reports, again raised the question of the policy to be adopted towards Ibn Saud. They suggested that if the Turks were really likely to disappear from the stage and Ibn Saud.be a power in the land, “it seemed desirable that this Chief should, when a suitable moment arrives, be led to a friendly understanding with us. But on a leview of the various factors of the situation, they expressed the opinion that no immediate response to the advances reported by the Resident was necessaiy and that the answer to Ibn Saud s reiterated enquiries might be that H.M. Government,. “ while anxious to maintain friendly relations with him so long as he comports himself in a manner consonant with British interests and our engagements with the Arab Sheikhs on the coast, see no necessity under present conditions foi making him any formal promises of protection, which might even have the effect of stimulating Turkish opposition to the consolidation of his authority.” 144 The Ambassador at Constantinople, Sir . Nicholas O’Conor, thought that our right policy was to inteivene as little as possible in the internal affairs of these tribes and let them work out their own destiny as best they can,” to wait on events and to modify our policy if subsequently a closer understanding with Ibn Saud seemed desirable. With this view H.M. Government agreed, and they instructed t le Govemment of India that they saw no reason to modify their earlier policy that Butish interests and influence in this region should be strictly confined to thecoast. If it was quite inevitable to give an answer to Ibn Sand’s enquiries, the answer should be that as Ibn Saud s proposals involved considerations which it was Impossible for H.M. Government to entertain, no reply was to be expected to them. Ibn Rashid defeated and abandons Qasim, 1907-1908. 145. In Octobei 190/ Ibn Rashid was decisively defeated by Ibn Saud and besieged by him in Boieida ; and in February 1908 Ibn Rashid entered into negotiations with Ibn Saud and abandoned Qasim to him. Ibn Saud settles Tribal Disputes in Rasa at request of Turks (1908). Ris ascendency in Nejd. 146. In May 1908 Ibn Saud was asked by the Turkish Wali of Basra to settle certain tribal differences in Hasa in the Arab way. In July of the same year Sultan Ibn Rashid, himself the murderer in April 1906 of Mita’ad Ibn Rashid, was murdered by his biothei Saud, who succeeded as Amir and made overtures to Ibn Saud. But by September of that year the Consul at Damascus reported that Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud has become practically the undisputed Amir of Rejd, with his ascendancy recognised in Riyadh, Qasim and by all the Bedouin tribes of Nejd. Iwen Saud Ibn Rashid himself admits that his Amirate of Hail is only a vassalage under the suzerainty of Ibn Saud.” In the same month Saud Ibn Rashid was overthrown, and the Amirate reverted to a minor under a Regency. But by January 1909 the Ibn Rashid faction had to some extent consolidated themselves. Ibn Saud and the Turks, July 1909. 14/. In July 1909 Ibn bauds agent at Bagdad, in the course of a discussion with the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia, remarked that “Abdul Aziz had thought of approaching the Sultan with the suggestion that he should fly the Turkish flag, pay a certain amount of tribute to the Turkish Government, and be recognised as the Governor of the whole of Arabia,” and had actually sent an emissary to take soundings, who had reached Basra, but had returned to Nejd on the news of the Young lurk coup d'etat of April 1909. Ibn Baud’s object and that of man} 7 Arabs was Arab independence. If they could not secure this they would prefer the supremacy of a foreign Power to that of the Turks, and the emissary clearly indicated that the Power they had in view was the British Government. First Conversations between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakes pear, 1911. 148. In the spring of 1911 conversations of much importance, though of a wholly informal character, took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear, then Political Agent, Koweit. Captain Shakespear was the first European whom Ibn Saud had met, and close personal relations appear at once to have been established between them. The Amir described his position and his ambitions in great detail. The following extracts from Captain Shakespear’s Report of the conversation are of interest as illustrating Ibn Sand’s view as to the previous relations of the Wahabi rulers with the British Government, his own relations with Turkey and his attitude to the Trucial Sheikhs :— “ . . . After the Egyptians had been expelled from Nejd, his ancestor, Turki-Bin-Abdulla, had re-created most of the original Wahabi dominion, including Hasa, Katif and most of the Oman coast from Qatar to near Muscat, . . . and had then made a treaty with the British Government . . “ . . . The Amir Feisal bin Turki, on obtaining a pardon from the Egyptians and returning to Nejd in 1842, was at once acclaimed as Imam. He also renewed the old treaty with the British Government.” “. . . the British Government showed how close were their relations with Nejd by sending one of their officers, Colonel Lewis Pelly, to Riyadh, and he renewed the old treaties and friendship, though not by an actual written document.” . . . Since the evacuation of Qasim by the Turks in 1906 “ there have been no signs of Turkish authority in Nejd and Abdal Aziz has so con solidated his power that his word is law over the whole of Nejd from within two days’ march of Hail to the Persian Gulf coast line excepting only the actual towns of Hofuf, Katif, and where the Turks maintained garrisons, and 3076 H Basra to Const., No. 32, 6.5.08.

He asserts that he had made no professions (at the time of the expedition against him in 1910 of the Sherif: of Mecca) of being the vassal of the Sultan, and being a Wahabi does not admit the Sultan’s Khalifate in Islam. . . . The As Sand . . . above all desired* to be in relations with the British Government so that the Turkish ^Govern ment would hesitate to oppress them or to interfere m their affairs m Nejd. . . » The new regime in Constantinople had already shown their aggressive policy, and he feared that before very many years there would be another attempt to subjugate Hejd. I hough the Wahabis had formerly fought us m regard to the coastal Chiefs’ affairs, they saw the benefit of our rule amongst them and had no wish to alter the present position, though Abdul Aziz mentioned having received a letter from Dibai, whose Sheikhs had written, after the Hyacinth gun-running incident, asking to be taken under his protection. On enquiring how he reconciled the regular receipt of a Turkish annuity with the claim to absolute independence, Abdul Aziz said that the annuity dated from the time of his father’s incarceration in Bagdad, was given then for his living expenses, and has continued ever since his transfer to Abdul Rahman ; it amounts to only £T.60 per mensem. The As Sand have never received anything else from the Turks in the way of subsidies, and on his father’s death Abdul Aziz proposes to allow his subsidy to lapse. All the correspondence they had had with the Turkish officials has been of a diplomatic nature, either to effect the removal of troops on the pretext of a show of submission, or to settle any other difficulties as they arose.” 149. The question of policy was again considered between the India Office and the Foreign Office on the receipt of Captain Shakespear’s report. It was agreed, however, that it seemed preferable to hold to the existing policy unless the Govern ment of India should propose a departure from it, when the question could be again considered. The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 150. Between 1911 and 1913 H.M. Government were engaged in negotiations with the Turkish Government on the various matters in dispute between them in the Persian Gulf area. In July 1913 a Convention was initialled under which Turkey— (a) recognised Koweit as an autonomous Kaza of the Ottoman Empire and accepted as valid the Sheikh’s agreement with H.M. Government; (b) abandoned all its claims and rights in respect of El Qatr, H.M. Government undertaking not to allow Bahrein to interfere with the internal affairs of Qatar, to infringe its autonomy, or to annex it; (c) agreed that the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjak of Nejd should be represented by a line running due south from the head of the gulf opposite Zaknuniyeh island, which formed part of the said Sanjak, to the twentieth parallel of latitude in the Rub’ al Khali. Further meeting between Captain Shakespear and Ibn Saud, May 1913. 151. On 15th May 1913 Captain Shakespear, then Political Agent, Koweit, reported that he had met Ibn Sand in the course of a recent tour, in the Koweit hinterland, and had spent four days with him. In the course of the visit Ibn Saud had discussed his future policy with great frankness with Captain Shakespear, who was in close personal relations with him. Captain Shakespear submitted a detailed report of his discussions, from which the following extracts, bearing on the matters now under discussion, are relevant:— 152. He, Ibn Saud, according to Captain Shakespear, stated that “ his power in Central Arabia had increased till he no longer feared any of its Sheikhs or rulers; he was, moreover, in alliance with all of them, excepting only one, viz. : the Sharif of Mecca, who, fearing a second Wahabi invasion of the Hejaz, had therefore allied himself with the Turks. The As Saud were prepared to hold what they had recovered during the last 15 years of their ancient dominion in Arabia, and felt capable of being able to do so comparatively easily but for the menace of Turkish aggression only possible from the East by way of Hasa and from the West by Mecca and Medina. To withstand the Turks from both directions they felt was beyond their strength, and to render secure their easternborders, thus making their full force available for the defence of their western boundaries, was one of the reasons for their desire to evict the Turks from Hasa I and Katif. Another most important one was that possession of these rich districts, with their ports, and especially Ojair, would furnish a valuable source of revenue. Moreover, the As Saud had other grounds, and just ones, for their claim to Hasa and Katif. One was that these districts formerly belonged to their house; another was that the Turks themselves, in a document given to Abdulla bin Faisal by Nafiz Pasha, the General who commanded Midhat Pasha’s expedition to Katif in 1871, had agreed that the area should belong to and be governed by Abdulla and his family. The Amir informed me that this document had only recently come into his possession, and on his return to Riyadh he would send me a copy. Another document of which he had heard, but so far had not succeeded in tracing, was one which purported to be an agreement made by Colonel Sir Lewis Peliy guaranteeing on behalf of the British Government that the As Saud family would be recognised as the Sheikhs of the Katif District. This document, he said, was the result of negotiations after the naval action at Katif and Dammam (in 1865), when four men named Muhammad bin Ma’ana, Abdul Aziz bin Umr, Saleh A1 Widawi and Ibrahim bin Ghanim were sent by Faisal As Saud as his representatives to the Resident. I have no archives, with which to test the accuracy of the Amir’s assertions, but I find a declaration printed on page 156 of Aitchison’s Treaties, Yol. XII, as No. XXVIII, which seems to bear on this transaction. 153. Captain Shakespear in his report stated that while for want of early records he was unaware of the earlier relations of H.M. Government with the As Saud family, “ I am aware, however, that we had frequently to take punitive measures against the Wahabis for interference with the Trucial Chiefs and Bahrein, but in this connection now I am convinced that ‘ Bin Saud ’ would be only too glad to furnish us with any undertaking we desired for the maintenance of the ‘ Status quo ’ in the future.” 154. Sir Percy Cox, in forwarding this report, remarked: “As regards Captain Shakespear’s references to past history and to certain putative agreements between the British Government and the Wahabi Amir, I think one of the letters to which he refers is probably that addressed by Colonel Pelly to the Amir on 6th January, 1866, in which he alluded to ‘ Your Highness’s Governor of Katif,’* . . . My own records have not so far produced anything of utility.” Capture of Hasa by Ibn Saud: May 1913. 155. On 13th May 1913 the Political Resident reported that Ibn Saud had captured Hasa without opposition. On 31st May the Viceroy reported that Sir P. Cox had pointed out that the draft Anglo-Turkish Convention, which had been under consideration since 1911 with a view to regulating relations between Turkey and H.M. Government in the Gulf Area, and which inter alia dealt with Nejd as a Turkish Sanjak, and the expulsion of the Turks from Nejd and Hasa, were somewhat irreconcilable phenomena, and had suggested the possibility of getting the Turks to look the facts in the face and with our help to arrange to include in the Convention a satisfactory solution of the problem, the basis being that Ibn Saud should be recognised as autonomous ruler of Nejd under the suzerainty of the Porte, and that we should accord the right to acciedit an agent to him as one of the maritime rulers and make agreements with him, with the knowledge of the Porte, m connection with the suppression of the aims tiaffic, slave trade and piracy, and our mission in the Gulf generally. 156 The Government of India thought it impossible at this late hour to raise the question of the status of Nejd without running the risk of wrecking the negotiations with Turkey—a view accepted by the Foreign Office; and Sir Edward Grey indicated that he thought it “ preferable to await developments, and to adhere as long as possible to the present policy of H.M. Government, which is to abstain strictly from intervention, direct or indirect, in the affairs of Nejd. The general attitude of H.M. Government, which in this matter is based on * This letter embodied an ultimatum to the Wahabi Amir in regard to the Sur incident of 1865, ^nd stated : “ This letter will be handed to Your Highness’s Governor of Katif. . . .” P.R. to G. of I., 866, 13.5.13, P. 1921/13.

Government were to approach the Ottoman Government, as suggested by Sir P. Cox, with a view to concluding^ direct agreements with Ibn Saud as an autonomous ruler, it would give rise to* suspicion and might have far-reaching and regrettable effects.” Ibn Saud and the Trucial Area 1913. 157. On 18th June the Viceroy reported that Ibn Saud had sent an envoy to the Residency Agent at Shargah, bearing a letter to him and one for the Sheikh of Dabai, intimating that he had recovered without bloodshed “the ancestral possessions of his forefathers, namely, Hasa and its dependencies, and had established peace and public security therein.” Overtures by Ibn Saud to H.M. Government, June 1913. 158. On 13th June 1913 Ibn Saud wrote to Sir P. Cox informing him of the conquest of Hasa, and suggesting a friendly understanding. The following extract from his letter is of importance because of its reference both to an earlier British treaty with Wahabis and to the “ dependencies ” of Hasa, &amp;c. :— “ We beg to address Your Honour in consideration of the previous friendship between us and you and of the still earlier treaty belonging to the time of my grandfather, Faisal—may God forgive him-—of the period of which 55 years have elapsed and 55 years still remain to run. I desire to establish the same in the same manner as it existed between you and my ancestors, and this (fact) has prompted me to make this reference. Firstly, I am confident that there will happen nothing to your people to produce causes which may be contrary to friendship and rules. And we have nowadays conquered the countries of our fathers and forefathers (viz.), El Hasa and El Katif, as well as their dependencies. ... I desire to be on the same terms with you as existed between you and my ancestors, and I desire that those terms should exist between me and you after them (my ancestors).” 159. Sir Percy Cox replied (9th July 1913) that the British Government considered it necessary to observe a strictly neutral attitude towards both sides. No reference was made to the alleged treaties with the Amir Faisal. Ibn Saud’s Overtures to the Turks, July 1913. 160. On. Hth July 1913 Sir P. Cox reported that an envoy from Ibn Saud had reached Bahrein en route for Basra with telegrams to Constantinople explaining that the Amir’s action had been forced on him in the public interest, and that he entertained the utmost loyalty to the Sublime Porte. The Resident urged that H.M. Government should inform Ibn Saud that we should be glad to see him reconciled to the Turks and to assist in promoting such reconciliation. The Porte could be informed that we had so replied. This proposal was supported by the Government of India and the India Office; but, the Foreign Office objecting to the suggestion that we should offer to “ assist in promoting such reconciliation,”' it was abandoned. Ibn Saud and Qatar; Apprehensions of the Trucial Sheikhs, July 1913. 161. On 1st August the Government of India reported the death on 17th July of the Sheikh of Qatar, and stated that the Political Agent, Bahrein, had informed the Resident that while at Katif Ibn Saud had addressed the Sheikh of Qatar and demanded the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from A1 Bidaa. “ Residency Agent, Trucial Coast, reports that Sheikhs of Dabai and Abu Dhabi, who are of the same tribe, have had a conference, and latter, who since the Wahabi evacuation has achieved a paramount position in Baraimi and neighbourhood, is convinced that Ibn Saud will now turn his activities in that direction. In this fear the two Sheikhs have decided to mobilise their Bedouins in the Sabakhat el Matti (vide page 1200, Persian Gulf Gazetteer) and take the initiative against Ibn Saud. There having been nothing unfriendly in our reply to Ibn Saud, I [Sir P. Cox] should not imagine that he would think it worth while to hostilize us by such action, but of coursethe state of Oman generally at present offers him a very favourable oppor tunity, if he be so disposed. I am warning Sheikhs of the improbability of ^ such a development, and deterring them from provoking hostilities, but I should be glad to give them, if possible, something reassuring as to the attitude of the British Government towards a possible enterprise of this kind on the part of Ibn Saud.” British Guarantees to Qatar, 1913. 162. The Resident was instructed in reply that the new Sheikh of Qatar “ and, if necessary, Ibn Saud, should be informed that H.M. Government would allow no outside interference in the peninsula. Latter should clearly understand that if he attempts it, he will be forcibly resisted. Former may be told that he has nothing to fear from Turks.” H.M. Government and Ibn Saud as a Potential Danger in the Trucial Area. 163. On 7th August the Political Resident telegraphed to the Government inter alia that*— “ At any rate for a long time to come the Porte can exercise no control whatever over Ibn Saud and that meanwhile he is in a position to give a varying deal of inconvenience alike in regard to Oman, the Trucial Coast and Katr, which inconvenience an innocuous modus vivendi, arranged if necessary with the knowledge of the Porte, would obviate. It is not a question of any desire to interfere in the politics of Central Arabia. Ibn Saud is now at the coast, and for us it is a question of a new menace to our interests in the Gulf sphere which we need either to sterilise or protect ourselves against.” Views of Government of India. 164. The Viceroy on 10th August in a telegram commenting on the general situation, and urging a modification in the policy hitherto adopted by H.M. Government, said that— “ It is clear from his [Ibn Sand’s] relations with the Sheikh of Katr and the recent reports as to the apprehensions of the Trucial Chiefs that Ibn Saud is becoming a more and more prominent factor in the politics of the Persian Gulf littoral, and has thus brought himself within the sphere of our interests and influence. As long as Ibn Saud confined himself to A1 Hasa he could be ignored with impunity. Such a policy, however, cannot in our opinion safely be pursued now that there is a possibility of his inter ference in El Katr, with the Trucial Chiefs, and possibly in Oman, where the rebellion may give him an opportunity for encroachment on Muscat territory Unless we come to some mutual and amicable under standing with the Amir, who has hitherto been friendly disposed to us, the probability is that we shall force him to adopt an attitude of permanent hostility, which cannot but react unfavourably on the Chiefs of the littoral. We therefore strongly advocate not any definite treaty with the Amir, but a friendly interchange of views in which we should intimate to him that we expect him not to interfere with the territories of Chiefs with whom we have treaty or other relations on the Gulf littoral. We see no reason why if this were done with the full knowledge of the Porte, to whom our intentions could be clearly explained, there should be any risk of offending Turkish susceptibilities or raising their suspicions. We might warn the Trucial Chiefs seriously against any provocative action against the Amir, but instead of assuring them of immunity from him, which is only likely to encourage them to assume a truculent attitude towards him, we might tell them that our relations with the Amir are such that their fears of aggression on his part are groundless.” Views of H.M. Government. 165. H.M. Government on consideration agreed generally with the Govern ment of India, and on the suggestion of the Secretary of State for India, Hakki Pasha was also informally told that H.M. Government owing to the death of the Sheikh of Qatar and subsequent events must in order to carry out their obligations make Ibn Saud either their friend or their enemy; that they could not afford to S. of S. to Vic., 6.8.13, P. 3157/13.

In September 1913 Ibn Saud, in reply to the Resident’s letter of 9th July (paragraph 159 above), asked for a clearer explanation of the British attitude. Sir Percy Cox intimated on 11th September 1913 that it was somewhat difficult to give the explanations desired without fuller information as to Ibn Baud’s wishes. He suggested a meeting, and added :— “Meanwhile, I have my Government’s authority to assure you that, pro vided you undertake on your part to abstain from all action calculated to disturb the status quo, or to create unrest, among the Arab Principalities whose rulers are in relation with the British Government, including the Principality of Katr, the independence of which under the Government of the late Sheikh Jasim and his successors of the Bin Thani family has been recently recognised by the British and Turkish Governments, the British Government will continue to maintain the friendly relations which have been sustained in the past.” Attitude of Turkey: October-Becember 1913. 167. On 2nd October the Foreign Office intimated that a reply had been received from Hakki Pasha to the communication referred to in paragraph 165 above, in which the Porte expressed their thanks for the friendly offer of H.M. Government stated that they were actually in negotiation with Ibn Saud, and added that if the necessity should arise for recourse to the good offices of H.M. Government the Porte would not fail to avail itself of them. 168. On 15th December the Ambassador at Constantinople reported that the Turkish Government had intimated that they proposed to recognise the recent fait accompli in Nejd by nominating Ibn Saud A1 Mutasarif of the district. Discussion between A ding Political Resident, Captain Shakespear, and Ibn Saud: IfSth December 1913. 169. Endeavours were made to arrange a meeting between the Political Resident and Ibn Saud towards the end of 1913, and on 16th December Major Trevor and Captain Shakespear met Ibn Saud and had an exhaustive discussion with him. The following points are taken from a memorandum of the interview which was read over to Ibn Saud and in the terms of which he concurred :— “His family, he said, had been in Nejd from time immemorial and had for generations ruled over it without interference from outside. He himself was an Arab chief, whose views on matters of policy naturally differed from those of European powers. Bedouin tribes are not concerned in weighing the merits of different governments, as they live as nomads and when oppressed move off to another locality In recent years he had been able to consolidate his authority in Central Arabia and has now taken Hasa and Q ati f AH l^ wants is to be left in peace and he sees that the British Government keeps the peace all along the coasts of the Persian Gulf, except in this small section of the coast of the Hasa province. If he could get an assurance that the British Government would maintain the maritime peace on this strip of coast and recognise his position as de facto ruler he would be satisfied. If not, he would have to trust in his own sword In the discussion which followed Ibn baud said he would be glad to co-operate with the British Government in the suppression of piracy and the illicit arms traffic and in the maintenance of the maritime truce and would also agree not to interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast and to admit British subjects and representatives in his territory, provided that the British Government would give him the assurances mentioned above. In fact, he went further than this and said he would be willing to consult the British Government in all matters if he received these assurances. We again repeated that it was quite impossible to give him any such assurance. In the course of his remarks Ibn Saud pointed out that though he claimed I rucial Oman and Qatar as part of his ancestral dominions and couldmake his power felt there, he was quite willing to meet the wishes of the British Government in regard to them. He hinted that the only reason which restrained him from overrunning Qatar and possibly Trucial Oman after he had occupied Hasa and Qatif was his desire not to alienate the sympathy of the British Goverment. 5 ’ 170. In a separate memorandum the negotiators recorded that Ibn Saud, after the discussion on the subject of arranging a modus vivendi had been con cluded, enquired the policy of the British Government “ in regard to Qatar and the Trucial Oman States. We said that we could not make any definite pronouncement on the subject, but that as a general rule, as far as we were aware, the policy of the Government was one of non-interference in internal matters. In the case of the Trucial Sheikhs we had certain agreements of long standing regarding the maritime truce, the slave trade and arms traffic, to which we held the Sheikhs, but we did not as a rule interfere with their rule on shore. As regards Qatar we translated to him the clause referring to that region in the recent Anglo- Turkish Convention and said that we assumed the British policy there would also be one of non-interference It proved that Ibn Saud’s enquiry was due to the possibility that enemies of his might take refuge in some of these States and plot against him, and he enquired what the attitude of Government would be in regard to such cases. 55 The negotiators were unable to state definitely, but promised to refer the matter to higher authority. “ He was apparently satisfied with this, but urged that the matter was important to him as affecting his authority over the adjacent Bedouin tribes. At any time in order to check the intrigues of such people, it might be necessary for him to take reprisals, and this might involve him with the British Government, which he was anxious to avoid. 55 The nego tiators recorded that Ibn Saud had also said £ ‘ in a more informal manner that he would not interfere in the politics of Qatar and the Trucial Coast States. 55 Views of Political Resident. 171. Mr. Lorimer, in forwarding this report, suggested the desirability, in the event of a mutual arrangement being reached between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, of disposing of the question of his relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and Trucial Oman and that of the control of refugees from his authority who settled under their protection. “These questions arise from Ibn Saud’s own position as an Arab chief and do not concern the Turks. It might be arranged with Ibn Saud, on condition of his not entering the territory of the said Sheikhs without our consent, that we should use our influence to prevent or restrain refugees whose conduct in their chosen places of residence is shown to be injurious to Ibn Saud’s legitimate interests. 55 172. Endeavours were meanwhile proceeding in London to assist in the reaching of an understanding between the Turks and Ibn Saud. A memorandum drawn up by Sir Percy Cox and communicated to Hakki Pasha on 9th March 1914 remarked that our requirements of Ibn Saud for the maintenance and protection of our interests included intev alia that he should not meddle in the territory or politics of Arab principalities in the Gulf, including the Trucial Coast and Qatar.” Hakki Pasha replied that he must refer the matter to his Government, and the Resident was instructed to inform Ibn Saud that H.M. Government were endeavouring to effect an arrangement with the Turkish Government and to warn him not to act independently. The Ambassadoi in Constantinople on 2nd April 1914 urged the desirability of watching the situation and awaiting further developments, the Turkish Government having intimated that they had a strong hope of coming to a settlement themselves. Treaty of \bth May 1914 between Ibn Saud and Turkey. 173 On 15th May 1914 a treaty (the original of which was found during the war among Turkish records at Basra) was concluded between Ibn Saud and the Turkish Government. The text of the treaty is reproduced m Appendix A. It will be seen that it proceeds on the basis that Ibn Saud is a Turkish subject and vassal.Aitch. XII, Xo. i, pp. 42-3. P. 3683/14, 3848/14.

Government concluded a further Convention (ratified on 3rd June 1914) with Turkey, which provided that the line separatingV British and Turkish Spheres in South-Western Arabia should rejoin dans le Euba-al-Khali, sur le parallele 20°, la ligne droite et directe vers le sud qui part d’un point sur la rive meridionale du golfe d’Oudjeir et qui separe le territoire Ottoman du sandjak de Nedjd du territoire d El Katr en conformite de 1’article 11 de la Convention anglo-ottomane du 29 juillet 1913 relatit au Goile Persique et aux territoires environnants.” 174a On 4th June 1914 the Foreign Office, the news of the conclusion o± the Ibn Sand treaty with Turkey not yet haying been made public, strongly urged the importance of avoiding any action which might lend colour to suspicions that H.M. Government were supporting Ibn Saud’s policy of^ making himself independent,” and in the same connection referred to him as a Turkish subject and specifically recognised as such by the Anglo-Turkish p£ nVentl0n +-m 29th July 1913. Sir E. Grey is, in fact, convinced that it would not be compatible with our engagements that Ibn Sand should be treated otherwise, or t at independent communications with him should be held except m cases where they cannot be avoided.” Summary, 1901 to 1914. 175 From the above it will be seen that Ibn Saud, emerging as the repre sentative of The Saudi family and capturing Riyadh from Ibn Rashid m 1901, by 1913 had consolidated his position in Nejd, and in the same year drove the Turks out of Hasa. His repeated overtures to H.M. Government between 1901 and 1913 with a view to securing their protection against the Turks had no result. In May 1914 he accepted the position of Turkish Wall of Nejd and concluded an understanding with a duly authorised Turkish representative, the basis of which was that he was an Ottoman subject and lieutenant of the Ottoman Porte in this area. y. F rom the outbreak of the Great War to the opening of the Blue Line Discussions, 1914-1934. British Offers to Ibn Saud in return for his Co-operation. 176 The importance of securing the support of Ibn Saud and the Arab Rulers of the Gulf (or, at any rate, of preventing them from giving active support to the Turks) in the event of war with Turkey was patent; and H.M. Government decided that Ibn Saud should be informed that, in return for his co-operation in the eviction of the Turks from Basra, H.M. Government would be prepared to recognise him as independent Ruler of Nejd and Hasa, and enter into treaty relations with him, and to guarantee him against attack by sea. Ibn Saud’s Response. 177. Ibn Saud on the outbreak of war took the field against his rival, Ibn Rashid, and used his preoccupations in this quarter as an excuse for refusing the Turkish request for active military support against the Allies. It proved impossible to pursue discussions with him as to an understanding on the lines referred to in the preceding paragraph until the end of 1914, when Captain Shakespear, on the instructions of H.M. Government, met and discussed the position with him. Ibn Saud intimated that he was entirely on the British side and that he would commence verbal negotiations on the subject of the offers made him by H.M. Government in the near future. In a letter to the Political Resident of 28th November 1914 he referred to the British promise of recognition of his independence as ‘ ‘ Her recognition of the independence of my Chief ship of all the parts of Nejd, El Hasa and Katif.” Ibn Saud’s terms, January 1915. 178. In January 1915 further discussions took place between Ibn Saud and Captain Shakespear. The Amir’s attitude was that being ultimately dis appointed of British intervention on his behalf in April 1914, he was obliged to come to an understanding with the Turks sufficient to secure his immunity from their aggression. He was now anxious for a signed treaty giving him a solid guarantee of his position under the aegis of Great Britain. If the treaty was not soon concluded, force of circumstances might drive him to give some overt demon stration of his intention to side with the Turks. On the other hand, once it was.concluded he would use all his resources and influence on our side. He proposed a draft. ^ 179. The following are the portions of the draft submitted by Ibn Baud, which bear on the question of his boundaries and of his abstention from inter ference with the territories of the Arab proteges of H.M. Government:— “ (1) That the British Government will acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa, Katif, their surroundings and the ports appertaining to them on the shores of the Persian Gulf are to me and (are) the territory of my fathers and forefathers; that I am the independent ruler of them and after me my sons and their descendants by inheritance; and that the above-mentioned territory is an independent territory in which there is no (right of) inter ference by any Foreign Power; “(2) That they (the British Government) will declare its (the territory’s) boundaries north, south, east and west, by land and by sea, and that (regarding) the nomads who wander between neighbouring towns, which are either under British protection or (directly) under British Government, if there should arise differences between me and the Chiefs of the said towns and complaints be made in (these) matters, they should be decided according to the ownership of fathers and ancestors ” 180. Captain Shakespear, in his letter forwarding this draft, remarked that the addition to our responsibility did not appear heavy. The Turkish menace from the west and north of Nejd, though very real to Ibn Baud, need give us no anxiety; and while we should probably be called upon to act as arbiters somewhat more frequently than hitherto between Arab Sheikhs along the coast and Ibn Baud, this was a duty largely to the advantage of our own interests. 181. Sir Percy Cox saw no special difficulty as regards the clauses referred to in paragraph 178 above, but remarked, as regards protection against external aggression by land, that, “ apart from the Turks, Central Arabia is practically inaccessible by land to any power but ours, and I venture to think that we should incur little risk by giving the desired undertaking, subject to the reservation that aggression be unprovoked.” Views of Government of India. 182. The Government of India pointed out that Ibn Baud’s proposals involved many matters of detail which would require lengthy consideration, and suggested that we should aim at concluding a treaty on broad lines for the moment, accompanied by an undertaking to conclude, as soon as this could conveniently be arranged, a detailed treaty in regard to other matters outstanding. They suggested that the guarantee of independence should be to the effect that “the British Government recognises Ibn Baud as independent ruler of Nejd, Hasa and Qatif, and guarantees hereditary succession to his dynasty ” H.M. Government approved, but (on the proposal of the India Office) suggested that the new treaty should also “ contain a clause binding Ibn Baud, subject to eventual definition 'of boundaries, not to interfere with Koweit, Bahrein, El Katr and the Trucial Chiefs.” There is nothing on record to show the precise object of the reference to a subsequent delimitation. 183. Discussions were pursued on this basis between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Baud in April 1915. The British draft and the draft submitted by Ibn Baud on the points now under consideration were then as follows :— British Draft. Ibn Sand’s Draft. Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa and Qatif, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the territory of Ibn Baud and his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Baud as the independent Euler thereof, and after him his sons and descen dants, etc Article I. The British Govern ment do acknowledge and admit that Nejd, El Hasa, Qatif, Jubail, their dependencies and territories, which will be discussed and determined here after, and their territories and ports on the shores of the Persian Gulf are the countries of Ibn Baud and of his fathers before him, and do hereby recognise the said Ibn Baud as indepen dent Euler thereof and as absolute chief of their tribes, and after him his sons, etc To P.R., 4.1.15, No. S. 13.

Its terms are of some interest as showing^ the extent at the time of Ibn Sand’s tribal claims. The agreement provided “ that Nejd and all the interior from A1 Kahaf to the valley of Duwasir and all territories of Ibn Saud and the encampments of Matair, Ataiba, Harb, Bani Abdulla, Ajman, A1 Morra, A1 Manasir, Bani Hajer, Sabia, A1 Sahul, Qahtauf, and A1 Duwasir, and everybody included among them, are subjects of Ibn Saud. I, Ibn Rashid, have nothing to do with them ” Treaty of ^th December 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud. 186. After further discussions between Sir Percy Cox and Ibn Saud, a treaty P.R. to G. of was finally signed on 26th December 1915. The Saudi draft of Article I, as set I., No. 35 0., out in paragraph 183 above, was accepted. It appeared that the reason for the Saudi version was that Jubail was the locality where Ibn Saud’s limits on the coast approached those claimed by Koweit, and that for that reason he wished to have it specified. As it was well outside the boundary accepted by H.M. Govern ment for Koweit in their negotiations with the Turks, Sir Percy Cox saw no objection to its acceptance. 187. In the case of Article VI, the Saudi draft, with a very slight verbal modification, was accepted. In its final form it ran as follows :— “ Ibn Saud undertakes, as his fathers did before him, to refrain from all aggression on or interference with the territories of Koweit, Bahrain, and of the Sheikhs of Katr and the Oman coast, who are under the protection of the British Government and who have treaty relations with the said Government, and the limits of their territories shall be hereafter determined.” The words “ other chiefs and tribes ” proposed in the original British draft quoted in paragraph 183 above were omitted in deference to Ibn Saud’s state ment that the several chiefs whom we did protect and had relations with were all mentioned, so that the words in question seemed unnecessary. 188. In Article VII, -which provided that a further detailed treaty should be concluded “ in regard to other matters jointly concerning ” the British Govern ment and Ibn Saud, Ibn Saud successfully pressed for the omission of the word “other.” He pointed out that some of the matters such as boundaries were among those already alluded to in the present treaty, so that there seemed no need to say “ other.” 189. From the above it will be seen that it was H.M. Government who them selves suggested the inclusion in the treaty of a provision for the subsequent determination and definition of the boundaries of the Persian Gulf States, our special relations with which Ibn Saud undertook to respect. Construction of Articles I and II of Treaty of 1915. 190. During 1916 Sharif Husain of Mecca wrote to Ibn Saud asking for an alliance and assistance. This overture was reported to Sir Percy Cox by the Amir of Nejd, who expressed mistrust of the Sharif’s intentions. As a result, Sir Percy Cox recommended on 8th September 1916 that Ibn Saud should be39 ^ i n ^9 rme( ^ definitely that no present or future understanding between us and tfie Sharif would prejudice our adherence to the terms of Articles I and II of our ^reaty with him of 26th December 1915.” He was instructed in reply that “ as the policy of encouraging an Arab State or confederation of States was not dead, anything repudiating it should be avoided,” and that “ reference to the treaty should be confined to Article I, as we could not admit that Article II was binding on us against other Arabs.” A verbal assurance on the lines indicated appears to have been given to Ibn Saud by Sir Percy Cox at Koweit on 21st November 1916. 191. The Foreign Office in a memorandum drawn up about this time Special 7. remarked that the wording of Article I of the treaty in effect “ commits us to arbitrate on the territorial questions at issue between Ibn Saud and King Husain, and in the last resort to impose an effective sanction for our award.” Agreement of 1922 with Ibn Saud on Koweit Boundaries. 192. In 1922 an agreement was reached with Ibn Saud, who in that year Aitch. XII, overthrew the Rashid, in regard to the boundaries of Koweit. The agreement No, ^ 1 ii ’ referred in terms to the boundaries accepted by H.M. Government for that pp ‘ principality in the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 29th July 1913, but by agree ment between the two parties and with the subsequent concurrence of the Sheikh of Koweit, it varied those boundaries in favour of the Saudi ruler. Summary, 1914 to 1922. 193. During this period Ibn Saud in 1915 concluded a treaty with H.M. Government, in which the latter recognised him as the independent ruler of Nejd, and he undertook not to interfere with the territories of their Arab proteges. By 1922 he had finally defeated and captured the representative of the Ibn Rashidi family. In the same year he entered into agreements under which he received certain concessions in the Koweiti hinterland, and by which the boundaries of Koweit, Nejd and Iraq were delimited. 1922-1934. Ibn Saud warned to respect Qatar, 1922. 194. In November-December 1922 Sir Percy Cox, finding that Ibn Saud proposed to include the whole of the peninsula of Qatar in a concession for oil in the Hasa district which was then under consideration, intimated to him that this could not be accepted and that he had nothing to do with Qatar except to respect it under the terms of his Treaty with us, and insisted on the limitation of his discussions to country west of the longitude of Salwa Bay. Sir P. Cox is stated by Colonel Dickson, who was present, to have drawn on a map a line running from Djau-ed-Dukhan to Dohat-as-Salwa, which, he indicated, must represent the Eastern boundary of any concession granted by Ibn Saud in respect of Hasa. The Sultan accepted this injunction without argument. The line in question, it may be remarked, cuts across the Blue Line, which was never men tioned in the discussions. Sir Percy Cox has ^ince stated that, to the best of his recollection, nothing took place in his discussion with Ibn Saud which would prevent His Majesty’s Government from claiming the Blue Line as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia. Bagdad, to Gr. of I., 19.1.23. See Pol. Dept. Memo, B. 430/P.Z. 614/34. Reassertion of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman and at Baraimi, 1922-34. 195. In 1922, when Sheikh Sultan bin Zaid murdered and succeeded his brother, the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, he found that the authority of his family in Baraimi, where it had been predominant since 1870, had fallen to a low ebb; and p 0 i. Res. the Beni Naim of Baraimi were engaged in conflicts with Abu Dhabi. In June to C.O., 1925 it was reported that the Awamir and the Dam had appealed to the Wahabi 9 - 6 - 26 - Amir of Hasa to protect them from Abu Dhabi, and in the same month it was reported that the Amir had sent an official to collect zakat in the Baraimi oasis, who was generally, but not invariably successful. This official also arrested and hanged a Hasawi refugee in Baraimi and notified the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi and Debai that the Amir of Hasa had taken the Awamir and Dam tribes, who were fundamentally Muscat subjects, under the protection of the Sultan of Nejd.Pol. Res. to G. of L, 137 S., 30.4.27, P. 3996/27. 40 Anti-Wahabi combinations in Oman, 1925. 196. In July 1925 it appeared that the Sheikhs of the Beni Naim, Beni Khatib and the Beni Kaab had been negotiating with Shargah for mutual assist-f &gt; ance in the event of aggression by the Wahabis, and in August 1925, after a conference between Dibai and the Imam of the fanatical Ibadhi tribes of the hinterland of Muscat, it was agreed that the two should support one another against the Wahabis. Further Wahabi activity, 1925-26. 197. In December 1925 a letter received by the Sheikh of Dibai from the Amir of Hasa contained a serious threat against the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. In February 1926 the Amir of Hasa appears to have sent police to Shargah in pursuit of a Nejdi criminal. He was not found there and the police proceeded to Ajman and Bas al Khaimah. The man escaped detection. It was reported at the same time that Nejdi slavetraders were bringing negroes and war captives to the coastal towns for sale, and that the Trucial Sheikhs were afraid to interfere with them. In March 1926 the Amir of Hasa sent two officials to collect zakat in Dhafra and Baraimi, and in two judicial cases about this time is stated to have written first to the Kazi of Shargah and secondly to the Sheikh of Dibai “ chiding them for not satisfying Nejdi complainants. The Kazi sent his son to Hofuf to express regret.” Views of Political Resident, 1926. 198. The Political Kesident expressed the view in 1926 that the region of Dhafra some 14,000 miles square, which stretches 175 miles from west to east and 80 from north to south, bounded on the north by the Persian Gulf and on the south by the Rub al Khali, belonged, with three smaller coastal tracts to its west, historically and de jure to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The first business of the Wahabis, if. they were to establish themselves in Eastern Arabia, must be to absorb this region. East of it they would have little difficulty in procuring the adherence of the people of Baraimi, Haffit and Dhahiran, on account of the antipathy of some for Abu Dhabi and of others for the Ibadhi fanatics of the Muscat hinterland. He added that the kazis in all the chiefships except Abu Dhabi and Dibai were actually Nejdis. 199. The Resident stated that the tribal situation was that Abu Dhabi and Dibai were wholeheartedly opposed to Ibn Sand, and were followed by the Beni Yas and Manasir of Dhafra, Mijan, Akal, and the Dhawahir of Baraimi, Umm al Qaiwain, the Beni Khatib tribe and the Beni Kaab were inclined to be neutral. Shargah and Ras al Khaimah had a century earlier been bigoted Wahabis. Trucial Oman and the Wahabis, April 1927. 200. A further report by Sir Lionel Plaworth in the spring of 1927 confirmed that Dibai and Abu Dhabi were opposed to Wahabism and had no desire to come under the sway of Ibn Saud, and stated that Ras al Khaimah and Shargah were closely sympathetic to the Wahabis, and that with them there might be bracketed the lesser chiefs of Ajman and Ummal Qaiwain. “ The latter four chiefs were actually Wahabis some hundred years ago, and are already in private communication with the Wahabi leaders.” Position at Baraimi 1927-34. 201. The oasis of Baraimi was, the Resident reported, occupied by three different sections of Arabs, the Naim, in close touch with Muscat and with no desire to be absorbed by the Wahabis; the villages belonging to the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, partly occupied by the Dhawahir, and equally anti-Wahabi; and the El Shamis, a branch of the Naimi, in close touch with the chiefs of Ras al Khaimah and Shargah and strongly Wahabi in tone. “ The Baraimi section of this tribe have recently paid willing tribute to the Wahabi agent of the Governor of Hasa, who came to Baraimi, and they would encourage the extension of Wahabi power.” Of these sections, the first were the strongest and their chief occupied the fort at Baraimi. It will be seen that the pro-Wahabi element was in a minority and did not in 1927 occupy the fort, and this is of importance in estimating the weight to be attached to the payment of zakat to the Wahabis by Baraimi.202. Later in the same year, however, the Baraimi Sheikhs, apparently « acting under the influence of Ibn Baud’s agent, and possibly apprehensive that the presence of the Wazir of Muscat, Mr. Bertram Thomas, portended aggressions by the Sultan, or that the establishment of a landing ground was likely to be a threat to their independence, refused to allow an R.A.F. party to reconnoitre the oasis. For convenience it may be recorded at this stage that despite this incident, however, no interference with the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhs by Ibn Sand’s agent for Baraimi was reported in 1928-1931. In 1932, a cousin of the Sheikh of Baraimi having been ambushed by Bedouin consisting of Abu Dhabi subjects and Manasir tribesmen, hostilities broke out between Abu Dhabi, Baraimi and Dibai. Peace was restored after three months’ fighting. It may be noted that there appears to have been no interference in this dispute by any representative of Ibn Saud and that the parties fought it out among themselves without any outside interference. There is no record since that date of Saudi interference; and in July 1934 that Ibn Saud had no agent at Baraimi, although his zakat gatherers sometimes went as far East as this point, “where, however, they do not press for fixed rates, but take what is given to them.” The Resident stated that the Awamir and Manasir had for the last four or five years paid zakat to Ibn Saud (having at an earlier stage paid it to Ibn Dhabi). No zakat was paid him by the Trucial Sheikhs. 203. The supplementary treaty envisaged by Article 7 of the Treaty of 26th December 1915 (para. 188 above) was never, in fact, concluded, nor was any supplementary agreement entered into with Ibn Saud on the matters then under discussion, with the exception of the agreement regarding the boundaries of Koweit referred to in paragraph 192. The treaty of 1915 held the field until 1927. The Treaty of Jedda, 1927. 204. In that year, after lengthy negotiations, a fresh treaty was concluded with Ibn Saud at Jedda on 20th May. H.M. Government, concerned by the activities of the Amir of Hasa, to which reference is made in paras. 195-201, decided to aim at the embodiment in any new treaty of the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty of 1915, binding Ibn Saud to respect the position of the Arab Sheikhdoms in alliance with H.M. Government, despite the fact that Ibn Saud had since the date of that treaty grown greatly both in strength and in international stature. They accordingly included that Article as Article 6 in a new draft treaty, acceptance of which by Ibn Saud their negotiators were to endeavour to secure. 205. The instructions to the negotiators remarked that the draft reproduced “the provisions of Article VI of the treaty of 1916 save that no reference is made to the question of determining the limits of the territory mentioned. H.M. Government have given careful consideration to the question whether Ibn Saud should be invited to refrain from aggression on the Rulers of the Persian Gulf Coast. It appeared to them doubtful whether in practice such an engagement would effectively deter Ibn Saud if he were determined to absorb some petty neighbouring Arab State. Moreover, H.M. Government did not wish to commit themselves to recognise the extent of Ibn Saud’s domains or to protect territories outside those domains, but would have preferred to remain free to take what action they considered necessary in each particular case, having regard to the precise nature of their relations with the principality concerned and to other relevant circumstances.” In view, however, of the recent instances of interference by the Amir of Hasa, referred to in paragraphs 195-201 above, H.M. Government “ came to the conclusion that if Ibn Saud were not asked to reassume the obligation imposed upon him by Article VI of the treaty of 1916, he might infer that they would not oppose any interference by him with the integrity of the Rulers in question and would thus be encouraged to extend his influence in South-East Arabia. ... If, however, Ibn Saud should finally prove unwilling to agree to reassume the obligation in the new treaty, you should inform him that H.M. Government hold themselves free to take what action they consider necessary in particular cases.” P.R. to G. of L, 181 S., 29.5.27, P. 3404/27. P.G. Ad. Reports, 1928-33.

Jedda to F.O., 26.1.27, P. 494/27. 206. Ibn Saud raised no objection to the draft Article, subject to the substitution of the words “ maintain friendly relations with ” for the words^ “ to refrain from all aggression or interference with,” and the omission of thel* words “or under the protection of the Government of His Britannic Majesty.” His grounds were that the earlier wording was not compatible with his dignity as an independent Ruler, aod more particularly that the term interference seemed to him to be capable of too wide an interpretation. The terms of the Article as finally agreed were as follows :— “His Majesty the King of the Hedjaz and of Nejd and its Dependencies undertakes to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Koweit and Bahrain, and with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast who are in special treaty relations with His Britannic Majesty’s Government.” Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-1914 not communicated to Ibn Saud in 1927. 207. It may be recorded in this connection, as a point of some importance, that Ibn Saud, in connection with the discussions which culminated in the Treaty of Jedda, asked for a statement of the treaty engagements of H.M. Government with the rulers whose special treaty relations with them he undertook under Article 6 of that treaty to respect. The list of engagements with which he was furnished did not contain the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913-14. Ibn Saud informed that H.M. Government continue to regard the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as binding on him. 208. It is unnecessary to examine in any detail the events between the Treaty of Jedda and 1934. Towards the end of' 1933 the question of the continental boundaries of Saudi Arabia was raised in an active form by the application of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to be allowed to negotiate for an oil concession in Qatar on behalf of the Iraq Petroleum Company, and by uncertainties as to the Eastern boundary which had been set by Ibn Saud to the oil concession he had granted in respect of Hasa. In connection with this, the Sheikh of Qatar and the United States Government were officially informed in the spring of 1934 that H.M. Government regarded the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention (para. 150 above) as the eastern boundary of Nejd, and as a matter of courtesy the Saudi Government were informed that, enquiry as to the boundary position having been made by the United States Embassy at Angora, a communication in this sense had been made to them. Ibn Saud subsequently intimated that he did not accept the Blue Line as binding upon him, and that he preferred ancestral claims to the territory to the east of it. It is now accepted that the question of his eastern continental boundary is one on which further discussion will be necessary in the near future between him and H.M. Government. f If .. VI. -Conclusion. 209. The history of the relations of the Wahabi Amirs with Trucial Oman, Muscat and with the British Government is given in detail above. It may be convenient, in conclusion, briefly to summarise the position and to touch upon certain of the more important general questions bearing on the difficulties which have arisen in connection wffth the Blue Line and the claims made in that connection by Ibn Saud. I.—General Historical Survey. 210. It will be seen that the Wahabi sect originated in Nejd in the early part of the eighteenth century; that by the end of the eighteenth century it had conquered Nejd and Hasa; and that between 1800 and 1818 it established a commanding influence in the hinterland of Trucial Oman, the headquarters of its agent being in forts built by the Wahabis at the oasis of Baraimi—a strategical point of first importance on the borders of Trucial Oman and the Muscat Sultanate. The Wahabi influence came to an end, and Baraimi was lost, with the defeat of the Wahabis of Nejd and Hasa by the Egyptians and the capture and execution of the Wahabi Amir in 1818.211. On the revival of Wahabi power in 1824 overtures were again made by f the Wahabis to the Tracial authorities. By 1831 those overtures had produced a considerable effect. By 1833 Baraimi had been reoccupied, and Wahabi influence appears to have been as powerful in Trucial Oman and its hinterland as it had been in the period prior to the defeat of the Wahabis by the Egyptians. The Wahabi agent at Baraimi appears to have been maintained there until he was driven out by the local tribes about 1838. Between 1837 and 1839, the Egyptians again overcame and destroyed the Wahabi power. They made endeavours, with the assistance of a former Wahabi agent at Baraimi to secure the allegiance of the Trucial Sheikhs. These, and the Beni Naim chiefs of Baraimi who now held the oasis, which they had recaptured from the Wahabis in 1837-38, were encouraged to resist by H.M. Government, and the efforts of the Egyptians ended in failure. 212. On the withdrawal of the Egyptians in 1840, and a fresh revival of Wahabi power, endeavours were again made in 1842-3 by the Wahabi Amirs to re-establish themselves in Trucial Oman. Baraimi was surrendered by the Naim in 1845 and between that year and 1853 Wahabi influence was to a large extent re-established. 213. Between 1853 and 1869 the Wahabis continued to maintain an Agent at Baraimi. His influence was, however, much less than before, and there are fewer signs of Wahabi influence in the affairs of the Trucial Sheikhdoms or their hinterland. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir, who appears to have paid a tribute to Turkey since 1840, claimed to be a Turkish subject (paragraph 105 above) and in 1866 he appealed unsuccessfully to Turkey for help against Her Majesty’s Government (paragraph 92 above). In 1869 the Wahabi Agent at Baraimi was murdered at Shargah, and in the same year the Sultan of Muscat captured Baraimi, in alliance with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. Meanwhile, the Wahabi ruling family, which had since 1865 been internally divided by disputes regarding the succession, were expelled from Hasa by the Turks. They were unable to take steps to re-establish, themselves to Trucial Oman, and by 1879 their influence was reduced to Riyadh. Baraimi came under the influence of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and so remained for the next 50 years. 214. From 1875 to 1901 the Saudi family are of merely local political importance. Cut off from the coast and confined to the centre of Arabia their influence is of the smallest and does not extend to Trucial Oman or its hinterland. The principal power in Nejd at this period is the Amir Ibn Rashid of the Jebel Shammar, a Turkish vassal. 215. The Saudis, under the present Saudi King, in 1901 attacked Ibn Rashid. The history of Central Arabia for the next 15 years is that of the struggles for supremacy between the Rashidi and Saudi families, culminating in the victory of the latter in 1922. Between 1901 and 1914 repeated overtures were made by Ibn Saud to H.M. Government with a view to securing their protection against the Turks. These were invariably declined. In May 1914 he reached an under standing with Turkey under which, as a Turkish subject and a Turkish vassal, he was appointed Amir of Nejd. 216. On the outbreak of the war Ibn Saud was approached both by the Turks and by H.M. Government. He alleged his preoccupations with Ibn Rashid as an excuse for not co-operating actively with the Turks but did not repudiate his allegiance to them. In 1915 he concluded a treaty with H.M. Government under which he undertook to respect their special relations with the Sheikhs of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, Muscat and the Trucial Coast, whose boundaries should thereafter he delimited, and thereafter he co-operated with them. The treaty of 1915 regulated relations between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud until 1927. 217. Throughout this time there were no signs of any importance of Wahabi advances in Trucial Oman or its hinterland. In 1925-26 emissaries from the Wahabi Viceroy of Hasa were reported to have been moving in the hinterland, to have approached the Trucial Sheikhs, to have reached Baraimi and to have .collected zakat from the tribes (paragraphs 195 to 201 above). The matter was not regarded as of great moment and no special steps were taken to deal with it, the affairs of the hinterland being at that stage of no concern to H.M. Government. But when the Treaty of Jedda of 1927 replaced the Treaty of1915, stops were taken to include in it a provision that Xbn Sand would respect the territories of the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Oman Coast which were in special treaty relations with H.M. Government. \ 218. Information accumulating since 1927 goes to suggest that Ibn Saud, as the result of the general prestige which he has achieved, and his authority with the Bedouin of Central Arabia, is becoming increasingly a power in the Trucial hinterland and even as far east as Baraimi. H.M. Government have adopted the attitude, both in the Persian Gulf and in dealing with the King, that the eastern boundary of Nejd is the eastern boundary represented by the Blue Line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, and that they cannot acknowledge any Saudi authority to the east of that line. This contention is vigorously con tested by Ibn Saud, partly on the basis of what he describes as ‘ c his ancestral claims.” II.—Points of Special Interest. 219. The following are certain of the main points of interest in this connection :— (A) Policy of H.M. Government 1800-1934. (B) Extent to which H.M. Government are committed by Treaty engagements with the Wahabis: 1800—1934. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs and their relation to the Wahabis : 1800 to 1934. (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd : 1800 to 1934. (E) History and position of Baraimi: 1800 to 1934. (F) Extent to which Ibn Saud and the Wahabi Amirs in the pre-War period were Turkish subjects or vassals. (G) The legal position. (A) Policy of H.M. Government, 1800-1934. 220. It will be seen that from 1800 to 1920 the policy of H.M. Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf was consistently to avoid any interference in the affairs of the hinterland. In the early part of this period they were solely concerned to make the seas safe for commerce; to put down piracy; and at a slightly later stage to suppress the slave trade. As time went on and the strategic importance of the Gulf area, particularly from the Indian stand point, became greater, they consolidated their relations with the rulers of Bahrein, Koweit, Qatar, and Muscat, and with the Trucial Sheikhs. 221. Their relations with the Wahibi Amirs in the period 1800 to 1870 were on all fours with their relations with the other rulers of this area. Once the Wahabi Amirs established themselves on the sea coast they became a matter of concern to H.M. Government, who were, however, content to abstain from all interference with their activities in the hinterland save to the extent that these might react on the position of the other maritime rulers of the Trucial area and so lead to piratical outbreaks, the revival of slavery, or the absorption of Muscat or Bahrein. They had no treaty relations with the Wahabi Amirs, and their com munications with them (apart from formal representations or demands for reparation for injuries committed at their instigation or by their subjects or vassals) were confined to polite exchanges of letters. The one formal engagement given in the period 1800 to 1870 is a unilateral undertaking given on behalf of the Wahabi Amir in 1866. 222. From 1870 to 1901 H.M. Government pursued their policy of con solidating their position on the littoral. In the period 1901 to 1913 they repeatedly refused to involve themselves in liabilities towards Ibn Saud. In 1913 they reached an agreement with Turkey in which the eastern boundaries of Turkish influence in Arabia were delimited. Their endeavours at the outbreak of the Great War to secure the co-operation of Ibn Saud against the Turks were successful, and in 1915 they concluded a treaty with him as an independent ruler, under which he undertook to respect the territories of their Arab allies. 223. Supplementary agreements were concluded with Ibn Saud after the war to regulate the boundaries of Koweit and Iraq, and the treaty of 1915 was replaced in 1927 by one less favourable to H.M. Government. Since 1925 the'growing power of Ibn Sand and the reassertion of Persian influence by sea, the development of air communications, the transfer of the air route to India and ^he East to the Arab littoral of the Gulf, the discovery of oil on that littoral, the tact that international oil agreements make it difficult to exclude foreign exploitation, have combined to make it necessary to take a more active interest in the affairs of the Trucial Coast, and more difficult to ignore the position in its hinterland; in the case of Qatar it has been necessary in the interests of securing that an oil concession shall be under British influence to offer the Sheikh guarantees of protection by land; and the importance of setting a limit to Wahabi expansion in the hinterland has been held to justify the positive challenge to the position of Ibn Saud represented by the intimation to him that the Blue Line of the 1913 Convention is his Eastern boundary. (B) Engagements of H.M. Government with the Wahabis between 1800 and 1930. 224. The Treaty of 1915 was the first formal engagement concluded by H.M. Government with the Wahabis. In 1810 friendly letters were exchanged between the Wahabi Amir and the Government of Bombay (paragraph 26 above). In 1813, similar letters were exchanged, and again in 1814 (paragraphs 28-30). In 1820 (paragraph 32) reference was made to the existence of an earlier Anglo- Wahabi Treaty. In 1831 the Wahabis (paragraph 53) expressed a desire for the renewal of ‘ £ the treaty .... which was made between you, the British and Imam Saud.” No such treaty could be traced, but a friendly letter was sent in reply to the Wahabis (paragraph 54). In 1843 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 98) expressed a desire for the renewal of the amicable relations which had existed between his father and the British Government, and a suitable reply was sent. In 1855 (paragraph 105) on the Amir being warned that the British Government regarded the Arab tribes on the coast as independent powers, the Amir referred to an understanding “between us and the British Government of 100 years' duration for the security of traders and travellers passing on the seas.” No reference was made in reply to the contention that such an understanding existed. In 1850 the Amir (paragraph 106), endeavouring to justify himself for his attacks on the Sheikh of Bahrein, alleged that “between the Wahabi Amir and the British Government treaties have been made by the several authorities, authority after authority,” and referred to his treaties with the Turks. The reply sent to him took no notice of this point. 225. In 1865 Colonel Pelly, then Political Resident, visited the Wahabi Amir at Riyadh. It was repeatedly subsequently alleged that some undertaking was then entered into by the Resident with the Wahabi Amir. There is nothing to support this (paragraphs 110-111). Subsequent to the visit, the Amir (paragraph 113), in reply to a protest against the activities of his Lieutenant at Baraimi, alleged that there existed between the Wahabi power and the British Government an agreement originally effected in the time of the late Saud and again ratified in the time of the then ruler. No trace of any such document or agreement could be found, and on the point being raised with the Wahabi envoys by Colonel Pelly they replied (paragraph 118) “ that the Wahaby Amirs had from time to time received friendly letters from the British authorities, and that the Wahabi Government considers a friendly letter to be synonymous with a treaty agreement” (1866). On 21st April 1866 a Wahabi representative volunteered the declaration recorded in paragraph 117 above. This was a unilateral declaration. 226. It will be seen that, if the Wahabi declaration of 1866 is left out of account, there is no foundation for any suggestion that any treaty or agreement, whether affecting the Trucial Sheikhdoms or the hinterland, was concluded between the Wahabis and ELM. Government between 1800 and 1870. Nor was any engagement subsequently entered into until the formal treaty of 1915 between H.M. Government and Ibn Saud, now superseded by the later Treaty of Jedda of 1927. No Saudi argument in regard to the Blue Line or the territorial limits of Saudi Arabia can thus be based on any engagement concluded prior to 1915 by H.M. Government. It is, on the other hand, a legitimate argument on the Saudi side, and one which they have not neglected, that no reference was made to the Blue Line in the lengthy discussions which preceded the conclusion of the Treaties of 1915 or 1927, and that the Anglo-Turkish Conventions were not communicated• s ;i 46 to them on the occasion of the latter treaty; though it is no doubt open to H.M. Government to argue, on the other side, that while as the result of their breach with Turkey they were prepared to ignore the Blue Line, and, as proposed on tb initiative of H.M. Government, to agree to a subsequent territorial delimitation, the Blue Line, which was internationally legally binding, must be the starting point of any discussions designed to bring about a modification. (C) Status of the Trucial Sheikhs, and their relation to the Wahabis: 1800 to 1934. 227. H.M. Government, without consultation with or any protest by the Wahabi Amir, in 1806 entered into an agreement with the Jowasimi Sheikh of Basal Khaimah-Shargah for the suppression of piracy (paragraph 24 above). In 1820 (paragraph 34) they entered into a general maritime treaty with the predecessors of the present Trucial Sheikhs. They have maintained those treaty relations since that date and have supplemented them by engagements, either with individual rulers, or with the Trucial Sheikhs generally, regarding slavery and piracy in 1838 (Ajman, Debai, Abu Dhabi, Shargah); 1839 (Ras al Khaimah); 1843 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1847 (all Trucial Sheikhs); 1853 (all Trucial Sheikhs), 1864 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Debai, Umm al Qaiwain); 1868 (Abu Dhabi and Qatar); 1873 (Shargah, Abu Dhabi). In 1887 they secured &lt;c exclusive agreements” from the Trucial Sheikhs, which were confirmed and strengthened in 1892, since when control of the foreign relations of these sheikhdoms has rested with H.M. Government. Further undertakings were obtained from the Trucial area in 1902; 1911-12 (pearling and sponge-fishing concessions); 1912 (Shargah- Tamb light-house); 1922 (oil). The treaty of 1820 and all subsequent treaties were entered into with the Trucial Sheikhs as independent States, and H.M. Govern ment, in so far as they have found it necessary to apply forcible pressure to the Sheikhs to ensure their compliance with the engagements accepted under those treaties, have done so without reference to, protest by (save in 1883^—paragraph 46 above), or the prior sanction of, any other power. 228. Since 1823 H.M. Government have (paragraph 36) been locally repre sented by a native Agent, with headquarters at Shargah, of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Since 1932 the Trucial Coast has informally been placed under the supervision of the British Political Agent at Bahrein. The history of the period since 1800, as recorded above, illustrates the close contact consistently maintained with the Trucial Coast by the Resident, which inevitably arose from the obligations by the Sheikhs and by H.M. Government under the Maritime Truce of 1820 (paragraph 34), and the subsequent engagements by which it was supplemented. 229. The historical survey above goes to suggest that between 1800 and 1870 the Trucial Sheikhs (but Abu Dhabi to a much less extent than the Jowasimis of Shargah), were for considerable periods under a large, though not consistently an effective, degree of Wahabi influence, if not control. But the important division in the area seems to have been that between the religious factions of the Hinawis (represented by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat) and the Ghafaris (represented by the Jowasimi Sheikh); the minor Sheikhs of Ajman and Umm al Qaiwain, who normally co-operated with Shargah-Ras-al Khaimah, and of Dibai, who normally co-operated with Abu Dhabi, changing sides according as one or other of the two major Sheikhs seemed likely to assume a dominating influence. Wahabi influence declined in this area after 1853 and disappeared altogether, save as a purely religious movement, after 1870. It appears to have revived only in the period subsequent to 1920. The long breaks in the continuity of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman apart, it can fairly be maintained that the Trucial Sheikhs have throughout, in continental as well as in maritime affairs, been independent political entities, even if some of them were negligible in size, and if most, if not all, were by land responsive to or entirely under the influence at various times of the strongest neighbouring power, whether that power was Muscat or the Wahabi Amirs. It seems difficult in any event for Ibn Saud to base any substantial claim to suzerainty over these sheikhdoms or their immediate hinterland at this stage, merely on the broken record of Wahabi influence in Trucial Oman during the period between 1800 and 1870, or on its revival in the period subsequent to 1920, at a date when he had by formal treaty engagements undertaken to respect the independence of these States.47 leikhof In 'iti tie e treaty isr witli and limai); seildis), Dhabi elusive thened rested n ucial •gai- i ovem- tothe r those :aph48 i repre- [esicieiit i placed story of sistently &gt;se from laritime h it was inM isifflisoi tently an division Hinawis and its jiananil mall, and ardingas appeal s to havf onrt [that tl* e affa^ 0 in size influence &gt;wer ffas d to base ^mediate uence in a liB* (D) Extent of Wahabi control in the area to the east of Nejd from 1800 to 1934. 230. From the historical statement above it will be seen that this has varied wery greatly, both in degree and in area, and that there are considerable gaps in its continuity. From 1800 to about 1815 it appears to have been a fairly substantial control, less marked in the case of Abu Dhabi, extending as far east as the boundaries of Muscat and largely exercised from Baraimi. The same is true of the period 1831-33 until 1836, or possibly as late as 1838. From 1845 to 1853 Wahabi influence is again marked over the same area as before. From 1853 to 1869 it underwent a steady decline, and from 1869 until 1923 it is practically non-existent, though the Sheikhs react quickly to the fortunes of the ruler of Nejd (cp. paragraphs 134-5, 148, &amp;c.). At that point there are definite signs of revival, though, even so, the Trucial Sheikhs are divided among themselves, Abu Dhabi and Dibai being opposed, like Muscat, to any such revival; Ras al Khaimah and Shargah inclined to sympathise; and the remainder neutral. In the hinterland of the Trucial Sheikhs Wahabi influence appears to extend in an informal fashion as far east as the oasis of Baraimi, a minority of the tribes occupying it having paid zakat ; while Mr. Bertram Thomas and other travellers report that the Al Murra tribe of the Central Arabian Desert also defer to it. 231. The main test of the existence of this influence is the payment of zakat by tribes or rulers. No payments are now made by the Trucial Sheikhs, who, how ever, exchange presents with the Amir of Hasa. The local political authorities positively state that this payment is, in fact, a form of danegeld or blackmail, and does not connote any political subjection. C£ The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear aggression from Ibn Sand and try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy, and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affecting his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing, and merely indicate that for the moment Ibn Saud is sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance.” (E) History and position of Baraimi. 232. Baraimi was in the past the only important Wahabi settlement in the Trucial area. The oasis of which it is the centre is well watered, fertile and strategically of great importance, since it commands the approaches into the Sultanate of Muscat. It was captured by the Wahabis in 1801, and from that date to 1869 was the headquarters of their representative in Eastern Arabia, with intervals during which it passed out of Wahabi control from 1818, or slightly earlier, to about 1833; from 1838 to 1845; and in 1848-9. In 1869 it was captured by the Sultan of Muscat, and appears never since to have been reoccupied by the Wahabis. Its forts are at present held by the Beni Naim, who appear to be hostile to the Wahabis, though a minority of the tribes who occupy the oasis were reported in 1924 to have paid zakat to the Wahabi tax collectors. It will be seen that there is this, no history of continuous Wahabi occupation, and that the oasis has not been under effective Wahabi control since 1869. (F) Extent to which the Wahabi Amirs and Ibn Saud have in the past professed allegiance to Turkey. 233. The Wahabi Amirs were decisively defeated in 1818 by the Egyptians, and the Wahabi Amir himself executed at Constantinople. On the revival of the Wahabi power in 1824 and for some years afterwards, the^then Amir Turki appears to have paid tribute to the Viceroy of Egypt, and to have endeavoured to represent himself to the Viceroy (though not locally in Arabia) as the Viceroy’s agent (paragraph 37). They were again decisively defeated by the Egyptians in 1837-39, and the Wahabi Amir taken prisoner to Cairo. He was released by the Egyptians and returned to Nejd in 1842. From 1839 to his death in 1865, it would appear (paragraph 90) that the Wahabi Amir paid tribute to Turkey, though, at any rate in the latter part of this period, through the Turkish authorities at Mecca.48 (cp. paras. 141, 148, 160.) 234. In 1855 the Wahabi Amir professed (paragraph 91), in writing to be a Turkish dependant, and stated that he had made it clear to Mehemet AA when the latter approached him in 1837 with a view to securing his co-operatioi^' against the tribes of eastern Arabia, that he could do nothing without the approval of the Sultan. In 1859 the Wahabi Amir, again m writing, referred to treaties concluded in the past between him and the Sultan of Turkey. In 1866 the Wahabi Amir (paragraph 92) made overtures, apparently almost simultaneously, to Great Britain and the Turks. But the overtures of his envoy were ultimately rejected by the Turkish Wali of Baghdad. 235 In 1871 the Turks were called in by the Amir Saud, who subsequently became the head of the Wahabis. The negotiations between tlie Saudis and the Turks in the 10 years which followed appear consistently to have proceeded on the basis that the Wahabi Amirs, in return for Turkish support to enable them to re-establish themselves in Nejd and possibly Hasa, were prepared to accept Turkish suzerainty. In 1890 they professed their obedience to the Turkish authorities (paragraphs 122, 124, 125). Ibn Rashid, by whom they were finally defeated in 1888, and who, from 1876 to 1901, was the leading ruler m Central Arabia, consistently professed allegiance to Turkey. Between 1901 and 1913, Ibn Saud, while continually endeavouring to secure British protection and British assistance against the Turks, on various occasions appears to have submitted to Turkish authority (see in particular paragraphs 132, 133, 146, 147), to have drawn allowances from them for his father or himself (paragraph 137, but see paragraph 148), and to have settled disputes on behalf of Turkey (paragraph 146). In May 1914, abandoning hope of active assistance of H.M. Government, he concluded a treaty as “Wali and Commandant of Nejdwith the Wali of Basra, “who was specially empowered by imperial iradeh,” the text of which will be found in Appendix A, and which Is only consistent with Ibn Sand’s full acceptance of the status of a Turkish subject and official. It may be noted, too, that on the outbreak of the War, Ibn Saud did not repudiate allegiance to Turkey, but gave as an excuse for his failure to lend armed assistance to the Turks that he was engaged in hostilities with Ibn Rashid, while at the beginning of 1915 he hinted to H.M. Government that, failing a satisfactory written understanding with them, it would be necessary for him to make overtures to the Turks. 236. The true position is no doubt that, throughout the whole of this period, the Wahabi Amirs, solely concerned with their own interests, were prepared to give a formal acknowledgment of Turkish suzerainty or to pay a nominal tribute to Turkey if by doing so they could be assured of non-interference by Turkey in their concerns. From one standpoint it would be unreasonable therefore to attach Undue importance to the acknowledgments of suzerainty constituted by the series of incidents referred to above. But it is on the other hand open to H.M. Govern ment in any dispute in which they may be concerned with Ibn Saud in which that ruler claims that he and his ancestors have for the last century been the indepen dent rulers of Nejd and Hasa, and that he is not the successor in title of the Turks in those areas, should take advantage of the very frequent and consistent reiterations of Wahabi allegiance to Turkey over almost the whole of the period. (G) The legal position. 237. On the limited issue of the continued validity of the provisions affecting the Blue Line and the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 (paragraph 150) and 1914 (paragraph 150 A above), the Foreign Office, at an earlier stage, expressed the view that the Blue Line remained internationally legally binding as against Ibn Saud. On the wider question of what precisely H.M. Government are legally F.O. to I.O., entitled to maintain as against the King in regard to the Blue Line, they have 31.8.34. since expressed the interesting and important opinions : — {a) That there is reason to believe that the territory immediately east of the Blue Line, on the assumption that neither H.M. Government nor any Arab State under their protection exercises any authority there, is at present either res nullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. (b) That “ while we are perfectly justified to use the Blue Line and the position of Ibn Saud as the successor of Turkey, &amp;c., as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most accept-able frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal deciding the matter on legal principles if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the Blue Line was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatar, a British protected principality, or, if it was res nullius, whether Ibn Baud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescription if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.” India Office, 1st September 1934.

Boundaries of the Trucial Sheikhdoms (Lorimer, 1905). Trucial Oman, being the area at present occupied by the Trucial Sheikhdoms (excluding Qatar), runs in the Persian Gulf from the Khor al Odeid in the West to Sha’am in the East and in the Gulf of Oman from Khor Kalba to Dibah, the places named all being included in it. Inland on one side, it is bounded by a line of uncertain course which runs from a spot between the contiguous villages of Dibah and Bai’ah on the East coast to Pas Shaam on the West coast, and so divides it from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate to the North; on another by a line even more indeterminate, which leaves the Gulf between Khor Kalba and Murair and after partially crossing the promontory in such a way as to exclude the Madadhah and Jan districts to the South, is eventually lost in South Khatam; West of Khatam the inland limit of Trucial Oman is at the commencement of the Ruba al Khali and the Jafarah deserts. The existing Trucial Sheikhdoms are Abu Dhabi, Debai, Sharjah, Ajman, Umm al Qaiwain, and Pas al Khaimah. The rulers of those principalities in 1820 signed the Trucial Treaty with His Majesty’s Government (together with Hussein bin Ali, Sheikh of Zyah, and Hasseiii bin Rahman, Sheikh of Hatt and Folna, and ex-Sheikh of Pas al Khaimah, whose Sheikhdoms no longer exist). The boundaries (omitting mention of insular possessions) of the Trucial Sheikhdoms as laid down in Lorimer’s Gazetteer (1905) are as follows :— Lor. II, 405. A lu Dhabi.—'From Khor al Ghanadhah on the East to the Khor-al-Odeid (the northern shore of which inlet should in Lorimer’s view, perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories) on the West—a distance of over 200 miles. “ Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined : it is asserted that on the East they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in; and on the South they may presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba’ al Lor. II, 264. Khali. A regular tribute was paid to Abu Dhabi by the Dhawahir, £&lt; who are numeiically a majority in Baraimi, though Baraimi was itself independent.” Lor. II, 454.

II 1757. x mm ”^'Q a ^ wa ^ n on West coast, and of a part of the interior which is virtually independent, it may be considered to embrace everything between a line Aitch. Yol. XII, pp. 245-9.joining Sha’am to Dibah on the North, and another connecting Sharjah Town and Khor Kalba on the South. On the East it is bounded by the Gulf of Oman, **®and on the West by the Persian Gulf.” Its boundary with Ajman is at a place called Dabdabah, 2^ miles from the North end of the date groves of Sharjah Town; and with Dibai at Abu Hail. Inland, Sharjah proper “does not, it is stated, extend beyond Wasit, a Lor. II, locality 5 miles East of Sharjah Town, the tract between this and Dhaid not being 1757 ~ 8 - under the Sheikh’s control.” The detached oasis of Dhaid is administered through a Wali. Aj man .—“ The authority of the Sheikh only extends 2 miles inland, and, upon the sea, miles South-West and 2-| miles North-East, embracing on the last-mentioned side part of the tract called Zora : his dominions are thus an enclave in Shar j ah territory. There is no dependent village, and no Bedouin tribe Lor. II, 53-4.

The Sheikhdom ‘ ‘ has no clearly defined boundaries, but it forms an enclave in Sharjah territory. On the coast it reaches North-East to Jazirat-al-Hamra and South-West part of the way to Hamriyah : the Siniyah island formed by Lor n Khor-al-Baidhah is thus included in it.” Falaj A1 Ali (or Falai), about 16 miles 1474-6.’ South-East of Umm-al-Qaiwain town and perhaps 8 miles North-West of Dhaid village, is the only place of importance not on the coast which belongs to Umm-al-Qaiwain. Ras-al-Khaimah .—At the date of compilation of Lorimer’s Gazetteer Ras-al- Khaimah was under the control of Sharjah and constituted the Northernmost district in that principality. It has since again become an independent state. It is described by Lorimer as “ divided from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of the Oman Sultanate on the North-East by a line which runs obliquely from Ras-ash- Sha’am on the West coast of the promontory to a point between the village of Dibah proper and Bai’ah on the East coast. On the West, from Ras-ash-Sha’am on the North to the South end of Jazirat-al-Hamra on the South, it is bounded by the sea; and thence by a line, of which the course is indefinite, drawn across the desert to the Southern extremity of the Jiri Plain. The South-East limit is an imaginary line connecting the South end of Jiri with the East coast at a point immediately south of Dibah.” The town of Dibah and village of Wamm were at the date of Lorimer’s Gazetteer exempt from the jurisdiction of the Deputy Governor (on behalf of Sharjah) and held in fief by a Wali who was first cousin Lor. 11,1007. of the Sheikh of Sharjah.\r' With reference to the C.I.D. meeting on the 13th on the subject of relations with Ibn Saud and particularly the question of the Blue Line, the following are some comments of mine in so far as the Persian Gulf area is concerned. (I have already given my views in more detail in my letter, No.594-S of 20th June last.) 2. The Persian Gulf coastal territory east of the Blue Line can be divided into three areas. (a) Jafurah - the area immediately south-west of Qatar. This contains two hamlets, Sakak and Anbak. Each consists of 8 or 9 reed huts with a few palm trees. The inhabitants of this area, chiefly the A1 Morrah, pay tribute to Ibn Saud (Colonel Loch 1 s report, paragraph 2). (b) The territories of the Trucial Sheikhs. The Sheikhs pay no tribute to Ibn Saud, but now and then give him courtesy presents. (c) This consists of the hinterland of (b). The Monasir tribe of one section of this area, Dhafurah, for the last four or five years have paid tribute/tribute to Ibn Saud (paragraphs 5 and 6 of Colonel Loch^s report). (d) Baraimi. For many years past the Wahabis do not appear to have kept a Resident Agent at Baraimi, and as long ago as 1904 (see Gtrrri'gendum orrF.Z.5124/34 to my letter N0.594-S), the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi captured it from the Beni Daim: i.e. from the local tribes, not from the Wahabis. (e) Territory of the Shaikh of Oman. There is no question of any Wahabi claim in this territory. 3. Since Ibn Saud exercises no regular rule over the Persian Gulf territory east of the Blue Line, (such as, for instance, he exercises up to that Line in the province of Hasa).his claims to any part of that territory depend on the tribute which he extracts from it. On the subject of such tribute, please see paragraph 7 of my letter No.594-S. 4. There seems to be some doubt as to our exact legal position in regard to the Blue Line. I suggest that it might be worth while to get the opinion of the Law Officers of the Crown on this question: not that I think we should necessarily adhere to the strict letter/* : letter of the law in our dealings with Ibn Saud, but it might be as v/ell to know exactly what the letter of the law was. 5. With regard to Ibn Saud* s desire for a comprehensive understanding with H.M.G., with a view to settling all outstanding questions,, ^s far as the Persian Gulf is concerned I think such an understanding would be an excellent thing. One of the most important outstanding questions is the Koweit blockade, and Ibn Saud*s treatment of this question would probably be an »acid test* of his sincerity in seeking H.M.G.*s friendship. 6 .

Previous PapersMinute Paper Department 2621 GOOD 3 34 It 'will be remembered that the Blue Line is a line drawn south from a point opposite the island of Zakhuitfjra to the SOth parallel of latitude (where it meets the Violet Line between what was formerly Turkish-Arabia r ' ■ and the British sphere of influence in south-western Arabia). The Blue Line was laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 and was adopted by the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914. The F.O. (d.o.letter of 16 March,P.Z.1823/34), after djssussion with their Legal Advisers, advised that the Blue Line was perfectly valid from the point of view of internation al law n .so that we should be on strong legal ground in maintaining that it still marks the boundaries between Saudi Arabia, as one of the Ottoman succession states, ^ and the territories in south-eastern Arabia, with which H.M.G. are in special treaty relations 11 . On the basis of i this opinion the official Middle East Committee on 23 March last agreed that H.M.G. must take their stand on this line as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud f s territory. After correspondence with Sir A. Ryan, a note was addressed on 28 April by the latter to the Saudi Government making it clear that H.M.G. regard the Blue Line as still operative. The Sheikh of Qatr was also informed in writing that this had been done. 2 0 Ibn Saud has taken strong exception to the claim that the Blue Line constitutes the eastern boundary of his dominions. The Saudi point of view is set out in the note and statement from Fuad Hamza of 20 June enclosed with Sir A. Ryan’s despatch of 27 June (Flag A). The Saudi Government hold that the boundary should be i discussed and settled by agreement. . Sir A. Ryan a J personally sympathises with their point of view. He doubts/doubts the juridical validity of the Blue Line. The Saudis are able to make the point that it was not * x mentioned in our treaty with Ibn Saud in 1915 (which provides for subsequent discussion of boundaries) or in the Treaty of Jedda, 1927 ( Art.6 of which might be held to imply that Ibn Baud’s dominions are co-terminals with those of the Sheikhs of Qatr and the Oman Coast). Sir A. Ryan also lays stress on the political consequencei which this question may have on our relations with Ibn Saud, who naturally attaches the highest importance to it. In this connection please see paras. 12-19 of Sir A. Ryan’s interesting note of 30 July on Anglo-Saudi relations (Flag B). 3. The Saudi Government have recently put out feelers in regard to a general rapprochement with H.M.G. with a view to the establishment of closer relations and coordination of general policy. Fuad Hamza’s first approach in this direction led to a visit by Sir A. Ryan to Taif on 12-14 July for conversations with Ibn Saud himself. The record of these conversations is at P.Z.5549/34 (top paper on the lower file). While there can be no question of an alliance with, or military commitment to ; Ibn Saud, it would undoubtedly be an event of great importance and advantage to H.M.G. if they could come to an entente cordiale with him by which all outstanding causes of dispute could be settled to the mutual satisfaction of both sides and the friendship between the two powers could be publicly reaffirmed. The I.0.accordingly suggested to the F.O. that the instructions sent to Sir A. Ryan prior to his conversations should not tend unduly to discourage Ibn Saud’s advances. The F.O. accordingly included the passage marked in para.2 of their/I 1 y ’■'f Minute Paper. Department. 'D 2621 6000 3 34 3* . cJ' PL &amp;n it Ulwl J their telegram of 10 July, Err.463C^(Flag CJ. It is to be hoped that on Sir A. Ryan's return from his present leave further negotiations may take place with a view to exploring the possibility of an entente or general settlement of outstanding disputes, 4, This turn of events ought to be taken into account in considering our future attitude on the question of the Blue Line, Another new point of some importance is that the F.O. Legal Advisers now take a different view of the legal position from their previous view on which the conclusion of the Middle East Committee on 23 March was based. Their present view is expressed in Mr, Beckett's minute of 29 August enclosed with F.O. d.o.letter at the top of the file. What it amounts to is that though the Blue Line was the eastern boundary of Turkish Arabia, and consequently of a//territory held by Ibn Saud as successor of the Ottoman Empire, nevertheless he may, since the disappearance of the Turks, have acquired some degree of sovereignty or overlordship in territory to the east of the Blue Line whi©h was a res nullius . It may also be noted that Ibn Saud claims that his ancestors acquired such sovereignty, in which they were independent of the Turks, and that he has inherited their rights, Mr. Laithwaite has made an exhaustive research into the history of the Wahabis and prepared a memo, (which is being printed and will be submitted) discussing the validity of these ancestral claims and also the present position. His memo, should prove very useful in considering the line to be taken in the eventual negotiations with Ibn Saud. 5. Meanwhile Fuad Hamza is visiting London and will be/rt—■—i -I f A be calling on the F.O. in the latter part month mth a view especially to some discussio^ of, the Blue Line. H.M.G. f s attitude in regard tothis' has hitherto been that Ibn Saud must first, in jirinciple, accept the Anglo-Turkish Convention as binding'on him .ft. as successor to the Turks; in other words, we* have claimed that the Blue Line should be the basis of discussion. Ibn Saud refuses to agree to this^and a deadlock is threatened. In any case it will be desirable that substantive negotiations should not take place with Fuad Hatftza, but should be left to Sir A. Ryan on his return to Jedda. This would incidentally 'give us time to obtain an authoritative opinion on the legal aspects, if necessary by a reference to the Law Officers, in order to make sure where Y^e stand before entering on negotiations. Meanwhile, however, it may be desirable not to take quite so stiff an attitude with Fuad Hafrza. It is a question whether we might inform him (without in terms mentioning the Blue Line) that H.M.G. will be prepared, in due course, to discuss the question of the eastern frontier of Ibn Saud 1 s dominions in the hope of arriving at an agreed settlement. Such a statement to Fuad Hal&amp;za would not estop us, when the time came, from continuing to take our stand on the Blue Line, if, in the light of further legal aavice and of the relative political considerations this is decided on as the best course. 6. It is possible that a further meeting of the Middle East Committee will be held on Thursday or Friday next week to consider the line to be taken with Fuad Hamza, having regard to the new opinion of the F.O. Legal Advisers. It is submitted that, subject to the course ♦ of the discussion, the I.0.representative might make the suggestion at A above.

CORV SENT BY A!R MAfL 2 8 SEP 1934 . COPY SENT BY A!R MAIL $Clcb,; £&gt; My dear Gilbert, Many thanks for your letter of the 20th August enclosing copies of correspondence with Ryan about the Blue Line. 2. We have now got Beckett’s viev/s on the legal points raised by Ryan in paragraphs 13 to 15 of his memorandum of the 30th July, and I am able to send you a copy of Beckett’s minute. Beckett had previously advised on the question of the validity of the relevant provisions in the 1913 and 1914 Anglo-Turkish Conventions, having regard to the fact that only the 1914 Convention was ratified. He had not hitherto given a considered opinion as to what precisely we were legally entitled to contend in regard to the Blue Line, as against Ibn Saud. You will see that Ryan’s qualms, are, in Beckett’s view, to some extent, justified. 3. On one point, I had a word with Beckett after I had seen his minute, viz. his endorsement, in paragraphs of the minute, Ryan’s view that the Treaties of 1915 and G. Laithwaite, Esq&lt; 1927/1927 with Ihn Saud ,f appear to proceed on the basis that Ibn Sand’s territories and those of the Sheikhs of Qatar, etc. are coterminous,'(which had surprised me). Beckett said that he might possibly have over stated the case on this point; but that in any case if we were not prepared to contend that the territory immediately to the east of the Blue Line fell under the sovereignty of the Sheikhs of Qatar, etc. our case is much weaker. Prom a legal point of view, he holds, as you will see, that the 'British sphere of influence cock will not fight at all.^ 4 » 7 -A- . /./ 4 -t ^ .‘‘t ^ V-t &gt; n •«* ■ *► - » ■ - I am glad of the opportunity to read all these papers and to consider the question of the blue lind in ius legal aspects in the light of the much fuller information than was before me on any previous occasion. L We start from the position that Turkey, by the treaty of 1914, article 3, which adopted article 11 of the treaty of 1913, accepted the blue line as the limits of TurKish sovereignty in this part of the Arabian peninsula. Prom this it is clear that to the extent that Ibn Saud is the successor of the old Ottoman Empire in this part of the world and must base his claim on such succession, the blue line represents the limits of the territories which he acquired as Turkey’s successor. I see that he was disposed to take the view that, even in 1913-1914 Turkey was not the sovereign in this part of the world, that he was already then an independent power and that Turkey’s treaties were invalid because she was dealing with territories over which she had no sovereignty. This argument is, of course, disposed of by the treaty which Ibn Saud himself concluded with Turkey on the 15th May, 1914, which I see recorded in the memorandum attached to E.4451. 2. The foregoing however only amounts to this, as successor of Turkey he could not claim beyond the blue line, and he certainly was the successor of Turkey. But this is by no means the same thing as saying that Ibn Saud cannot, since that date, have acquired a sovereignty beyond the blue line, or that His Majesty’s Government possess sovereignty right up to the blue line on the other side, or that any sheik under their protection does so. 3 . ...The subsequent questions for consideration fall substantially into two classes: (a) the question whether th oar subsequent treaty negotiations with Ibn Saud His Majesty’s Government have waived or lost any right tnat they may otherwise have possessed to hold Ibn Baud’s territories to be limited by the blue line, and (b) wnether, even if an affirmative answer is not returned to (a), it must be admitted that a substantial portion Oi. the territory east of the blue line is res nullius 1 and therefore as such(i) open to acquisition by occupa tion on the part of Ibn Saud, and (ii) not being under the sovereignty of His Majesty’s Government or within the territory of any sheikh’s under their protection, is an area where His Majesty's Government have no legal right oo ooject to steps being taken by Ibn Baud in the direction of acquisition of sovereignty by occupation, even if he has not at present done sufficient to acquire a definitive title. 4. It must be remembered that under international law territory is either under the sovereignty of a member of the family of nations, or it is not; if it is not, then it is open to acquisition by occupation by another power. Spheres of influence in international law, whatever their political significance, mean nothing at all. If a state admits it has not sovereignty over a territory, but only claims a sphere of influence overf it, then apart from treaty obligations binding particular powers not to enter the sphere of influence eoc. legally any other power can go there and take steps to make itself sovereign. I am well aware that from the-.political point of view spneres of influence ray have great importance. It may be a ground upon which representations may be made to another state that its action in going chere is provocative and unfriendly, and that it mast not be surprised if their action provokes the resentment and retaliaticnwhich may follow upon provocative and unfriendly, but nevertheless perfectly legal, acts. Legally a sphere of influence Is of no effect at all unless you have a specific treaty with uae Pcwer who is entering the zone, under which the latter has specifically undertaken not to do so. 5. The secona point to be remembered is that Under international law, to use the words of Huber as arbitrator: 'Territorial sovereignty cannot be limited uo ics negative side'. Sovereignty over territory cannot consist in a mere right to keep other states ou+ '' when tne -Spj, sovereign exercises no authority whatever there. if this is the position, then even if' toe spi dlsant sovereign had originally a perfectly sound title, he will lose it if another state enters territory and de^jractp. exercises authority there for a sufficient period, and this acquires a prescriptive right.D . / 1 'W) 7. On these grounds I think that the territory immediately east of the blue line is at present either Heg-ijullius or (conceivably) in parts already under the sovereignty of Ibn Saud. 8. The second part of the case against His Majesty's Government when they seek to maintain that the blue line represents to-day the limits of Tbn Saud's dominions (b.s opposed to those which he could claim as successor to Turkey) is based upon the subsequent agreements and negotiations with him in 1915, 1922 and 1927. It is true, as Sir A. Ryan states, that the agreements of &gt;( 1915 and 1927 appear to proceed upon the basis that Ibn Baud's territories and those of the Sheikh of Qatr etc. are co-terminous, i.e. that-there is no vacuum between them, but this seems to me to be an argument which cuts both ways, though of course it does dispose of any case built up on a British sphere of influence as opposed to territory belonging to the dominions of the Sheikh of Qatr. But from the legal point of view, the sphere of influence argument was clearly hopeless in any case, and any substantial use of it seems to be merely an admission of weakness on cur part and a virtual giving away of any legal case that we may have. It is, of course, an argument against His Majesty's Government that in negotiating the 1915 agreement no mention whatever is made of the blue line. It is not by any means conclusive, because the agree ment of 1915 proceeds on the footing that the boundaries of....of Itrn Saud on one hand and Qatr on the ether are all to be delimited by agreement. The most that can be said is that the 1915 agreement appears to proceed on the assumption that in the future delimitation by agreement the criterion should be the areas over which ' Ibn Baud and his predecessors and the Sheikh of Qatr etc. possessed in the past, and this rather suggests that we did not think the blue line agreement with Turkey was necessarily to be relevant. This is, of course, net conclusive, because it may well be that Ibn Saud and his predecessors could not really establish claims on past history to territory crossing the blue line or even coming anywhere near it, and we would not put the blue line into the agreement because we were not then-prepared to admit that he could establish a claim that even went as far as this. I doubt very much if the 1927 treaty carries the matter any further. The 1922 agreement relates to an area which is so far distant from the blue line that it can hardly be said to be directly relevant at all. The most that can be said about it is that the frontier with Koweit there agreed upon is quite different from that laid down in the treaty with Turkey of 1913 and once again the arrange ments with Turkey do not appear to have been taken as the basis for fixing the new frontiers. The argument alone is not, I think, very conclusive, but is, of course, a straw which acquires some force when added to other indications of the same kind. More nearly relevant are the lines drawn by Sir Percy Cox in 1922 at Uquari actually in the areas concerned (E.1512, para.’I' of the India...1 \ •) 7. India. Office memorandum). Sir Percy Cox drew a. line indicating what he considered then to be Ibn Sand’s limits, which follows quite a different course from the blue line, and this is perhaps a rather strong indication that the 1915 agreement with Ibn Sand did not mean the blue line to be relied upon when the frontier delimitation contemplated by that agreement was taking place. 9. The conclusion to be drawn from all this is that, while we are perfectly justified to use the blue line and the position of Ibn Saud as a successor of Turkey etc. as much as we can in negotiating with Ibn Saud in order to secure the most acceptable frontier possible in wording future agreements, I do not think we should win before a tribunal, deciding the matter on legal principles, if the issue was whether the area immediately east of the blue line was a part of the territory of the Sheikh of Qatr, a British protected principality, or if it was res nullius , whether Ibn Saud was free to acquire territory by occupation or prescription, if he could produce evidence of the state of affairs necessary to support such a claim.

As regards the 'Blue Line', the Koweit ■blockade and the question of the Bahrein transit dues, ,we suggest that they should he discussed at interdepartmental meetings, at which Ryan and, if possible, Fowle should be present. For a variety of reasons,including Fowle’s absence in Ireland, we propose that these meetings should be held early in September. As you know, we have agreed to discuss Saudi matters informally with Fuad Bey Hamza, if he comes to England. But we understand from Sheikh Hafiz Wahba that he is unlikely to do so before mid-September at earliest and we have indicated to the Sheikh that it would be more convenient for us if he came towards the end of next month.

U’zr^q^j (C) Position of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 12. The list of outstanding questions in section (A) above is less formidable than its length would suggest. The general relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Sand have, in fact, improved materially in the last three years. They are now threatened more seriously by the “ blue line ” than bv any other subject of difference. 13. I cannot personally believe in the undoubted legal validity of the “ blue line. It appears to me that in 1915 and in 1927 His Majesty’s Government were content to treat Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat and Oman as conter minous with Ibn Sand’s dominions, whatever the boundaries. So far as Qatar is concerned, it seems to me that the AngTo-Turkish Convention of 1913 itself proceeded on that assumption, and that the “blue line” was conceived as an arbitrary boundary between Qatar territory and Nejd. When it was recently decided not to assert the sovereignty of the Sheikh of Qatar so far west, I myself preferred the expression “ British sphere of influence ” to the expression “ Qatar sphere of influence ’ ’; but I do not think it can be seriously maintained that Great Britain has a sphere of influence in Eastern Arabia, except in the sense that her influence extends to the coastal principalities up to their territorial limits, what ever these may be. 14. It appears to me further that the Anglo-Saudi Treaty of December 1915 destroyed the validity of the “ blue line ” by substituting a new criterion for the determination of Ibn Sand’s boundaries. He was to be recognised as independent within his ancestral limits. These limits may conceivably have lain west of the “blue line.”. This appears to be Colonel Fowle’s latest contention, but I have not seen his paper on the subject. The limits may have lain east of the “ blue line,” as Ibn Saud contends, invoking in support of his claim the proceedings of the Felly mission, the records of which I have not seen either. My point is that the 1915 treaty imposed on His Majesty’s Government an obligation to accept the ancestral limits in due course as determining the boundary and implied that the coastal principalities extended up to this boundary. I have toyed with the argument that the treaty of 1915 imposed limitations on Ibn Baud’s sovereignty and that the treaty of 1927, which removed those limitations, again altered the whole position and re-entitled His Majesty’s Government to rely on the “blue line,” on the ground that Ibn Saud was no longer negotiating as a rebel against Turkish authority, but as the ruler of a succession State. 15. This argument, however, carries no conviction in my own mind. If it corresponds with what His Majesty’s Government believed to be the position in 1927, they might well have been expected to make it clear, instead of which they made no reference to the “blue line,” and again treated the coastal principalitiesas though they were Ibn Baud s neighbours. The argument would be stronger, if it could be shown that when the Nejd—Koweit frontier was redrawn in 1922, Ibn Baud explicitly admitted the validity of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as a starting-point, but I have no record in Jedda of the negotiations regarding the Nejd-Koweit boundary. 16. Whatever the legal position, the political considerations are of much greater moment. I am convinced that Ibn Baud will never admit that the Turks had any right to dispose of territories over which, he affirms, his Arab ancestors rulea, and which had, in his view, been simply usurped, partly by the Turks and partly by Ibn Rashid. Hatred of the Turks is in his blood, and he will accept no position, however sustained by legal argument, which rests on an ex post facto recognition of their rights. One might as well expect Mr. de Valera to swallow Pope Adrian’s bull. 17. Nor will Ibn Baud waive his claim to jurisdiction over tribes like the Murra, who may or may not have submitted to his ancestors, but who have been within his sphere of influence and no other for many years. However great his desire for a rapprochement with His Majesty’s Government he will be at least as insistent on his claim to a great part of the hinterland of the Trucial coast as he has been on his claim foTNajran, which, until the Imam admitted it, rested on similar foundations. He may accept a compromise, but not a compromise turning on a minor modification of the “blue line,” or a compromise involving the recognition of a British sphere in the interior of Arabia, distinct from their sphere as quasi-protectors of the coastal States. If he recognised the existence of such a distinct British sphere, he would go down to Arab history as one of the lost leaders. 18. I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the future relations of His Majesty’s Government with Ibn Baud will depend very largely on their attitude in regard to this question. If we take the possible course of shelving it on the basis that each side reserves its position, he will remain with a rankling sense of injury. In my opinion the issue must be faced, and His Majesty’s Government must choose between a more or less open breach with Ibn Baud or a generous settlement with him. 19. I have throughout regretted the unwillingness of His Majesty’s Govern ment to admit frankly to Ibn Baud that their interest in the area in dispute is due largely to its oil potentialities. He himself undoubtedly realises this, but has been too canny to raise the question of his own initiative. His interest is to assert territorial claims over an area which has been left indeterminate. That of His Majesty’s Government, as I see it, is to show cause why it has become important to define the position in that area, and the best way to do so would be to discuss frankly the economic reasons for doing so. 20. In Part (C) of my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I reviewed three possible policies in regard to the questions then outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Baud. They were in a nutshell: (a) positive support; (b) friendly laissez-faire; and (c) stiffness all along the line. On the whole, I favoured laissez-faire, and, on the whole, that policy has been followed, except as regards the Transjordan frontier question. I am now inclined to favour a more constructive policy, the corner-stone of which would be a generous settlement of the “blue line” question. The expiration of the original period of the Treaty of Jedda and Ibn Baud’s recent expression of a desire for “conversations” provide an opportunity for seeking a fairly comprehensive understanding with him, if it should suit His Majesty’s Government to enter into one. 21. The form and scope of such an understanding would require careful consideration. As regards the form, we might contemplate a treaty and annexes to be substituted for the Treaty of Jedda, a supplementary treaty or a series of exchanges of notes. As regards the scope I suggest tentatively the following points for consideration :— (i) His Majesty’s Government very naturally ruled out any sort of an alliance, and would presumably find it equally impossible to guarantee the security of Ibn Baud. They have, however, fore shadowed, subject to a satisfactory settlement of certain questions, a formula giving expression to the special nature of their relations with him. It might achieve his object to some extent, if the suggested8 understanding were made operative for a longish period, say fifteen or twenty years, and affirmed the readiness of His Majesty’s Govern ment to use their endeavours to preserve the status quo in Arabia, subject to their undertaking no military commitment and not inter vening, except by way of good offices, in any dispute between Arabian rulers neither party to which was in special relations with them as regards its foreign' relations. Whether they would go further and meet Ibn Saud to the extent of promoting a security pact of some sort between him and Iraq is a question beyond my competence. (ii) The understanding might define the boundaries within which His Majesty’s Government recognise the sovereign independence of Ibn Sand, subject to any agreements which may be entered into between the Arab Governments concerned. These boundaries would be: The present frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq; the present boundary between Nejd and Transjordan, with, perhaps, some definition of the status of places close to it like, e.g., Hazim; a readjusted de facto or, if possible, de jure frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan; the boundary recently established by treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen; a line corresponding to the Anglo-Turkish violet and blue lines, but well to the south-east and east of them, so as to include in Ibn Sand’s territories the Diras of the Murra, Manasir and other named tribes, and to avoid the creation of a distinct British sphere behind the States on the Persian Gulf coast, whose authority would be held to extend up to the new line, subject to any arrangements arrived at between these States under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government; and the existing Nejd- Koweit boundary, modified, perhaps, by a division of the neutral zone. (iii) It might be agreed, though it would be difficult to obtain Ibn Saud’s consent to this, that economic concessions between the blue and violet lines and the new line should be granted only to groups composed in equal parts of interests nominated by His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud respectively. (iv) Assurances might be given to Ibn Saud that His Majesty’s Govern ment and thn Government of Bahrein will not attempt directly or indirectly to impede direct shipments of goods to the Hasa coast, subject to the unfettered right of the Bahrein Government to levy transit dues at such rates as they may decide on goods for Nejd landed in Bahrein or transhipped in Bahrein waters. (v) A settlement of the Koweit blockade question might be made an essential condition of the understanding. (vi) The understanding might bind Ibn Saud to give reasonable facilities for landing in and flying over the coastal strip of Hasa in case of need, subject to an undertaking not to fly inland without special sanction from Ibn Saud and to payment of a reasonable annual rent, in recognition of Ibn Saud’s sovereign rights. If the understanding were for fifteen or twenty years, this rent might possibly be met in anticipation by a remission of the Saudi Government debts to His Majesty’s Government. (vii) His Majesty’s Government might abandon the right of manumission as from the promulgation by Ibn Saud of a public act on lines to be communicated to His Majesty’s Government, unofficially, but for their approval, in the course of the negotiations. (viii) The understanding might define the position in regard to the Hejaz Railway in the light of any arrangements that may be contemplated, in consultation with the French Government, during the next four months. 22. The above suggestion would not, except as regards head (i), involve any real departure from the principle hitherto followed by His Majesty’s Government of dealing with each outstanding question on its merits. What it amounts to is a proposal that we should explore the possibility of effecting a simultaneous settlement of the longish number of individual questions of importance, which are now outstanding.[156 gg—2] B THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT EASTERN (Arabia). CONFIDENTIAL. July 30, 1934. Section 2 [E 5064/2429/251 No. 1. Memorandum respecting Anglo-Saudi Relations, as seen by Sir A. Ryan in July 1934. despatch No. 233 of the 20th June, 1931, I discussed Ibn Baud’s attitude m regard to his relations with His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom, m the light of long conversations which I had had with Fuad Bey amza and the King himself. At that time he sought a rapprochement with -His Majesty s Government. He was obsessed by suspicion of the Hashimite rulers and one of his objects was the impossible one of ousting them from the position of special favour accorded to them by His Majesty’s Government. 2. I returned to England in February 1932 in the special circum stances of the Bakhit slavery case, I attempted to review generally, but systematically, the position as between Ibn Saud and His Majesty’s Government m a memorandum submitted at home on the 23rd February, 1932. Many of the statements and conclusions in that memorandum now call for revision, not so much, I think, because they were erroneous at the time (except in one particular, to which I will revert), as because of many changes in the situation in Arabia since it was written. In one respect, however, the position is similar to that of June 1931. Ibn Saud still sees in His Majesty’s Government the most important foreign factor in the world about him and he again seeks a rapprochement in a spirit of anxious misgiving. I again attempt a general review in the light of my recent conversations with Fuad Bey Hamza and then with the King at Taif, which I am recording separately. 3. I cannot do better than use the same structure as in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, with which I hope that this paper may be compared. (A) Position as regards Various Questions of Interest to His Majesty's Government. 4. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I enumerated these questions under twelve heads as follows :— (1) Transjordan frontier question. (2) Persian Gulf questions. (3) Arabian air route. (4) Shell benzine. (5) Other money matters. (6) Pilgrimage. (7) Slavery. (8) Deportation of British subjects and protected persons. (9) Aqaba and Maan. (10) Hejaz Railway. (11) Naval visits. (12) Treatment of foreign representatives in Jedda. 5. Subject to important modifications, the above list of headings still covers all outstanding matters of sufficient importance to affect, or to be capable of affecting, the general relations between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. The present position in regard to each may be briefly and roughly summed up as follows : — (1) Transjordan Frontier. This has ceased to create any serious difficulty since the conclusion of the Saudi Transjordan Treaty of July 1933. The attitude of the Saudi authorities still gives rise to some local complaint, but there has been no renewal ofcontroversy with the Saudi Government and there is no reason to anticipate any recrudescence of serious trouble, so long as Ibn Sand adheres to his present policy and the Amir Abdullah refrains from embroiling himself in the internal affairs of Saudi Arabia. (2) Persian Gulf Questions. These, on the other hand, have assumed major importance and may now be classified under the following four heads, the last of which is of capital importance to our relations with Ibn Saud :— (a) Koweit Blockade.—No substantial progress has been made with the solution of this problem since February 1932. Now that the Transjordan frontier is out of the way, His Majesty’s'Government would like to press for a removal of Ibn Sand’s embargo on trade between Koweit and Nejd. Their action has been hampered by the attitude of the Sheikh of Koweit, notably in regard to his old claims against Ibn Saud. _ (b) Bahrein Transit Dues. —This question, which is eminently one for a rational business settlement, has been singularly complicated by the Ahmedi incident of about October 1932 and the growth in Ibn Sand’s mind of a belief that His Majesty’s Government are determined, in the interests of Bahrein, to boycott direct trade with the Hasa Coast. The personal resentment shown by the King during my recent visit to Taif gives this aspect of the general question of transit a special importance. oil ,—This has become an important factor in the whole situation in North-Eastern Arabia since the grant of the Hasa Oil Commission to the Standard Oil Company of California. The most immediate matter of common concern to His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud is the proposed concession for the Koweit neutral zone. It is firmly believed by the British authorities in the Persian Gulf that Ibn Saud is also taking a hand in the business of the proposed Qatar concession. (d) The Blue Line .—The oil question was mainly instrumental in directing attention last year to uncertainty in regard to the frontier of Qatar and by inference to the whole question of the eastern and south-eastern boundaries of Saudi Arabia. After much consideration His Majesty’s Government decided to take their stand on Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914, as establishing a legal position which must be the basis of any discussion with the Saudi Govern ment, to whom they would be prepared to make some concessions, but only minor concessions. Ibn Sand’s reaction has been not less violent than was to be expected. He has begun by asserting, on legal and historical grounds, claims to territory far beyond the blue line established by the Anglo-Turkish Conventions. (3) Arabian Air Route. Further efforts since February 1932 to obtain certain facilities from Ibn Saud in respect of the Hasa Coast ended last year in a deadlock. Ibn Saud was prepared in principle to grant the facilities, but on exorbitant money terms. The amount which His Majesty’s Government was prepared to pay was not such as could possibly attract a ruler so jealous of his sovereign rights. We have been living from hand to mouth, reducing what are technically violations of his territory by forced landings and flying over to a minimum and apologising for them before the Saudi Government have time to protest. This has worked well enough in the conditions of the last year, as it has not suited Ibn Saud to be sticky with His Majesty’s Government over small matters. He cannot, however, count indefinitely on his continued complaisance. (4) and (5) Pecuniary Claims in regard to Shell Benzine, &amp;c. The Shell benzine affair was settled by a commercial agreement in 1932 and this has panned out satisfactorily for Shell. The E.T.C. cable account with the Saudi Government continues to fall into arrear, but the debit balances have not of late been such as to alarm the company. Other private claims are not so important as to affect relations between the Governments. The only claims which still call for notice in this connexion are what has now become a joint claim of His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India for the cost of arms supplied to Ibn Saud by the latter in 1929 and the claim of His Majesty’s Govern-[156 gg—2] B 2 ment ui respect of the Saudi share in the cost of the MacDonnell enquiry in 1930 ml ma , de t ?'! ardS the reC0Ver y of these clalms S mce February i ,i e orts made at tiie instance of the Treasury last autumn failpd an d the matter was subsequently left in abeyance pending the HqZation of prtsSt of amTati™ 11 - 1 t0 the Char ^ e ^ mo'nth buTthe prospect ot an}/ early recovery of the amounts is still poor.

I should like, however, to arrive at a reasonable settlement of the question of the Government of India dispensaries, which I brought up to date m a recent despatch. * P (7) Slavery. I have recently submitted elaborate reports on this question. Broadly speaking, the position is that, if Fuad Bey Hamza can be trusted, Ibn Baud might be induced to promulgate a public act imposing severe restrictions on the traffic in slaves, but is as keen as ever on getting His Majesty’s Government to abandon the right of manumitting and repatriating slaves'taking refuge in the Legation a f u . ® dda- despatches set forth the pros and cons of a deal on those lines, which, on the whole, I favour. Nothing can usefully be done at present to promote the larger object of securing a general suppression of slavery in Saudi Arabia. (8) Deportation. Deportation cases, as such, have given less trouble of late than they did three years ago. 1 his heading may now be replaced by the additional heading at (13) below. (9) A qaba and Maan. There has been no essential change since February 1932 in regard to this question. It looked last year as though Ibn Baud might seek to reopen it as soon as the Treaty of Jedda became denunciable in March 1934. More recent indications have shown that, while anxious to maintain the reservations he made in 1927, he realises that it would be useless and impolitic to reopen the question at present. On the other hand, the completion of new maps of the frontier area may create an awkward situation for His Majesty’s Government, if it should be found necessary to seek Ibn Baud’s consent to a modification of the de facto frontier between Transjordan and the Hejaz. This question might by extension affect also the position in regard to the frontier between Transjordan and Nejd. (10) Hejaz Railway. The Saudi Government have recently reopened the question of reconditioning this railway as a whole. They seem ready to shelve indefinitely, by a reservation, the questions of the ownership and alleged Wakf character of the railway. His Majesty’s Government are considering the matter sympathetically in consultation with the French Government. (H) Naval Visits. There has been no change in the position since February 1932. The Red Sea sloops continue to visit Jedda four or five times a year, after the Legation has notified the Saudi Government, without, however, asking for permission for the visits. They do not attempt to visit other ports, including, by an elucidation of standing instructions, anchorages in the Farsan Islands. This limits the4 freedom of action of the sloops, but is not attended by any serious disadvantages Last year the Saudi Government spoke of enacting general regulations on naval visits, but they have not so far taken any definite action m this sense. (12) Treatment of Foreign Representatives. The position described in my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, remains unaltered in essentials, but there has been some improvement m matters of detail. The Saudi Ministry for Foreign Affairs has been somewhat strengthened, and, though its remoteness from Jedda still causes inconvenience, opportunities for oral discussion are afforded more frequently and somewhat more regularlv. There had been breaches in the practice of confining European foreign representatives to Jedda, the most important being my recent visit to Taif°by invitation, and the King’s expression of hope that he would be able to receive me in Riadh also. There has been less inclination to head the Legation off representations on behalf of British Moslems. On the other hand, the Saudi Government are again playing with the idea of making distinctions between diplomatic and consular officers. I gathered this from a personal conversation with Fuad Bey some weeks ago, when he was inclined to insist that the distinction must be made, though he inferred that non-diplomatic officers would not necessarily be deprived of certain privileges, e.g., customs immunity. I urged him to let well alone, and his illness deprived me of any opportunity of exploring the matter further. We must be prepared, sooner or later, for attempts to curtail the very extensive privileges at present enjoyed by all members of the Legation staff, attempts which it may be difficult to resist, but which, in the conditions of Jedda, would have extremely inconvenient consequences. I add one general heading in substitution for (8), viz. :— (13) Attitude of the Saudi Government towards Moslem British Subjects and Protected Persons. This problem has grown in importance since 1932, owing to the increasing indications of a drive on the part of the Saudi Government to reduce certain foreign elements in their country, especially such as tend to over-populate the towns, and, in particular, Mecca, with nondescripts. Broadly speaking, it may be said that their policy is less open to criticism than the methods employed in their spasmodic attempts to give effect to it. The growth of xenophobia, however, directs attention to the lack of any droit d’ etablissement whatsoever. I have dealt with the whole subject at length in a recent despatch to the Foreign Office. 6. If any general settlement of outstanding questions with the Saudi Government was attempted, it would be necessary to ensure the completeness of the above list, but it certainly omits nothing of first-class importance bearing on their relations with His Majesty’s Government. So far as British interests are concerned, the most important at present are those under heads (2), (3) and (7); and, in a less degree, (6), as regards dispensaries, (12) as regards diplomatic and consular privileges, and (13). Ibn Saud, on his side, attaches supreme importance to (2) (d), and considerable importance to (2) (b) and (c), to (7) as regards manumission, and to (10). (B) Position of Ibn Saud. 7. In my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I said that “ Ibn Saud is almost certainly on the down grade.” This estimate has been falsified by his good luck on various occasions since then, and still more by the good management which has enabled him to take advantage of his luck. Were his financial position more assured, he would now be in a very strong position, thanks to his repression of the revolts in the Northern Hejaz and Asir in 1932, his success in avoiding serious trouble with elements which might be tempted to turn against him in Nejd, and by his conduct of his quarrel with the Imam Yahya, in the last stages of which he renounced any idea of conquering the Yemen, but established a legal title to the whole of Asir and Nejran, and sterilised, probably for a long time to come, if not for ever, the influence of the Idrisis.-p oiV 8 ™ 1111 run through the reasons I gave in my memorandum ot the 23rd February, 1932, for the then apparent deterioration of Ibn Sand’s political position : — (c) The administration of the Hejaz has not become less efficient, and has per aps somewhat improved. There are fewer internal signs of discontent with e Saudi regime than there were in 1931. It cannot be called popular, but some eas o e ubes aie too broken to think of resistance, the townsmen seem more resigned, and some of them have an increasing interest in the stability of the present regime. J r ^ indications as afford a criterion suggest that Ibn Saud has strengthened his position vis-a-vis the extreme Wahhabi opponents of modern ideas It is impossible to form any exact estimate, but the King has shown ^ oidness ™ variou 1 s directions, and less is heard of the Ulama of Neid. In of hand^ 8 a D 6 t0 ma ^ e USe tde ^^hwan, without letting them get out xr i Ibn baud s isolation in the Arab world is less pronounced than it was. lie has learnt to control his hatred, if not his suspicion, of the Hashimites. Care- ±uHy run trued sympathy with him seems to abound in Palestine and in Syria, peihaps also m more independent Arab countries. The unexpected death of King I eisal last year has removed his most conspicuous rival in the Arab world. His display of moderation in nis final settlement with the Imam has advertised him as a man who is first and foremost a good Arab, all the more so as other good Arabs, line the would-be mediators, headed by the Grand IVIufti of Palestine, have been enaoled to claim an unearned share of the credit. He has, in fact, discreetly avoided any appearance of a desire to dominate the Arab world too exclusively and has beaten with ah the more effect the Moslem Arab drum. (d) Remaining himself a good but not extreme Wahhabi, Ibn Saud has tended to show greater tolerance towards Moslems of other denominations, both Sunni and Shia, He divides the sympathies of non-Arab Moslems generally, but he has probably more admirers in countries like India, and perhaps the Dutch East Indies, than he had some years ago. Even in Egypt, the third largest contributor to the pilgrimage, there is a strong tendency to criticise King Fuad’s policy of holding him at arm’s length. (e) Ibn Saud is still isolated from the general life of the family of non- Moslem nations. Even here, however, there are signs of a readiness on his part to increase his intercourse with individual nations; and. though the signs are small, they may foreshadow a process capable of considerable acceleration in the more favourable conditions which would result from a consolidation of his position in Arabia. He has realised that he must look west for any serious help in developing his resources, witness the grant of the Hasa Oil Concession to the Americans and his readiness to treat with Europeans for the grant of other concessions. (/) He is still poor in competent advisers on other than purely Arab affairs. There have been no notable additions to the list, but the men he has have grown somewhat in stature. His Minister of Finance has learnt the useful lesson that, while old debts may be put on the long finger, current liabilities must be met, if credit is to be maintained. Payments in respect of immediate transactions have been much more punctual of late. Fuad Bey Hamza is a doubtful factor. He has advanced in the art of diplomacy, but he does not seem to enjoy the full confidence of Ibn Saud, and his own heart-searchings in quest of a larger life may sweep him out of the King’s service. Should he remain in it and retain his health, he is capable of rendering much service as a liaison between Saudi Arabia and the modern w'orld. Even Sheikh Yussuf Yasin has achieved more elasticity. Some other less well-known men have also come on, like Muhammad Tawil, a Hejazi, whom Ibn Saud has used successfully in Hasa, and perhaps the Ibn Muammar, a Nejdi, who represents him in Bagdad. 9. Ibn Saud has shown no further signs of physical decline. He has grown somewhat lethargic in his habits; but he looks fit, lives a healthy life, especially in Nejd, no longer overeats (if, indeed, there was truth in the Sheikh of Koweit’s suggestion that he used to), and imposes his will on his advisers in all major matters. Even the story current some time ago of his impotence seems to have been exaggerated, as he has had a son within the last few months. 10. It would be going far beyond the mark to suggest that the future of the Saudi regime is assured, but Saudi Arabia offers at least as much prospect of [156 gg—2] b 3? / *Sd“.io u h S “ *S£% favour of his heir, still an almost un n0 ^ jJ Sand’s policy in the last two regime.

(C) Position of His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom. 12 The list of outstanding questions in section (A) above is less formidable tVicin -jtq Ipno-th would sugo’est The general relations between His Majesty s Government and Ibn Baud’have, in fact, improved materially m te last three years. They are now threatened more seriously by the blue line than by y ^^ir^ltanno't pereonallv believe m the undoubted legal validity of the ‘‘ blue line ” It appears to me that in 1915 and in 1927 His Majesty’s Government were content to treat Qatar, the Trucial Sheikhdoms and Muscat an d Oman as contere minous with Ibn Sand’s dominions, whatever the boundaries. So far as Qatar is concerned it seems to me that the Anglo-1 urkish Convention of 1913 itseit proceeded on that assumption, and that the “ blue line was conceived as an arbitrary boundary between Qatar territory and hrnjd. M hen it was recently decided not to assert the sovereignty of the Sheikh of Qatar so far west, I myself preferred the expression British sphere of influence to the expression Q a ‘ sphere of influence but I do not think it can be seriously maintained that Hreat Britain has a sphere of influence in Eastern Arabia, except m the sense that her influence extends to the coastal principalities up to their territorial limits, what- 14 It appears to me further that the Anglo-Saudi Treaty of December 1915 destroyed the validity of the t£ blue line ” by substituting a new criterion for the determination of Ibn Sand’s boundaries. He was to be recognised as independent within his ancestral limits. These limits may conceivably have lam west o± the “blue line.”. This appears to be Colonel Fowle’s latest contention, but I have not seen his paper on the subject. The limits may have lain east of the blue line,” as Ibn Saud contends, invoking in support of his claim the proceedings ot the Felly mission, the records of which I have not seen either. My point is that the 1915 treaty imposed on His Majesty’s Government an obligation to accept the ancestral limits in due course as determining the boundary and implied that the coastal principalities extended up to this boundary. I have toyed with the argument that the treaty of 1915 imposed limitations on Ibn Saud s sovereignty and that the treatv of 1927, which removed those limitations, again altered the whole position and re-entitled His Majesty’s Government to rely on the blue line,” on the ground that Ibn Saud was no longer negotiating as a rebel against Turkish authority, but as the ruler of a succession State. . , _ - + 15. This argument, however, carries no conviction m my own mind. It it corresponds with what His Majesty’s Government believed to be the position in 1927, they might well have been expected to make it clear, instead of which they made no reference to the “blue line,” and again treated the coastal principalities i a i!ff S ronlH^P^ were ^f s neighbours.

However great his desne for a rapprochement with His Majesty’s Government he will be at least as insistent on his claim to a great part of the hinterland of the Trucial coast as he has been on his claim to Najran, which, until the Imam admitted it, rested on similai foundations. He may accept a compromise, but not a compromise turning on a minor modification of the “blue line,” or a compromise involving the recognition of a British sphere in the interior of Arabia, distinct from 'their sphere as quasi-protectors of the coastal States. If he recognised the existence of such a distinct British sphere, he would go down to Arab history as one of the lost leaders. • 18 A y 0 n0t t3link 1 exa gg erate when I say that the future relations of His Majesty s Government with Ibn Saud will depend very largely on their attitude in regard to this question. If we take the possible course of shelving it on the basis that each side reserves its position, he will remain with a rankling sense of injury. In my opinion the issue must be faced, and His Majesty’s Government must choose between a more or less open breach with Ibn Saud or a generous settlement with him. 19. I have throughout regretted the unwillingness of His Majesty’s Govern ment to admit frankly to Ibn Saud that their interest in the area in dispute is due largely to its oil potentialities. He himself undoubtedly realises this, but has been too canny to raise the question of his own initiative. His interest is to assert territorial claims over an area which has been left indeterminate. That of His Majesty’s Government, as I see it, is to show cause why it has become important to define the position in that area, and the best way to do so would be to discuss frankly the economic reasons for doing so. 20. In Part (C) of my memorandum of the 23rd February, 1932, I reviewed three possible policies in regard to the questions then outstanding between His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud. They were in a nutshell: (a) positive support; (b) friendly laissez-faire; and [c] stiffness all along the line. On the whole, I favoured laissez-faire, and, on the whole, that policy has been followed, except as regards the Transjordan frontier question. I am now inclined to favour a more constructive policy, the corner-stone of which would be a generous settlement of the “blue line” question. The expiration of the original period of the Treaty of Jedda and Ibn Baud’s recent expression of a desire for “conversations” provide an opportunity for seeking a fairly comprehensive understanding with him, if it should suit His Majesty’s Government to enter into one. 21. The form and scope of such an understanding would require careful consideration. As regards the form, we might contemplate a treaty and annexes to be substituted for the Treaty of Jedda, a supplementary treaty or a series of exchanges of notes. As regards the scope I suggest tentatively the following points for consideration :— (i) His Majesty’s Government very naturally ruled out any sort of an alliance, and would presumably find it equally impossible to guarantee the security of Ibn Saud. They have, however, fore shadowed, subject to a satisfactory settlement of certain questions, a formula giving expression to the special nature of their relations with him. It might achieve his object to some extent, if the suggestedunderstanding were made operative for a longish period say fifteen or twenty years, and affirmed the readiness of His Majesty s Govern- ment to rise their endeavours to preserve the status quo m Arabia, subiect to their undertaking no military commitment and not inter vening except by way of good offices, in any dispute between Arabian rulers neither party to which was in special relations with them as regards its foreign relations. Whether they would go further and meet Ibn Baud to the extent of promoting a security pact of some sort between him and Iraq is a question beyond my competence. (li) The understanding might define the boundaries within which His Maiesty’s Government recognise the sovereign independence of Ibn Baud, subiect to any agreements which may be entered into between the Arab Governments concerned. These boundaries would be: The present frontier between Saudi Arabia and Iraq, the present boundary between Nejd and Transjordan, with, perhaps, some definition of the status of places close to it like, e.g., Hazim, a readjusted de facto or, if possible, de jure frontier between the Hejaz and Transjordan; the boundary recently established by treaty between Saudi Arabia and the Yemen; a line corresponding to the Anglo-Turkish violet and blue lines, but well to the south-east and east of them, so as to include in Ibn Baud s territories the Diras of the Murra, Manasir and other named tribes, and to avoid the creation of a distinct British sphere behind the States on the Persian Gulf coast, whose authority would be held to extend up to the new line, subject to any arrangements arrived at between these States under the auspices of His Majesty’s Government; and the existing Nejd— Koweit boundary, modified, perhaps, by a division of the neutral zone. It might be agreed, though it would be difficult to obtain Ibn Saud s consent to this, that economic concessions between the blue and violet lines and the new line should be granted only to groups composed in equal parts of interests nominated by His Majesty’s Government and Ibn Saud respectively. (iv) Assurances might be given to Ibn Saud that His Majesty s Govern ment and the Government of Bahrein will not attempt directly or indirectly to impede direct shipments of goods to the Hasa coast, subject to the unfettered right of the Bahrein Government to levy transit dues at such rates as they may decide on goods for Nejd landed in Bahrein or transhipped in Bahrein waters. A settlement of the Koweit blockade question might be made an essential condition of the understanding. (vi) The understanding might bind Ibn Saud to give reasonable facilities for landing in and flying over the coastal strip of Hasa in case of need, subject to an undertaking not to fly inland without special sanction from Ibn Saud and to payment of a reasonable annual rent, in recognition of Ibn Sand’s sovereign rights. If the understanding were for fifteen or twenty years, this rent might possibly be met in anticipation by a remission of the Saudi Government debts to His Majesty’s Government. (vii) His Majesty’s Government might abandon the right of manumission as from the promulgation by Ibn Saud of a public act on lines to be ‘communicated to His Majesty’s Government, unofficially, but for their approval, in the course of the negotiations.

It is said that there are no settlements, other than Sakak and Ambak, in the area east of the Blue Line as xar as Abu Dhabi* This is confirmed by the aerial reconnaissances (visibility 4 to 7 miles) along the line Zakhnuniyah Island-Salwa-Sakak-Khor al 'Odaid-Sabakhah Matti-Yas Island. There are however desert wells here and there. 2. SAKAK AND AMBAK * Sakak (7 miles south-east of the sea at Salwa near a conspicuous flat topped hill) consists of a couple of stone and mud houses, eight or nine reed huts and a garden of 50-70 palms with wells. There are two groups of about five wells situated three miles south-east of Sakak. Ambak is said to be about the same size. Sakak is said to be inhabited in the summer (it was on the 29th June), but is vacated in the winter when the people take their animals away to graze. The people are Al Morfah and pay zakat to Bin Sa'ud. 3. KHOR AL 'ODAID » The Khor al 'Odaid is a fine stretch of water forming a good Flying Boat anchorage and is connected with the sea by a channel passable for motor/n motor launches* SABAKHAH MATTI. The Sabakhah Matti is ? as the term Sabakhah implies, a salty waste. It is said to be uninhabited, but a trail from ’Oman to Hasa, usable by motors, passes across it inland. On June 29th wells (no trees or cultivation) with a few bedouin tents were seen some 15 miles inland on the west edge of the Sabakhah* The coast is low and beset with shoals and reefs. 5. DHAFRAH . Dhafrah (an area in the hinterland south of Abu Dhabi not to be confused with ’Jafurah area south_west of Qatar) is almost entirely Manasir country and there are tfery few persons from other tribes (except the ’Awamir) there. The tract is fertile with a lot of trees andplenty of water. i There are no built houses, but palm branch huts are used* Water is particularly plentiful at ’Uqailah, which is consequently used as a tribal gathering place by the Muzakis (tax gatherers). The Manasir are under a number of petty Shaikhs. Kashid bin Mana’ is said to be theleading Shaikh, but it is t doubtful whether he has any real influence. The ’Awamir, whose area is beyond Dhatrah up to uaraimi (Bani Ea’im and Bani Qitab), have a more powerful head, Hamad bin Rakadh. Both the Manasir and ’Awamir at present pay zakat to Bin Sa’ud, but only, it is stated, during the last 4 or 5 years. The/The Manasir at any rate are said to have paid zakat to Shaikh ^aia bin Khalifah of Abu Dhabi (who died about 1918) and the history of Trucial ‘Oman tends to confirm this. So far as can be traced none of the tribes in this area have fumished men for the Yemen Campaign. 6. MUZAKIS . Each year lately a party (who may number some 30 armed men with some servants) of Muzakis (tax gatherers) has been sent to Dhafrah by the Amir of Hasa (‘Abdullah bin Jilouwi) about April. In 1933 the head of the party was Badr al ’Utaibi, but as there were complaints of his harshness to the people, Muhammad- al-Sahali was sent in 1934. Zakat is charged at the rate of one dollar for each full-grown camel, half a dollar for each young camel, and one dollar for every five sheep* In 1934, 10,000 dollars are said to have been collected from the Manas ir in Dhafrah. If a man cannot pay in cash, it is alleged that the Muzakis take one of his best camels and assess its value at one-fifth of what it should be (this is possibly exaggerated). The Muzakis sometimes go as far afield as Baraimi(where Bin Sa'ud has no agent) and ’Oman, where however they do not press for fixed rates but take what is given to them; in practice the payments vary, less if Bin Sa’ud is engaged in war or other pre-occupations more if he is free to deal with the matter. No zakat is paid by the Trucial Chiefs to Bin Sa'ud, but courtesy presents of 5to 10 camels are sent yearly/yearly to the Amir of Hasa “by way of friendship H and the bearers receive presents in return. These presents do not imply any suzerainty. 7* The position seems to be that the Trucial Chiefs and the tribes fear aggression from Bin Sa'ud and to try to placate him, the former by presents of courtesy and by listening to representations, for example, in cases affect ing his nationals, and the latter by paying zakat to him. But these arrangements are of recent standing and merely indicate that for the moment Bin Sa'ud is sufficiently powerful to make the payment of blackmail to him an appropriate insurance.1fc n&lt;J *' &gt;ir} ^ OTa l ..cus st.:n u_l in 1913- 1914 of Ills Majesty 1 » Oorerarv-nt, who had a» historic position in reg rd to that part of 'r-Ma.

These I think dispose of any 'ancestral 11 claims by Ibn Saud to any part of the territories in question, at all events to the three last named. His occupational claims to Hasa are not in dispute. 2. The submission of vague ancestral claims is a favourite device of Arab Rulers, and I recollect that the Iman of Yemen, when I was at Aden, based his claim to the Aden Protectorate partly on ancestral grounds, which on examination proved to be entirely fictitious. Sometimes the chaotic and tribal conditions of Arabia make it difficult to refute such pretentions, but in the present case the task has been comparatively simple. 3. HASA. Table A. It will be seen from the Table that prior to/Y' ? - 2 - ^ ^ ,870 ' ti-L to Ibn Saud's occupation of Hasa in 1913, the Wahabis had only occupied that province for two comparatively short periods,i.e, 23 years, from 1795 to 1818, and 8 years, from 1830 to 1838. This hardly comprises an ancestral claim, and Hasa is no more naturally Wahabi because they have occupied it for the last 20 years than Riyadh and Central Mejd can oe said to be naturally Shammar because the latter held it trom 1888 to 1902. The ancestral home of the Wahabis is of course Central Nejd: where they hold sway elsewhere in Arabia it is merely by virtue of their very recent conquests. However the point is of an academical nature• 4. QATAR . Table B. Ibn Saud has certainly no claims on Qatar. The Wahabis only occupied it, more than a century ago, for two years,i.e.from 1809 to 1811* On occupational grounds the Turks, who occupied it from 1871 to 1914, would have the strongest claim, but their claim was never recognised by His Majesty's Government, and in 1914 was renounced. 5. TRUClab COAST # Ta ble C. More than a century ago from 1800 to 1820 Wahabi influence was strong in this area, but they have never been in occupation of on any point on th^coast, or in the interior with the exception of Baraimi, from which the Trucial Coast Shaikhs have made various efforts to eject them. Such influence as they exercised has been retrograde and their allies at one period were the notorious Qawasimi pirates. As British influence increased Wahabi influence waned, and at present any direct influence which they have left is confined to Baraimi, though the Trucial 4H' (y&lt;f -&gt; Coast/n -3- Coast Shaikhs may from time to time pay Ihn Saud some sort of 'tribute' in order to prevent the latter inciting his tribes to raid their hinterland territories. 6* OMAN . Table D. At various times in the past (the last occasion being in 1865) the Wahabis, with Baraimi as their centre, have ravaged the Sultanate with fire and sword, and exacted tribute from more than one Sultan, No place in Oman, however, (with the exception of Baraimi), has been in occupation of the Wahabis and no tribute has been forth coming from Muscat for many years, 7 » Tribute . In the course of this letter and in the attached Tables mention has been made of 'tribute' ( zakat ) paid to the Wahabis. There are two sorts of tribute which are paid to Ibn Saud. There is (a) that which is paid by the inhabitants of an area under Wahabi occupation, which is of the same nature as taxes paid to any government, and which is a recognition of Wahabi rule. (b) There is also the 'tribute' which is exacted by Ibn Saud from Shaikhs outside his kingdom under threat of raids or other unpleasantness. This of course is the modern blackmail, or the ancient Danegeld, and is in no way a sign of submission to Wahabi rule. Such tribute as is exacted by Ibn Saud in the territories Bast of the Blue Line is Danegeld, pure and simple.

Wahabis still exercise some little influence over Baraimi and it is possible that some of the Trucial Chiefs pay some sort of trioute to Ibn Saud from time to time to prevent his inciting his tribes to raid their hinterland territories. Speaking generally, however, it may oe saio. that at the moment direct 'Wahabi influence on the Trucial Coast is of little practical importance.4 i sTl 'A Reference* Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf* Lorimer. page 423 » 424 to 425 Date. 1800 to 1803 1803 441 1807 to 1820 » 456 1829 to 1856 'D' Wahabi relations with Oman Sultanate.

Note from Saudi government dated June 20th invokes principle (which it represents as being the same as that stated by me on basis of paragraph 3 of your telegram No “ v 95 ) an y frontier agreement must be between Saudi government and governments concerned and not unilateral they fcnerefore insist that they cannot regard blue line as correctly describing frontier either in fact or in law between their neighbouring Arab territories but declare entir readiness to come to an understanding regarding frontier wnich shall secure interests of all Arab countries concerned. Tney enclose statement of reasons for their attitude. Following are the main points enclosed in statement. 1. Blue line was not agreed upon between governments having proper authority and locus standi. Saudi government do not now wish to discuss position of Ills Majesty's Govern- merit at that time but Turkish government clearly had no right to determine destiny of countries which had made agreements with His Majesty's Government. Authority of the Ottoman government never extended beyond inhabited towns and villages and ceased when Ibn Saud recovered his ancestral territories and established his legal authority therein by occupation of Hasa on April 13th 1913. Basis of agreementsmade regarding them 'by Turkish government after that date are void* 2. Article 1 of Treaty of 'December 16th 1915 between His Majesty*s Government and Ibn Baud shows actual frontier was not determined but was to be fixed subsequently and that His Majesty*s Government recognized the right of Ibn Baud to dominions of his ancestral (? gp« orntd,) and tribes belonging thereto* By their agreement to protocol on Nejd Koweit frontier they recognized inappropriateness of Anglo-Turkish line as a true and acceptable basis for frontier between Ibn Saud*s dominions and other neighbouring countries. 3. Confines of Quatar are known among Arab tribes to be those of inhabited towns and villages at which Ion ^ Baud's dominions are known to end. Actual limit between Ms dominions and Quatar is that of Ha-jrat (i.e. stony district as opposed to sandy desert beyond) of Quatar. Saudi government cannot contemplate alteration of traditional frontier or of actual frontier except by straight forward agreement for which they are prepared. 4. All tribes between coastal towns of Quatar and coast of Gulf of Oman and Hadhrarnaut belong to Saudi Arabia. They obey its laws pay Sakat and obey callsto war etCo This situation of fact* and exercise of Saudi authority s are never challenged by coastal rulersc Saudi government have considered and still consider them as part of His Majesty^s rights to which there can be no opposition 0 Comments and record of conversation with Fuad will folloWo Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No 0 147 P repeated to Government of India telegram No* 36 5 Bushire telegram no. 127.;u.OSUR£ in FOREIGN OFFICE A VcRiNG LITTER DATED 25JljN 1934 ' [This Document is the Prop erty of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] Prom SAUDI ARABIA.

No. 140 o My telegram No. 147» 1, Tone of Saudi communication is polite but very firm. In viev/ of importance of precise language used and your desire not to go too fast I told Fuad yesterday that His Majesty’s G-overnment were unlikely to form their opinion of communication until they had seen its actual terms and that while unable to discuss merits of the question I wished to elucidate certain points. 2. I feared that use of plural 'governments' in note implied that agreement should be with local rulers. Fuad assured me that intention was merely to state the general principle applying to any frontier agreements between the Saudi Government and any other governments whatsoever. 5. As I drafted my telegram under reference after my conversation with Fuad I think it unnecessary to telegraph regarding other points elucidated thereby. I will report fully by despatch by next bag. 4. Notwithstanding limits which I set to conversation - 4 r ^ ^ ;—- (? grp,omtd; ■■ » * we natuTTTlly toucheTor^maln issuemore than once/to Lferarte; as though he considered it an important marginal point and to Ikhwan settlements east of the blue line, I was careful not to suggest any probable weakening by His Majesty’s Government in their view of legal position. I purposely-Vv-. ft purposely let fall words ^British sphere” at intervals in order to counteract any idea that matter was merely one of frontiers between Saudi Arabia and the Sheikh of Qatar etc,, 5. Fuad attempted, especially in later stages of the conversation, to belittle the whole question as relating to H a few miles” of deserts I pointed out that area between Anglo-Turkish line and limits claimed in his note was enormous. He thereupon took Annex G to Anglo- Turkish 1914 (? convention) and suggested uossibility of ftOA line due south froii(^fearato)- (which he seemed to think was on the base line of Qatar peninsularX? to) north-eastern end of Hadhramaut bending across to same western terminal as violet line. 6. Fuad complained that His Majesty’s Government had given Ibn Saud no indication in 1915 that they regarded blue line as operative and maintained that language of treaty of that year justified the King’s present pretensions, I suggested areas left for future determina tion might well have been conceived as not in any case extending beyond Anglo-Turkish lines, I referred to possible effect of treaty of Jedda without however developing my argument in detail. (It would have been roughly that treaty of Jedda stabilized Ton Saud 3 's whole position vis-a-vis His Majesty’s Government including his position as ruler of succession state). -Fuad complained that in 1927 His Majesty’s Government had again given no hint of their present contention although as regards local rulers in Eastern Arabia had been fully discussed. 7o7* Confidential. I got general impression that Ihn Sand is much interested in Qatar but cares little about trucial shiekhdoms. Fuad 1 s suggestion in paragraph 5 above may afford indication that what is in the King's mind is to maintain connexion with Qatar; to retain Ikhv/an settlements; perhaps to be able to meet .Americans as regards boundary of Hasa concession; and to placate His Majesty's Government by agreeing to mathematical line well inland from trucial coast and due north of Hadhramaut knowing he can still exercise tribal influence beyond it* At the same time Fuad's suggestion made in more personal portion of a conversation from which I expressly excluded formal discussion of main issue cannot be regarded as a proposal by the Saudi Government,, For one thing it is increasingly uncertain whether Fuad commands full confidence of the King* Addressed to Foreign Office No, 149, repeated to Government of India No. 57 and Bushire No. 150.P.Z. 4203/34.

When he left Washington recently he understood from the State Department that they had not yet decided whether to reply to the Persian note or not; in the former case, he understood the reply would be a bare acknowledgment* I told Mr* Loomis that the Persian Government had reiterated this claim from time to time, notably in the two communications of which copies had been sent to the League of Hat ions, to whom our replies declining to admit that there was any basis for the claim had also been communicated*. He told me that he had three years ago been given by Mr. Hendel a copy of Sir Austen Chamberlain's note of February l8th,1929. It seemed to him a very complete answer to the Persian claim. He asked whether he could have a copy of the note of January X8th, 1928, end 1 said X would either send him one through Mr* Millard at the united States Embassy or give him a reference to the League document containing/containing it, Mr. Loomis then, in the course of further conversation on his Company’s various oil interests in the Persian Gulf area, asked what the relations were between Ibn Sand and the sheikh ox Qntar* Mr# Walton and X explained that there were no 3Pecial relations between them, except that under the Treaty 01 . «Jedtia Xbn baud agreed to keep on ifiendly terms with the Sheikh ox* Qatar and other local potentates who were in special treaty relations with Sis Majesty’s Government• iir. Loomis said that Ibn Saud had rather ixiplied to his Company that he had some kind of overlordship over the Sheikh of Qatar, and quoted the Foreign Office Peace Handbook of Arabia, 19S0, as saying that Ibn Sand’s dominion at that time extended over Qatar. We told Mr.Loomis that the statement in the Handbook was certainly a mistake, and Mr. Loomis said that he was glad to know, as his Company did not wish to be misled by Ibn Saud in the matter. At a later stage of the conversation we were looking at the map and I indicated to Mr. Loomis the Blue Line. Mr. Loomis at once said »Oh, yes. The line laid down by the Anglo- Turkish Conventions”• He evidently knew of the explanations regarding the blue line which we gave the U.S. Embassy here. Mr. Loomis also enquired whether any oil concession had yet been given to the Gulf Oil Company and the Anglo- Persian Oil Company in Koweit, and Mr. Walton replied that the negotiations were not yet concluded. Mr. Loomis then referred to the Koweit Heutral Zone and remarked that his Company had, under the provisions of their concession over the Hasa, an arrangement in respect of Ibn Baud’s rightto grant an oil concession in the Neutral Zone, I asked him what this amounted to, and ha said that the provision was not very definite hut was to the effect that the Standard Oil Company had the right of first refusal, (This confirms our previous information). In the course of the conversation Mr, Loomis also said that the reports of his Company * s geologists working in the Hasa proraised favourably, and that his Company were not interested in any other area of Ibn Saud*s dominion, (Sd.)

WW ^7- -\r \r Correspondence ending with your telegrams Nos.50 and 8 iuad engaged me in long conversations on June 5th and 6th regarding general relations 'between Ibn Baud and His majesty’s Government. While admitting that the former had no ground for complaint he attributed recent compromise with the Imam to the ambiguousness of His Majesty’s Government’s attitude. I contested this on obvious lines* Fuad said that the King felt that the time had come to take stock of his relations with His Majesty’s Government and sounded me as to the possibility of their consenting to a general discussion in preparation for which the King might like to see me himself. I admitted several major questions had assumed or were assuming importance but I reminded him of constant preference of His Majesty’s Government for dealing with all such questions on their individual merits and expressed doubt as to whether you would see what material there was for a general discussion. Fuad said that events in the neighbouring countries made Ibn Baud anxious to consider his position. He spoke of veiled Turkish and Persian hostility to the Arabs and the menace which it constituted to Iraq. He also spoke vaguely but suspiciously of the attitude of the Kixig of Iraq. I said that settlement with the Yemen • * •2* Yemen gave pronij.se of stable administrative direction and that fears of Turkish and Persian aggression in Arabia iested on no solid xomidation tnat I could see^ Cn my pressing him as to what he was at, Puad said, that the King sought the opinion of His Majesty 1 s Government as to whether the time was ripe for a rapprochement with Saudi^Arabia with a view to establishment of closer relations and coordination of general policy* If so might not conversations be under taken with a view to an understanding whether oral, written or in form of an alliance * I promised to convey this to His Majesty’s Government but again expressed personal view that they would prefer to deal with definitely outstanding questions individually and would be averse from discussion of the'more hypothetical contingencies to which he had referred* Gariy in the conversation Fuad spoke of the possibility of his visiting; London this autumn* My redaction was friendly but guarded whereupon he begged me to divorce question of his visiting London from that raised by. the King* General impressions I derived were that for reasons indicated in correspondence, the King has got into one of his recurring states 01 suspicious aimi^ogj that he has authorised Fuad to attempt to promote general understanding of some sort with His Majesty s Government to whom he holds cut hope of meeting tneir wishes on all points in return fox uheir support, and that Fuad is making the most of his instructions, but it is perhaps to re-estab 1 ish his changed credit; w j. oh th© Kina which may be somewhat snaxen el chough Ibn Gaud recognises his utility 0 Tne o * «/ The position resembles that oT June 1931 when the and lUad mde similar approach although the setting is different and even more nebulous and the King Is more In the Dackground so far* vvhat reply should I give? in particular would you be prepared to give ruad a nearing if he went to London? In my opinion visit to England could produce no more result than that of the Saudi Mission in 1932 and it would doubtless be in many ways inconvenient. On the other hand Fuad intends to go to Europe for reasons of health in any case and could hardly be prevented from going to London privately, A show of welcome and readiness to talk things over informally might soothelbn Baud and allay somewhat his suspicions of British policy* Addressed to Foreign Office telegram No.138, repeated to Bagdad and Angora,[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office if not required for official use.] •4CL.O?-imS POmAQH OFFICE ■ ■ w.y r ♦* % i • Y Ym: a * f4Ll LSH TEH DATED Sim 1934 U To BAUDi ARABIA. i! j- , (E 3851/2429/25). ^ 1 7 9 S s i Cypher telegram to SI 3 ?

This is placed at the back of the correspondence (folio 4).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Saudi Arabia</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chief Commissioner, Aden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for the Colonies, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Committee of Imperial Defence, Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Kuwait</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Saudi Arabia, Āl Sa'ūd dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Saudi Arabia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Frontiers</topic></subject><subject><topic>Boundaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Bilateral relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0002a0#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
