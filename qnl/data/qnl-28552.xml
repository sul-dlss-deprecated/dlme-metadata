Colonel Stannus notes that the account of the proceedings includes references to the involvement of Captain Robert Taylor which appears to have exceeded the bounds prescribed to him, and that a letter had been written to Captain Taylor requesting an explanation for the references, and that the Colonel's response to the Imam of Muscat made reference to that involvement too.The letter to the Imam describes the military action taken against Bussorah, and the involvement of the Resident at Bussorah (Robert Taylor) in mediating the peace settlement and the specific terms within relating, particularly those relating to the East India Company.Translation of a letter from Mahumed bin Souliman [Muḥammed bin Suleman] and Saleh bin Hussin [Saleh bin Ḥusayn], Commanders of the Imam's fleet to His Highness Syed Said (Saʻīd bin Sulṭān), 1 November 1826 (ff 75-77)Letter from Colonel Stannus to His Highness the Imam, 27 December 1826</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024197023.0x00007d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
