It also covers British concerns over the definition of the Southern/Gulf Ports of Persia (pledged as security for British loans), and British fears that the customs of these ports might fall under the control of another foreign power, or be used as security for non-British loans. Also outlined in the memorandum are a number of proposed loans that never reached fruition, and a proposed conversion loan in 1910 from the Imperial Bank of Persia in order to consolidate the Persian Government's debt.Information on some of the diplomatic discourse which has taken place from 1900 to 1912 between the Foreign Office, the India Office, and Russian representatives regarding the payment of loans to Persia is also included.The appendix on folios 48-53 contains supporting transcripts, which include:an extract from a memorandum by Sir Arthur Henry Hardinge, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Persia, dated 29 March 1903; it provides background details on the Imperial Bank of Persia (f 48);a note on the Caspian Fisheries (f 48);the text of an agreement for the advance of Â£200,000 by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government (ff 48v-49)a table showing the amortization scheme for the Anglo-Indian Loan of 1903-04; extracted from a report on Persia by Sir Cecil Arthur Spring-Rice (f 49);a statement (in French) by the Administrator of the Persian Customs as to 'fixed charges' on the customs revenue, dated 1909 (ff 49v-50);the text of an agreement between the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Persian Government, dated 8 June 1910, with supplementary letters from the Bank to the Persian Finance Minister, dated 2-4 June 1910; it regards the repayment of debts owed to the bank (ff 50-51);a list of payments and receipts from the Imperial Bank of Persia (1903-1910) respecting loans or proposed loans to the Persian Government (ff 51v-52).Some extracts quoted in the main body of the memorandum are in French, as are a number of the appendices. An index can be found on folio 54.This memorandum is continued in a subsequent memorandum dated 27 November 1912 (see IOR/L/PS/18/C120b).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Persia, Qajar dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Imperial Bank of Iran</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Persia</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Loans</topic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><subject><topic>Public debt</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00010c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
