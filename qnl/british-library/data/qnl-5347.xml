On the other hand the reduction of the post of 2nd gy; copyist in the Bushire Residency in 1925, vide ray pre- decesaor’s letter «0.163 dated the Slat January W2&amp; has not proved successful. In surrendering the post my predecessor was moved by the desire to meet the demand for reduction in the charges made against imperial revenues on account «C expenditure in the Gulf but X think the reduction of staff should have been experimental. it has in practice been found impracticable. 1 iind that work is getting behind aand and papers are coming up to me with most unsatisfactory delay.

Sir, With reference to Foreign and Political Department memorandum Bo.252-^/28» dated the l?th July ±928, I have the honour to state that the reason for retaining the post of typist in the Residency Uffice, Bushire, in Grade III was that the incumbent of the post of 2nd Clerk, Kuwait, who is confirmed in that grade, should not lose by the transfer of the appointment to Bushire. On reconsideration of tne question, however, Dir Lionel Haworth was of the opinion that, as it was his intention to obtain not meirely a typist but a general assistant and understudy to the Coniidential Clerk, the assistant should be adequately paid in consideration of the important nature of his work. Sir Lionel Haworth theioiore suggested to me that the appointment of Confidential Assistant should be in Grade XX* 2. I support this view arid, as 1 require the cleric in Bushire urgently, 1 request that the Government of India will accord sanction by telegraph to tne transfer of the appoint ment of 2nd Clerk, Kuwait, as Confidential Assistant, Busnxre in Grade II 1&amp;0-10-200) plus a duty allowance of Rs.25 per mensem.

In Persia generally prices are slightly higher, as the imposition of the Surtax on sugar and tea appears to have influenced the prices of other food commodi ties. In these circumstances, the Political Besident considers that there would be no justification at present for any reduction in the pay of the clerical subordinate and menial establishments under the Persian Gulf Besidency and recommends the continuance to them of the existing scales of pay for a further period of one year, with effect the becretary of State for India in Council ? 7 as conveyed 2.

Sir,’ r I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with Foreign and Political Department Memorandum No. 2351 - Kst.A., dated the 24th Atgust 1921, in which was communica- tea the decision of the Government of India to change the style of 'Extra Assistant to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf' to that of 'Assistant Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf'. At that time the only other Extra Assistant Resident here was the Treasury Officer, 2. Mr.W.Hayward, the first officer to bear the new designation, is retiring on pension this month. In his case on general grounds I think that the conferment of the new designation was unobjectionable though, with due deference to my predecessor's opinion, the reasons given by him in favour of it were not very cogent, as the Secretary, the Under Secretary and the Vice-Consul are the only Assistants wnom I would authorise to communicate on my behalf with Foreign Consuls and Belgian Customs officials. 3.

In addition to his Treasury work he will technically be head of the non-confidential English office in the Town Residency, working directly under the Secretary. (b) that Khan Bahadur Syed Allah Banda be styled 'First Interpreter', working under the Vice-Consul as well as the Secretary. His main duties will be connected with political and commercial cases in Persia, though as head of the Oriental Office he will also assist on Arab Trucial Coast esses. (c) Khan Sahib Mirza Ali will be styled 'Second ^ Interpreter'. He will assist the First Interpreter generally. In particular he will translate the Arabic correspondence. 5. I do not think that necessarily the Senior Extra Assistant Resident should always be the Treasury Officer and Registrar.

I also attach a statement of prices in Kuwait during the same period, 4, It will be seen from these statements that thou^a some slight improvement is indicated, the level of prices has not fallen, generally, so as to render the cost of living appreci ably less. It is my opinion, therefore, that on the score of reduction in prices there is no justification for reduction in pay. The position is practically the same now as when Colonel Knox reported in his letter Ko*1151, dated the 15th July economic possibilities for the present, I.have examined in detail the possibility of reduction in personnel. The result is that with a redistribution of work in my Headquarters office I propose to surrender the posts (a) of Second Copyist, Bushire (Bs. 100-4-1EQ pilna House Bent Bs. 20), and (b) of Besidency Agent at Behbehan (Bs. 23) which has been vacant since 1 st March 1924, when the late incumbent resigned. These are all the reductions in numbers which I can suggest at present with due regard to efficiency. 5 # I may, however, mention that my present assistant Secretary retires in July next. In considering the question of his successor I shall probably recommend a re-adjustmsit of duties which may result in some reduction in the cost of establishment. I shall address the Government of India on this question later after examining all the aspects of the case. I will merely now remind the Government of India that when the Mir MunsMU appointment was raised last April to that of Oriental Assistant Secretary, the post of Interpreter was ordered to be abolished as soon as possible. This measure was carried into effect last September, when the Interpreter retired on pension. In this reduction of staff I regret to report a noticeable diminution of efficiency because 5. Seduction in pay being thus precluded from the scope of (a)(a) we now have no really qualified Arabic scholar in Bushire, and (b) when the Besident goes on Tour he must either deprive Bushire of its dragoman or do without that assistant himself. 7. Bo reduction in numbers seems possible in any of the Consulates anb Agencies subordinate to this Residency. The strength in every subordinate office is based on what, in my opinion, is the irreducible requirement in each case, viz, one dragoman, one English office clerk and one Vernacular office clerk or munshi. This number is maintained in every one of the offices (though the posts bear different designations) except Lingah where there is only a Consular Agent, and Ahwaz where owing to the maintenance of a Vice-Consul in addition to the Consul, an additional Munshi is necessary. If Ahwaz was a Consulate officered by the Levant Consular Service I do not believe that the incumbent would be allowed to leave his post for three months every year to visit Isfahan and Tehran. It mi$it then be considered unnecessary to provide him with a Vice-Consul and a second Vernacular Clerk. 8# I append, as desired, a list of the appointments on the establishments of this Residency and subordinate offices, with the emoluments attached to each. I have not considered the Political Agencies at Muscat and Bahrain in the above scrutiny for possible reductions, on the score that the expenditure incurred on these Agencies is not shared by the Imperial Government and therefore not affected by the demand for reductions by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty^ Treasury. I would, however, remark that the argument against reduction in pay is equally substantial in their case as will be gathered from the statement which I submit of prices of foodstuffs prevailing at Muscat and Bahrain curing the past four years. 9. As regards reduction in the personnel it will be noticed that each of these offices has more than what I have stated above to be in my opinion the irreducible minimum of an office. Muscat , however, runs an Indian Treasury which accounts for the additional{ 21% J additional Mmski Glerk, The Bahrain Agency exercises jurisdiction over all foreigners Yvho visit the Islands, which fact accounts for the additional Munshi and for the Indian Assistant who is necessary in addition when there is no British Assistant Political Agent. No smaller office can possibly deal with the cases of the large Persian, Iraqi and Nejci communities, not to mention some hundreds of Indians and the small American, British and French elements.

It is not quite clear to us why the Resident at Bushire and the Government of India consider it necessary to make any alteration consequent upon the increase of salary whicn was recently sanctioned for the incumbent of this post. We have only recently abolished in deference to Turkish susceptibilities the title of 'dragoman' at our Embassy at Constantinople and at other posts in the Fear East, and it would be rather inconsistent for us no?/ to appoint a 'dragoman' to Bushire. Moreover, as far as we are aware, the title of 'dragoman', is not one in general use in Persia, where the usual designation for the head native translator is that of 'Munshi Bashi' or 'Head Munshi' After/ L.D. lake ly Esq . , India Office, S.W. 1.\ after all there is no real implication of dignity in the title 'dragoman”, which - outside official circles - used to be adopted by every scoundrelly guide or bazaar tout in the Levant. .Ye should therefore prefer, unless there are very strong reasons against this course, to keep to the title of 'Head Munshi' 1 , which is universally understood in Persia and does not in any way’appear derogatory. Failing this, the title of 'Chief Translator” or 'Interpreter” might be suggested.

The proposal. Viscount Peel observes, is in general accord with the recommendations of the Masterton-Smith Committee, but departs from them in so far as it apparently envisages direct conmunlcation between the Political Agent, Bahrein, and His Majesty's Government as the normal arrangement, while the Conmittee proposed to have recourse to it only in cases of urgency, relations with Ibn Saud being normally conducted through the Resident at Bushire. Provided that the Secretary of state for the Colonies is satisfied that the enhanced power and dignity of Ibn Saud render it undesirable to use, as a channel of communication, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and provided that the latter is duly supplied with copies of all correspondence on the subject Under Secretary of State, Colonial Office.subject exchanged with the Political Agent, Bahrein, Lord Peel,is not disposed to offer any objection to the proposed departure from the terms of the recoimendations made by the Master ton-Srith Committee, The alteration in the functions of the Political Agent, Bahrein, will naturally involve an alteration in the incidence of expenditure upon the Agency, This question cannot however profitably be discussed in isolation, and Lord Peel, as at present advised, is willing that its consideration should be postponed until sufficient progress has been made in the discussion of the incidence of Aden expenditure to render it possible to consider as a whole the alteration in the incidence of expenditure in Arabia and the Persian Gulf involved in the establishment of the Middle East Department.

From 10%' With reference uo the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department,No. 949/86(2)-Est.,dated the 22 nd March 1923, I am directed to invite attention to the letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, No.1151, dated the 15th July 1923, a copy of which was forwarded under cover of my letter No. 74-M.,dated the 13th September 1923. 2. In the opinion of the Government of India ,in his letter dated the 15th July 1923 the Political Resident has made out a very strong case against any reduction in the near future in the emoluments of the office establish ments under his control by that portion of their salary v?hich is to be regarded as a bonus proportionate to the cost of living. In the circumstances, they strongly re commend the retention of existing arrangements for a further period of two years, that is, until the end of the financial year 1924-25. The question of revision can then be rs-examined in the light of conditions then prevailing.. c It will be noticed from paragraph 4 of Colonel K n ox's letter of 15th July 1923 that the volume of work * ... ' [ ; .. r • r ' in the offices of the political Resident and the Political Agent,Bahrein, has been increased by the addition-to their responsibilities of Nejd affairs, with which the Government of India are in no way concerned. In these . circumstances7$ \ \ circumstances it would only seem equitable that His Majesty’s Government should be asked to pay the whole cost of that portion of these two offices which deals with these matters. Further infoimation as to the strength and cost of this establishment is being obtained from the Political Resident, and it is suggested that , if the Secretary of state sees fit, proposals to this effect may be laid before His Majesty’s Government. 4. Steps are already being taken to meet the Political Resident’s request for spare copies of documents required for circulation. Indeed, the practice of supplying these originated in this office and is generally adopted in correspondence with other local officers besides the Political Resident. 5. The Government of India trust that the recommenda tions made in paragraph 2 above will meet with the con currence ox nib Majesuy’s Secretary of spate for India and that His Majesty’s Government will agree to continue to bear their share of the cost. m I have the honour to be.oo 4 L J 7 3 4 Jo* Oppy of a letter Ho.1151, dated Bushire, the loth July 1923, from the Hon'ble the lolitical Hesicient in the iersian 'jull. jus hire, to the Foreign oeoretary to the GoverniiEnt of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. VV'^f Revision of pay of Office establishment in' ieisia ana the xersian G-ulf • I have the honour to refer to your letter 1,0.822/86(2)- datea 14th March 19^3, asking for my proposals for the :4 r ' .Ss** m &amp;»- revision of Office hstaolishiaents in Persia ani the Persian (?ull', hi accordance with the terms of your letter of the : r ,7 Wth January 1922 in which increases of pay to these establish- .jy ments uad been sanctioned subject to future reconsideration. ; f • &lt;7 ® 0V8rnmeflt of India then suggested that part of the increases of pay should oe regarded as 'bonuses IK liable to reduction” as the cost of living falls; and I understand that although Government ao not expect that an immediate i' abolition of these bonuses is practicable in view of the present level of prices in Persia, they consider that it may oe possible to effect a curtailment of expenditure in this way in the future. They also suggest two other ways of achieving the same object, namely (a) reduction of work with due regard to efficiency, (so as to permit of a reduction of staff) ana (b) the adoption of the principle of payment for services rendered to the public. 2. I now beg to ancles e for the information of the Governmek of Inaia a note on the subject prepared by Consul General for Meshed, In forwarding this note to me Colonel Prideaux observed that 'it seems questionable whether the cos; \ living will ever fall to the figures exi; ting before the war; ana I doubt the expediency of reducing our staffs f emoluments as proposed for so negligible a gain'. This opinion is precisely the same as that which I have arrived at altea consultation with the Political Officers serving under me*3o far as it is possiole to do without iaating elaoorate xx£ statistical enquiries, which in any case would De far from reliable , I huvo come to the conclusion that the level of prices for the principal necessities of life in Bushire is aoout the same now as it was in 1922 and 1921, that is slightly higher than in 1920* In Bahrain. Kuwait and Bandar nbbas there appears to have been a slight drop; in Muscat prices are apparently double what they were in 1920. Generally the price of labour, which is a most important consideration, remains unduly high. It is, however, almost impossible to arrive at the true state of affairs as regards - the cost of living - for | clerical establishment in Persia and the iersian Gulf; the large f area concerned, the wide difference in the price of different commodities in different places, and the difference in the relative importance ol many articles of consumption among the various communities, preclude anything other than the most general estimate which is that, having regard to all the factors concerned, the level of prices in Persia is very much the same now as when the establishments were originally revised. There is no justification, therefore, in my opinion, or in that oi any political ol fleers serving under me, foi remeving now on the score of greater cheapness of living, the bonuses granted two years ago. 3. There is nothing to indicate that prices are likely to return to the normal in the near future in Persia and the Persian Gulf. But even should the unlikely happen and prices levels; materially come down, I am of the considered opinion tnat there should not be any further revision, on that account, of the present rates of pay of the office establishments workirg in this Residency, and I beg most earnestly to request Government definitely to accept these rates as permanent and not liable to reduction. I do not think that clerks are overpaid now, or having regard to the general conditions of service in Persia, wouldI woulci oe overpaid even ix the cost of living were to ooiob down ! s tantially, the Government have admitted the difficulty of manning the Persian and Gulf ports, owing to the peculiar condi tions of service and the competition of commercial firms; and these difficulties are emphasized by all the officers serving in tae ulf, n.G.i,,. consul lor Arabistan in particular refers to the very strong induceme nt which, even at present rates of pay, Indian clerks have to resign Government scjrvice ana join the angle xersian Oil Company. In addition, the knowledge that -heir pay may at some future date be reduced is bound to have a most unsettling effect on clerks working in the Gull and seriously to discour^g© recruitment, uven if it could oe proved to their entire satisfaction at some future date that prices have gone down beyond any question, the simultaneous re auction of pay would be bourn to cause great discontent however carefully it may be insisted on before num that part of their increased pay is liaole to reaction. The carrying out of that measure wouln cause a general grievance, and the reply would inevitably follow tliat ii prices have fallen work has increased, figures collected in the iiushire Residency Office of letters and telegrams received ana despatched would undoubtedly support such an xg argument, uhile 1921 was a lighter year than 1920, 1922 was heavier than either; and 1923 bids fair to exceed all three. I do not then consider that the offices in the Persian Gulf are overstaffed, or the clerks overpaid; and I venture to appeal to the generosity of Government not to economise in its expendi ture in the i ox si an Gulf at the expense of their Mh hard-worked clerical establishments. Colonel i rideaux described the resultant gain to Government as Negligible 1 and I oeg leave to support that view. Prom the statement which accompanied your letter of the 30th January 1922 it appears that the increases to the office establishments part of which are to be considered as Nonuses Liaole to reduction 1 amount to As.61,900 in the year. Prom this figure we may tame Ils.6290 the yearly cost of the ^hushtar;• % JtasMu- Ocmlar iwncy rtioh h«s teen aoeli.hen. Ihre romains te.53,903.

The reduction contemplated in the cos* of (“) is 15)4 i.e. Bs.2340/- a0 ig 5( ^ i&lt;6&gt; Hs. 19150/- The total annual expenditure - auditable am non auditable grants - on rersia and the Persian Gulf is, roughly, 15 lakhs of rupees excluding such items as lighting and buoying oi the Gulf etc.). It follows that the gain to Government if those reductions were carried out would be in case of new posts 0 . 6 $ and in the case of old post 1.28 of not even the whole expenditure of Government on Persia and the lersian Gulf, duch a trifling gain Government would mean a serious and utterly disheartening loss to a very loyal class of Government servants working under the “lost tlying conditions and would adversely affect the efficiency of Government work. 4 * '“ S regarcls reduction of work, which 1 have already x touched upon, I confess I find it very difficult to see how any reduction can be effected so long as our political commit ments not only remain as they were before, but actually increase. I need only refer in this connection to the steady extension of t tte P., siM Oil C, WS interests , in J . r L tbe rersian Gulf, and the addition to the responsioilities of the Political flesident of the affairs of the *mir of Uejd. On the Contiary, so materially is the work increasing in the Bushire and oatirein offices, particularly in the vernacular branches, that I fear I shall do compelled shortly to ask Government to give me assistance in dealing adequately aixt expeditiously with the added volume of work which I am now charged with. There is no possibility, that I can see, of reducing returns or superfluous correspondence sufficiently to enable any office mine Gulf to reduce its establishment. I shall impress on all my officers the necessity of pruning work am«nd correspondence to the smallest pcssiole extent; but in spite of every endeavour to the contrary the inevitable tendency is for work to increase, But I would take this opportunity cl asking you to assist us in this matter by directing that when documents are sent to me which are intended to be circulated to sub-offices, a sufficient number of printed or type written copies may oe sent ne for the purpose of distribution. If frequently happens that lengthy audit resolutions, or other instructions are sent to me of which my office has to make out other copies for distribution. The time spent on this copying is very heavy; and ii it sea could be saved it is not unlikely that I could reduce my office establishment by one clerk, h. There remains the question of applying more extensively the princple that the cost of definite services should ioe covered by suitable fees. I am addressing you separately on tins point. The result of the enquiries I have made from l consular Officei s is that considerable increase of income is possicle if fees are more strictly insisted on in future; but it would be unsafe to make any definite forecast. 6. Another direction in which some saving to Government can oe effected is in the non-audit able grants of this Residency. In the current year’s Budget which has just been received, I have been allotted gr nts for 'office allowance' in the different offices which include the cost of salaries of certain establishments which used to oe paid from office allowances but have since oeen made pensionable and transferred to auditable charges. The sums so transferred which are no longer a charge on our x non-auditable grants amount to Bs.13,974/for the whole of the i ersian rulf; and this amount I am ready to relinquish to Government. I am writing to you separately about this, further in view of the pressing need for retrenchment I am urging ail officers subordinate to me to use the utmost economy this year in their expenditure from non-auaitable grants; and to subject these grants to the closest pox personal scrutiny with —mmm( Z£5 a view to the possioility ,f a reduction next year. 7. The outcome of the above considerations is that so far as th mam subject of your letter is concerned, the reduction of office establishaeuus, I am unaole to make any practical suggestion. Hyself and every officer whom I have consulted are of the opinion .that at present no saving can be effected by the reduction of jestablishments; that having regard to the conditions in which Ithey live and work there is no sufficient justification for the jredu ction of their emoluments; and that the hardship which such P “ easure would i™olve is out of all proportion to the small jprofit which Government would make. In conclusion we are unanimous m hoping that taking the circumstances into considera tion Government will be pleased to remove this x sword of Damo cles suspended over the heads of the office establishment in rersia, and stabilize their emoluments at the rates already sanctioned. nealizmg as I do how difficult the financial situation is I deeply regret that my answer is so unsatisfactory. The conclusion however seems inevitable that, if real retrenchment m the i ersian Gulf is to be arrived at, it may be achieved not by cutting off the leaves Out oy lopping off the branches, i-ie cost of oui oiiice establishments bears a very modest and a very reasonable proportion to our total expenditure in these regions (less than 5^); am in my opinion their strength is only oarely in keeping with the scale of the responsibilities and commitments of H.II.Government. Until the latter are reduced, I fear it is impossible to economise in the former.iiOte on the 'roveriniient oi Indian enquiry as to the possibility oi revising the arrangements sanctioned for 192&lt;3- 23 ior the office establishments in iersia and the ieisian Gulf* 1.

The existing fees charged under the Consular Instructions cannot be properly enhanced. They already bear a surcharge. The revenue derived from fees is remitted quarterly to the foreign Office, London, n statement showing the Consular fees recovered during each of the three years ending 1922 is submitted. I’o Court fees have been levied in this period, as no cases have been tried under the lersian Order in Council. In Karguaari Court cases, the successful litigants pay a tax of 5-/0 on their decree to the Karguzar. u . . 3d.

In particular you suggest the ^ increase of fees for passports and for registration of British subjects. Before your letter reached me I had received a letter from Lir.H.G.Ohick, 0.1.1. His La jesty 1 s Consul at Shiraz dealing* with the very same subject with the xx object of increasing the receipts of Consulates in Persia and to emphasize the commercial dependence of Persian trade on British and India relations, good will and shipping. Mr.Chick last December suggested to the Minister at Tehran the f, s trie ter application of the Consular Pees Order in Council to Persia” and he made certain definite proposals which I shall det.il later on to this end. Sir Percy Loraine concurred generally in Mr.Chicks ideas and said that he was ready to put some such suggestions before H.M.Poreign Office after Mr. Chick had consulted a port Consulate such as Bushire. Mr.Chick then wrote to me. I have considered his suggestions - after consulting other Consular Officers in the Gulf - and I now propose to submit my comments on them to you, and to send copies of this letter to the Minister in Tehran for such action as he may consider advisable.2. (2*0 Mr• Chick T s sugg'estions, in his own words, are as follows:- (i) Pee 36. Certificates of origin of goods (from the province of the exporters) should, I suggest, he made compulsory, by special instructions from the Home Government and Government of India to shipping companies and Customs authorities, before any goods are shipped from Persian ports to $reat Britain and India, igypt, etc. This of course would not mean one certificate for every package, but for every consignment. (ii) Pees 40 and 41 might be specially required by the jport authorities at Karachi, Bombay, Basrah as well as in the British Dominions and Great Britain in respect of all Persian sailing and other vessels, sailing to ports in British possession or control. Such certificates to be given by the Consulates in the Persian Gulf. (iii) Pee 42. Manifests of all cargoes shipped in such vessels to have a consular certificate, or a list of cargo to be made out and certified to by the Consular Officer of the nearest Persian Port. (iv) Pee 34. Bills of Health similarly. (v) Pees. 59,61,68. The Courts in India (and Mesppotia?) to be asked to insist on the production of a British Consular attestation on every Persian document or statement of claim presented. (vi) Pee 70. British and Indian merchants and firms having recognised agents, whether with or without Power of attorney in Persian provincial centres to require the said agents to register their names as such at the Consulates. British and Indian merchants having sums in excess of £500, or say £ 1000, outstanding by any Persian client for more than one year to give notice to the Con sulate through the Said client for registration of the existence of such indebtednesso (vii) Pee 80 h Consular transit pass, addressed by Consu lates in the interior to the Consulate at the nearest port to be required from the Provincial centre of the Persian concerned in the casecase of every Persian proceeding to the British Dominions, Indi^ Basrah, *&gt;r t o ports. I regard this measure as extremely important in view of the movements of Persian Bolshevist agents. Persian passports are only issued at the ports; and neither the British . Consular Officer at a Persian port, nor for that matter the Persian Passport authorities have any satisfactory evidence on which to rely as to the real origin of the individual applying for visa. This can to some extent he ascertained in the inland provincial centres and Consulates. (vm) Pee 67. British Consular attestation of the Bhara (religious) or other Persian Court certificates as to the rightful heirs to the property of Persians dying in British territory (and kesopotamia?) to he required by the local authorities. 3. I shall now consider these in their order:- (1) i!e„ 36. yjrvmeate Qi wngm of g 1 QQds..». This is already com pulsory for goods sent to the United States of nmerica from Muscat and Bushire; and the Consulates at these ports issue a fair number of certificates each year. Bushire h_s also granted a few for Germany which requires them under the Separation (Hecovary) let of 1921. If these certificates were mads compulsory for goods sent from every Gulf port to Great Britain, India, or other British territory and Egypt, the revenue which might be anticipated would ^ no doubt he considerable. But to bring this about would require fresh legislation in Great Britain and each of her Colonies and dependencies; and as presumably the new rules would have to apply not to Persia only but to all foreign countries, the question seems to he one of very great magnitude involving far greater issues than that merely of increasing Consular fees in the fersian Gulf. In addition the Consul Bandar abbas (Mr.Pagan) opposed this fee on the ground that it would not he levied at the smaller ports there is no Consular Officer, and that in consequence shippers would have to call at Consular ports in order to obtain the certi ficates, and thereby suffer much expense and trouble. (2) ices 40,41 flartlfigates ag t? orqw and muster roll s, signature, (3) Pee 42 on manifests.Th9 /ic9 '° 0nsu l* ^ushire, and the Consul, Bandar Abbas are both opposed to these fees. They point out that the result revenue would be small and the trouble and inconvenience to trade considerable. The effect of imposing these fees would also be to Place an unfair tax on the British Imia steam Navigation Company and Messrs. Strick &amp; Co; whose steamers are the only ones which would not be lixely to evade them and whose returns alone could be checked without great difficulty, mj.Pagan's conclusion that 'the proposed innovations might entail more inconvenient and indirectly, expense for merchants and others than would be warrantee by the corresponding increase in revenue, and might even lead local merchants to look for other routes' is one which I am incline to agree with. (4; Fee 34 .Bill of dealt.ru The Consul, Muscat, leaves this fee; and the Consul, Bandar Abbas, is in favour of it. Objections similar to those already noted in the case of ships' manifests etc might be raised. (5) Pees 59, 61, 66. Attesta tion of documents in th« Omn-to In his letter, to me Mr .Chick explains that he means his proposal to apply to iersians actually resident in Persia; and that he has in mind cases when a iersian iilersia has a claim in I~ndia, or wishes to carry out some transaction in India; and he considers that British Indian Courts might with advantage be directed to insist on documents stamped by a British Consul in support of the Persian's claim or representation. I agree with Mr.Chick as regards fees 59 and 61. As regards fee 68 I am unable to support Mr.Chick. This fee refers to the fee for each signature attested by a Consular Officer in any document not otherwise provided for. This would practically apply to every scrap of documentary evidence tendered in court, and the obvious case occurs of admissions signed without full realization of the consequences entailed. The signatory might quite well regret his signature and refuse to have it attested and it would be very unfair to the other party to rule that such documents could not be tendered in evidence for want of attestation by a British C onsular 0 ffioer&gt;1922 (6) tfee 70. Registration. The compujsory registration in Oonsulate of British and Indian iiierchants and firms, and their recognised agents might give rise to an undesirable impression that \?e were trying to protect these agents; and that registration was merely the thin end of the wedge for seducing Persian subjects from the ^ allegiance to Persia. For that reason I think this proposal of Mr.Ohick’s should be approached with great caution. I am even more doubtful of the advisability of enforcing the registration of outstanding claims as this might be understood to commit the Consulate to action on behalf of the claimants without further effort on their part, ouch registration might also lead to litigation regarding the correctness of the amounts alleged to be outstanding. Furthermore it is. an interference with the liberty of British subjects; and, more than that, it might well be resented by the debtors as tending to shake their credit and leading to quarrels, which are quite likely enough to arise of themselves between British creditors and foreign debtors without the further stimulus of registration. ^ (7) Fee BO.A. Transit Pass. This fee is regularly levied in ^ Bushire, and presumably elsewhere at 1 gold franc under Foreign Office orders. The transit visa proposed by Mr.Ohick is an entirely different matter however and would be an innovation which the Persian Government would certainly resent; and I think with reason. Moreover it would be impossible to enforce this rule as many people come from remote villages and districts and would have to go far out of their way to obtain a British Q^ovisul's visa. I regret that I cannot support Mr-Ghick*s proposal. (d) Fee 67. attestation of Foreign signatures . Ms fee is realized at Shiraz, Bushire and Ahwaz, and other GonsularSi Officers are in favour of its imposition. I agree. 4. I now come to the two concrete suggestions made in your letter namely that the fees for registration of British subjects and for the passports should be increased. Neither is possible without the consent of His Majesty’s Government. As regards registration H.M.Government has only recently fixed the fee at Ile.l/- in the1922 amendments to the various Orders in Council and I do not recommend its increase at present. The fee a for passports laid down in the Consular Fees Order in Council (fee No.76) is already in my opinion high enough. But in commection with the issue of passports and the collection of Consular fees on that account, I am satisfied that a stricter application of the rules would yield a substantial increase to the revenue. It is necessary to explain here that in the ports of the Persian Gulf a very lazge number of those who apply for sqE passports to Iraq or I^ndia, are pilgrims or very poor persons who simply cannot pay the prescribed fee of approximately 8 shillings. For this class of person an old establisned custom, lias sanctioned the issue of a document known as a cer tixicate of identity for v/hich one rupee (collected in rupee stamps) is charged. This practice has great advantage^ indeed if the purpose of a passport were insisted on in these cases quite half the people vdio apply for permission to gdjto Iraij on pilgrimage would be unable to do so. But I believe that some laxity has grown up in this matter, and Consular Officers - wit] the oest intentions - have allowed the privilege to be abused, giving certificates of identity at iaxa* Re.l/~ each to a very large number who, if careful enquires were made, would be proved to be well able to afford the fee for a passport. What a strict enforcement of the rules can achieve is shown in the case of the Bushire Consulate (see Appendix VI) where recently the fees for passports have risen from an average of £4-10-0 for the 3 quarters ending March, June and September 1922, to £.182-11-0 in the December quarter of 1922, £162-16-0 in the March quarter of 1923, and £71-0-1 in the June quarter of this year. The present Vice-Consul, Mr.Gardener*s experience is that of the total number of passports and visas issued about one-half should be issued at full Foreign Office rates, and one-half at Indian rates. The returns of fees furnished by the Consul, Bandar Abbas, (Appendix III) illustrates well how possible receipts are being given away. In over 5 quarters his Foreign Office fees amount to total of only £2-2-0 while in the same period his endorsements or visas on Persian passports realized R s .684. In addition hegave 327 visas free. There Mere therefore over 1000 applicants. If 500 of these had been forced to pay full fees, and the rest given certificates the income would have been £200 and hs.500 - a loss of Bs.184 and a gain of nearly £198. The Mohammerah figures are even more telling (ippendix V). In 1922 1961 persons were given certificates of identity. If even one-third of these had been made to take out passports there would have been a gain of 650 x 8 shillings = £260 against a loss of £43. Possioly other Consular Officers might quarrel with Mr. Gardener's estimate of the proportion of applicants who can afford to pay the full fees. But it is perfectly obvious that as things «re ^ valuable source of revenue is being thrown away; and I am confident that ii Consular Officers go into the question care fully and strictly limit the issue of the rupee certificates to really deserving cases, as I am now instructing them to do, a large increase of income will follow. 5. finally a suggestion has been made to me, by the Vice-Consul, Mohcammerah, which I think well worth serious consideration. It is that fee 113 should be ,levied; that is to say the 5&gt; commission charged, in respect of every sum recovered through Consular Officer’s efforts or good offices in the Karguzarat Court or in any other way. This commission has never been levied in Persia- but I see no reason against its being introduced and credited to Government. If this is sanctioned the resultant revenue will be very considerable; equally considerable will be the relief to Consular Officers from the nuisance of interesting themselves in and supporting countless petty claims put forward by petty traders over whose litigious propensities the restraint of having to pay a commission would be a salutary check. I venture strongly to commend Mr.Lincoln's suggestion to the notice of the Government I of India. 6.

I /V ii/ &lt;?=c I have the honour to reter to para. 5 of your letter, No. 297 / 80 -nst.,cated 30th January 1922Revision of pay of office establishment in the Persian Gulf and Persia’, &gt; n which ttxt&amp;Z it is laid down that the tenure of L.ne post of Attache and Extra Assistant Residents should ore inarily be limited to a period of 5 years. In this connection I beg to point out that the increments for u-nese posts cover a period of 5 years,so that the in cumbent only reaches the maximum pay in his fifth year, after which he has,in the ordinary course of events, to retire on pension* Under the pension rules,however, Articles 474,485 and 487,C.S. R # ,the pension allowed is ho.If cue average pay drawn during the last 3 years of service. 1 tom this it will oe seen that it is impossible for any one to draw the full pension of any of these SiaSx&amp;x posts,unless he is given 2 years extension,and such an extension has only to be granted in exceptional cases. This I think constitutes a distinct hardship on the persons holding such appointments, as although an incumbent of one of these posts may have completed a long term of meritorious service and be in every way entitled to a full pension,he is-unable to draw it not having completed 3 years in the highest grade,possibly o m ing to age or other circumstances which should in any way militate against him. % In these cl rcumstances there appearto be two courses c open_which would overcome this objection.(i)To increase the initial pay of the post by Rs. 50/-**each^ a 3 by doing so( 3l so an incumbent would reach the maximum after 2 years service in the post and could then do 3 more years which would entitle him to draw full pension, or (ii) to in crease the increments from Bs. 20/- to Rs. 50/- and reduce the period from five to two years, which wfimld have a similar result. The post of Assistant Secretary is slight ly diiferent and I would recommend that the initial pay be raised to Rs. 500/- from Rs. 475/- and the two annual increments to Rs. 50/- each. Otherwise in this case the annual increments will have to be raised to its. 62/8/- to bring this post under the same conditions. Of the two courses I think the second would probably recommend itself to the Government of India as being the less expensive. I attach herewith a list of appointments with their pay, which would be affected by the change, it will be seen tuat the appointments are not many and the expense involved is not great and I would venture to press for i sanction as it would remove what is felt ^ be a very te.:A.l grievance. I may state that owing to the nresent rules I have had already applications requesting that the maximum pay may be granted owing to the impossibj 11 ty of a full pension otherwise. There is also another aspect of the case which I respectfully uring forward and this is that,if my proposal is sanctioned ,it would take away any excuse to recom mend any person for retention in such appointments,after he has served his o years,simply in order that he may be able to enjoy the full pension of the post. \s&gt;j( y Copy of a letter No. 1407 .dated 11th August 19.00, i^om the Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bush!re, to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment. proposal ior certain Government officials serving in the Persian Gulf clerical establishment to draw the maximum pay of their post under the Revision Scheme of pay sanctioned on 31st January 1922. I have the honour to toward herewith a list of Government officials serving in the Persian Gulf clerical establishment, who, I strongly recommend,may be allowed to draw the maximum pay of the grade in which they are serving. I have noted against each of them the special reasons why I am making a recoramendati on,but I would also add the following remarks which apply to them all. The recommendations for the increase of pay recently sanctioned was made from dat^ collected in 1919,and the ^ cost of living in the Gulf has again increased since then,and all business firms here have experienced this, and have been forced to raise the pay of all their clerks. The rates given by theseg firms no^ make it worth while for clerks in Government service in the Persian Gulf,even in the higher grades,to resign Govern ment service and their pensions and take employment in such firms as the Anglo-Persian Gil Company,Strick Scott &amp; Co. , Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Ltd.,etc. , who are always on the look out for good clerks. Several of the clerks now recommended are simply waiting to see whether the present conditions are likely to be bettered before applying ‘for such posts,and I am certain their services would be at once accepted by some of the above mentioned business concerns. Another point is that not very many of the clerical establishment in the Persian Gulf serve their full time icr pension, owing to the unhealthy climate in whichthey have to serve,and. they trust to he able to save it is impossible to do so in Government service,but it ihen,certain clerks of the Persian Gulf establish ment were lent to Mesopotamia during the war,and there they they have had to revert to,and though I readily admit that this in itself is no reason why their pay should be increased when they return,yet these men have been used to a much higher style of living during the last 5 or 6 yea ts,c‘.dq it is very difficult for them at once to cut it goto all together. Mr. M. A. Fernandez for instance has had to o-rop from Rs. 700/- per mensem to Rs. 200-10-250;this is a tremendous drop and he and others in the same position are naturally rather disillusioned and discontented. In conclusion I would point out that,if these f senior men were to leave Government service,and I consider It most probable that they ’'ill do so, as I am convinced they will find no difficulty in getting posts on much better pay,if the maximum is not granted,it will be very difficult for me to carry on, as very few of my junior clerks have as yet the necessary experience. The work and the responsible nature of the duties of these head clerks, especially those serving in Muscat and Arabistan.are such that it is very necessary to have trustworthy capable and experienced men there,while in almost all the Agencies and Consulates the head clerk has to carry on in sole charge for some period of the year when the Political Agent or Consul is away on tour or recess. For these reasons I request that the Government of India may be pleased to sanction the rates of pay proposed in the attached list with effect from 1st April 1922. enough to enable teem to retire before earning full pen sion. In these days owing to the high cost of living can be done in business firms.where a man.can often save more than what his pension from Government service would save gi ve him. drew very much higher rates of pay than those to which If« II' these proposals are sanctioned,It will be necessary^to gt’ant the extra amount which will not he very much,hy special allotiBEnt to cover the expenditure, as it is impossible for me to do so with the funds at» my disposal,which are mi cut down to the lowest limit.li-le ^ sg., | 408 J From- The toreifei secretary ftp ^HO^ venj ment of India - 11 t ' iae Foreign and Political Department,Simla, To - The hon’tle the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf ,Bushire. ; o. 3064/86(2}-Bst.

The first is that you should examine the possibility of educing work, such as the submission of reports etc. ,y to the greatest extent possible with due regard to efflci ency. The second is by the adoption of a principle recom menced in the Geccee' Report on retrenchment, that where a Government department performs definite services for the puoli.c, the cost of the services should be covered, as far as P 088 - 1316 . cy the imposition of suitable fees. The Govern ment of India realise that a great deal of the gratuitous work done in the Persian Gulf is performed without a charge for political reasons. They feel that as foreign competition is for the present small, it may- be possible to increase • existing fees and to institute fees for services which have hitherto been performed without charge. For example,it might be possible to increase the fees charged for pass ports, for the registration of British subjects and other similar services. A statement should be submitted showing tfte average receipts for Court fees,Consular fees etc. , in the various posts. •I. A reference is invited to your letter No. 1407,dated tne l.:tn irjjgust 1922 in which you proposed that certain Government officials serving in Persia and the Persian Gulf should oe permitted to draw the maximum rjay of their posts on coming under the revision of pay sanctioned in 1922 and to memorandum No. 1791,dated the 30th September 1922 regarding the conversion of the non-pensienable services of certain clerks serving in Persia and the Persian Gulf to pensionable service.

In view,however, of the uncertainty caused by the necessity t&gt;r a revision of the pay of the * establishments 5n Persia and the Persian Gulf at the beginning of the financial year 1923-24 and of the fact that expenditure in Persia and the Persian Gulf has recently been the subject of a reference to His Majesty’s Government and has also been under the survey of the Retrenchment Committeeon-lttee .the Govemmejit hkve postponed consider tion of your 1 proposals.iut would b&lt;? •1 «ri -iw ation of your proposals,jjut had if you would include any reconmendatlm W g ay wish to make m - yM a « :ao „ bete 1JStruct -j; o submit. 4.

Department. Three points raised by the Foreign Office letter of 21 st December 1921 require to be dealt with:- (1) the Treasury stipulation that no part of the compensation which may have to be paid on the abolition of the staff posts concerned shall fall on the Imperial Exchequer. ( 2 ) the Treasury demand that the post at Shuster should continue to be a charge upon Mesopotamian funds. ^ ‘ ^ t) l) f ^ ( ( (3) the Treasury suggestion that there should be an enquiry into the comparative cost of the maintenance of the consular posts in Persia in the British and Indian spheres* Consideration of these points has been delayed in the hope of receiving by mail a copy of the detailed orders passed by the Government of India on the Secretary oi State’s telegram of 7 th January, which woui-Q have rendered it possible to inform the Treasury what steps had been taken to give effect to their stipulation that a suitable proportion of the increase of pay should be regarded as a bonus reducible when the cost of livin^ppreciably falls. This is, however, not essential, and further delay in dealing with the three points noted above appears inadvisable. (1). The exact meaning of this stipulation is not clear. It may have the narrower meaning that the Treasury refuse to share in compensation paid on account of the abolition of any of the appointments which they consent should now be set up, or the broader meaning that they refuse to share in the compensation paid for the abolition of any post, however old- 2847—2 3000 12/20 [2503] establishedestablished, which has now been placed on a pensionable basis. There is also the question of the exact shade of meaning involved in the phrase 'any compensation which mav have to be paid!! One can conceive two forms in which the question of compensation might arise. The Government of India might propose in the event of the abolition of a post that some special sum in compensation should be paid to the incumbent. If the Treasury mean that they would not share the cost of such a proposal, I think that they are within their rights in making such a reservation. On the other hand if the fact of a post being pensionable involves automatically the acknowledgment of a claim for compensation from its incumbent on the abolition of the post, I do think that the Treasury can refuse to share such compensation. They benefit automat ically from the abolition of the post and cannot claim to leave the equally automatic debit to the share of the Government of India. Perhaps the Financial Secretary will say whether an automatic claim to compensation arises in general practice on the abolition of pensionable posts. I cannot help thinking that ithe Treasury insistence this point is oue to an inadequate grasp of the cadre system as worked in India. It is extremely unlikely that if any post were abolished its incumbent would be thrown out of employment and thereby have a claim for compensa tion. It would simply mean a slowing-up of promotion in that cadre, and a decrease in the number of entrants accepted; a wholesale abolition of posts would of course involve dismissal of personnel, but that is extremely unlikely. ( 2 ) We cannot, I think, ignore the Treasury’s reservation in regard to Shuster; otherwise they will refuse to pay when the claim comes to be made. It will be bufficieno to point out the impossibility of asking the Arab State of Iraq to pay for a British Political Agency.Minute Paper. n ■ C Department. Agency.

Financial Secretary, Since the above was written, we have received the Government of India’s telegram No. 685 S. of the 28th May, which shows^that the Government of India has seised on the Foreign Office proposal that Mesopotamia should pay for the Shuster post, and proposed that, failing this, the post should be abolished. The draft has been modified to take note of this. Does the Financial Secretary concur in the draft? I am very doubtful as to the distinction drawn by Mr. Simpson in his minute (and in his draft, this portion of which is retained in the modified draft below) in regard to Treasury liability for compensation* It seems to me reasonable that we should expect the Treasury to share anv compensation that ’has to be paid’, whether under rule or as a matter of equity in special cases. I should be glad of the Financial Secretary’s views on this point. /. iL „ A~t . A2.C,, R O J . J 2847—2 3000 12/20 [2503]Draft Paper. I 2224 Department. Jhe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.

On the assumption that it reuers to posts which have been made pensiohahle under the scheme which has received Their rdship's approval the Secretary of ate agrees that if the Government of India were to put forward proposals for the grant of special cdrnpensation to the? incumbent of any such post on its abolition he would/not seek to have a moiety of such compensation accepted as a charge upon Imperial Revenues; such compensation, however, as wouldbe payable by/rule on the abolition of a pensionable post he considers should be accented in moiety as a charge upon the Imperial Exchequer which, as jnefits automatically from the discontinuance of the salary attached b the post in question,should accent Nf ts share of the compensation incolved //Your letter states further that the assent of the (yK ' 1 / ^ 4 ^ &lt;, /v “[) ^ L. /U -^Ux, ^ % ^ fat. ,ix i ^ ‘w ' * ^ ^ ^ , 1Draft Paper.

The Government of Indj.a in paragraph 6 of their telegram of the 25th May recommend that, if the High Commissioner is unwilling to meet the charge, the post should be discontinued. This recommendation will be considered with the other proposals put forward in the Government of India's telegram. Meanwhile Lord Peel hopes that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, ^ fJwrxArtx, assuming that he aggess that the proposal that Irak revenues should pay is not one -A/r thai can- properly be made to the High Commissioner, will urge the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury to accept as a charge on Imperial revenues a moietj of the expenditure already incurred at Shuster, and of further expenditure so long as the post is retained. wU: - D- ' ETVFrom Sited Received Viceroy 9 Foreign &amp; Political Dept t; Secretary oT State for iiidiao Simla, 25th May, 1922c 8 a.ono 0 26th May, 1922c i 'I .F.0oC o Co1906) S35**So Your telegram of the 28th Janua y o' o $ 36 &gt; Arab 1 at an c ParaoNodo He recommend following measures as purely provisional arrangement up till March 1st, 1923, pendiiig consideration b Rebrenohmono Oommattee ox the wnji j case of ezpordiuure in Persian Goi \ AhTOZo Consul for Arabistan (superior post) usually officer of about 15 years 5 Civil Service^with Vice-Consul of about 7 years 5 service, ; Kohaamerah and Dizfulo Vice-Consuls of about 10 years’ serviceo Cost, varies., but maximum, if all posts held by nembers of Indian Civil Service, is Rs.,5.,750 a monoho We recommend for all officers,special pay of RsoSOO a month in view of hardship, climate,, nsponsibility and expense, and for Consul at Ahwaz and Vice-Consul at, Mohansnerah and Dizful, RsolC-O, sumptuary,, Mohomerah post is much more expensive than any which would ordinarily he neld »y a jura. officer, and we reconmend that, in addition t /%hcu'.i :ace, • compensatory allowance of HsciCC' a, monuho Para„Noo2, In consultation with Colonel Trevor 8 we have decided,though with regret, and only in view of financial stringency to abolish the post o.

That being so it is hardly surprising that the Foreign Office and the Treasury should boggle at the proposals, especially as part of their avowed purpose is to undo certain economies effected in 1912. It might be as well to advise the Government of India that the full and prompt concurrence of the Treasury can only be obtained in these times for a case that is very clearly established. There is some confusion about the terms used in connection with the pensionary proposals. Colonel Trevor goes into little detail on this point, but he speaks of all ’ministerial 1 posts being pensionable. The Government of India consider it essential that all ’clerical 1 posts should be pensionable and put the additional cost at not more than Rs.92C per mensem^ 4 (I n many cases the pensions would be very small but would make a big difference to the officer. For instance a pension of Rs.25 to a clerk on Rs„50 pay would be a very important matter to him, though, absolutely the sum is small]. The Treasury refuse to bear the cost of compensation if any of the new pensionable ’staff* appointments have to be abolished. (They presumably contemplate the possibility of British activities in Persia declining and of establishments being reduced accordingly in which case the increase of pensionable posts would be a misfortune).

L.D.Walcely, Esq.The Under Secretary of State. • Foreign Office. 10 2054—2 2000 8/20 I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to reply to your letter Fo, K. 10811/ 425/234, dated the 11th August, regarding the pay of Office Estab- lis-liments in Persia and the Persian Gulf. It is understood that your letter, while expressing the view that the particular proposals submitted by the Government of India ere premature, is not intended to throw doubt on the necessity of making some improvement in the rates of pay in question, and in view of the urgent representa tions received as to the difficulties under which the Resident in the Persian Gulf is labouring in the absence of such improvement (vide Government of India 1 s telegrams Fos.1334,3st A, 1927,Est.A, and 2334 Est.A. dated 11th Kay, 13th July, and 22nd August), Kr. Kontagu would greatly regret the indefinite postponement of a. decision which would be involved if it were thought necessary to insist on the preparation and submission by the local author ities of a comparative statement as contemplated in para.2 of your letter, or a revised.scheme to meet the / —'Vthe objections raised in para.3, before the matter is further considered by His Majesty’s Government^ Ch© trusts therefore that it may be possible to agree forthwith upon some instructions to the Government of India that will obviate the necessity for further reference to His Majesty’s Government before final orders are pa.ssed. As regards the question raised in para. 2, Hr. Montagu would A deprecate the suggestion that it is desirable to apply such detailed further criticism to proposals for a revision of small local salaries that have evidently been carefully v/orh- ed out by the local officers and checked in detail by the Government of India (who are equally interested with the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury in securing economy in Y . ^ Pe!\si^n expenditureespecially v/here, as in this case, the total increase of expenditure involved is not large. The Secretary of State in Council does not however wish (although he had hoped that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury would be prepared, as he was, to accept the Government of India’s proposals as they stood) to press the same view in regard to the broader objections taken in para.3 of your letter. He would nevertheless suggest that these would be sufficiently met , if the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and tne Lords Commissioners of theDepartment Draft Paper. 1 txie Treasury still tliink it necessary to modify the Government of Indians proposals,by instructing the Government of India in consultation with the Resident in the Persian Gulf to earmark such portions of the increases of pay as may he thought appropriate (it being recognised that the recent increase in the cost of living was only one of several factors which necessitated the submission of the scheme under discussion) as * remunerative personal allowances, subject to revision after (soy) three years, the question of reduction of staff to correspond with any decrease of work to be considered after the same interval, Mr. Montagu trusts that Lord Curzon will now see his way to place the Government of Indian proposals, with this suggested modification , before the Lords Commissioners of the Treasury.

As regards the staff requirements of the various posts Lord Gurzon can only accept the views of your Department, and it is not possible for him to consider or criticise in detail the proposed rates of pay without reference to a comparative statement of pre-war rates and the increarje in the cost of living at the various posts, regarding which no information is given by you. 3. Prom a general point of view however, the proposals appear to Lord Cursor, to be open to the grave objection that no provision is made in the scheme for reductions either in pay or staff corresponding with any future fall in prices or decrease of work. Conditions are still abnormal everywhere and not least so in Persia and the present is not, in Lord CurzorM s opinion, a suitable time for fixing Establishments on a permanent and pensionable basis. For these reasons he thinks the proposals premature, and in view of the fact ■that their adoption would involve a heavy additional charge on Imperial Funds he is most reluctant, on the information at/ *■* 'he Under-Secretary of State, India Office.— -T-~r F©d/IA° ! 2267 ; •* 2' Q Q p Y 0- &amp;&amp;A From Dat-oti Received Viceroy, Forsiga &amp; Political Dep.^., V) Secretary or state for Indie-o Simla.

Irevo r, o.S.I., C.I *n*, Deputy Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Hon’ble Mr*. H. R.C.Dobbs, C.S.I., C.IMM, Foreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart; q r I have the honour to submit herewith a scheme for the 1 rev:l sion) w jr revision of mC. increase of pay to office Establishments in the Persian Gulf and Persia proper. 2 . I had hoped to submit these proposals earlier but various things combined to delay them. I had in fact prepared a scheme when my attention was celled to the time-scale system which had recent! v been sanctioned for the north west Frontier Province. Later tee question of including Meshed and Seistan in the scheme came up. The proposals now submitted suggest a. modified form of tine-scale and the ministerial staffs of the Consulate-General at Meshed and the Consulates at. Seistan and Kermanshah are included. If Shiraz eventually becomes an Indian Office, it can be included., the establishment being fixed on tie scale of tho Kerman Consulate. . 3. The last retd si on. of establishments of the Bushire Resi dency and its Bub-Offices occurred in 1912 when the Reduction Scheme was introduced. This scheme, sanctioned in Government \\&gt; of India letter No.2G85-Est.A. , dated 6 th July 1912, abolished 1 certain appointments and transferred others to the non-pension- able establishment. The posts (a) abolished and (b) transferred ^ere as foVMm (a) Superintendent pnd 2nd Treasury Clerk at Bushire. 3rd Clerk at Muscat. 2nd Clerks at Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas ,Kowe it and Kerman (b) 1 Camp Clerk, jj 2 Copyists 2 Murskis in. Bushire. at Bahrein. 1 interpreter l 1 interpreter at Muscat. 1 2nd Clerk at Kerman. 1 interpreter 5 1 2nd Clerk 1 Vernacular Clerk | guns his a t Ahwaz, Bandar Abbas and Koweit. As regards (a) the posts abolished, experience has shown that mostmost of them are necessary and that the work cannot he satis factorily carried on without them. As regards (h) the intro duction of the non-pen si onahle system has made Govemiment service in Persia and the Persian Gulf thoroughly unpopular and it has been found year hy year increasingly difficult to attract recruits. As • sjcesult of this vacancies ho ve remained unfilled for monihi s to tne detcii' lent both of Gover en1 Service and of the health of the reraaihi clerks who find t he-us elves overworke d. owing to the shortage of personnel, which has also made it n difficult to grant leave in m^y cases when leave was urgently and deservedly required. 4. in drawing up the present scheme the main objects in view have been to make service in Persia and the Persian Gulf attractive in order to maintain recruitment, to better the lot and future prospects of the existing ministerial establishment in view at the enormous increase in the cost of living,which, there is little reason to, doubt will be permanent and, in order to facilitate the achievement of the above to make all ministerial appointments pensionable. 5. Tne revision scheme proposes firstly to introduce a modified form of time-scale pay, as has been adopted in other Provinces, with certain additional all ministerial posts pensionable, certain new appointments. 6. It will be convenient to take a I lowance s, s e con o. xy co r uske and thirdly to create the last point first for 1 3rd Clerk.

A confidential clerk was or^iginally included in a re-organi zation scheme in 1905 out was struck out of tne final proposals submitted to Government on account of the difficulty of obtain ing the right stamp of man. ire third clerk ruscat has already ceen. sanctioned as a temporary measure and the Political Agent considers his retention an absolute necessity in order to carry on the work of the office efficiently* It is presumed that sooner or later ci^ful will again come under this Residency and tnat an Assistant Resident and Vice- Consul will be retained there, so provision is made for clerice1 establishment. All the remaining new appointments are necessary in the interests of the Service (and. in point of fact are mostly revivals of posts abolished in 1912) on account of climatg and other objectionable conditions, increase of work, and to provide a substitute for the head clerk when sick or absent on leave. 7. For many years prior to 1900 there were always 2 gazetted Officers, an Extra Assistant Resident and an un-covenanted Assistant at Bushire. In that year tie gazetted appointment of un-covenanted Assistant was reduced to a non-gasetted post of Superintendent. In tne 1912 reduction scheme it was thought that as a. Vice-Co.uSul had been appointed it would oe possible to abolish the post of Superintendent and have only the Extra Assistant to carry out the duties formerly carried out oy the ExtraExtra Assistant and Superintendent, Experience,,however, has shew that the appointment of a Vice-Consul has not materially reduced the work of the Extra. Assistant, who when he was British Vice-Consul, only did purely routine Consular work which did not occupy much time and one reduction of which has Deen more tnan made good uy the increase of the normal work of Ms appointment. Consequently it was found necessary to apply for the •services of a second gazetted officer and the post of Treasury Officer was created in 1914 for r period of two years, and in September 1916 it was extended for tne duration of the war and six months after. Under present circumstances this appointment will, I presume, cease to exist in 6 months time. Various letters $ No*1428 dated 4th May 1513 and ’ applying for the appointment of a No.1125 dated 26th June 1916. ’ r .— ♦ Treasury Officer and for his i retention in 1916, give details of the work he is called upon to perform, and I am strongly of opinion that, the work of tne Residency cannot be carried on efficiently witnout a second gazetted officer to do the Treasury and Accounts work. It may be mentioned that in addition to ordinary Treasury work tne Treasury Officer supervises tne accounts of the Residency, and is responsible for checKing ana supervising all the office accounts of the Sub-Offices* 8. For the above reasons I have included a second Extra Assistant Resident in my proposals under the style of 'Treasury end Accounts Officer'. The appointment of Extra Assistant Resident,Kerman has also oeen sanctioned as a temporary measure for the duration oi the war and for 6 months after* I have no definite information regarding the appointment of Deputy Assistant Political Officer at Kennanshah but I presume - it is on the same footing* 9* In regard to these two appointments, I beg to say that, if eventually there is to be a second British Officer es Vice- Consul or Assistant Political ufi'icer at each of these places, 1 consider the appointment of Extra Assistant Resident or DeputyDeputy Assistant Political Officer unnecessary, if it is not intended to retain Vice-Consuls or AS cH r&gt;+ Till et Kerinr. or Keirnanshaii, tne presence of an experienced Indian Officer to run the office, and take charge of the Consulate when the Consul is on tour, is very desirable. Further it is advisable to mention at this point a that I only suggest Head Clerks at Kernsnshah and Kerman if the posts of Extra Assistants at those places are allowed to lapse; I do not think there is any need for an Extra Assistant and a Head Clerk together at either place. 10. 'the post of Indian Assistant at b acre in was sanctioned in 1918 and is presumed to oe permanent; in these proposals I have altered the style of the appointment to Extra Assistant Resident to conform with the other appointments of similar standing which will be graded together. 11. My proposals for the sphere of tne Residency were prac tically complete when the Government of India (in Foreign and Political Department telegram No.2804-Est.A. dated 16th July i lS20)were pleased to suggest that the office establishments at Meshed and Seisten should be included in the scheme. Assuming that it is desired to include all Consulates officered from India, I have included Kemanshah Consulate also. References to these places have caused considerable delay, and it has onl^ been possible to conduct telegraphic correspondence so that 1 have not been able to go into detail as much as I should have desired. The Consular officers at Meshed, • Seistan and Hermansimu. however, approve of the proposal to place the oilice establish^ ments on the Residency time-scale ion promotion, and have approved the grades and rates of pay suggested, jy me. They have also suggested in which grade their respective officials should be, so there is no need for detailed comment irorn me. 12. The Hermans hah establishment has been modelled partly on the pre-war scale and partly on the analogy of Kerman. The present establishment is greatly in excess of this, but is maintained solely for military reasons and paid from Military Funds.7 KT7 Funds, I presume that even when things have settled down there will he a good deal work at Kemanshah in coimiec- tion with the raiitary Rest Camp and Hill Station at Kerind and in connection with- the use of Kermanshah itself as a summer resort; such work, however, has really nothing'to do with the Consulate as such and the extra staff required to deal witn it will, I imagine, he paid either, from ilitary Funds or Hesopotamia Revenues. 13. The time-scale is nodelled on the lines on which it has recently been introduced in the North West frontier Province with the difference that the minimum grade pay of the former is considerably higher than that of the latter with correspondingly higher pay through the succeeding grades, except the maximum grade which is less. The estab lishments are divided into incremental grades carrying a minimum pay of Rs. 100/- and maximum of ?; . 500/- with annual increments in the grade spread over 5 years. There are four grades for clerks and two grades for superior or gasetted Officers, IV present pay fn. 65 to 85 proposed pay ..100 - 120 III Present pay Ho. 90 - 120 Proposed pay .. 120 - 150 II Present pay ..120 - 150 Proposed pay. .. 150 -200 Present pay .. 150 - 130 Proposed pay .. 200 - 250 with intermediate scale gradations accord!

It will thus take 20 years for a clerk to rise to the maximum pay, if he passes from one grade to the next without a pause. As,however,grades I and II are almost entirely confined to the Head Clerics of tue various offices, -Clerks will have to wait for vacancies before they can be promoted to them. 1As regards taa superior ranks i.e. gazetted officers their grades will be as follows Grade.^resent nay Rs, 350 Proposed pay Rs. 400-20-500 Graded.

In the case o~* Kerman and Kemanshah should it be decided to retain ^xtra Assistant ResidentZat oresent /I consider that i Head Clerk Is unnecessary, on the other hard i' these gazetted posts are abolished then a Head Clerk -rad ii {ISO-1C-COO) is necessary. I consider that there is r-a objection go tne tenure o r the appoi''tmeuts of Extra Assistant grade A being held -'or a U nited time, At I consider that the time should be sufficiently ichg to enabl e tne incumbent to draw pension fixed on the fuD pay of tne post, and that therefore tenure should be fix'd at 3 years to* 4# O \J v to permit of this, or the increments might he increased to l:.:. 35/- per annum to enable the incumbent to reach the full salary at the couimenceraent of his fifth year, and his tenure ..night be limited to 7 years. If, however, the Government of India would prefer to limit the appointment of Extra Assistant ^irst grade to 5 years, w then I would suggest that the posts of Extra assistant 1st grade should carry a fixed salary of R . 500/- per mensem instead of an incremental salary of 400-20-500. By this scheme all ministerial officers will met an imediate increase pay, the increase ranging from 50 / in the case of lower paid clerks and 20;/ in the case o* 6 * the higher. The average immediate increase works out at approxi mately 33/ and the ultimate increase when a man has benefit- ted by the incremental scales will be 50/. 15. Duty Allowanc es. A duty allowance of Rs. 50/- each -or Extra Assi/tant Resident^ Treasury and Accounts Officer and Confidential Clerk at Bushire and for the Superintendent at Muscat has been pro posed; for the Extra Assistant Resident Bushire as his appointment is a responsible one and he will be the senior ”Un-covenanted' Official in the sms cadre; for the Treasury and Accounts Officer because he holds charge of the currency chest and stamps; ^or the Confidential Clertd ecause it is necessary to have a reliable man and one canno' be got unless he is well paid, and it was considered better to keen him in the 1st grade cr* Clerks than to make him an * Extra Assistant Resident; for the Superintendent at Muscat dor being Cub-Treasury O^icer vi • e my letter Mo *1352 dated A 13th .August 1920. i 7.
