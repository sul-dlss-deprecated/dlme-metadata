The writer, Sir Frederic Arthur Hirtzel, explores the opinions of the press regarding the correct way to implement such procedures in Turkey, and discusses the likely shift in international relations and the balance of power (particularly between Britain, Russia and Germany) should Germany succeed in its economic ambitions. Hirtzel also discusses the new tariff which has just been introduced to Turkey.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>India Office, Secretary to the Political and Secret Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Germany</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Turkey</geographic></subject><subject><topic>International relations</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tariffs</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000250#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
