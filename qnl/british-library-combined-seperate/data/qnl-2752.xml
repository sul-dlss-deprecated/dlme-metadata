An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 2-36; these numbers are also written in pencil and blue crayon, but are not circled, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. A previous foliation sequence, which is also circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains the application made by Frank Holmes for the Eastern and General Syndicate Limited to renew the 1925 oil concession in Bahrain.
