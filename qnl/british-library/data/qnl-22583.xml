The post of G.L.R. was created at the time The Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. transferred their rights under their exploration concession of the 2nd December 1925 to B apco. Condition C of the Schedule to the Indenture by which this transfer was effected provided for the maintenance by B apco 'at all times in Bahrain' of an official to be called 'the. Chief Local Representative of the Company' whose appointment was to be aporoved by H.I .G» and who would be the sole representat iVe of Bapco empowered to deal direct with the local authorities and population in Bahrain. It stipulated further that in all Company matters the C .L .R. should communicate with the Shaikh only through the Political A^ent, Bahrain, and named as first C .L.R, Major Frank Holmes, a British subject, vide page 64 of F.2/2-III n 2. H.II.G. had attached considerable importance-to the C .L.R. being a British subject and though this was not stipulated in the Indenture of 1930 a compromise was effected between H.I and Bapco's American principals, who had wished to choose a U.S. subject as C.L.R., by ap ointing Wajor Frank Holmes for a terra of 5 years or such lesser period as Bapco operated their explorat ion concession, provided the arrangement was mutually satisfactory to Bapco and Major Holmes (cf. pages 2-6 of F.lO/l-IV). 3. Unfortunately considerable embarrassment was caused H.M.G. by Major Holmes' multifarious activities and his long absences from Bahrain and H.T.G. was at last moved to infor'U Bapco that they considered the constant presence of the C.L.R. in B ahrain both necessary and stipulated by Condition C of the Indenture of, 193^ (s.45, enclosure 1, of F.lO/l-JV), at the same time letting Bapco know that I'ajor Holmes was no longer acceptable- to H.J .G. and that H.I .G. preferred that Mr. Skinner, Field Manager of Bapco and an American subject, should be appointed C.L.R., vide p.12 seq and s.45, enclosure 7, ibid. ^ 4. Mr. Skinner's appointment however %as a tern orary one (please see s.57 ibid) and during the negotiations for the 1934 Lease Mr. J.M.Russejj- of the I.iesopatamia Persia Trading Corporation, a British subject, was proposed and eventually appointed C.L.R. Please see in this connection Residency x.l. at page 196 of F.lO/l- VII which discusses status of post of C.L.R. as conceived at time. 5. Article XVI of the 1934 Lease (copy below) embodied in modified form Condition C of the 1930 Indenture but did not stipulate that the J.L.R. should be a British subject. Advantage was taken however of the 1939 Deed of Farther I.Iodification to make it one of the conditions of II.M.G.'s approval of the Deed that a Politicaj. Agreement should be entered into between H.M.G. and Bapco analogous to those already entered into between H.LI.G. and P.C.L., vide p.227 of F.10/14-II, and Article IV of this Agreement, which was signed on 29/6/40, stipulated that the C.L.R. should be a British subject through whom Bapco were to deal with the Bahrain Government 'in all except unii ortant or routine matters', vide p.179 of F.10/14-III♦ 6. Mr. Lipp, General lanager of Bapco, had acted as C.L.R. during the latter's absence on leave, vide p. 129 of F. Ip/l-ltVI and p.4 of F.lO/l-XVII, but in April 1941 Mr. Weightman suggested that Mr. Lipp be allowed to act as C.L.ft. instead of Dr. Kennedy, the then C.L.R., vide p.36 of F .lO /l-XVII. His reasons seem to have been (a) to facilitate the transaction of business, cut out a go-between who was not a responsible official, and deal directly with the only man on the spot who had real authority, and (though not slated in his letter under reference) (b) the Defence Officer, Bahrain, was already dealing direct V with.the General Manager on defence matters ^nstead of through the C.L.R., vide pages 173-1S2 pf F.23/l.e (c) the /(d) the appointment of Dr. Kennedy had been a purely temporary appointment, vide p.200 of F.lO/l-XVi (not submitted) 7r The appointment of Mr. Lipp would have been contrary to the nationality stipulation in Article No. IV of the recently signed Political Agreement between H.l .G. and Bapco (vide p.179 of F. 10/14-III) but H.I.U }, agreed on condition that (a) tjie appointment would be personal to Mr. Lipp (b) it would last only for the duration of the war, vide pages 49 and 51 of F.10/l-XVII.- 3. In order to avert any trouble that might have arisen from an appeal by Dr. Kennedy to Bapco's New York principals F.r. Lipp referred to them himself and received their consent to his taking over the additional duties of C.L.R#, vide page 126-130 ibid. 9. In '1942 Mr. Lipp went on leave and LTr. Ward Anderson was appointed to act as General Manager. Mr. Lipp thereupon raised the question of who should act as C.l .ii. , vide p.21 I ibid, and after consulting the Bahrain Government (vide pages 208 and 212 ibid) Mr. Wakefield advised that i ; r. Anderson be appointed C.L.R., vide p.213 ibid. In this instance the New York Board ^ of Bapco also recommended that Mr. Anderson should act as C.L.H. , vide p. 229 ibid, and II.I .G. agreed to the appointment on the same two co iditions that applied to j r. Lipp's appointment as C.L.R vide p.230 and 238 ibid, 10. / P.A. may also 'wish' to see suggestions that have been made from time to time regarding tl^ appointment of a deputy C.L.^i. References are at pag^s 192 and 20'T of F. 10/l-XVI and pages 214^ and 218 of F.lO/l-XVII - also S,20, enclosure 4, of F.lO/l-IV. P.A. l r 26/10/45.&gt; V. 1. ORIGIN OF THE POST OF CHIEF LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE. v ' In the original concession granted to the Eastern and General syndicate, no provision was made for a British control clause and of this fact H.M.G. became apprehensive when the Company suggested that, as British capital was not forthcoming owing to unfavourable geological reports, they haa negotiated with American and ^anadian interests with a view to finding sufficient capital to finance prospecting operations in Bahrain and ultimate comii.ercial development, and had in fact already transferred their rights to the ^astern Gulf Oil Company, who in turn assigned its rights to the Standard Oil Co. of California and this Company organised a Canadian subsidiary to operate the concession. During this process of transfer and re-transfer, the option period of two years originally granted had • expired. Under the terms of their agreement with the ^astern Gulf Oil ^ompany, the Eastern and General Syndicate applied to His Majesty's Government for the grant of an extension . The Colonial Office, while agreeing to make a recommendation to the Shaikh for renewal, stipulated that the Syndicate must remain a British Company and be registered in Great Britian or a British Colony and that no foreign control would be allowed. But it was argued that as American interests would provide the capital they a dominating share in the control should be allowed/«3fl3b0dx3upaxbcsd3be0OQ5x and as H.M.G. found it difficult to oppose the transfer, they eventually agreed to withdraw this stipulation, but as an alternative they insisted on a maximum degree of British control possible, and put forward certain conditions. One of these condit ions demanded that the Company should at all times maintain in Bahrain an official to be called w Chief Local Represent-■ative jrt of thps Company, whose appointment would be approved by His Majesty 1 s Government and he would be the Company*s sole representative empowered to deal direct with the local authorities ana the Population of Bahrain. All cornmuni cat io ns on behalf of the Company to the address of the Shaikh ^ould have to pass through the Political -'-gent. ^fter considerable discussion the Company eventually in 1930 agreed to this demand and/an indenture between the Shaikh and the Company was signed. REASONS FOR CREATION OF THE POST. In the opinion of His Majesty*s Government, it was considered essential that if the oil resources of Bahrain were to be profitably exploited, the relations between the p Company engaged in such exploitation and the local authorities and population in Bahrain should be maintained upon a satisfactory and friendly basis. To secure this end, it was absolutely necessary in the view of His Majesty*s Government that there should be no doubt in the minds of the local authorities and population as to who was the Chief Local Representative of the Company, and that such local represent ative should be not only persona grata with H.M.^. and the ;local authorities in Bahrain, but also familiar with conditions prevailing in the Arabian littoral of the Persian ^ulf. Moreover in vievv of the predominant position of this country and the prestige attaching thereto it was highly desirable that the principal representative of the Company shoi; -Id be a British subject.^ The bahre.n peiuoleum company limited \,c Awali, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf.
