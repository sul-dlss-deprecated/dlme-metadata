ICth January, No. EXT. 5914/44 TOP SECRET. Sir, I am directed by trie Secretary of State to refer to your letter No. C/519 of 22nd November, 1944, regarding the activities of the United States Vice-Consul at Dhahran. 2. As Bahrain is informally within the jurisdiction ‘ of the Vice-Cons ’ 1 it must be expected that he will wish to fulfil the functions ordinarily carried out by Consular Officers, including the protection of American nationals and commercial interests. The Vice-Consul should, of course, dea'! direct with H.IJ. Political Agent and not with the Shaikh in view of the fact that H.M.S act on behalf of the Shaikh in regard to his foreign relations and since all foreigners are under British jurisdiction, Prima Fac ie the Vice-Consul would appear to have acted correctly in the matters referred to in the 3rd paragraph of the Political Agent’s letter of the 2nd November. 3. As regards the Bahrain Petroleum Company, it was perhaps natural that the State Department should wish to inform itself of the difficulties in accelerating work of common importance to the war effort by asking their Vice Consul to discuss the question at issue i nformall y with the Political Agent, and in a similar case H.N.G. would see no harm in his doing so again. Nevertheless, while the Political Agept need not refuse to allow the Vice-Consul to discuss unofficially with him questions affecting the Bahrain Petroleum Company the Vice Consul should not be allowed to forget’ the three points: (a) that the Bahrain Petroleum Company is a. British Company, (b) that under Clause 4 of the Political Agreement of June 29th, 1940 between II.M.G. and the Company, a specific procedure is laid down regarding the Company’ s'dealing with the Bahrain Government in connection with their lease and regarding any other matters of direct concern to H.M.G. and (c) that in all cases the Consul must never take up any matter direct with the Shaikh but only with the Political Agent. 4. II.M.G. consider that all this might be explained to the Vice Consul in a frank and friendly manner, in order to ensure that he really understands the peeition. They consider it important to avoid giving the State Department any grounds for saying that their Consular Officer is being impeded from carrying out his legitimate functions. In general H.M.G. would suggest that K it would be of advantage to cultivate,, so far as possible, friendly and informal relations with the present Vice-Consul so that the United States Government may not feel compelled, in order to maintain what they consider to be their legitimate interests in this important area,• to replace him by some more knowledgeable and experienced individual who may prove .to be the source of a great deal of trouble. 5. The Secretary of State is, of course, in entire agreement with you as to the importance of avoiding any infringement by the Americans of our position at Bahrain\ MM mrnmm ft - 2 - but he feels that this will probably best be vSeeured by a method of approach on the above lines and he 1 ' would therefore be glad if the instructions proposed m paragraph 5 of your letter under reference could be modified accordingly. 6.

I replied that I should be delighted to introduce the party personally to the Shaikh and offered accommodation in the Agency, which was refused as arrangements had already been made at the Mission. 2. The party arrived in the late afternoon of the 13th and came to the Agency at 7.45 a.m. next morning. At S.a.m., I took Mr. Sutton, Mi3,3 M&amp;rton(Secretary), and Mr. DeJong to call on the Shaikh. The visit was a purely social call and no business was discussed. The same evening the party, accompanied by members of the American Mission and the Kuwait Oil Company dined at the Agency. The Shaikh and two officers who were staying at the Agency were also present. 3. On Sunday the Vice-Consul and his companion visited Magwa and bathed at Fantas. In the evening there was a f, fork supper' at Mr. Bartlett’s house (Kuwait Oil Company) followed by a religious service and refreshments chez Mrs. Dejong. All these occasions were graced by the presence of the Vice-Consular party and the Political Agent. The visitors left early next morning (16th). 4. The American Vice-Consul, who had no Arabic, did not seem to be particularly well-informed about the history and present circumstan ces of Kuwait. He appeared to have no business to discuss and did not indicate that he considered Kuwait as being v/ithin his sphere. KUWAIT.Telegram Cypher jfrom Ambassador, Baghdad.

Galloway took up with the Foreign Office the question of the salute given at Kuwait by the U .S.S.» , Pocono , » to the American Consul, Basra. The Foreign Office discussed the matter with the State Department through the Washington Embassy and the State Department replied resisting the idea of sending special instructions to their naval vessels in the Gulf depriving their consular officials of the honour of a salute when on official business even though outside their districts, the more so as the occasions on which one of the rare visits of a United States warship equipped for saluting to Kuwait would coincide with a visit of the Consul from Basra are likely to be few and far between. In the circumstances, the Foreign Office proposes to let the matter drop, and after consulting S.N.C.P.G., I have agreed and have expressed the hope that I may be permitted to raise it again should circumstances make this desirable.

Preliminary reaction here and at Bahrain is that there is no insuperable objection to U.3. proposal provided that (a) there would be no change in question of jurisdiction (b) IT.3, Consular Officer would not have direct dealings with Sheikh (c) there would be no change in political agreements with oil companies which oblige them to deal with the Sheikh through the Political Agent. 2. Possible complication Is that if U.S. establish consular office here India may no longer be content to operate from Basra. 3. Pending my return and final expression of views from here I suggest you might obtain legal advice/ NO. 0/115(13/8)^ i 'A - 2 - advice on foiinal position of U*S. Consular Officer. Possibilities seem to be (a) that exequatur should be issued by H.h.G.

Situation is further complicated by a) negotiations now r&gt;roceeding for Consular conventions with certain states of which Egypt is one though it is untimely such conventions will be concluded with more than a small number of states with the next few years and even the convention with Egypt may “take a year or two to negotiate, (b) application by Irani Government for appointment of Iraqi Consul , * t' x at Kuwait ( Baghdad despatch No. 103 ) iifUf 3 . Consular conventions would normally include a mind of a most favoured nation clause which would give the other signatory right to appoint a Consul or Consular Officer wherever a third state has a Consulate. This unfortunately disposes of the United States arguement that we could refuse to allow other Consuls to be established at Kuwait on the grounds that other countries’ interestsjhre not asUSM/ great as theirs. Incidently existing Consular (mut) with the United States Government also contains clause which permits United States to include within a Consular district though not necessarily to have a Consulate in, any area which is open to Trade Commissioners or Commercial .Representatives of a third state and it is likely that other Consular conventions concluded by us will contain a similar clause. Bahrain will be an area to which a clause of this nature will aooly when there is an Indian Trade ti.C* ent there It must be assumed that irrespective of exist- 4 ence of Consular conventions with Egypt and Iraq appoint ment of an American Consular Officer at Kuwait will make it most difficult for us sooner or later to resist the appointment of Egyptian or Iraqi Consuls if those Govern ments press strongly for this. '*e are disturbed at the prospect of representatives of either country being estab lished in Kuwait, dhere would be endless opportunities for political intrigue and Kuwait *3 special relations with us might get unwelcome publicity in Egyptian and Iraqi press. Moreover both countries would no doubt try to use Kuwait as a pawn in their own rivalry. ? Proxy for United States Consul will also make it far more difficult to resist Indian and Pakistan Governments wish to have Consular Officers in gulf. On the other hand United States Embassy are 5 pressing us hard for a reply to their communication of ^pril 39th and we feel if we refuse them this facility, for which they have extremely strong practical grounds, ! any more than see the danger of that tension make some difficulty..difficulty about accepting continuance of our (unut) position in the Persian Gulf. We therefore feel we have really prolonged (mut) but to agree to American pro posals subject to conditions stated in paragraph one of Kuwait telegram under reference. We would hold off \ Egyptian and Iraqis for as long as possible but we should almost certainly not be able to do so indefinitely. 6 . Our idea is that Kuwait would be (mut) by us and that Consul should not receive any document from Sheikh. 7 . before coming to final conclusions we should be glad of your urgent slews. 3 , Correspondence copied to Washington, BMEO., iairo, Baghdad.

He continued that he did not think there was a full time Job here for a Consul, but that a Vice-Consul working unofficially for three weeks during the month could do all the work there was.

(Dear Mr. Palmer), Will you please refer to Lewis Jones’ letter ESS62/1901/91 of the 29th April to me forwarding a request from the State Department for our agreement to the opening of a United States Consulate in Kuwait. As I have already made clear in conversation with Lewis Jones, we have fully accepted the strength of the arguments in favour of the establishment of a consular representative of the United States Government in Kuwait and appreciated that the increase in the volume of work has caused difficulties in the administration of consular business from Basra; but while we have^been most anxious to meet the practical require ments of the United States Government, we have also been seriously concerned at the political repercussions which are likely to arise. The Iraqis have already asked for the appoin tment of a Consul and if an Iraqi Consul were to be appointed the Egyptians might be expected^to follow up with a similar demand. At present the United States is the only country with which the United Kingdom has a Consular Convention, but we expect to negotiate such conventions with a number of other countries soon and are at present negotiating one with Egypt. These conventions are likely to include a provision similar to that in the U.K. - U.S. Convention providing that a Consulate may be opened at any place where a Consulate of a third country is established. If there were a U.S. Consulate in Kuwait, we should be unable on the conclusion of our Convention with Egypt to refuse the opening of an Egyptian Consulate there. For this reason we fear that it cannot be argued that the establishment of a U.S. Consulate would not constitute a precedent. If the way were thus opened to Egyptian and Iraqi pene tration there would be a real danger that Kuwait would be rapid ly infected with all the ultra-nationalist maladies from which those two countries are at present suffering. Kuwait would * become involved in Arab League affairs and in all the rival ries and intrigues which now divide the Arab States. This involvement of Kuwait in Middle East politics would be to the advantage neither of the United States nor ourselves. I might add that if Consuls were appointed from outside countries at Kuwait there would be a similar demand for representation at Bahrain where similar considerations apply. This desire to exclude the hurly-burly of Arab politics does not of course mean that we wish to keep Kuwait or Bahrain in permanent tutelage; but our hope was that they would develop in their own time on a steadier and more stable basis than most' of the Arab States have done. In this connexion, we are well aware of the need for strengthening our own political repres entation in Kuwait and steps to this end have already been taken. We thought it was desirable to set out fully the above consideration which would explain to you the difficult situa tion in which the U.S. Government’s request puts us and the reason why we have taken some time to consider the matter. We are sure that the State Department will wish to weigh these considera tions carefully before coming to a final decision. If they /finally Mr. J. Palmer, United States Embassy, London, W.l.- 2 - {^X finally decided that they wished to go on with the idea of ap pointing a U.S. Consul at Kuwait in spite of the difficulties to which we call attention we should not wish to object. In order however to reduce so far as possible the dangers and difficulties to which we think this appointment might give rise we should like to have your agreement to the foil owing three points in relation to the status of the U.S. Consular Officer at Kuwait The first is that his exequatur should be issued by H.M.

If on further consideration the State Department felt able to suggest some method of dealing with their practical requirements which did not involve the political difficulties which we foresee in the present proposal, we should naturally be very glad to consider any such suggestion. I should make it clear that we have not yet made any approach to the Shaikh of Kuwait on this subject. (Signed: B.A.B.
