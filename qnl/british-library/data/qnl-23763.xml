Eventually I was unable to bring them into the town until some Veterinary official had inspected them and consigned them to the Veterinary Hospital for malleigning. Here it was proposed to place them in a huge shed with a concrete floor where their beading would have been blown away in the first five minutes. 3. I would be glad if you would kindly inform me what regulations I must comply with on landing,should I bring them this summer,so that the inconvenience experienced in the past may be avoided.

BA'HAIN. 3th Goto ;er, 194 1 -. , While in Kashmir recently I spent some time v;ith the State’s Director of Agriculture, a Professor Fotidor, who tells me that he graduated at the University of California, in Los Angeles, U.S.A. In regard to ideas for improving the climate of Bahrain, which is ciissed as '’sub-thopical 11 , it appears that, since there are no autumn or spring seasons here, to obtain results from fcrntt- trees, such must be ’defoliated’ and their roots opened twice a year in July and December.. With this treatment apoles should bear fruit, and also pear-trees. Further, it should be easy to grow the avocado pear and pecan nuts in Bahrain. To deal with the difficulty of salty arid sandy soil here ordinary beach grasses, including the 'Andrapogen” grass', should be freely planned from seeds which can be obtained without difficulty from The Professor of Sub-tropical Horticulture in the University of California, Los Angeles, U.S.A. This department, it seems, supplies seeds to many parts of the world for the purpose of binding and fructifying sand-dunes and containing flying sand'. This information might be of interest to Captain Howes regarding his | enquiry about the con/ditions in Gwadur. I have also ascertained that a very easy method of improving the soil and the climate of Bahrain is to plant very freely 'wild mustard seed in arid spots. This seed (which is freely grown as a fertiliser in Kashmir) will spread of its own accord, and is harmless to cattle. But it should be planted here during the next month preferably at the waxing of the moon. Further, a source of considerable profit to cultivators here would be the extensive growth of the sun—flower, whose cake, when milled, forms a valuable commercial source of ethyl-alcohols. Here we have the nucle^us of a profitable industry, if the local farmers would take it up. The Iraq Government has recently appealed to all cultivators tp grpw linseed very extensively, as its harvest is about twenty-five times the quantity sown; and oil-seeds are in great demand at present by the Government of India for war purposes. I do not know if this can be done in Bahrain; but I have instructed the Agriculturist at the Government Farm at Budayeh to make an experimental patch of all of of these three plants with a view to testing their success here. Without doubt the dissemination of mustard seed, and the cultivation of sin-flowers would be profitable in Bahrain, and effect an improvement in its climate in the course of several years.

He was originally a Christian and as such married a very fine A girl some/ years ago.

This lady has only just returned to Bahrein after a long stay in India. 1 Could you very kindly inform me of the actual address of Salim as we got a lawyer to send a notice to him several months ago and the notice apparently did not find him?

To Political, Bahrain* Unnumbered Dated 10th September, 1942. For Wakefield. Gan you find me a cook?Reference your telephone message re. a cook, there are several aspects which may interest you. (a) The British mess have two cooks in Qatar (one first class and one of the average Indian Rs.60-70 type). Both came out on Rs.70/-. In addition they draw Rs. 8 /- special war allowance and get as much good food as they can eat - if not more. You will understand that on this pay and rations they are difficult to satisfy on return to Bahrain. The only compensating factor is that they would probably profit from you on the bazaar bills, which they sadly miss in Qatar. (b) In the case of British Indians the Company deposits Rs.150/- with the Protector of Emigrants and, of course, repatriation is guaranteed. (c) We cannot bring pressure to bear on these cooks to take up other employment in Bahrain, and unless your terms are attract!^ they will inevitably prefer to go back to India for some leave before setting out on another profitable Protector of Emigrants* adventure, or finding congenial work in India itself where cooks, we understand, are in great demand. (d) The date we can release these cooks is now very indefinite as we are finding it very difficult to conclude any transfers of equipment to G-overnment Departments, etc., and until the big batches are exported Qatar camp must remain open. For example, the R.A.F. have just informed us that their Purchasing Board is not empowered to agree to prices and priced lists must be referred to the Air Ministry in England for settlement with our principals. Similarly, another big batch of 600 • • •tons is likely to be held up for some time. These delays are giving us some concern as they are cost ing us considerable sums in keeping the staff and labour in Qatar. (e) However, as soon as any cooks can be released, we will give you a chance of testing them while they are waiting for the steamer. As passages are few and far between in these days you should have plenty of time to vet them. Personally I think you will be well advised, if you have a reliable cook in India, to write to Mrs. Dixon to bring him out, and rely on these Company cooks merely as a make-shift in an emergency.

His father was a Sikh convert to Christianity and prem married this Mrs* Gurdial as a Christian, Her father was a Mohammedan convert and she is now working in the combined Military Hospital, Quetta. I have been asked by the Chaplain to try and assist her in obtaining a divorce from her husband. The man’s present name is A.K. Salim. He has become a convert to the Muslim religion, is said to have taken another wife unto himself and to be residing somewhere in Bahrain, as an employee of the Oil Company I will try and obtain further details of his address before this letter goes off. Mrs. Gurdial has knowledge of her husband f s re-marriage from him and from persons who have second hand knowledge only* Would it be possible for you to help the unfortunate woman, who appears to be a very decent creature by letting me have the names of two or three persons, who could give evidence to the effect that the man has - either re-married or is living with another woman? As you know aTrharried under the Indian Christian Marriage Act may not marry again even if he adopts another religion.

I have seen Mr. Salim (ne^ Prem Gurdial) and he has no desire whatever t© deny his second marriage which, for a Moslem, is perfectly legal. 4. I enclose a copy of the certificate of Mr. Salim’s second marriage together with a translation. Witnesses to the marriage are Abdur Rasool bin Fairooz Toorani, a Bahrain contractor, and Mohammed Sami’ bin Kazim, Mr. Salim’s personal servant.. If necessary their statements could be thkeh oh oath by the Political Agent. 5. Mr. Salim would not contest the proceedings for a divorce but would strongly contest any claim for maintenance made by his first wife. Mr. Salim has never refused to keep his first wife with him and has consistently expressed his willingness to do so. He became a Moslem in 1936 and did not remarry until 1939 or 1940. 6. If Mrs. Gurdial limits her claim to divorce the case seems likely to go through quickly as Mr. Salim does not deny the fact ^ of his second marriage. If, however, she tries to claim maintenance, the case is likely to last a very long time as most complicated questions of law arise and my provisional view is that she would not win her case. 7. Mr. Salim is taking three months’ leave in India from January or February 1944. Yours sincerely, V ■ i or B.
