Soft grayish, sandy (siliceous) pottery covered with a transparent colorless lead glaze, now iridescent, which ends in an uneven line on the lower part of the body, and decorated on the outside with a wide band of intricate vine scrolls in cobalt blue under the glaze. The design is partially hidden by the iridescence. The mouth rim has been broken and repaired, and there are kiln blemishes on the bottom inside of the bowl.", "medium": "Ceramic; fritware, painted in black and cobalt blue under a transparent glaze; heavy iridescence; rim and handle repaired", "dimensions": "4 x 6 7/8 in.
