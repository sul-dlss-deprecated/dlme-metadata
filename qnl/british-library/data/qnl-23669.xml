The Government of India are advised that, whatever arrangements may bo concerted totmexan tM.

In accordance with this principle, the pensioner has no right to c_aim thajt part of the oommuted value of his pension should be calculated according to one table and part according to another. The commuted value of the pen sion must be calculated , according to the cornr.utation table of the Government under whose rule-making power he served at the time of resignation or discharge, and it is therefore necessary to draw a distinction between the case of officers who are temporarily lent by. and that of officers who arQ permanently transferred from, one Govern ment to another, in the forme: case the commutaticn should, in the opinion of the Government of India, be according to the table ot the lending Government, and in the latter case according to the table of the Government,to which the officer's services have been permanently transferred. The commuted value so ascertained should then be met by ^the^Governments concerned on the principle of Article 190(4) of the Audit Code.

If this were not done, a candidate might he hold to he of Indian domicile for purposes of admission to ^ service hut of non-Asiatic domicile for. clearly 'be avoided. 5. The omission suggested in paragraph 2 ahove seem ftlly justified. Hule 5(2} of the Do: licile ^ules ^ ^miits a person to aonuire the domicile of any country, subject to tie law of the country, if any, hy making a suitable declaration to thrt effect. This rule is 'based on section 11 of the Indian 3uccession Act, which provides that any person may acquire Indian domicile 'by depositing in some public office in British India, a declaration in writin^ of his desire to do so, provided that ha has 'been resic m in India for a period of one year immediately preceding such declaration. This means that a person 3f non-Incian - azK rzxiK/tHxaHxsxaJsxsEixxExfszxszKKiHixaEtxxaxssxxEHXiart seksxsx domicile could, hy residing in Inaia for a eriod of one year prior to selection or admission to an examination for appointnent to Gk )vjrn. .ent service in India, acquire an Indian domicile and he col: e eli ihle for . that app ointment or examination.

Deputy Secretary to the Government of INDIA. Jjetter to all Local Covemments except the Central provinces, i^o. .376/32-2-Ests., dated the 3rd December 1932. 1 am directed to say that the G-overnment of India have recently had under consideration the question of the modification of the procedure of the Public Service Commission in disciplinary cases with a view to reduce the difficulties that might occur in any individual case in which the conclusions of that body differed from those of a local Government. 2. The disciplinary cases in which the Public Service Commission have not accepted the conclusions of a local Government have been very few. Although in the nature of things the possibilities of differences of opinion in these matters between a local Government and the Commission can never be entirely eliminated, the2. J-) Grovernment of India are disposed to think that the chances of such disagreement can 'be minimised if the Public Service Commission referred 'back to a local G-overnment, through the Grovernment of India, any points regard to in a disciplinary case in/which the evidence appeared to the Commission to 'be insufficient. This should enable a local G-ovemment to examine the case further, hut if any new evidence of facts were 'brought on the record 'by means of such a reference, the /officer concerned would, of course, have to he made acquainted with them and given the opportunity of examining them. Similarly cases would 'be referred 'back if it appeared to the Oommission and the G-overnment of India that the procedure was defective. Such cases would he rare for the Government of India have no doubt that local Governments have issued detailed instructions 'based on the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules to ensure that the procedure in departmental proceedings is in accordance with the rules and is not open to criticism. -Kven though references on these two points will not he frequent, it appears to the Government of India that this procedure will 'be of value precisely on these comparatively rare occasions when friction is likely to develop 'between the Commission and a local Government They have, therefore, decided to commend it to the Commission for adoption in suitable cases and will watch its working with interest. Copy of a letter No. JJ'. 108/35-S dated the 10th August 1935 from the Secretary, Public Service Commiss ion to the Government of India, Home Department. I am directed to address you on the need of the better observance of the provisions of Rule 55 of theCivil Services I Classification, Control and Appeal) Hules and its counterpart, Hule 34 of the Railway Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, which provide for the holding of departmental inquiries before the infliction of certain penalties on members of the Civil Services. In the Home; Department's circular letter No, 376/32-JSsts., dated the 3rd December 1932, it was assumed that local Governments had issued such detailed instructions based on the Civil Services (Classification, Control and Appeal) Eules, as would ensure that the procedure in departmental proceedings was in accordance with the rules. The Commission have reeently found reason to doubt whether that assumption is altogether well founded, 2. As the Government of India are aware, the Public Service Commission have to examine every year a large number of these departmental cases, of which they perhaps see more than any other single inlndia. It is now apparant to the Commission that in not a few cases the proceedings are drawn up not merely in disregard, but almost in ignorance, of the provisions of the Hules cited. Not to mention others, the Commission have been compelled in recent months to return three cases I of which particulars will be given below&gt; for the purpose of rectifying major defects in procedure. 3, In the first of these cases, which involved the question of the removal from the service of an officer of the Indian Police, no actual charge had been framed against the delinquent. In the second, which related to the Railway Department, the officer believed to be at fault was actually punished by an authority which had not the power to do so, while no charge had ever ^0011 fr^niGd against him at all, nor had any inquiry been held into his conduct, beyond the kal*x±Mtmxkiatxm&amp;*K± inquiry into the accident in whichhe was supposed to have played a contrihutory part. In the third case an Inoome-Tax Officer was refused an oral inquirj, although he had made it abundantly clear that he desired one. A fourth case exhibiting an analogous defect has also had to 'be referred hack to the Department concerned, and is still under disposal 'by the Commission. 4. It will 'be observed that in all these cases open disregard was shown for essential provisions of the rules in question to an extent which no advisory 'body in the position of the Public Service Commission could possibly overlook. Apart from the fact that these provisions have been deliberatelt inserted for the protection of the members of the Services, the disregard of them provides an officer who has been punished with an almost irresistible case for the reversal on appeal of any order passed against him. In the matter of defective procedure the Public Service Commission have only one course open to them. Un the other hand, they are conscious that sometimes the objections that they are constrained to take on the above grounds to departmental proceedings are apt to be regarded by departments converned as unsubstantial or technical In their character, and dilatory and vaxatous in their practical effect. While the Commission cannot conceds that there is any justice in these criticisms, they readily recog nise that delay in terminating departmental proceedings must always be prejudicial to good discipline. 5. 1 am to suggest, therefore, that the Home Depart ment should issue a circular letter to the various departments of the Government of India as well as to the Provincial O-overnments, asking that, whereever full instructions as to the proper observance of Bule 55 (Rule 34 of the Railway Rules) have not been issued, this may now be done. The Commission believe that it*4. takes no more time or trouble to draw up proceedings regularly than it does to conduct them irregularly, un the other hand, the due observance ot prescribed procedure helps in the early disposal of cases, and so in the end tends to the 'better maintenance of the rights of 'both Government and its officers, which the purpose that rule 55 and other rules are designed to serve.Ko ,f&gt;L of 19JJ.'

From W«Christie Esqr« , Deputy Secretary to the Government of India. TO All Provincial and Minor Local GovernmentB. Subject;- Pension contribution payable by His Majesty's Government in respect of Government servants lent to them on foreign service conditions. Sir, I am directed to say that Supplementary Rule 3C7, as it jbi stands at present, applies to contributions for pension and leave salary xsKJOxxxxttts recovered from the departments of His Majesty f 8 Government in respect of Government servants transferred to foreign service under them, and interest at the rate prisoribed in that ru is leviable from those Departments if the contributions are not pai within time limit laid down therein. The India Office, however, recently brought to the notice of the Government of India the fact tjaat it is a well established principal that interest is not charg&lt; on adjustment between Indian Revenue and the Imperial Fund, and suggested .hs t in accordance therewith, the provision of Supplemen r Rule 307 should not be applied to the pension contributions recovered from His Majesty^ Government. The Government of India have considered the metter carefully and agree, in view of the principle brought to notice by India Office and of the fact that Supplementary Rule 307 is difficult to apply in cases in which adjustments are made by book transfer, as in adjustments between Imperial Indian and/Governments, to the establishment of * bilateral conven tion that interest on overdue pension and leave r^lary contribution or payments for similar purposee, should not be levied from either party. His ^jesty's Government are being requested tt issue similar orders on their side. 2. ^tepe are being taken to amraend Supplementary Rule 307 so as to make it inapplicable to contributions for pension and leave sa is, ry recovered from His Majesty 's Gorernment.

Sir, I am directed to reler to this Department letter No.All-XV-Pi.Il/34, dated the 6th September 1934,on the subject noted albove. The o ue£tion has arisen as to v /hat coarse should be adopted in the case of a civil employee who has rendered satisfactory paid military service in the Great *«ar in addition to military service pensionable under the ICilitary iiules be lore or after such war service but who did not earn a pension by his war service in conjunction with his other military service, 2, The Government of India have decide a that in such a case that portion of the mili tary _service which was rendered before or after the war service should be dealt with in accordance with th&amp; provisions of ^jrticle 356 Civil Service Regulations, The war service-portion (i.e. the period oi service rendered between 4th august 1914 and 31st August 1921) should, however, be dealt with under iirticle 356'or 357-*, Civil Service Regula- tions, whichever may be more advantageous to the oiiicer con cerned. So far as this period is concerned, the officer * . . .. i should be allowed an option between the application of the .one or the other article, subject, of course, to the limitations prescribed in the respective Articles. If the war service is counted under Article 35b the whole oi it will count, out il under article 357- a , only completed years up to a maximum $-1 4 years; and in the latter case the residue oi war service canno t2 - V oaxmot then be counted unaer article 356. The option should be ^ ♦ based on the assaiAption th^t the local Government would give the flLaximum benefits permissible under Article 356. If a local G-overnment is, in exercise oi its discretion not prepared to give the maximum under that Article, the-y should inform the officer as to what they are prepared to allow before he is asked to opt 1:... 3. If the entire military service including war service is dealt with under i -jfticle 356.^ Civil Service Regulations, the whole of the gratuity received in lieu of pe nsion (but not that portion given as a reward lor war service) will have to be refunded by the officer concerned. If, however, the portion which was war service is dealt with under Article 357-A,Civil Service negulations and the rest of the military service before or after the Iftar under Article 356 ibid, the amount of gratuity which the officer will refund in respect of the latter portion should bear the same pro portion to the total amount of gratuity received in lieu oi pension as the period dealt with under Article 35b bears to the total period of military service including the period oi war service. 4. itor the purposes of the instructions conveyed in this letter it is immaterial whether or not there was a break between the war service and the other military service, 5. These orders apply only to civil employees who have retired or may retire on or after the 28th May 1929, the date from which : the rule in Article 357-A took effect, end rny cases which have been disposed of in accordmct with any other interpretation should now be re-examined and revised orders issued, ii ne cessary.

I have the honour ■''o refer to the Government of / hny Ind/a, Foreign ^nd rolitical department letter No.F.3 Oy-£&lt; ^5 dated the llth May 1955, reg .rcing the propo sal to reduce the travelling allowance admissible under b.R.144 from three fares to one and three-fifths fares c^nd to Observe as follows: • 2. rfith regard to the concession of three fares for self allowed for steamer j ourneys in the case of remote localities detailed in b.R.SuS, the scale of Travelling iJ.lowance formembers of the i ers-an Gulf Cadre was instituted with a view to placing them on the s&lt;ume footing as Government employees in India. xx member of the i ers-.an Gulf C^dre, however, whether unmarried or married, and travelling without h j.s family, vhen he proceeds on leave and reaches h'is fixed point (Karachi^ ^.s not on a level with his confreres in other ngenc-es and Residencies in India. The latter are almost all recruited locally , e.g. in Baluchistan, North ne.tern Frontier i rovince, Hyderabad or the l unjab btatses agency in Lahore. tVhen these individuals proceed on leave the extent of their expenses on a short railway or bus journey is a few rupees. The members of the Persian Gulf Cadre are recruited from all over India, e.g.Bombay Madras, Punjab, United rrovlnces, Bengal, etc, ^nd such a Government servant arriving at Kc .racM has to incur Railv^ay fares not of a few rupees but of not infrequently more than one hundred rupees. I have no doubt that it was with this consideration in their mind that the Government of India fixed the present scale.s -2- 3. It must not be forgotten that the scale allowed is for fares without food and a Government servant has to pay for P assages with food'. In addition, there are other incidental expenses, such as boat hire, cooliage, conveyance charges etc. and the cost of transporting a servant, or in the case of an officer of servants. 4. The above points apply even more forcibly to a married man when travelling with his family, since briefly he has more mouths to feed on the boat and more Railway fares to pc.y on the train. 5. Taking all the above circumstances into consi- deration I am of opinion that the cost of travelling incurred by members of the J^ers-i-an Gulf Cadre w en travelling by themselves would be met by two fares instead of the present three fares.- 6. On the other hand married members of the k ersian Gulf Cadre suffer from a considerable disadvantage com pared with their colleagues in India, since the rule applicable to Government servants in the i ersian Gulf is that, unless they accompany their families to the fixed ppint, no travelling allowance is admissible, (vide the ruling of the accountant General, Central Revenues in paragraph 1 of his letter No.T.xi. ■-6-4u6 dated the 21st June 1954, copy attached; (a; In Indi-a there is not the same necessity for the family of a Government servant to be sent t another station on account of bad climate or lack of hospital facilities as there is in the * ersian Gulf.-3- 1 Cby whenever, however, this is necessary, the family can be sent to the nearest hill station involving un expenditure of a very small sum. (cy tven when a Government of the Persian Gulf C*dre k does accompany his llmil„, he Cc.n only drau the ^re 'fare without food' and has to pay for their foods at a high rate out of his own pocket, 7. .1 Government servant in the Gulf is frequently obliged to send his family to England or India, and to incur considerable expenditure on steamer fares between his place of posting and the fixed point (Karachi, and on fares between Karachi and his destination. 6. •lith regard t6 the ^ccountant-General, Central Revenues' ruling cited in paragraph 7 above, I cannot agree with his interpretation of o.B.i45. It cannot matter to Government whether a Government servant accompanies his family to the fixed point or not. 9. whether Government agree with my views in the immediately preceding paragraph or not, I have little doubt that they will agree yvith me that in equity members of the i ersian Gulf Cadre should be put on an exact equality with their colleagues in India by being given Travelling .J.lowance to and from the fixed points, for their families, whether accompcinied or not. I, therefore, propose*that 1- fares without food be allowed for each adult member of a Government servant's family for journeys to and from the fixed points. To limit the use of th is concession to cases of necessity, I suggest that it should be admissible only once a year (for families of gazetted and non-gazetted officers, for journeys to and from tbe fixed points. I would ike once again to emphasise the point that this concession will only put Government servants serving under this Residency on equal terms with those ser--4- ving in India. 10- To show the heavy extra expenses which married members of the Persian Gulf Cadre are put to in sending their families to the fixed point Karachi unaccompanied I attach a table sharwing Details of the actual exi enses incurred by a Government servant's family on a return journey betv/een Bushire and Karachi, for which no travel ling allowance is held to be admissible. 11. I have only referred to one of the fixed points viz. Karachi, as it is to India that most of the per sonnel of the rersian Gulf Ccidre more especially the clerks proceed. The same remarks apply to the other fixed point viz. Basra. 12. To sum up: My proposers, which I trust will receive the sympathetic treatment of Government, are as follows: (ly Unmarried and married Government servants travelling without their families to receive 2 fares (paragraph by (2, Members of the Persian Gulf Cadre travelling with their families to receive 2 fares plus fares per head of family (paragraphs 6(c; and 9) Families to receive travelling allowance once a year as in (2^ whether accompanied or not.

New Delhiy the 20th December 1935, S ubject :— Rebate on air passages. Sir, I am directed to invite a reference to the Government of India, Home Department, endorsement No. F. 113/35-Ests., dated the 11th July 1935, regarding the grant of passages by air to officers entitled to passage concessions under Schedule IV to the Superior Civil Services Rules, and to Rule 3 II of the Passage Rules, 1925, and to say that His Majesty's Secretary of State for India has been negotiating for some time past with Imperial Airways, Limited, for the grant of rebate on air passages booked with them which are paid for out of public funds. An arrangement for the grant of this rebate has now been made with that Company and it is set forth in the Memorandum of Procedure accepted by the Secretary of State and Imperial Airways, Limited, and the extract from India Office letter No. S. &amp; G. 2493/35, dated 1st August 1935, which forms an enclosure to this letter. That arrangement has been accepted also by Indian Trans-Continental Airways, Limited, in so far as they are concerned with through passages into and out of India^ including Burma. The main features of the arrangement are :— (1) The rebate allowed by the Companies will be of two kinds, viz. :— (i) a deferred rebate on a sliding scale from 1 per cent, to 5 percent, according to the aggregate annual ' money value ' of all ' concession ' and 4 duty ' passages booked with the Com panies. The amount in respect of each passage, which will be taken into account in calculating the deferred rebate, will be the tariff cost of the passage less any excess over the amount paid by Government which may be paid by the officer concerned from his own pocket, and any rebate granted bj^ the Companies to the officer or to Government at the time of booking; and (ii) a rebate of 10 per cent of the tariff cost on all duty passages. The term ' duty passage ' is to cover all passages, other than con cession passages, which are booked whether for officials or non-officials at Government expense. 692(0) FD2 The former rebate, i.e., the deferred rebate, will be claimed in England annually in arrears through the agency of the Accountant- General, India Office. Quarterly statements of passages paid for wholly or partly by Government will be sent to him for the purpose, separate statements being prepared for concession and duty passages. The latter kind of rebate, i .e., the 10 per cent, rebate, will be claimed at the time of making payment to the Companies. (2) Concession passages will be booked with the Companies either direct or through their accredited agents, and duty passages will be booked direct with the Companies. The procedure for the booking of concession passages will be the same as at present obtaining in the case of such passages taken by sea, i .e., they will be booked on the authority of a certificate of eligibility obtained from the audit officer concerned. The Company or their accredited agents, as the case may be, will present their bill for payment to that audit officer supported by the certificate issued by him. Duty passages will be booked by the head of the administrative Department concerned. The Company will forward their bill to that authority who in turn will forward it to the audit officer concerned for making payment to the Company. (3) If in any special case an officer is allowed to pay for a duty passage from his own pocket and to claim the cost thereof (within the limit admissible) subsequently from Government, he will be required, in order to enable Government to secure the defer red rebate thereon, to book his passage with the Company either direct or through their accredited agents, and to furnish the Company, at the time of booking, with a copy of the orders of the competent authority allowing him a free passage at Govern ment expense, so that they may be able to trace the passage when the rebate statement in which it is included is received by them. He will also be required to furnish the particulars of the passage booked by him {i .e., the name of the Company and the aeroplane, the date of embarkation, the tariff cost of the passage and the amount actually borne by Government and the agency through which the passage has been booked) to the audit officer concerned for the purpose of the quarterly statements to be forwarded to the Accountant-General, India Office. The audit officer will support the claim for rebate in respect of such a passage by a certificate from himself to the effect that Government accepts the liability for the cost or part cost of the passage. ^4) The arrangement is taking effect from the 1st January 1934, and the rebate-year in regard to air passages will be the calendar year running from 1st January to 31st December. 2. All audit officers are being requested to prepare claims for the rabates in respect of passages booked during the year 1934 for transmission to the Accountant-General. India Office, at as early a date as possible. The claims will be forwarded to him on the civil side by the Accountant-General, Central Revenues, and on the military side by the Military Accountant-General. 3. A list of accredited agents on behalf of both Imperial Airways, Limited and Indian Trans-Continental Airways, Limited, is enclosed. 4. I am to add that the 10 per cent, rebate will be allowed by Imperial Airways, Limited, and Indian Trans-Continental Airways, Limited, on ** concession ' passages to Government servants. The Government servant will draw on his passage account up to the credit admissible for the journey performed and pay the balance out of his own pocket. The amount to be so paid will be reduced by a 10 per cent, rebate over the whole cost of the passage. Government will not be concerned with this part of the transactionbut will include the amount paid to the Government servant from the passage account in the claim to the deferred rebate which it has been agreed that Imperial Airways and Indian Trans-Continental Airways, Limited, shall give to Government.

By order, etc. YAKUB SHAH, Assistant Secretary to the Government of India. * By name.1 3. As regards the points raised in your letters under reply, it will be seen that— (1) Government is to get deferred rebate only on the net fare payable by Government for all passages booked under the scheme—see paragraph 8 of the memorandum of procedure. (2) Provision has been made for cases in which an officer is allowed to pay for a passage from his own pocket and to claim the cost (within the limit admissible) subsequently from Govern ment-—see paragraph 9 of the memorandum of procedure. For this purpose such passages must, however, in all cases, be booked either with the Company direct or with an accredited Agent of the Company. (3) Duty passages are intended to include all ordinary Government passages, as distinct from concession passages, whether taken for officials or non-officials. (4) The special rebate of 10 per cent, on passages booked direct by Government is to be claimed at the time of making payment to the Company in respect of the passage or passaged concerned —see 2 &gt;aragraph 3 of memorandum of procedure. In any cases which may arise in which a portion of the cost is borne by the Government servant himself, it is not intended that the rebate shall be shared with such servant but that it will accrue wholly to Government. (5) The Guaranteed Indian Railway Companies, and also the Bengal and North-Western and Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway Companies to a limited extent, have been included in the rebate arrangement—see paragraph 10 of memorandum of procedure. 4. The statement of procedure is in the main self-explanatory but special attention is drawn to the following points, viz.— (a) The procedure indicated in paragraph 7 regarding passages where adjustments arise differs from that which applies in the case of rebate claimable in respect of sea passages. (6) In order to ensure that rebate will be claimable on all concession passages booked by officers, it is desirable that air concession certificates when issued should bear an instruction requiring the holder to book direct with Imperial Airways or with an accredited Agent of that Company. (c) The rebate scheme is not limited in its application to passages between India and the United Kingdom but covers in addition disbursements for passages by Imperial Airways such as those for Conference delegates proceeding by air between the United Kingdom and the Continent. Passages from one part of India to another are however outside its scope. [d) The form of return is that intended to be used for the submission of the annual claims to Imperial Airways Limited. The form will require modification as and when necessary to meet the requirements for furnishing the periodical returns to the Ac- countant-General at this Office. I am. Sir, Your obedient servant^ (Sd.) F. W. H. SMITH.Proposed procedure for submission of claims for rebate granted to Government by Imperial Airways Ltd., on passages by air provided for Government purposes. 1. As already agreed, the rebate arrangement comes into force with effect from 1st January 1934. 2. The arrangement provides for a deferred rebate on the money value of passages provided by Government for officials and non-officials travelling on duty and of concession passages provided under Government rules for officers of the Indian Services and for their families on the following scale, such rebate to be calculated annually in arrear :— 1 per cent on passages of an aggregate money less than £4,000. value of £2,000 and 2 per cent on passages of an aggregate money less than £6,000. value of £4,000 and 3 per cent on passages of an aggregate money less than £8,000. value of £6,000 and 4 per cent on passages of an aggregate money less than £10,000. value of £8,000 and 5 per cent on passages of an aggregate money value of £10,000 and o\er. 3. Duty passages will be booked by Government direct with the Com pany. A 10 per cent, rebate on the published fares will also be allowed to Government on such passages and will be claimed at the time of booking. 4. An officer applying for a concession passage by air will be furnished with a certificate from Government (issued in India by the Audit Officers and in England by the High Commissioner for India in the case of civil officers and by the Military Secretary, India Office, in the case of Military officers) which he will present to the Company, either direct or through accredited Agents, and if the cost of any passage engaged by him exceeds the amount entered in the certificate, the difference must be paid by the officer himself. 5. The certificate so supplied will be evidence that the passage is required for the purposes of Government. 6. Claims for deferred rebate on both duty and concession passages will be collected, prepared and submitted annually to the Company by the Accountant-General, India Office, supported by statements {vide attached specimen), the number and date of the bill on which payment was made to the Company being shown against each entry in the statements. 7. Claims for rebate will be preferred as soon as possible after the close of the calendar year and any adjusting payments or refunds made in respect of passages taken in a previous year will be included in the annual statement for the year in which the adjustment is made. 8. The ' money value ' on which the deferred rebate is to be calculated will be taken in each case as the tariff rate at the time of booking of the parti cular passage or passages concerned, less any excess over the certificate value which may be paid by the officer and any rebate granted by the Company to the officer or to Government at the time of booking. 9. In any individual case in which an officer is allowed to pay for a passage from his own pocket and to claim the cost* subsequently from Government, particulars of the passage so booked will be ascertained from him and entered in the statement to be submitted to the Company. The Company will be informed at the time that Government accepts liability for the passage. In all such cases the passage concerned must have been booked with the Company direct or with an accredited Agent of the Company. 10. The scheme will apply in its entirety to passages by air provided by the Guaranteed Indian Railway Companies for their officers. As regards the Bengal and North-Western and Rohilkund and Kumaon Railway Com-* panics it will apply only to the extent of 50 per cent, of the cost of such passages. ♦ Within the limit prescribed.military entitled Sheet No. year commencing Ist January Last return sent in to Imperial Airways Ltd. on Payment for — passengers at tariff rates made to Imperial Airways Ltd., (or their accredited Agents) between 19 and 19 civil entitled civil concession Name of Air Liner.

Subject: Joining time on first appointment to officers recruited overseas. —r-r ill* • • • • I am directed to refer to the India Office letter No. S&amp;G 906/32 dated the 21st i-arch 1932 ladOressed to the Government of ^-ndia in the finance department} intimating in t er alia the concurrence of the secretary of State in Council in the definition which the Grovemment of India proposed to apply to the phrase 'without avoidable delay' occurring in the Finance Department letter No.7/XX-E.I/28, dated the 19th May 1923, which is 'based on the orders con tained in the late Lord Birkenhead's despatch No. 9-3ervices, dated the 23rd .February 1928. 2. in connection with a recent case, the question has^ arisen whether the term 'without avoidable delay' refers only to delay on the part of tl e officer in joining his first appointment or also to delay caused hy a local Government deferring tbe issue of posting orders either inadvertantly or deliberately. The orders issued in 1932 hrse hitherto been i eld to apply to both classes of case^, but on re-examining the matter, the Government of India are now inclined to think that this is not consistent with the original orders of the Secretary of ^tate, as in a case v;here the local Government delays posting orders, the delay in joining his first appointment is not the fault of the ofiicer and there is consequenlly no question of it being a delay which he could avoid. Oncd a newly appointed officer reports to his local Government he is under their control and it is for them to direct his movements. If they do not give him orders promptly as to his ultimate station, he-2- should not 'be penalised. Such delays can 'be dealt with 'by local Governments themselves under the ^ower ves ted in them 'by i^ndamental Rule 9(6) ('b) (iv) and tfee present interpretation of the Secretary of State's orders is inconsistent with that rule as involving in terference 'by him with the power delegated to local Governments. 3. The Government of India therefore propose to define the term 'without avoidable delay 1 * as refaa ring only to delay on the part of the officer in reporting himself for duty (either at the loccl Government's he^dauarters or at the actual ;.lace of duty, as the case may he) and not to delay in actually taking up his duties thereafter. I am to request that the orders of the oec etary of 3tate in Council may he obtained on this point and communicated to the Government of India.

The undersigned is directed to say that on the deletion of rules 15 ana 16 from the compilation of Supple mentary Rules by the Finance Department, the question of incorporating the s ubstance of these rules in the Govern ment Servants* Conduct Rules has been consiaered. it has been decided that as the rules referred to above are not gais germane to the subject matter of the conduct rules, they cannot properly tea find a place in the Government Servants* Conduct Rules. It is, however, considered that some departments of the Government of India may feel the need for rules similar to those which have been deleted from the Supplementc ry Rules; if so, it is suggested that they will consider the desirability of incorporating the instructions conveyed in the original Supplementary Rules 15 ana 16 in any of the&gt;3^ Copy of Olroular Letter No. P.?(47)-H.1/35 dated the l9tli SVbruary 1936 from the Government of India in the Finance Department. Subjects- Grant of leave not due mentioned in Note 2(ii) to Fundamental Hule 78 to officers who take leave prepara tory to retirement. I am directed to refer to paragraph 3 of this Department letter No. F.46-H.I/29 dated the 6th May 1929, in which officers referred to in Note 2(ii) to Fundamental Rule 73 have 'been exempted from the re quirement that leave not due may he granted only if the officer is expected to return to duty. This has 'been interpreted to allow the officers referred to above to comhine leave not due with other leave at credit preparatory to retirement whether on ordinary or proportioba te pension provided that the usual maximum of Z3 months as regards the total amount of leave as well as the combined maximum mentioned in that Note of three montus in terms of Ifeave on average pay as regards leave not due are not exceeded. How ever, as pointed oul in paragraph 2 of the letter men tioned ahove, leave not due is meant to he granted only in exceptional circumstances, such as illness or urgent private affairs. The Government of India are, therefore, of the opinion that leave not due referred to in Note 2(ii) of Fundamental xlulo 73 like all otner leave not due, should not he admissible when an officer is on leave preparatory to retirement. This view has the approval of the Secretary of State in Council who is heing asked to amend Fundamental Bule 81. In the meantime I am to request that leave not due referred to therein should not he granted preparatory to retirement, hut past oases in which leave not duepreparatory to retirment has either heen granteci or refused in aocordatice with the practice then prevailing need not he reopened. (The decision that leave not due should not he granted preparatory to retirement will however apply to Sir Alan Green, late deputy High Commissioner for India, and the question of the leave admissible to him preparatory to retirement should he settled in accordance with this decision.)

As regards the distribution of the fees between Government and the officers, I am to add that after a careful consideration of the matter the Government of India have decided to the conclusion thafe the proportion of 4 per cent now credited to Government is inadequate. Tjiey have accordingly decided that it should in future he raised to a flat rate of 25^ and that the officers should he allowed the balance of 75$ of both the (fees charged for private analyses , etc., and the sale proceeds of vaccines manufactured for and issued to private persons. No payment should, however, be made to officers from the sale proceeds of those vaccines which are used on a large scale for prophylactic purposes (e.g.T # A.B., Cholera, influenza and plague vaccines). 3. The local Governments concerned have accepted generally the suggestion of the Government of India that the fees received should in every case be credited to Government in the first instance and that the percentage of the amount payable to officers and subordinates for work done shoul d be drawn and distributed by the Direc tor of the laboratory in such manner as he thinks equitable.

Subjects- Method of allocation of leave salaries of Grovernment servants subject to the Revised Leave Bules. X am directed to invite a reference to paragraph 3 of this department letter No. D/3861-^ , dated the 11th April 1935, in which it was laid down that when a Grovern ment servant subject to the -Revised Leave Bules is trans ferred permanently to another Government, the Audit Offi cer of the lending Grovernment should draw up a subsidiary leave account indicating the amount of ^earned leave 14 at credit, leave salary for whioU will he borne by the Grovernment f rom which the Government servant is transfer red, and send it to the Audit Officer of the Government to which the Government servant is transferred. This procedure cannot 'be applied to non-gazetted Government servants as the records of Service and the service hooks of such Government servants are maintained 'by the heads of offices and not by the Audit Officers. The Govern ment of India have therefore decided that when a non-ga zetted Government servant subject to the Revised Leave Rules is transferred permanently to another Government, ^ the head of the office from which he is transferred should i prepare a leave account showing the amount of ^earned leave* at credit on the date of permanent transfer and send it to the toad of the office to which the Government ser vant is transferred.

As a result of those orders the Government of India issued instructions, inter alia, to the effect that such an allowance should be taken into account in calculating leave salary and pension. This allowance should therefore pro- ; perly be classed as duty allowance for purposes of the Civil Service Regulations and not as a local allowance as it is at present. 2. Allowances of this nature have been taken into account in the calculation of pensions of officers retiring on or after the 10th March 1924, the date of issue of the India Office letter referred to above, but the orders contained in that letter have never been incorporated in the Civil Service Regulations so far. I am there fore to forward draft amendments of Articles 23-C and 32 of the Civil Service Regulations for the consideration of the Secretary of State in Council.
