THE SCHEDULE above ref5?red ,J&amp; Name Number of Shares to be taken The State Government of Bahrein 65 Charles Kendall &amp; Partners Limited 7, Albert Court, Kensington Gore, London, England. 585 SIGNED SEALED and DELIVERED J by the said SIR SULMAN BIN i HAMED AL-KHALIFA In the i presence of iNo * Political Agency, Bahrein, 7th October, 1960. Dear Pinhey, Kindly refer to my (as Acting Political Resident) letter No.483/3/50 of 28th September to Andrew on the subject of the proposal of Charles Kendall &amp; p artners Limited to establish a finance company by 'charter'' from the Shaikh. 2. I enclose o copy of Andrew^ minute on 2 the subject and of the draft 'Proclamation of Incorporation' of the Company. 3. No action seems to be required at the moment. 4. I agree with Andrew*s opinion that the Indian Companies Act is far too complicated for application in Bahrain. Yours sincerely, L.A.G. Pinhey, Esq., O.B.E., The Residency, Jufair. 4Haines left a note here that when he saw Belgrave at the end of «£uly he was shown a document prepared by a firnrof London solicitors (on behalf of Charles Kendall &amp; Partners Limited) for the establishment of a finance company by 'charter' from the Shaikh. t i « 2. Evans and I have been considering this proposal and have ^ tentatively come to the conclusion that such a ’’charter' would really be a piece of ad hoc legislation by the Snaikh- x or the formation of and regulation of the working of such a company. In civilised countries it is ? of course ? an outmoded method of incorporating a company (the ttast India Company and the Hudson Bay Company were examples), which is now always formed under the provisions of the commercial law of the country concerned* There is* however, precedent for such an arrangement v/hich would be analagous, if not exactly similar, to the arrangement under which, for example, oil companies and Cable &amp; Wireless operate their concessions. There are, however, two particulars in which Kendall , s proposal differs from their concession agreements for the exploitation of oil resources or for setting up telegraphic or wireless c ommunications, viz.:- (1) It is understood that Kendall proposes^to operate his local company in partnership with local people, i.e* Arabs or other non-Europeans* (2) The objects of Kendall's company are not specific. A 'finance company' it is understood is formed for the purpose of raising % capital to-finance other ventures- 3. At this stage of our thinking about it, the first question that seems to arise from (2) above is that whereas a monopoly may be justified in the case of a concession for wireless and telegraphic communications and certainly is justified in the case of an oil concession, it seems to us very doubtful as to whether it would be justifiable in the case of a 'finance company'. Is a monopoly contemplated in Kendall's proposal? 4. There is another question which also seems to arise now. This we believe is the first occasion on which a proposal has been made for commercial operations jointly by Europeans and local people. Prima facie such co-operation should be encouraged, but cleajrly the question of the relations cetween Europeans and local people, for which we are responsible, is slightly involved. If we are to support, or at least not to oppose, the proposal, what safe-guards can we provide to ensure that the'relations between Europeans and local people involved are not prejudiced? Perhaps all that is required is a clause in the agreement to the effect that any dispute arising bet’ween, on the one hand, persons subjeco to the Order in Council, and on the other, persons subject to the jurisdication of the Shaikh, should be referred to the Political Agent for orders. (This, however, needs thinking out; it is not quite the same as the similar clause in any agreement between the Bahrain Go-vernment and the person5, I suggest that, if you see no objection, you put such of these considerations as you think fit before Belgrave and at the same time ask him for a copy of the proposed ’’charter 11 so that v/e can study it. You are, of course, on perfectly sound ground in asking for a copy since it concerns an arrangement proposed betv;een a person subject to the jurisdiction of the Shaikh.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00002f_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/1312</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00002f</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/1312</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 6/98 Bahrain Investments Ltd'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1950/1950</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-08-31T18:03:51</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (10 folios)</extent><extent>The file is arranged in rough chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 12; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence, minutes, memoranda, and other documents connected with the establishment of an investment company in Bahrain.
