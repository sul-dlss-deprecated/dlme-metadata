C. Dalrymple Beigrave, Esquire, C.B.E., Aaviser to the Government of Bahrain, Bahrain. To His Britannic Majesty's Political Agent, Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour to refer to your letter No. C/50^-7/5 dated 5rd August 1^58 regarding the wisn of His Majesty's Government to station a detachment of the Royai Air Force In Bahrain. 2. The matter was fully discussed by tne Regency Council who wrote at full length to Mis Hlgnness Shaikh Sir Hamaa on the suoject. His Hignness has approved of the suggestion m principle and has instructed me to discuss with you certain details. 3. His Highness agrees to ocempt from Customs duty all government stores such as petrol and oil and materials for the necessary buildings, for the operation of the detachment. This would Include food, drink material and equipment required for the maintenance of tie staff and per sonnel, in a similar manner ^n which His Highness has granted exemption to the Royal Navy. The exemption from customs duty on fooci and liquor used at recognised social gatherings or by honorary members of the Royal Air Force messes or clubs should such institutions exist in future. This point is specified in order to avoid the necessity of separate applications on the occasion of each entertainment.4. The exemption relates to customs duty only and does not ap F iy to other charges due on imports or local taxes or rates such as motor taxes and bridge to^is Vvhi ch may come ^nto existence when the causeway Is complete. 5. H±s Highness Shaikh S^r Hamad would like to be informec when it is likely that building operations will commence and what ±s likely to be the strength of the proposed detachment.

K ' With reference to your D.O.No.C/618-7/5 dated SSth July 1940. I have sounded the Shaikhs on this matter as I think it is one that requires their opinion. Their suggestion is that we should wai^ the duty on petrol used by the Royal Air Force aircraft landing here for the duration of the war but the matter should be reconsidered after the war. What they actually said, to me, when discussing this and other similar exemptions, was that such payments mattered little to the British Government but to Bahrain's revenue they were important. cy Yours sincerely, 7 A- H.

As His Hignness is aware the stationing of the flight in Muharraq had to be postponed solely on account of the war; but the Royal Air Force use from time to time the landing ground at Muharraq in carrying out their operations which include in their objects the protection of Bahrain. A recent instance is the co-operation of two Royal Air Force aircraft in the destruction of the Italian suomarine Just outside the Persian uulf. 3.

ALC/Accts/104. Sir, »vjr V I have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter from Air Headquarters concerning exemption of Customs duty on fuel and oil for Royal Air Force aircraft for the duration of the war. 2• It would seem to me that the Air Headquarters have only a very hazy conception of what the Bahrain Government have conceeded in the way of relexation of Customs duty. The issue was fogged up about a year ago 'by the Bahrain Government agreeing to allow all R.A.F. equipment, for the maintenance of a Flight stationed at Muharraq, to be imported duty free. The Bahrain Government letter No.1568/31 — of 1357 dated 3rd. November, addressed to your office refers. 3* Now it would appear that the Shaikh has, for the duration of the war agreed to waive the import duty on fuel and oil used by R.A.F. aircraft. Headquarters again seem to have got mixed up. The position as I see it is (i) For the duration of the war, all fuel and oil uplifted by Royal Air Force air craft is to be duty free. Duty being claimed on import and refunded monthly in accordance with the uplift returns that I send to the Director of Customs. (ii) The Bahrain Government agree to allow all R.A.F. equipment for the maintenance of a Flight stationed at Muharraq to enter free of import duty, should it be decided to go ahead with the project as put forward originally. (iii) At present duty is paid on all R.A.F. stores and equipment and this is in many cases equipment for the Defence of the Island. 4. I cannot understand the remarks in paragraph 3 of Air Headquarters 1 letter as Customs duty has always been paid by the Royal Air Force on all stores and equipment, including fuel and oil. The 'BP' Aviation Service Manager does not appear to realise this in his letter. 5. Air Headquarters have not the slightest grounds for trying to claim exemption of all R.A.F. equipment from Customs duty. 6* I suggest we get a refund of duty on any fuel or oil either used after 9th.November 1940, or imported after that date and then ask the Bahrain Government to agree to us importing all fuel and oil duty free to avoid the extra and unnecessary work in claimimg a monthly refund of duty when fuel and oil are uplifted by aircraft.?• It is further suggested that the Bahrain Government be asked to clearify the position and that we have a simple agreement drawn up to avoid any- further annoying arguments arising out of wrong inter pretation of the present varied letters• I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant- ling Commander, lir Liaison Officer. s Political Agent, Bahrain .

The Political Agent Bahrain has notified in his letter NO.2208/21/9 dated 25th November, 1^40 copy attached for your information, that H.H. the Shaikh of Bahrain has agreed that as from 9.11.40 and for the duration of the war Customs Duty will not be charged on imports of petrol and oil used by R.A.P. aircraft landing at Bahrain, but that Customs Duty paid prior to 9.11.40 cannot be refunded to the R.A.P. ) V v 2* TheNBP' Aviation Service, Basrah, however informs this Headquarters in their letter No&gt;1338 dated 21st.December 1940, copy also attached for your information, that their agent at Bahrain has been informed by the Bahrain authorities to the effect that;-' (i) as from 9.11.40 Customs Duty will be charged on all supplies of Aviation fuel &amp; Oil imported on account of the R.A.P. (ii) refund of duty will be allowed on such quantities of petrol and oil as may be uplifted into R.A.P. aircraft which land on the R.A.P. aerodrome at Muharraq only. (iii) the Customs authorities have requested the A.L.O. to report the arrival and departure of R.A.P. aircraft in support of the claims for refund of duty. 3. It will be observed that the information in paras 1 and 2 above is conflicting; also that no mention is made by the Political Agent as to whether Customs Duty will also be exempted on R.A.P. Equipment and stores imported into Bahrain for all R.A.P. purposes including any for the use of the A.L.O. and R.A.P. Rest House. 4. The R.A.P. stores,Equipment, petrol and/or oil are not sold at Bahrain nor issued for other than R.A.P. purposes. It is therefore considered that you should discuss the matter with political Agent Bahrain with a view to obtaining exemption of payment of Customs Duty on R.A.P. petrol, oil. Equipment and/or Stores imported into Bharin. Payment of duty and drawback as outlined in Bharin Agent f s letter referred to in para 2 above would be complicated and should not be suggested. As this question has been under correspondence for a considerable time it is desired that an early settlement should be made, and final clear agreement entered into with the Shaikh of Bahrain.

The Chief Supplies &amp; Transport Officer, Air Headquarters, British Forces in Iraq, Habbaniyah. Dear Sir, CUSTOMS DUTY AT BAHRAIN . We would refer you to our conversation at a -H. q ,. on the 14th instant when we informed you that the Collector of Customs at Bahrain had notified our Agents that as from the Pth November 1 Q 40 Customs Duty will be charged on all supplies of Aviation fuel and oil imported on account of the Royal Air Force. He further states that refund of duty will be allowed on such quantities of petrol and oil as may be uplifted into R.A.F. machines which land on the R .a .F. aerodrome at Muharraq only. The Air Liaison Officer has been requested to report to the Customs the arrival and departure of R.A.F. aircraft in support of the claims for drawback. This decision conflicts with the arrangements detailed in your letter No.55ll/3 0 /ST of the 21st September,1^39 and although the point has not yet been raised we may be obliged to pay duty on all supplies imported for the R.A.F. since the 1,4.39 the date from which you advised us that the duty free privilege would be effective# We should be glad if you would let us know whether you have any information on the subject and if not, may we suggest that the Air Liaison Officer be requested to ascertain the exact position as we feel that this matter can be investigated by him more satisfactorily than by our Agents. We would point out that the refund of duty under the new ruling applies to petrol and oil uplifted from the Muharraq landing ground only and that no provision seems to have been made for supplies uplifted by the occasional flights of the R.A.F. flying boats which land on the alighting area opposite the R.A.F. jetty at Bahrain.

Dear Alban, With reference to your D.O.No.C/119-7/5-(a) dated the 4th February, 1941. The clerical labour involved in checking and making the refund for R.A.F. imports is small, and comes in the normal routine of work. I think that if the concession suggested by the R.A.F. was granted thefe would be a tendencey to regard such imports as being exempted from any customs supervision and later it might be supposed that any articles marked for R.A.F., whether personal or otherwise, would be imported without the application of customs rules.

The key correspondents in the file are the Political Agent at Bahrain (Hugh Weightman, from October 1937 to October 1940, Major Reginald George Evelin Alban from October 1940 to January 1942, Edward Birkbeck Wakefield thereafter), the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain (Charles Dalrymple Belgrave), and representatives of the RAF and Air Headquarters in Iraq.An initial agreement to exempt customs duty on the import of oil and petrol, as well as building materials, food and drink, to the RAF base at Muharraq, was proposed in 1938, and agreed in principle by Belgrave, acting on behalf of the ruler of Bahrain, Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah. The file’s contents track the finer details and negotiations of this agreement, based on the principle that the goods imported were used towards Bahrain’s wartime defence. Included in the file are details of the imports of oil and petrol into Bahrain during 1942, including the amount of customs duty paid (folios 40-41).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00008f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
