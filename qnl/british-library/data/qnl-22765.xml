He proposed to circulate a list for subscritions and I said that I would personally give him one. He tells me that he has got Rs.1000/- from the Shaikh and Rs.2000/- from the H a hrain Government and has also been promised assistance by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The Mission in America ate also, I understand, producing some money. I said that if he would let me have details about the cost of the installation and wliat sum had been promised to him and also details about the treatment of British subjects in the hospital and in the H U rsing ^ome I would send a recommend ation to Government for a contribution. I, however, made it quite clear that the chances of getting money were very sma.ll since the earthquake at Duetta. 15.2.1956.T / P.0«No*bl5-2/l Dear Doctor Dame, Thank you for your letter of the loth February 1D36* I ±uite undent na and think that you are vise. 2 # I am sending with this letter a personal gilt of tfs*10Q/- towards your proposed X f1p ay installation# 3 # x pT^omised that I would recommend to Government that they should give a grant towards the X fT foy installation anu if you would like me to proceed with the matter, /ould you kindly let me know (a) what the installation will be capable of and what its approximate cost vail be, (b; whether you would permit the Medical Ofiicer, Victoria lemorial Hospital, ana the Medical Oi.iicers ol His Majesty’s uhips to avail themselves of it and (c) what fees wouid be charged# If you wouid also tell me oi the occasions on which you have taken in ratings oi His Majesty’s nhips and such British subjects as Commander tinier, Mrs# .Skrirnsnire and so on, it would strengthen the case that I submit to Government# Doctor L*f* Dame, Mason Memorial Hospital, Bahrain# / II © Bahrain, Feb.22,1936. Col, G. Loch, The Agancy, Bahrain. ^ Dear Col. Loch, The American Mlaslon Is contemplating the purchase of an X-Ray Unit for ita hospitals In Bahrain. The particular unit that we have chosen was suggested to us by Dr.Ruggles,a very skilled X-way technician in the United States, in conjunction with a Victor representative. They say of this unit-'It is fool-proof;and is a iuore elaborate equipment than would be installed in a small city in this country. w The particular unit is classified in the General Electric Catalogue as m/8157 and includes the following: (see inclosure) The total of the machine,including '3ight,delivery,installatlcr, r md a short course of instruction by a technician will be approximately Rupees 15 e OOO. Of the necessary amount H.E.Sir Sheikn Hamid bin Isa A1 Khalifa has contributed Rs,1000; and the Bahrain Government has contributed Rs*20d^, the Bahrain Petroleum Company is giving us a generous contribution and many residents of Bahrain both arabs .nd Europeans have already contribut ed various sums. e thought that you might be interested in this project especially in view of the factthat we are more frequently called upon ( and it gives us pleasure to do so) to serve Britisn subjects, haval men as well as private citizens. Just now we nave Commander Rainier in the European Nursing Home,and a short time ago Warrant Engineer Dean was with us for some days. In the past we have also had Seamen Gotham,Skeet and Collins. Other British subjects whom we have cared for (in the Nursing Home or before it was built in the doctor's own home) are Major Frank Holmes, Mrs.Wm. Hendry, Mrs.Wm.Meikle and Mrs.Skrimshlre. Some time farther back some of the officers of the B.I.S.N. Co. were also cared for in a small semi-European room in our hospital for natives. When the machine is installed it will of course be available to any doctor who may wish to send his patients for examination. This fact we wish to emphasize especially for the information of the Medical Officer of the Victoria Memorial Hospital of Bahrain and of the Medical Officers of His Majesty's ships in the Persian Gulf. We cannot say now what our fees for X-Ray examinations will be. Suffice it to say that it will depend somewhat on our operating costs but can assure you that fees will be very reasonable. As a matter of interest may I inform you that when we were building our Hospital for Women ten years ago the A.P.O.C. generously contributed Rs.5000 towards its construction. Since at present there is no X-Ray equipment anywhere in the Gulf be-tween Basrah on the north and Karachi on the south,the Installation of this unit in our hospitals which are so centrally located,will be of Invaluable benefit not only to all the residents of these islands but also to those of a great section of the adjacent and surrounding territory. We lay this matter before you for your information,your sympatheti interest and active support. Yours truly£ V/8157 'DRF' Combination Shockproof X-Ray Unit consisting of: Tube head complete with oil immerged Coolidge X-Ray tube. Fluoroscopic Shutter and shutter control arm.

To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. / X’Ray for r-ason Memorial Hospital. Bahrain . Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the Arabian Mission (the Dutch Reformed Church of America) is contemplating the purchase of an X-ray unit for use- in their Hospitals in Bahrain and have made a public appeal for funds. 2. A copy is enclosed of a brief specification of the apparatus which has, I understand, been recommended to them by Doctor Ruggles, who is said to be a very skilled X-ray technician in the United States, in conjunction with a Victor X-ray representative. It is estimated that the total cost of the machine, including freight, delivery, installation and a short course of instruction of the Mission medical staff by a technician, will be about Rs.15,000/-. 3. I am not qualified to offer any opinion on the apparatus, but the Mission are in a position to get/-// - 2 - g«t good advice in such zaatterc* I tm a little doubtful whether a 'chert course of instruction'* will prove sufficient to train the Mission taff t but on that point again they liave no doubt got competent atbrice# 4# Ibe Miseion are unable to cay what fees will be charged tor X*»ray examinational as the fees will depend aomewhet on tlie operating coats 9 but they assure me that they will be very reasonable* They state that 9 when the apparatus ia installed, it will be be available for tm examination of patients of the Radical Cfflc6r f Victoria temoriel ;ioapltal 9 and of the I'erUeal Cffloex*# of Hie Kajeety f a hips* 6* the Arabian ; ieaion have now f in addition to their hospitals for men end women in wtdeh extensive and excellent attention ia given to the local populace, a very well equipped Hursing rsungalow where aecomsiodatloii is provided for i uropean and American cases* In the peat a number of patients of British nationality have been received and treated in the Arabian Mission, among them beinkt a fervent Engineer and thr^e rating s of the Hoyal Kr^vy* 6« There is a real need for an X-*my Installation at Bahrain as the nearest installations at present available are at Basrah and Karachi, and 'fehmin is well situated to serve the central and Uouthom portions of the Peraian Qulf« 7# Apart from the existence of a considerable British com tty, the eatabllshment of the Hnvrl ifese make® it of definite interest to Qevemncnt that an x-rsy installation shculd be available at Bahrain* B* The Arabian Mission have received support Iccrlly/*.locally* His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin *Isa A1 Khalifah has made a personal contribution of Rs. 1000/- and the Bahrain Government have given Rs*2000/-* A number of contributions have been made by residents of Bahrain, both Arab and Europeans, and I have myself gladly made a personal contribution. The Arabian Mission hope, moreover, to receive help from their governing body in the United States and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited have, I understand, undertaken to help them. 9. In view of the benefit to the British community, who have already contributed privately, and of the value which an X-ray installation may be to the welfare of the personnel of the Royal Navy, I venture to hope that you will feel disposed to recommend that Government should make a contribution of the same amount as that granted by the Bahrain Government, that is to say, Rs.2000/-. 10. I am sending a copy of this letter to the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieutenant-Colonel Political Agent, Bahrain3(SJ- Dated the May 1936 C ‘Cxw. U|0 f Oould you please refer to Colonel Loch’s letter JMo. 1004-2/1 of 15th April 1936 on the sub ject of an X'Bay for Mason Memorial Hospital, Bahrain? of India that a moiety of all expenses in connection with Bahrain should he paid by His Majesty’s Govern ment, which proposal is now under consideration by the latter, the Besident does not think that there is any hope of the proposal contained in paragraph 9 of Col. Loch’s letter being sanctioned by Government, and he is, therefore, not forwarding it. Y/hen His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India have come to some arrangement as to sharing the Bahrain expenses, the proposal may be submitted again. 2 In view of the recent proposal by the Government Officiating Political Agent,* I 4t;i DEFT.
