He wears a dark-coloured fez and ceremonial robes, featuring a mirrored paisley (
                           boteh) pattern at the lower hem and each sleeve, as well as a sash. His left hand grips the pommel of a sword which is held against his body by a sword strap of plaited material.Three circular badges are suspended from a bar on the left of his robe. Below these a more elaborate stelliform badge is also worn.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing the image to take on a soft-shaded paint-like quality in places. In particular the original background has been substituted completely.Temporal Context:The photograph was taken between 11 June 1885 and 19 September 1885, according to Durkje van der Wal in his publication
