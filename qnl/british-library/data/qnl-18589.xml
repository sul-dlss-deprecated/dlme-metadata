Mubarak claimed that the ryots [Indian peasants] of Bahrain had risen in favour of him, but that he had no intentions of attacking Bahrain. Chitty concludes that if Mubarak had plans for an expedition to Bahrain, it would begin from al Bidda.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673698.0x000013#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
