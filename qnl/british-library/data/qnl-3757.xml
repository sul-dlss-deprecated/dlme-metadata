H.Bar s Political Agent, Bahrain. ,ir, I h- ve the honour to inform you that the Air'Officer Conmiandihg, British Forces in Iraq, has ordered the re-markiixg of Yas Island Landing Ground, usin^- Crude Oil markings. It has been suggested that the crude oil could most economically he obtained from the wells of the Standard Oil Company of California in Bahrain Island. It would be much appreciated if you would investigate and inform me accordingly whether the Company are prepared to sell the oil to this department at the pit head and, if so, at what price. 4 tons of crude oil are requirea in 40 gallon arums or thereabouts.

J'\ I hsve the honour to enclose a copy of a letter Jio:MA/52/5/18 datea the 14th iay 1234 froa the Assistant Section Officer, Works and Buildings tepartment, Basrah, regarding a proposal to re-aark the landing Ground at Yas island and to obtain crude oil for that purpose fro® The Bahrain Fetrolewa Company Lioited. 2. 1 cannot help keeling that it would be wiser, from the political point of view, to leave the re-iaarking of the Landing Ground at l&amp;s Island, till agreeneafc has been reached with the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi, as you are aware, he alsays brings up the fact that air facilities were installeu at Yas Islaud without his consfcnt ia order to support his refusal for permission for an fcrnergenay landing ground to be aiade near Abu Dhabi. The Shaikh aad his people recently assisted a Sapiti aeroplane, which had a forcea lending near Abu Dhabi, aad at the request of the Air Officer ComBandiag, British i'oroes in 'Iratj, an eipreesion of his thanks is being conteyeu to the Shaikh. /This2. This landing and departure will, 1 hope, show the Shaikh that the aatter is a siaple one and so help to remove the distrust which exists in the Shaikh's mmd, but, if it is imeciEtel/ followed by further activity at Yas Island, he will only be strengthened in his obstinate outlook. 3. I am doubtful whether it is wise to draw the attention of The Bahrain 'etroleum Goapaay Limited to our f '' ^ ' ■ ■ ' . , ; : v'; i landing ground at Yas Island, as the reason for our purchase is certain to become known to thea and they are in close touch with the California Arabian Standard Oil Ooapany, over whose aeroplane we have already had difficulty. 4. in the circumstances I venture to recoaaend:- (i) tiiEt the re-marking of the Landiag Grouna at Yas island be postponed till agreement has been reached with the Shaikh of Abu Ih&amp;bijtuui (ii) that,if it is desired to re-aark it, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited be asked to ship the required, crude oil to Bahrain, where it could be loaded direct from the £.S Khuzisian into a launch and ssnt to Yas Island.

On the 14th April, an aircraft of lTo^84 (Bomber) Squadron had a forced landing at ABU DHABI, and, owing to coming down on soft sand, went on its nose. This incident was reported by signal to the Political Agent,Bahrain. It is mere than probable that had there been a properly marked out landing ground at Abu Dhabi the aircraft would have suffered no damage, and so a great deal of expense might have been saved. 3. The pilot of the forced landed aircraft reported tlrjat the local inhabitants were most friendly and helpful and it seems quite probable that now the Shaikh will raise no objection to our establishing a landimg ground ift 'this area; It will be noted from the Table of Air Facilities that the proposed landing ground at Abu Dhabi is in Category ,i«e. Important', and the above incident emphasises its necessity to the Hoyal Air Force. 4. It would be appreciated if you would forward your views as to whether you consider it possible to establish this landing ground in the near future and whether you require co-operation from this Command# I ha¥e the honour to be.

If so, (.or even on the general grounds that it is a Ruler's duty to protect property), it say be necessary to enforce that respons ibility. I confess, however, that in view of his consistent attitude (even though there have bees negotiations for the provision of guards), I should be loath to use force against him In connection with the present incident. Hot only could the Shaikh be confiraed in his sense of injustice, but to do so eight ®ell be sad® the cause of grave difficuities to us eiscKhers. For it is necessary to reaeasber (a) that there 1® alaays a danger of driving a can of the type of Sheikh Shakhbut into closer relations *ith ^ing Bin Jsa'ud, and (b) that the success of our facade policy depends on the goodwill (or fear of strong action) of the iSuiers concerned.

He (Shaikh) stated that the Persians official had said to his official in the Island that they(Persians) want to lease the Island for 500 pounds a year.

After Compliments, The Shaikh of Ras-al- lv haimah informed you in his letter dated the 10th Rabi T al-Auwal 1353(22.6.34) that he spoke to me about two things which he wanted me to communicate to you. .His desire is that the petrol dhow in which the petrol is stored in the creek at Has-al-JChaimah should be one owned by him. When he spoke to me about this I told him that I will refer the matter to you. In view of the fact that in the beginning he dia not agree for the dhow to be kept in the creek ano. that only after a lengthy discussions that the dhow was placed v in the creek, I told him 1 that the Government will appreciate the idea if he were to build a godown as the question of the dhow has already been approved by the Government. He said that i should refer the matter to you.. 1 told the Shaikh tnat ne should write me a letter that he will build a godown for the petrol and then i will refer the matter to you. He said that he will consider the matter. He has now written this letter. I beg to say that the object of the Shaikh m having the boat for himself is to create trouble. His behaviour has not been satisfactory as tliat of the Shaikhs of hibai and Sharjah. When the ^ :j petrol dhow becomes under his control he will try to cause trouble about it, while matters are quiet and going on smoothly now. Decision rests with you. As regards Tinb Island, the Shaikh said that the Persian^ j official said to his official that he wanted to lease the Island j lor 500 pounds a year.

We found him very much disappointed for the installation of tie tank in the said island without his permission, it is said, that he was told, at the time of the installation of the tank, the Shaikh is not responsible for the tank in question,hence he went on on this belief. I said to him that the island belonged to him and the Government were undoubtedly compelled to place the petrol tank for the Royal Air Force aeroplanes and that it was not possible for him not to agree to the demands of the Government. We took three days to convince him but we found that he was misled by certain people. After much difficulty, he agreed to what K.B. f Isa bin Abdullatif .Residency Agent, Sharjah, and myself thought it to be useful namely, to post guards for the tank and do all the needful. W@ fixed Rs.400/- per mensem for him to be spent on the pay of guards and for taking boats from Abu Dhabi to the Island, from time to time, to inspect the guards and report about them to the Shaikh.

Following is note of my conversation {as Political Agent, Bahrain ) with Shaildi of Ahu Dhahi regarding the damage to the tank * - fT I took the matter up with the ShaiMi of Abu Dhabi on my return visit to him on the morning of the 30thK June and informed him of the contents of the telegram. I asked him to send a representative with a represent ative of the Residency Agent (who was present) to make enquiries. The Shaikh replied (perfectly politely) that it was his Island, that G-overnment had put the tan there without his consent and against his wishes, that he declined to accept any responsibility and that he would not send anyone to help in making enquiries. He added that he did not wish to enter into any discussion about the tank, till after it had been removed. I pointed out the advantages that Abu Dhabi gained from the Government, peace at sea for their pearling boats, ease in getting their supplies from the steamers at Dibai and help on their journeys to India and elsewhere, andand said that the tank was a small matter and not like a Rest House and establishment suoh as had been made at Sharjah# I did not feel Justified in going so far as to threaten that these advantages might not continue, but the inference is an easy one. The Shaikh, while admitting the advantages, remained adamant. In the course of the conversation he emphasised that he had not complained or made trouble like the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, but that it was not just of G-overnment ( who had of course power to overwhelm him ) to have placed the tank there in spite of his wishes, that people thought that the Island was no longer his, and that he awaited Justice from us/ 1 ^ Bahrain I consulted Shaikh Hamad bin T Iws, who is wise in Arab matters, and he and his son advised that we should get Shaikh Sa T id bin Maktum of Dibai to act as an intermediary. Bushire I discussed the Question with Colonel Fowle, and we instructed the Residency Agent to ask Shaikh Sa T id bin Maktum to accpmpany him to Abu Bhabi and verbally to persuade the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi to accept the tank and establish guards on Yas Island. The following line was to be taken ;~ ^ (a) Shaildi of Abu Dhabi cannot divest himself of responsibility for damage to British Government property within his territory since all Rulers are responsible for security and since he actually at one time sent guards there with Residency Agent and after that has been discussing Question of pay of guards with Residency Agent. (b) If Shaikh will not place guards there I (Politic- -al Resident) will do so, which will adversely affect his prestige.8. (o) On the other hand, if shaikh agrees to provide guards I (Politioal Resident) will bear cost of making guard house near tank and of flagstaff on whioh he oan fly his flag, whioh will increase his prestige.' 4. This was done and the Political Agent, Bahrain, has telegraphed the gist of the Residency Agentts report { I have not yet received the full report owing to my absence in Tehran )• It is proposed that an agreement for the tanlc should run for twelve years from the date of installation of the tank and that the Shaikh should receive Rs. 400/- { four hundred rupees ) a month. The Shaikh asks for payment from the date of installation. The Shaikh says that his earlier refusal was due to bad advioe from certain Persians and Arabs. Tiie position, therefore, is that the Shaikh is now prepared to accept the tank and to provide guards, but that he asks for Rs. 400/- a month. The Shaikh is likely to be adamant on the subject of the amount, because he is a young man of some character and because, as he invariably emphasises, the tank was installed in spite of his written objections. I am averse from trying to obtain a reduction of the amount by using pressure or force, as ( apart from other considerations ) it would show us in an unfavourable light along the Arab Littoral and confirm the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi in his rancour. 7* The alternative of putting our own guards on Yas Isla nd would be expensive and unsatisfactory for political reasons. It would also destroy any hope of arranging amicably an emergency landing ground and tank near Abu Dhabi •8. It is possible, however, that the Shaiih might be persuaded for Rs. 400 a month to agree to an emergency landing ground with a tank near Abu Dhabi as well as that at Yas Island. 9. If this can be arranged it would, I think, afford a reasonable solution of our difficulties with the Shaikh, espeoially as rationing and watering guards at Yas Island will be a troublesome and expensive business. you agree, I should like to have authority as soon as possible to try to conclude the arrangement suggest -ed in paragraph 8. It would be as well to obtain the authority by telegram as long delay may give an oppolrtunity to the Shaikh*s xiaci relations and others to make trouble. II. The Political Agent, Bahrain, does not recommend the payment from the date of installation of the tank. I agree, and hope that I may be able to come to some arrangement with the Shaikh over this point. arranging for a tank near Abu Dhabi, it would probably be easier to obtain the Shaikh's consent, if it were possible to install a tank flush with the ground and so strong that a permanent guard post would not be required.

September, so I understand. My Supervisor, Mohammed Khan, will amve from Muscat about 10th. September and has orders to arrange for a Dhow into which to tranship the oil. He has my authority to engage this dhow with six or eight men to do the work at the Island and I should be extremely obliged to you if you would assist him to get his requirements at a reasonable rate. I have asked A.H.Q. to arrange a credit with you for Rs.500 on which this Supervisor may draw* I have told him that he may pay the dhow Captain half the agreed rate before starting and 10 days pay to the coolies. Downie, the Section Officer, will pass through Bahrain about the 19th. September by flying boat on the way to supervise the work at Yas and will discuss any matters you desire on that occasion. Owing to the oil being more expensive than if it had been got locally, I am anxious to keep expenditure down as much as possible and so your assistance would be much appreciated in the matter of the dhow and labour.

The scheme, which is pro visional, depending for its realization on the willing cooperation and support of all the Governments concerned, contains the following three main features: — A very material improvement on present time schedules between the several parts of the Empire concerned. A substantial increase in the frequency of services. All first-class mail to the Empire countries covered by the projected services is in future to be carried by air. This scheme. S ir P hilip S assoon ex plained, envisaged a schedule of just over two days to India, two and a half days to East Africa, four days to the Cape, four days to Singapore, and seven days, to Australia. Provision was made for four, or possibly five, services a week to India, three services a week to Singapore and to East Africa, and two each to South Africa and Australia. He could say nothing definite about the letter rate, but it was hoped that for letters posted in the United Kingdom it would be about the present Empire rate of l^d., this to apply to the first half- ounce instead of an ounce as at present. Correspondence covering at least eight sides of special light paper could be sent within the half-ounce limit. But the Postmaster-General could not introduce this l|d. rate before 1937. An integral feature of the scheme. S ir P hilip S assoon added, was a comprehen sive programme for development of ground organization which would enable the Empire services, catering for passenger as well as mail traffic, to be run as freely by night as by day. Finally, he stated that something like two years must elapse before the project, ' the largest step for ward which has yet been taken in the development of Empire air communica tions,' could be brought into full operation.

To jueet his wishes I instructed TTo. 205 3(;aadran lo Bono a flying boat down the Gulf carrying the necessary Worfcs Personnel. Group Captain SAUL ordered this flying boat to proceed to HAS AL KHAIMAH, the mv'jst convenient base for the purpose in view. It was therefore a matter of surprise to me when I learned that, on the advice of the Political Agent, ^ ^ at it was inadvisable for a flying boat to visit R a S a I j KHAIMAH, SAtTL had had to make use of DIRAI as the base. I look upon HAS aL KIlAl: AH as a recognised refuelling place for our flying boats operating in the Gulf, and somewhere at which they can touch at any tiiie with no more than formal notification in advance. Moreover, the Air Ministry have impressed upon me thit they regard this place as the moat important refuelling base for sea planes in the Gulf. In fact, ehould we be unable to use RAS rJL KHABuJI in the event of one ol our inter-Command reinforcement schemes being put into force, a profound modification would have to be made in the scheme with possible delay to the movement of aircraft. I am not aware of the reason which precluded the use of l s fiL khai; all on this occasion, but S a UL , in a partial explanation, has led me to believe that the Shaikh of RAS al khaimah had removed his flag from TAlB Island,- thas playing into the hands of the Persians, who have given indications of their intention to renew t eir claim for the island* The best answer, it seems to me, would have been to have alloweci the flying boat to go to RaS ^ KHAlfeAH at once, but of that you no doubt are in a better position tha 1 I to judge as you are in possession of the i cts. Before you receive this letter I hope that we shall have been able to meet and h ve had jan opportunity to discuss the matter, but I feel that I should like to place my views on record. I consider that any interruption to the activities of either land planes or flying boats in the Persian Gulf is a very sen as matter, and I should appreciate it if, in every instance when there is any question of aircraft being unable to uBe the facilities provided, I could be i mediately put in possession of the full facts of the case.

We are pressing them for these and I hope that we may get a telegram off to you before this letter reaches you. 2. In the meantime, I send for your information copy of a letter dated 18th January from the Air Ministry y/ which, while it refers primarily to the question of policy on the Trucial Coast, is also of direct interest in the present connection as affecting the progranme of beacons and other equipment for night flying etc. which the Air Ministry have in mind. Arisin &amp; out of it, we have had a certain amount of demi-official discussion with the Air Ministry in the course of which it has been impressed on themj (a)/ fon'ble Lt.Col. T.C.W, Powle, C.B.E,, Bushire.(a) that it is rather far to suggest that 'the authority of the sheikhs has already been obtained' for the establishment of a civil air route; and that what has in fact happened has been that we have with much difficulty secured certain specific alr-faclllties from the various Sheikhs concerned; (b) that it is necessary to handle the Sheikhs carefully in natters such as the present, and that while the course of action suggested in paragraph 3 of L| your express letter of 5th January, IT-s, seems clearly the best in the circumstances, it must be open to the Resident, if it proves quite impossible to secure the facilities desired without making some payment, to make a recommendation to this effect, 3. We have further pointed out that the provisional list of facilities enclosed in the Air Ministry letter of 18th January includes certain facilities which we now hear of for the first time, viz. the beacons on the islands of Abu All, Halul, Das, at Kalba and at Jiunri (of these Abu All appears to belong to Ibn Saud and Jiunri will also not be of direct interest to you), and that you have in the past impressed//(s - 3 - Impressed upon us ttie desirability of giving as Long notice as possible of arc/ air facilities which might be required, and so of giving the Resident and the political officers concerned the opportunity of working to a programme laid down well ahead&gt; since it was only in this way that really satisfactory results could he obtained. 4. i gather that in deference to our informal representations the Air Ministry will consider indicating an order of priority as regards these facilities, but they have emphasised that with a developing air route such as the present, there is some difficulty in supplying, a list of requirements which can definitely be regarded as final or as covering all they are likely to require for some years ahead, though they appreciate the importance of doing this so far as possible. 5. i am sending a copy of this letter to Loch at Bahrein and to the Government of India.

As Sir Samuel Hoare is aware, the next stage in the development of the imperial Air Routes is to equip them for night flying, and with this in view the Council hope to inform the India Office shortly of the particulars of the equipment and organisation which it will be necessary to provide in the Persian Gulf. These will consist of airway beacons, Directional Finding W/T Stations and a Meteorological organisation, and as far as can be foreseen at present, will in almost every instance be located at air stations already established. | 3/ Under-Secretary of state, Political Department, India Office, S.W. 1.11* - 2 - 3. Tlae Air Council do not regard such eqlpment as in •the nature of additional facilities which are to he obtained from the Shaikhs hut as part of the normal organisation of a civil air route and of the equipment of a civil aerodrome. It may he, however, that when His IVajesty' s representatives in the Persian Gulf learn of the new proposals they may be Inclined to regard them as outside the terms of the agreements already concluded and to feel that they must therefore approach the shaikhs anew. The Council hope that sir Samuel Hoare may see his way to acqiant His J/aJesty's representatives in the Persian Gulf with their views and trust that he will agree that permission to improve the equipment of these air stations for night and day and all-weather flying is both unnecessary and inadvisable. They would suggest that the appropriate procedure is to instal the beaconsj etc., as a matter of course and without raising the subject with the Shaikhs, ana in the event of question being raised, to explain that beacons and ?ifireless Stations are part of the normal organisation of a civil air route for the establishment of which the authority of the shaikhs has already been obtained. 4. A list of the proposed beacons, etc. on the Truclal Coast (which may require subsequent modification) is attached to this letter. For convenience of reference the list has been amplified to include the facilities which will be required elsewhere to improve the route between Basra and Karachi. I am, etc. (Sd.) J.M.

The Council received Just after the despatch of this letter, a copy of Confidential Express Air jyail letter i 1 No.173 of 1935 dated the 5th January, from the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, from which they are glad to learn that colonel Powle has advised that the Political Authorities in the Gulf should in the first instance adopt the attitude recommended hy the Air Council. The Council, however, are a little disturbed to observe that Colonel Powle does not appear to be very hopeful of the result of such a policy and that in his view some payment ffiay be necessary for the establishment and security of the airway beacons to be located on the territories of the Trucial sheikhs, even at existing landing grounds. 3. The Council would be reluctant to make any further Payment for air facilities in the Gulf but in the last resort, and if political considerations appeared to dictate it, they would be prepared to reconsider their views in this connection. 4/ Ner Secretary of state, Political Department, India Office, s.w. 1.{%1 \ 4.

Political Agent, Bahrain, The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian ^ulf. Bushire. Air facilities at Kalba . Sir, p ,5V | I have the honour^to...Tefer to the second paragraph of your Express better Ho:1161-8 dated the 8th December 1934 regarding the establishment of a landing ground at Kalba. As a result of various enquiries, I believe the position at Kalba to be that in the hope (that has so often proved Illusory) of securing peace on his death. Shaikh Saqar (great grandfather of the present Shaikh) of Sharjah, divided his shalkhdom and left Kalba to his son Msjid, grandfather of the present Shaikh of Kalba, Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad# Shaikh Sa T id bin Hamad, therefore, regards himself as independent, pays no zakat to Sharjah and keeps the revenue for his own purposes. \ Nevertheless, it appears to be recognised that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjah is the authority who should make any political agreement connected with Kalba and that Kalba should revert to I Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar on the death of Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad who is old and has no sons. Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad is, however, swch under the influence of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Has al Khaimah (who is his cousin), because he (Shaikh Sultan bin Salim) helped him some years ago in a souabble with Fu.lairah, ^hen Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Shar jah had refused to do so, also because he has married Shaikh Sultan bin Salim 1 s /sistersister. Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Sharjali offers to send his brother, Shaikh ^hammad, to arrange for a landing ground at Kalba 'A'hen he returns from tne pilgrimage in a couple of months 1 time. The Hesidency Agent, with v^hom X discussed the matter separately at Bahra^ suggests that he (the Residency Agent) should send a relative with a letter. 4. I understand, though I have no records of the matter, that Shaikh Sultan bin oaciar's attempt to arrange for a landing ground in about 1931 broke down because Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad of Kalba asked the advice of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Has al Khaimah and I doubt whether Shaikh Muhammad bin Saqar would be any more successful. Hor do I think that the Residency Agent's suggested letter is likely to be successful, and he himself will be unable to go to Kalba owing to sickness. 5. I have come, therefore, to the conclusion that the best plan is to defer taking up the question of a landing ground at Kalba till good relations -yvith Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah shall have been restored. Once that has been done, it should be possible to arrange for the landing ground through Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Shar.lah without our experiencing difficulty from the ill advice of Ras al Khaimah. I should, however, warn you that payment will undoubtedly be wanted and that it would be well to ascertain up to what sum Government is prepared to pay for the desired landing ground. I v/ould suggest that up to Rs*200/- a month at your discretion be recoimnended. 6. I have no records at Bahrain about , our misunderstand ing with Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Ras al Khaimah, but I hear that he considers himself aggrieved because his boats were seized when the petrol barge was installed and because discussions with the Honourable the Political Resident did not /takei — I U] taKe place v.ithin uhe year for which an arrangement v/as temporarily brought about by Shaikh Sultan bin Saqar of Shar.1ah, and that he is now afraid of coining off to one of His Majesty's Ships as he expects to be taken away. There seems to be some ground for thinking that certain interested persons have played on the Shaikh^ feelings in order to prevent a reconciliation. The Shaikh has been represented as hot—headed, even as slightly insane, but after a recent talk with Shaikh S u itan bin Saqar I should be inclined to think that the oddness of his mentality has been exaggerated and that he actually labours (rightly or wrongly) under a grievance in much the same way as Shaikh Shakhbut bin Sultan of Abu Dhabi. 7. Owing to my lack of records of the case I am unaware what arguments can be used to clear nis mind and to regain his friendship, should a meeting between you and the Shaikh be brought about, but I feel that once a meeting can be brought about, it should not be impossible to restore frank and friendly relations* I think that the Besidency -^gent might now be ordered, in strong terms, tb do 'all that is possible to influence the Shaikh's mind in order to pave the way for a meeting, but this may take some little time. 9. I should like, if I may, to discuss with you means of bringing about a meeting between you and the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah, but the following course seems possible* After the Residency Agent has had a few months in which to influence Shaikh Sultan bin ^alim in the right direction, I might go to Ras al Khaimah in a flying Boat en route to Muscat, and have convenient engine trouble. I might await the repairs in the Residency Agents house where the Shaikh would be likely to visit me and where I could in the circumstances receive him without loss of face, and then return his call* I might thus /be able^5) 4. be able to estabxish personal relations and possibly even, then or later, xrienaly enough relations to enable me to bring him off to see you. 10. Both ^aj,11 'Abdullah Williamson and haj .ii Yusuf bin iihBiad Kanoo have offered their services with a vie?/ to persuading Shaiich Sultan bin Salim to be reconciled to the Government • 11. In conclusion 1 would emphasise that I regard the question of bringing about a reconciliation with Shaikh Sultan bin Salim of Has al Khaimah as one of considerable importance, (1) because of the rather unfortunate impression which is caused along the Trucial Coast by ^our relations with him, and (il) because of the danger that his present unfriendliness to us may afford an opportunity to others to establish their influence there. The Tanb Island incident and the report of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim having asked the help of the French j Admiral in the matter of water (see my Express better No;0/124 ' dated the 21st February 1935) suggest that this is no idle fear.

I should give him plenty of time for talk before opening up the subject of your visit, unless he himself asks you why you have come. I appreciate that it might be convenient for you or others to come down while construction is going on in a Flying Boat, but this cannot be done unless the &amp;haifch agrees to it. 3# I think that the Shaikh may acquiesce in your coming in a Flying Boat if you would mention in conversation at some tiise towards the end of your reconnaissance that you will be sending down some material ahead in a dhow and that you will be coming afterwards, but that if the Sloops are ver^? busy and cannot spare time to bring you, you may come in a Flying Boat. 4. If the Shaikh raises no objection to the Flying Boat coming well and good, but if he does raise an objection, please do not press the matter, as it might easily give rise to difficulties over the landing ground. 5. It is advisable to avoid, as far as possible, being drawn into discussion (especially in public) with the Shaikh or his relatives about the equipment of the landing ground and to avoid making mention of the tank (they all know the word). If they ask questions, it would be best to say that you have Com only to select the site and to ascertain what sand and rock is available for the work. If they specifically ask about the tank or lamp, it would be best to say that they are being Me and will be ready, if God is willing, later on. 19th March 1935• Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.m*. 3 • ^ obt,: -* vid.fi a^y p Lfittar M0»C/l3 of 222ia • «bruc.ry 1936. 4.

Should the latter make objections we can quite fairly explain to thea that the beacons wireless and meteorolsgieal stations are part of the normal organisation connected with landing grounds. 6.

Tne only satisfactory result of the Residency Agent's visit to Abu Dhabi appears to be that the Shaikh !has withdrawn his objection to the Installat tion oi j tank at Yas island, and has agreed to appoint guards. S). In regard^to payment for guards. In June 1933 ithe shaikh demanded Rs.800/-p.m from the day the tank was / &gt; placed at Yas. The P. A requested authority to clinch with the Shaikh for this amount, but was informed that the R.A.F have authority to pay only Rs.100/- p.m. In h^'s '-f. IS' recommendations regarding facilities required by the Roysl Air Force on the Trucial Coast, Colonel Loch asked to |be authorized to assure the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi of a payment of Rs.800/- per mensem for Yas Island and the ^ emergency landing ground at Abu Dhabi , and to pay him :arrears for Yas Island at Rs.200/- p.m from the date of occupation of the Yas Island site. In his letter dated |the 16th January 193S,'the A.O.C agreed to the payment of Rs.400/- cash down and afterwards Rs.100/- p.m subject to | guards being provided and maintained over the R.A.F property at Yas Island. 3). In view of the above it is doubtful if the Shaikh 1 s claim to a payment of Rs.400/-p .m will be acceptable to the R.A.F. '7/? I w d •rment made about the tank at Sir Ban! Yas (Yas Island). Shaikh Shakhbut was then with Dr. * olm e S , bu t on his return, the Political Agent went into a private room with 'jjL kJ - aaiidl Snakhbut, Shaikh Khalifah and Shaikh ^ and ^ said that Shaikh Khalifah had asked him about the matter. ■I The Political Agent told the S h ai khs that he had wanted pt t0 br;Lng Shaikh Sa'id and Khan Bahadur 'Isa, but as they I vvere :Lll, he P ro Posed to leave the matter till after the f Id when they would come and settle the matter. Shaikh Shakhbut asked if there was any reason for the delay and added that he now preferred to have all matters settled direct between him and the Government instead of being made throu-h ShUkh Sa'id or any other P erson ' concluded by saying that the question about this matter came from his uncle and that he did not want to asiv about this matter as he would have considered it - to be rude to ask when the Political Agent was his guest • and that he would sacrifice his interests in Yas Island in honour of the Political Agent. )i A jL 7-1-1934. On Friday evening»the Political Agent sent twelve rounds of sugar to the guards at Yas Islamd, who had been sent there by the Shaikh and were living in a barasti. They had two iron water tanks and there was ^Iso water fror hollow wells fed by rain. The guards had only a small quantity of rice left and were afraid that they would finish their supplies and they had asked Abbas bin Abdullah Khuri to send them rice L from lalmah island.

Khan Bahadur 'Isa bin 'Abdul Latif, the Residency Agent, Sharjah, is of opinion that if the Shaikh of Abu Dhabi is addressed by you about the ggreement and facilities at Abu Dhabi, he will not agree although he thinks that the Shaikh will raise no objection about Yas Island. He thinks that the Shaikh it would be better if the matter is left for him and Shaikh Sa'id to settle. He thinks that the best thing would be for him and Shaikh Sa'id to take a lump sum of Rs.3,000/- plus the total monthly allowance of Rs.400/- from the date of the arrangements made by him and Shaikh Sa'id, when he is sure they will be able to make the Shaikh sign the agreement. a.r. 4-8-1935. yV) -r IVtrCl. ^ a . UvU Ow - - 4'^-- 1, i is' c i-v- ft* x-mf t~7 - Jjflnen Doctor Holmes and I lamaed this aorning iie Shaikh was waiting on the beach. He receivea Doctor mes a..a took nim to &amp; Majlis. After the usual courtesies, tne Shaikh came out and sat in front of his Uajlis. The Shaikh called me and insisted tnat I should sit by his side. Besides Ahmad bin Khalaf bin Waiabah, there was no one near. The Shaikh, who looked with some anxiety on his face, said that the ship has been here for the last few days and asked me whether there was any work. Ahmad bin »Utaibah tnen interrupted saying.-' ffhat about the matter which we have settled'. I told the Shaikh that when the P.A. last Tisited Abu Ddabi he told him that he was ready to talk over the matter with him , but as Khan Bahadur 'Isa was tnen ill the matter was left till after Ramadhan. That in order to settle this matter and also another amall matter with it all arrangements were made but that the Doctor did not allow Khan Bahadur »Isa to come as he was sicki tdat as far as I know even the money was on board. Ahmad bin 'Utaibah said that Shaikh Shakhbut feels shy to ask tne P.A. about this matter, which was settled, but that they have been counting the months. Shaikh Shakhbut then said that he would not go and ask P.A. about this matter but that all what he wants is that the GoTenment should be pleased with him. Many people came up and he onangeo tne subject of tne talk. The Shaikh then went to the Doctor and after he examined him he went to his house.12th February icm. lb The P.a, landed at 09«30 hours and was received by the Shaikh on the beach wno took him to his Majlis. After usual courtesies and coffee, the P.A. told the Shaikh that he wanted to nave a private talk with him. All the people present were askei. to go out except Shaikh Khalxfah and Ahmad bin 'Utaibah. The following is tne conversation which passea between them:- You askea Saijid 'Abdur Razzai yesterday about the air iacilities. As the matter was discussed by Khan Bahadur 'Isa i wanted to bring him with me in order to settle the question as there was a small matter of which they were aware when they made the arrangement, but I am sorry tnat his ill health did not allow him to come. I told the Government that you were ready to help and they were very pleased. As you know the aeroplanes are now using this route for going and coming and are therefore in need of a landing ground outside Abu Dhabi which they will only use at time of emergency. The Government will be grateful of your assistant in tiiis matter**,. 'I am always ready to help in ai^y manner which will please the Government. Du- your last visit I told you that I did not think of anything(money&gt; as I was sure tnat notning will be lost if it was with the Government'. Ahmad bin 'Utaibah interrupted saying;- ' Shaikh Shakhbut aid not get anything from the Government about the previous arrangement ana that this matter nas been the subject of various talks on the Coast. The people say that although he (Shaikh) accepted the arrangement they (Government) did not igive him anything'. 'In order to stop people talking I want to have the matter settled now. I am authorised by the Government to settle this matter and i am ready to give you a writteh undertaking that the people of the aeroplanes will not come to the town without your permission nor will tney interfere with the divers or with the divingf.-2- Shaikh: P.A. Shaikh: P.A. n This is all right, but I should like to think over this matter. I want one month's time after which I will write and inform you through the Residency Agent'. This is not a very important matter which requires such a long time to think over. You may talk over the matter with shaikh Khalifah and let me know what you think about it. When I return to Bahrain I will be very busy and will not have time to come after a month. I told the Government that you were ready to help, and if I now return and tell them that you have postponed the matter they may have some doubt'. 'The Government may give me time to think over this matter and I hope that everything will be according to the wish of the Government?# I think it would be better if you talk over this metter and let me know what you think about it. I am now going back to the ship and you can let me know of your reply, not now, but tomorrow or the day after'. When the P.A. left the Majlis with the Shaikh, Ahmad bin 'Utaibah said to me that ne wants to talKto me and asked how would that be possible if I were returning to the ship with the P.A. I told him that I could tell P.A. that I was remaining behind with the Doctor and he can then tell me whatever he wants. He agreed to this and I told P.A. of the suggestion made by Ahmad and so I remained on shore. As soon as P.A. left for the ship. Shaikh Shakhbut, his two brothers. Shaikh Khalifah and Ahmad bin Khalaf bin 'Utaibah all entered the Majlis and closed it. They had a private talk for one hour after which Ahmad bin 'Utaibah alone came out and called for me and took me in a corner where no one was near. He told me that before the arrival of P.A. they heard from Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum that the Government were going to ask h e r i'3« for the landing ground, that they asked him(Shaikh Sa »id) to ask Shaikh Shakhbut about this matter but he refused to do so before they would comply with the arrangement made by them and pay the allowance. He said that Shaikh Shakhbut was a funny sort of man with strange ideas and that it was very difficult for one to convince him. I told Ahmad bin ^taibah that in the previous matter he was very helpful and that P.A. hopes that he will also use his influence to assist in this matter, which, when settled, will be in the interest of the Shaikh* He said that he took lot of trouble in the previous case in order to bring the matter to a success, and swore that had it not been for him no arrangement could have been made. He said that as soon as the P.A# left for the ship they started discussing this matter with the Shaikh who was reluctant in giving his decision. I'hat whatever influence he may use it would be difficult for him to convince hiia(Shaikh) without the money. I said that i was certain that Shaikh Shakhbut will listen to his advice and assured him that as soon as the , matter is settled the money will be paid to the Shaikh at once and without any delay whatsoever. He then said that in the that case he was going to talk with Shaikh Shakhbut and that he was sure that he will convince him and make him agree to the landing ground. He expressed a hope that P.A. will help Shaikh Shakhbut in getting him money from the Government.-4- 13 th February ] 9:^R. f I (2^) Tiie P.A. landed at 4 p.m. in order to discuss the terms of the agreement about air facilities at Abu Lhabi. Before the draft was read the following discussions took place I have come now in connection with the draft of the agreement about which we had a talk in the morning You said in the morning that you considered me to be one of you and that you did not want to conceal anything from me. Having the same feelings towards you I want to explain and make everything clear about this matter. A ground does not mean an aerodrome with buidings(Mahattah) etc, like the one at Sharjah but an open ground for landing purposes at time of emergency. It will have marks on it which will be seen from the air. These marks, which can be seen during the day, will not be visible at night and therefore there will be a light to guide the aeroplanes when flying by night. This light will work by itself and needs no one to attend to it- just like the buoys at sea. The aeroplanes are also compelled to land sometimes for , supply of petrol to enable them to reach the next station. The need for the petrol is due to leakage or stormy winds or other unforeseen circumstances. For this reason the landing ground will also have a place for petrol. The ground at Abu Bhabi will therefore have markings and a light and a place for petrol and nothing else. Similar arrangements will be at Sirr Bani Yas Island.( in reply to an enquiry from Shaikh khalifah the P.A. said that the guards would be Shaikh Shakhbut's men and not from the Government) The second thing I want to explain is the question of money. You told me that you did not care for the question of money and that you would be proud to assist the Government- but as there is to be an agreement it is necessary that i should explain also the question of money. As no arrangement was made between you and the Government nothing was fixed for you in the past. But when 1 last visited this place I informed the Government that you were ' ' Ml U.* 111 - 1 1-5- Shaikhi P.A. Shaikh: ready to help ana asked them for money. After great deal orrespondence and after 1 had pressed them in the matter, they authorised me to give you a lump sum of money in return ■ for these facilities. On signing the agreement you will erefore get a lump sum of Bs.5000/- and a monthly payment of Hs.400/-. I have aone my best about the money and I know that Government are not prepared fo pay more. I now read the draft to you?, ( Draft was read over). ' For your sake L do not want to speak anything about the landing ground at Abu »habi which, as I said before, I am ready to give it to you without asking for anything. As regards Sirr Bani ias Island, an agreement was concluded between me and Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum and Khan Bahadur »Isa who were acting and had the full authority of the Government. In this agreement they undertook to pay me, from the date of the placing of the tank( I produced the paper and showed them that this was not the case), a monthly allowance of Rs.4-00/-, and 1 ask for payment accordingly'.'. ' They were sent here to make an arrangement about the tank because the tank had been broken and any settlement naturally had to be shown to Government before they accepted it. But they did not know about the other matter. The Government were only prepared to pay Rs.400/- for both and nothing more. The arrangement made by them about Yas Island could not be accepted by the Government as it did not include the landing ground at Abu i^habi? ' If they were not authorised to make the arrangement on behalf of the Government 1 am ready to withdraw the paper which I had signed. Besides this I have a letter from the P.A. Bahrain that the allowance will be counted from the date of placing the tank'. V 1 III I At this stage lot of discussions took place betweenP.A. 'JM Re landing ground at. Khan Bahaaur 'Isa, the Residency Agent, Sharjah, says that Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad of Kalba is under tiie influence of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Xhaimah and that he does not ao anything without consulting him. That when he was approachec last year, he primary agreed to allow a lancing ground but then refused as the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah advisee him not to allow one in his country. That as Shaikh Sa'id is under the influence of the Shaikh of Ras-al-Khaimah, to whom he pays allegiance, it is difficult to make any suggestion as to the best way of approach ing him. That although the Shaikh of Xalba may not be willing to allow a landing ground, it may be possible to convince him about the landing ground by giving him nice and sweet words, which he thinks that it cannot be done in a short visit. on the 2nd March 1935. ShaiKh Sa f id hin Hamad used to pay zikah to Sharjah,but now pays to no one. He regards himself as more or less under (and under the Influence of) Has al Khaimah. K.A. f s only suggestion was that 1 should go to Kalba v/ith a warship . I asked him if he could do nothing,that I realised that he had been ill for a long time, but that things were not what they had been on the Truci al Coast and that we expected results. He said that he would write a letter and send someoBQ with it. I aslced what result he expected , to which he replied that God knew but perhaps he could get somethi g. He pointed out that much money would be demanded. I wanned him a ainst committing Govt, to payments 11 he and ShaiKh Sa^d bin Ma^tum had done at Abu Dhabi. Submi t ted,please. 1.

Lieutenant Tutton was present. 2. I handed over the letter for the Shaikh and also the ^ Memoranduin of the suggested line of action for Flight-Lieut enant Coates. I emphasised that they should try to avoid discussion and particularly not to use the word TT tank T! , as everybody knew it and it might lead to discussions. It S.N O :136.k then transpired that they d.ld not want to put a tank tS^ but to build a house for a petrol store. I said that this '' thing as I had arranged for a tank. After some 'iseussion agreed that it should be possible ( not at th Vls lt) to make a small store house and not a tank if they found water close under the surface and that it would be explained to the Shaikh that we had to keep the petrol in thus way as the sub-soil water would spoil the tank. 3. In the course of conversation they said that they wanted to make a flying boat anchorage. I said that this .was an entirely new thing and that they should studiously avoid any mention of such a facility. I said that it Placed me in a most difficult position and also placed a , sreat strain on the Shaikh when certain facilities were asked for and immediately afterwards something more than that agreed upon was wanted. I said that interested people would say to the Shaikh ' we told you that if you gave something to the British they would take something more', and in the extreme case may eaen lead to the assassination of the Shaikh. I said that If an anchorage was really essential, after the entire landing ground facilities had been established we might then, after about six months or an year had elapsed, think of approaching the Shaikh for this other facility once he had got used to the facilities established under the existing agreement. They said that he had already got used to flying boat anchorages with a landing ground from Yas. I replied that so far from ins becoming used to them, we had been bickering with him for four years because such a thing had been done and that it would be most unwise to risk further trouble by doing anything hasty. 1 specifically said that nothing should be done now en in this respect. ■ Dictated on 20-3-1935i -</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/264</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/264</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>‘File 7/2 II Landing grounds and seaplane anchorages’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1934/1935</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-07-04T00:24:42</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (264 folios)</extent><extent>The contents of the volume are arranged in approximate chronological order, from the earliest items at the front of the volume to the latest at the end.

The principal correspondents in the file are Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Percy Gordon Loch, Political Agent at Bahrain, and Khan Bahadur ‘Īsá bin ‘Abd al-Latif, the British Government’s Native Agent at Sharjah. The majority of the volume’s correspondence relates to specific air facilities in the Gulf, notably in the dominions of Shaikh Shakbut bin Sulton of Abu Dhabi:1. Damage to the unguarded petrol store at Yas Island [Şīr Banī Yās], and the contamination of its contents, was reported to Loch in June 1934 (folio 12). The damage enforced further negotiations with Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan over arrangements for guards to be installed at the store. Loch arranged for negotiations to take place, with Shaikh Sa'id bin Maktum of Dubai acting as a mediator between the two parties (folios 51-52).2. The establishment and marking out of an air strip at Şīr Banī Yās. Negotiations over the guarding of the petrol tank at Şīr Banī Yās went hand-in-hand with negotiations for an emergency landing strip at the same location. Negotiations with Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan were successfully concluded on 13 February 1935. The original agreement is included in the volume (folio 226), with a copy of the English text (folio 162, 163).3. The erection of beacons at air facilities across the Gulf for night-time flying. While arrangements were made for landing strips at Şīr Banī Yās and at Abu Dhabi, British Government officials in London and the Iraq RAF Command pressed for the installation of beacons at air facilities in the Gulf to enable night time flight along the India air route (folio 121). British officials in London and the Gulf were at odds with each other over the speed with which beacons could be installed (folios 201, 204-05), given the slow and precarious nature of negotiations with the Arab shaikhs. In a letter to Fowle, dated 13 December 1934, Loch expressed reservations about raising the issue of beacons with Shaikh Shakbut bin Sultan, given the difficulties in resolving existing issues with the landing strips and petrol store (folios 138-40).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><geographic>Şīr Banī Yās Island</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003e7#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
