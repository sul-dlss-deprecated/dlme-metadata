Fuad Bey has given me following message (2) Ihn Saud is receiving telegrams from all parts of the Aral) world, urging him to do something about Alexandretta and he would he grateful for the advice of His Majesty’s Government. He does not wish to disturb his good relations with the Turks but what is he to do? What about an appeal from him to the Turks? (3) Speaking personally I commented to this effect. So far as I knew. His Majesty’s Government considered Alexandretta should remain within the Syrian group and were using their endeavours to that end. It was hoped that Franco-Turkish negotiations would end satisfactorily in a few days. What was there to tell the Arab world except to await the result? It was for the King to decide whether to approach Turks or not, but would not such a move tend to make them more difficult? They would ask what standing Saudi-Arabia had in the matter. It would be exceedingly dangerous to use the 'Arab world' in the sense of a political unity, called upon to take action in every matter affecting Arabs everywhere, and a great mistake to suppose that action deemed appropriate during the recent troubles in Palestine was applicable in all cases and would always be as well received. (4) Fuad admitted his own views did not differ much from mine but he has to produce a reply for the King.■KiMMMMHH mmmm Notes. Minute Paper. Register No. P.2. 3% G) 4 SECRET.

CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [E 3277/1494/25] No. 1. Sir G. Clerk to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 1.) (No. 207.) Sir, Constantinople, June 21, 1932. I HAVE the honour to report that on the 8th June His Highness the Emir Feisal, son of the King of Hejaz-Nejd, arrived in Constantinople by Soviet steamer from Odessa. He was accompanied to Turkey by M. Florinski, Soviet Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, and both on his arrival and during his stay in Turkey has been the object of assiduous attentions on the part of members of the Soviet Embassy. 2. After a short stay in Constantinople, the Emir, with his suite, among whom were Fuad Hamza Bey, deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Halid Eyubi Bey, aide-de-camp, left for Angora in a special saloon coach placed at their disposal by the Turkish Government, and was the guest of the Government from the 12th to the 15th June, afterwards returning to Constantinople, where he is to spend a few days before leaving for Tehran via the Caucasus, and thence for Bagdad. 3. While at Angora the Emir was received by the President of the Republic, who gave a dinner in his honour at his new residence at Cankaya, and was the guest at banquets or receptions given by Ismet Pasha, Tevfik Riistii Bey, Kazim Pasha, President of the Grand National Assembly, and Hikmet Bey, secretary- general of the Gazi. In deference to the opinions of the Emir, no alcoholic refreshments were served at these gatherings. In his turn* the Emir gave a dinner to the President of the Republic and leading Turks. Before leaving Angora the Emir had an amicable conversation at the Iraq Legation with His f Highness the Emir Zeid, Minister of Iraq and brother to the King of that country. 4. In the course of the dinner given at Cankaya by the President of the Republic, speeches were exchanged which, while on conventional lines, were marked with slightly more restraint on the Wahabi than on the Turkish side. The Gazi expressed his pleasure at the efforts which were being made to set the Hejaz and Nejd on the way of progress, and his best wishes for the future of those countries under the strong administration of King Abdulaziz, while the Emir confined himself to acknowledging with thanks the Gazi's wishes and reciprocating them. The official communique issued on the conclusion of the visit referred to cordial and sincere conversations, harmony of views, feelings of mutual confidence, and the influence of that visit on the consolidation of peace in the Near East. 5. The time between banquets was devoted to inspections of banking and military establishments. In this latter connexion it is noticeable that the visit of the Emir to Turkey is distinguished from that of other important personages by the exhibition to him of part of Turkey’s military resources, and by the rather unusual participation, in his reception and in his send-off. of high military authorities. The Emir was shown over military factories and barracks, under the guidance of AH Sait Pasha, Army Inspector; he assisted at tactical exercises, was present at a display of military horsemanship, and witnessed an aerial review in which some twenty-five military aeroplanes from Eski^ehir took part. One of these flew into an obstacle when starting and the pilot was killed. The others indulged in formation flying, which to a lay observer seemed rather ragged, but the diving and other acrobatic feats seemed temerarious but successful. 6. Press comment on the visit is curiously unanimous in insisting that Turkey’s interest in Hejaz and Nejd arises out of pleasure at their having won complete independence, and in declaring that it is, and always has been, Turkey’s desire that Moslem States detached from the Ottoman Empire should have complete independence. For this reason she has always disliked the term “mandate,” which signifies subjection. She had only consented to cede the [516 a—1]2 Vilayet of Mosul because the cession was to be made to an independent Iraq. The line to be followed in regard to Syria by France, which is at present enjoying a “ bad press ' in Turkey, is thus clearly indicated. Yunus Nadi, writing as usual with his tongue in his cheek, after proclaiming Turkey's yearning for the independence of her former possessions, praises the austere organiser of the Hejaz and Nejd who has obtained independence for his subjects, has endowed them with a strong Government, dealing out severe justice and ruling with iron discipline, and he concludes with an outburst of joy at the progress made by the Arab peoples, Turkey's co-religionists. 7.

Between TurJcey, Nejd # Hejaz, and Yemen. We announced yesterday the arrival of Sherif Mahmoud Sharaf Adnan Pasha, Counsellor of H.M. the King of Nejd and the Hejaz, coming from Constantinople and on his way to Mecca. One of our reporters met him and asKed him as to the reasons for his journey to Turkey and as to the present political conditions in the Oheziret-el-Arab. He asked also that he should be authorised to publish the interview but the Sherif refused, not wishing to see his political comments published in the daily newspapers. Nevertheless, with apologies for disregarding his wishes, we publish hereunder the interview which is interesting. The reporter says the following:- 'The first thing I thought of asking him was the 'reason for his journey to Turkey, now that the Seoudist 'policy is beginning to oppose itself to the British 'policy and that Turkey and Russia are trying to exchange 'treaties with H.M. Ibn Seoud and H.M. the Bnam Yehya. 'So I asked him that question. He replied 'I did not go ''to Constantinople on a political mission but for the '' sake of the property and business which I have there.' 'His meeting Turkish statesmen. ' - Did you not meet any of the Turkish statesmen? n Yea/' - Yes I did, for certain reasons and it was for the 'same reasons that I had to go to Angora where I met ”Ismet Pasha the Prime Minister and Dr. Tewfik Rushdy 'Bey the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Suleiman 'Shewket Bey the ex-Turkish representative in Hejaz but 'as I was not in charge of a political mission, our 'conversations were not about politics. 'Between Nejd and Turkey. ' - But the Turkish press said that you talked with the 'Foreign Minister of Turkey about the negociations which 'are taking place between the Turkish Representative in 'Hejaz and Bejd and the Nejdian government with a view 'of concluding a treaty? ' - We had a conversation on this subject but a personal 'and not an official one and that is a matter on which I 'can say nothing before I lay it before H.M. the King. ' - Do you approve of friendly relations with Turkey? ' - Yes if such is the wish of H.M. the King. 'Friendly relations and great Britain^ attitude. ' - What will be Great Britain's attitude towards such 'relations? ' - British policy has always been known to be easy and 'tolerant and not to force things, save in exceptional 'circumstances. Great Britain has demonstrated her 'sympathy towards the Arabs and the Arab question during 'the war and after it and British statesmen never missed 'an opportunity to declare that the Arabs will obtain 'their independence and freedom; all these declarations 'were merely political disguise because Great Britain in 'reality/'reality did not keep a single promise of the several 'ones she gave to the Arabs, We did what we could to 'strengthen our friendly relations with Great Britain 'and now if we sign a treaty either political or 'economical with 1‘urkey, this would not be an attack on 'Great Britain but a matter of doing something which we 'find necessary to us and our government is ready to 'conclude any treaty with any power without having to 'obtain the assent of Great Britain, if our government 'thinks that that treaty is essential to them, 'The Hejaz ambassador in Turkey. ' - Bo you think a representative of Nejd and the Hejaz 'may be appointed in Turkey? ' - This is a thing already definitely decided and 'directly H.M, is back in Mecca, he will sign a decree 'appointing his representative. ' - Can you tell me who is going to be that representative ' - I do not know, 'The Whabi attacks on Kweit, ' - Ho doubt you read the recent telegrams relating ?the attacks of the Wahabis on the kweit and the Iraq 'frontiers and their murder of Mr, Bilkert the American 'who was with Mr. Crane? ' - Yes I read this and I say that this is one of the 'things which are being done by way of propaganda against 'us and against Iraq, The Akhwans never made such an 'attack and you may be sure that it is not their habit to 'do such things. This attack was made by people very well 'known to those who tried to attribute it to the Wahabis.■■■■■■ w The expulsion of ffeiaal Dawish. ' - What about the concentration of the Wahabis on the 'Iraq, frontier? ' - This is not true and if there are any Wahabis there 'they must be the men of Feisal Dawish who has been turned 'out of the country and for whose punishment orders have 'been issued. 'Between the Imam Yehya and Ibn Seoud . ' - What do you think of the relations existing between 'the Imam Yehya Hamid-Ud-Din and Ibn Seoud? ' — They are very good and it is certain that a Yemen 'delegation will come in the spring to Mecca in order to v 'open official negotiations with a view of concluding a 'treaty between the two Arab monarchs. I am certain that 'H.M. Ibn Seoud*s keenest desire is to maintain friendly 'relations with H.M. the Imam and put an end to misunder standings which could not last except for foreign 'intrigues. The ImamS desire cannot be different. ' - But British sources said a month ago that Ibn Seoud 'had demanded to enforce his sovereignty over the Idriss 'people and the return to them of their territory now 'within the Yemen boundaries. Everybody knows that the 'execution of this would prevent the return of the coastal 'region as far as Hodeida, to the Idrissi. ' - No, article 4 of that agreement said that Assir was 'now territory under Ibn Seoud*s influence, but the King 'never asked for what you say nor would he do so in the 'future.' This /® 'Vi r\ This is the conversation we had and we know that despite his denial, the Sherif went to Turkey on a political mission, delegated by Ibn Seoud,to fix up the terms of the treaty to be signed between Turkey and Ibn Seoud. Shortly, within the few days following the return of the King to Mecca this information will be confirmed.(S 5l8g/S99/91) Oopy ^ Gq.MA British ^mbac#y.

To aocomplish this, it has, at the risk of alienating many Moslems within Turkey and without, gone in for an internal policy of drastic secularist tion. That does not, however, mean that Angora intends to lose all touch with Arab countries, when, if ever, the ^reat taek of internal consolidation shall have been achieved, Turkey may ma e more active use of the sympathy of her Arab co religionists, For the moment she is content merely to remain in touoh and not unnaturally sends a permanent representative to the centre of Islam - or as near to kleoda as a 'modern” Turk finds it expedient to go.

Sir, In continuation of my despatch No. 115-of September 30th last I have the honour to report that Suleiman Shevket Bey has now officially presented his credentials to Ibn Saud, and been recognised as Diplomatic Representative of the Turkish Republic in the Kejaz. his office is styled a Legation, and he has taken precedence over the other foreign representatives in Jeddah. 2. On his first ceremonial visit to His Majesty he made the following speech: ’’I have the honour to announce to Your Majesty that the Turkish Republic has chosen me as diplomatic representative accredited to Your Majesty. I have been very pleased with the welcome which has been extended to me. My duties will be facilitated oy your kindness and courtesy. Indeed my reception has not fallen short of that promised in the declaration to the i-ead Oj. the Turkish Republic which Your Majesty transmitted through Edib Bey Servet, member of the National Assembly and Turkish representative at the Moslem Conference held at Mecca four months ago. I find it difficult adequately to express my thanks for your kindness. I seize this opportunity to declare to Your Majesty that the sole object of my mission is to strengthen the bonds of affection and friendship between our two governments. I rejoice to say that Turkey is on excellent terms with all the governments with which she has relations. Our relations with Your Majesty’s Government will be based specially on brotherhood and friendship. There is no need for me to recall the old connection; His Britannic Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, which/ Foreign Office, London, S.W.which, founded on brotherhood and cooperation, long existed between the Arabs and the Turks, We Turks do not forget our old relationship, and believe that it will be in our mutual interest to revive those noble memories in a new form. such will be my task. Meanwhile, I crave Your Majesty’s assistance to perform it in accordance with Your Majesty’s wishes. It will be an honour and a pleasure to me, my Lord, to serve both countries.” 3. When he recalled the noble memories of pre-war Arab and Turkish cooperation, Shevket Bey must have been carried away by the exaltation of the moment. In private he does nothing but groan at Arab ’’barbarity” and the evil fate which sent him to the Hejaz. His original instructions were to establish himself at Mecca, but the authorities are said to have opposed the attempt, lest other foreign representatives should likewise make an appearance in the Holy City. Shevket Bey himself declares that while Jeddah is just bearable, Mecca would be impossible, and so both parties are satisfied. 4.

It was rumoured, though I discredit the report, that Turkish official recognition was brought to Ibn Saud by the new Turkish representative, who arrived in Jeddah by the boat on which the Emir Saud was also a passenger. This is Suleiman Shevket Bey, whose mission in the Hejaz may prove as interesting as that of our Russian colleague if in some ways dissimilar. Shevket Bey has not yet started to pay his official calls. In spite of that, a spontaneous acquaintance has rapidly developed between him and the Soviet consul-general, the spontaneity being apparently of Russian origin. 10. Can there be any 'sympathy of purpose or attitude between the Russian and the Turkish representative in the Hejaz? In a recent Bagdad Intelligence Report an Iraqi politician is reported to have written, after talking with 'leading Islamic politicians' in Egypt, that he 'found everywhere a growing desire for a united Islamic front. Turkey was the source of the new inspiration, and Ibn Saud and the Imam Yahya of the Yemen were sympathetic.' Russia would naturally be interested in such an excellent weapon of anti-European propaganda as a united Islamic front, and perhaps Shevket Bey has been instructed to be interested in the same ideal. He is a middle-aged man, who wears a dinner-jacket, is far too enlightened to have much in commoncommon with your Wahabi mediae valisms, and has been making enquiries as to the best method of securing a regular supply of v/hisky from over the water. 11. His second-in-command is a less formal and more interesting figure than his chief. He is IMimud Nadim Bey, Vali of the Yemen in Turkish days, a small, rotund and jolly man, who also openly professes devotion to the best-known produce of Scotland. He will be remembered as the official who was deputed by the Imam Yahya (Colonel Jacob’s book is my informant) to go to Bazil when Colonel H.F.Jacob was detained there, along with his mission to the Imam, in 1919; indeed, he boasts that he was instrumental in obtaining Colonel Jacob’s release. He speaks Arabic well and is obviously well versed in Arabian affairs. Nadim Bey has already been here for some considerable time awaiting the arrival of Shevket Bey, who on his way has spent some months in Egypt. 12. Before the latter’s advent, the predbige of the Soviet mission was on the wane, a tendency exemplified by its reduction from a diplomatic agency to a consulate-general. M.Khakimoff may possibly find his influence buttressed by the new Turkish arrivals; but it remains to be seen whether the two work in amicable conjunction.— /7gl f L ( ^ ® t&gt;uT AWAY WITH P.1784.

I have the honour to inform you that according to an announcement in to-day’s paper the Turkish Government has appointed a certain Suleiman Shevket Bey to 'be Political Representative at Mecca. Suleiman Shevket aey who is unknown to me la stated to be proceeding shortly to his post via Alexandria. 2. The Turkish Government is also sending a delegate to the forthcoming Islamic Congress at Mecca in the person of Edib Bey, a retired Colonel who is now a deputy for Constanti nople. Edit Bey is something of a man of the world, speaks good French, plays bridge and is associated with Europeans in mining and other business. He is dso a personal friend of the Ghazi, and that he should be chosen to go against his personal inclination - he is not thin enough or religious enough to relish a summer at Mecca - is another indication that the Turkish Government is far from losing interest in the Hejaz. 3. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s High ..Commissioner in Egypt and to the Acting British Agent and Consul at Jeddah. I have etc. (Sgd) R.C,Lindsay. The Right Hon.
