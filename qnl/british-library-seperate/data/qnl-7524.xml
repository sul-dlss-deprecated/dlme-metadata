It contains correspondence authorising expenditure, outlining the procedure to be followed for making payments, and reporting on the progress of construction. It also contains statements of expenditure submitted periodically by the Persian Gulf Political Resident to the Secretary of State for India, for subsequent submission to the Air Ministry. These statements generally outline the following: allowances made against the construction of the rest house, the personal subsidy paid to the Shaikh of Sharjah, rent paid to the Shaikh of Sharjah for the aerodrome, pay for guards at the aerodrome, and an allowance paid for additional accounting work undertaken at the Persian Gulf Residency.The file also contains two reports, dated between 1932-33, related to early difficulties encountered by Captain Kenneth Mackay, Supervising Engineer, in the construction of the rest house: see folios 97-112 and 131-143. Particular attention is given to the attitude of the Residency Agent for the Trucial Coast, Khan Bahadur Isa, and the attitude of local rulers.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Financial statements</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Native Agent, Trucial Coast, Sharjah</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Sharjah, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Building construction</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f7#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x0001f7#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
