Will you please refer to your demi-official letter No. 432-S dated the 20th June 1940 ? 2* It is a fact that the Roman Catholic Priest was an ollicer in the Italian Army and Air E’orce in the last war and I understand he claims to have had Mussolini ds an N.C.O. under him I Nevertheless I am quite sure that he is all right, and he is faith fully carrying out the small restrictions I have placed on his movements. The one thing that seems to worry him is that he cannot hear from his old mother who, incidentally, wrote to him some little time ©go and told him not to go home lest he should be called up as a military chaplain.GOVERNMENT OF INDIA Department.

His behaviour was considered satisfactory and it was not thought that stricter action was necessary. 2. As a result of recent events strong resentment exists both among the European residents and the Arab population at his being allowed to remain in Bahrain and it is probable that if further air attacks are made on Bahrain this resentment will reach a pitch when his safety can no longer be guaranteed. 3. So far nothing definite is known against him and as far as I am aware he does not indiklge in any form of propaganda but Italian broadcasts have shown that information concerning Bahrain reaches Italy with surprisingly little delay. For instance recently one Ahmad bin »Isa al uhatm, a remote relative of the Al Khalifah Family, who had been dissatisfied with his allowance for /- S. 44. {Designat io n ) MFP— 985 S&amp;P-&lt;M-1597)—27 11-36—10,000.— p — for some time, addressed a letter to the Shah of Iran inviting nim to take over Bahrain# He attempted to smug .le this letter out of Bahrain but it was recovered and Ahmad bin 1 Isa was imprisoned as a result of proceedings in the Bahrain Courts# I am informed that news of this case was broadcast irom Bari some three days after the sentence had been passed. There is a further point, in the recent air raid most of the bombs were dropped midway between the two Hares on the Fast side of the Refinery# These flares are occasionally moved for operational purposes and had the attack taken place tnree days previously bombs aimed between the flares would have fallen on the Refinery# 4# i therefore consider it essential that Father Luigi Magliacani snould leave Bahrain both as a precautionary defence measure and also for his own personal safety# I do not know whether Italian Roman Catholic priests have been interned in India but if they have not I suggest that Father Luigi Magliacani be returned to India and in his place an English priest sent to carry on his work in Bahrain, There are some four or five hundred Roman Catholics in Bahrain, chiefly Indians and uoanese and a school has been started for the education of their children which it seems a pity to close. o.

Dear Alban, With reference to your lotfCer 'Secret' dated 8th June 1941, I have been unable to obtain any information about a Wireless Trans mitting apparatus. Father Luigi owned an ordinary wireless set which I understand was in bad repair. When he departed he left it with Braganza and asked him to sell it for him. Braganza is the leading Goanese Catholic and deals with the com munity's accounts etc. The wireless set was not functioning and Miss O’Sullivan, of the Bapco hospital agreed to get one of their experts to look it over and mend it. She took it aw'ay and for sometime it was at Awali. Lately it was returned to Braganza but is still out of order so he has not been able to sell it.\ — * * * w / V',4 S No* 2-»y/44 CJ f iilR From To The Under Secretary tc the Government of India in the External Affairs Department, GOFFIDENTIaL.

Dear Sir, May I ask you the favour of obtaining a permit from the Political Agent, Bahrain for Reverend Pather Luigi Magliacani to enter Bahrain and take up his post as Parish Priest of the Catholic Community there. Reverend Father Luigi Magliacani was posted in Bahrain in June 1939. Being an Italian he was interned during the war and was sent to Dhera Dun Camp in India. On being released after the war he was permitted to return to Aden in 1946; but as his Provincial Superior had granted him leave to go to Italy for a few months rest, Father Luigi went to Italy via the U.K. in September 1946. I expect him back in Aden this October and as I have very few priests I am obliged to send Father Luigi back to Bahrain.

The file’s principal correspondents are: the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Geoffrey Prior; Lieutenant-Colonel Arnold Crawshaw Galloway); and the Political Agent at Bahrain (Hugh Weightman; Major Reginald George Evelin William Alban; Major Tom Hickinbotham; Cornelius James Pelly).The file includes:correspondence dated 1940, including: the Political Agent in Bahrain’s assent, in June 1940, to Magliacani remaining in Bahrain (f 3); arrangements to deport Magliacani during October and November 1940, in response to the Italian bombing raid on Bahrain on 19 October 1940. The deportation order (f 11, f 14) was made because the Political Agent in Bahrain could not guarantee Magliacani’s personal safety, rather than Magliacani himself representing a threat to Bahrain (ff 3-23);correspondence dated 1944, relating to an application from the Archbishop of Agra, India, for Magliacani to return to Bahrain, in the wake of Italy’s surrender, and Magliacani having been released from the Central Internment Camp in India (f 24). This portion of the file includes copies of correspondence in Italian (ff 35-40, with English translations at ff 43-48), dated between 11 May 1931 and 22 April 1939, addressed to Magliacani, from various correspondents, including Camillo Guiriati, Italian Consular General in Calcutta [Kolkata], Leo Pollini, Director of the Istituto Fascista di Cultura in Milan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rome. The correspondence was, according to a note in the file (f 34) found in Magliacani’s boxes during a search conducted on 25 July [1944]. Letters from the Security Office at Bahrain and the Bahrain Government state they have no objection to Magliacani’s return (f 29, f 31). A letter from the Political Resident to the Political Agent at Bahrain, dated 27 July 1944, states that it is too early for Axis subjects to return to the Arab sheikhdoms, and that permission for Magliacani’s return must be refused (f 41);correspondence from 1947 and 1948 relating to a further application for Magliacani’s return to Bahrain, with no objections offered by the Bahrain Government (ff 49-60).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Irzio Luigi Magliacani</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Bahrain</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Deportation</topic></subject><subject><topic>Catholicism</topic></subject><subject><topic>Missionary societies</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000055#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
